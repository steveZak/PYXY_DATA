        "wiki": "The Minnesota Zoo (formerly the Minnesota Zoological Garden), is an AZA-accredited zoo in Apple Valley, Minnesota. When it opened on May 22, 1978 it was fairly revolutionary in its exhibit design. The zoo, built in a suburbanizing rural area, had more space to house exhibits and was one of the first zoos to organize its animals by their living environment as opposed to their species. Exhibits are arrayed in six themed areas, including three themed walking trails ranging from one to two miles in length:\n\nMedtronic Minnesota Trail, featuring animals native to Minnesota\nNorthern Trail, featuring animals of the north (above the 45th parallel north)\nTropics Trail, an indoor walking trail featuring animals from the tropics\nDiscovery Bay, an activity area themed around marine wildlife\nRussia's Grizzly Coast, a part-indoor, part-outdoor new multi-million exhibit featuring animals from Russia's Far East and the Kamchatka Peninsula.\nWells Fargo Family Farm, themed around farm animalsThe Minnesota Zoo is a state agency. This differs from other zoos in Minnesota and most others in the United States, which are run by municipalities or private organizations. The Minnesota Zoo charges admission and sells annual memberships.\nIt is also home to a high school, the School of Environmental Studies.\n\n\n== Exhibits and attractions ==\n\n\n=== The Medtronic Minnesota Trail ===\n\nThe Medtronic Minnesota Trail features animals native to Minnesota. The trail, which had been nearly the same since it opened in 1978, was reopened in 2007 after a year-long renovation. The trail now features a \"north woods\" look and includes exhibits for raccoons, coyotes, and gray wolves together with long-time residents like beaver, otter, puma, and lynx. Smaller Minnesota animals, like turtles, frogs and salamanders are featured in the exhibit's \u201ctrailhead,\u201d which is styled after a lodge. The quarter-mile trail takes guests through more than fifteen wildlife exhibits where they experience a variety of Minnesota landscapes, ranging from views into a beaver pond, a walk alongside a northern forest glade and a bird-watching perch in the treetops. The Minnesota Zoo received the Association of Zoos and Aquarium's (AZA) 2008 Significant Achievement Award for this trail. Animals in this area include:\nWolverine (Gulo gulo)\nBeaver (Castor canadensis)\nCougar (Puma concolor)\nCanadian lynx (lynx canadensis)\nRiver otter (Lontra canadensis)\nPorcupine (Erethizon dorsatum)\nBald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)\nPileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus)\nCoyote (Canis latrans)\nGray wolf (Canis lupus)\nFisher (Martes pennanti)\nBlack bear (Ursus americanus)\nMinnesota reptiles and amphibians\n\n\n=== The Northern Trail ===\n\nThe 3/4 mile Northern Trail lets visitors to animals found north of the 45th parallel. The Northern trail could also be seen from the zoo's monorail which was run year round, but permanently closed on Sept 2, 2013 as the trains were outdated and hard to find new parts for. Currently, the zoo is planning to convert the monorail track into an elevated Treetop Trail. Animals in this area include:\nAmur tiger (Panthera tigris altaica)\nDhole (Cuon alpinus)\nWoodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus)\nPrzewalski's horse (Equus ferus przewalskii or Equus caballus przewalskii)\nBactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus)\nTakin (Budorcas taxicolor)\nBison (B. bison)\nMusk ox (Ovibos moschatus)\nMoose (Alces alces)\nBlack-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys luvodicianus)\nCanada goose (Branta canadensis)\nGoitered gazelle (Gazzella antilopenia)\nPronghorn (Antilocapra americana)\nTrumpeter swan (Cygnus buccinator)Part of the Northern Trail is planned to be replaced by a future exhibit called Asian Highlands. The exhibit will be divided into two: Edge of the Himalayas and Mongolian Steppe. Edge Of the Himalayas will feature snow leopards, musk deer, tragopans, markhors, and red pandas. Food carts, sheltered seating areas and restrooms will be strewn throughout the area.\nThe Mongolian Steppe will be seen on the exhibit's north side. Pallas cats will be featured in a side exhibit while herds of Asian wild horses, camels, onagers and gazelles roam on a field behind the cats. A camel ride will take visitors along part of the exhibit.\n\n\n=== The Tropics Trail ===\n\nThe Tropics Trail is an indoor trail that gives the impression of being in a tropical rainforest. Animals in this area include:\nWhite-cheeked gibbon (Nomascus concolor)\nTree kangaroo (Dendrolagus ursinus)\nRing-tailed lemur (Lemur catta)\nBinturong (Arctictis binturong)\nKomodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis)\nRed panda (Ailurus fulgens)\nGolden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia)\nGreater Indian hornbill (Buceros bicornis)\nTamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla)\nVisayan warty pig (Sus cebifrons)\nLesser flamingo (Phoenicopterus minor)\nBurmese python (Python molurus bivittatus)\nAsian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea)\nLinnaeus's two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus)\nDwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis)\nRed river hog (Potamochoerus porcus)\nRock hyrax (Procavia capensis)\nDeBrazza's monkey (Cercopithecus neglectus)\nMalayan tapir (Tapirus indicus)\n\n\n=== Discovery Bay ===\nDiscovery Bay contains several aquariums with a combined 1,100,000 US gallons (4,200,000 l) of water. Guests have an opportunity to touch sharks, rays, sea stars and sea anemones in the interactive estuary and tide pool. At the entrance to the Tropics building, you can see the Wyland mural titled \u201cOur Ocean Family,\u201d dedicated on September 8, 1997. Animals in this area include:\nHawaiian monk seal (Neomonachus schauinslandi)\nHorn shark (Heterodontus francisci)\nSwellshark (Cephaloscyllium ventriosum)\nLeopard shark (Triakis semifasciata)\nBat ray (Myliobatis californica)\nWeedy sea dragon (Phyllopteryx taeniolatus)\nSand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus)\nSouthern stingray (Dasyatis americana)\nCobia (Rachycentron canadum)\n\n\n==== Dolphins (1978-2012) ====\nDolphins were exhibited at the zoo since its opening in 1978 until 2012. Hawaiian monk seals now reside in the dolphin tank. Director Lee Ehmke mentioned that in the future, perhaps a slim chance will come along that will allow the return of dolphins to the Minnesota Zoo.In 1992, Rio gave birth to the zoo's first successful captive-born dolphin, a male named \"Shadow\" sired by Semo.\nIn March 2006, Rio died at 35. She came to the Minnesota Zoo from the New York Aquarium in 1980. Rio gave birth to four calves at the Minnesota Zoo. One of Rio's calves, 7 month old Harley, died earlier in January 2006 in a freak accident. He had been learning to swim between the pools when he jumped out of the water and hit his head on the deck between the pools. Another dolphin, \"Ayla\", who suffered from Scoliosis or curvature of the spine, was euthanized at age 14 in December 2006. She had stopped eating and stopped responding to her medication. At that time the remaining dolphins at the zoo were \"Spree,\" \"Chinook\" and \"Semo.\"\nIn 2007, the zoo shipped Chinook, a 24-year-old male, to the National Aquarium in Baltimore. Chinook was moved because the aquarium had seven adult females and no adult males. Chinook fathered a calf and then moved to the Brookfield Zoo in 2010.Two females; Allie, and her mother, April were additions to the Minnesota Zoo's bottlenose dolphin family in 2008. Both arrived on January 14, 2008 from Dolphin Connection in Florida.\nIn September 2009, three bottlenose dolphins from the Brookfield Zoo arrived at the Discovery Bay habitat while their home stadium, the Seven Seas Dolphinarium, was being renovated. The three dolphins, Tapeko, and her daughters Noelani and Allison, remained in Minnesota for roughly six months until the tank in Brookfield was completed in the spring of 2010. This eventually brought the Minnesota Zoo's dolphin population up to 7. On April 15, 2010, Tapeko, Noelani, and Allison, made the return trip back to the Brookfield Zoo. Spree too was sent to Brookfield after it was decided she would have a better chance at acclimating herself to their social structure as she was generally outcast by Semo, April and Allie.\nSemo had impregnated Allie in mid 2008. However, Allie suffered a stillbirth on March 26, 2009, much to the disappointment of zoo staff. In November 2009, it was confirmed by ultrasound that Allie was pregnant yet again, by Semo this time as well. The female calf was born on July 17, 2010, and through a Facebook vote was named Tajiah in late 2010.\nBy January 2011, the pod consisted of 47-year-old Semo, 42-year-old April, her 23-year-old daughter Allie, and Allie's 6-month-old calf Taijah.\nDolphin shows at the zoo were put on hiatus in 2011. With Semo in his mid 40s, the zoo felt it was best for them to avoid the more high-energetic behaviors usually performed by the younger members of the group.On February 15, 2011, April died and a necropsy was pending to determine cause of death. April was around 42 years old, making her one of the older bottlenose dolphins known in human care.\nOn February 6, 2012, Semo and Allie's 1 1/2 year old calf Tajiah died suddenly of complications from a stomach ulcer.In all, a total of 19 dolphins have been housed at the zoo over the years:  Semo, Flipper, April, Rio, Vince, Mindy, Chinook, Allie, Shadow, DJ, Ayla, Mindy's 1997 stillborn, Spree, Harley, Tapeko, Noelani, Allison, Allie's 2009 stillborn, and Taijah.  As of 2013, Semo, Tapeko, Chinook, Allie, Shadow, Spree, Noelani, and Allison were still alive. Flipper, April, and Rio all surpassed the average expected lifespan of a bottlenose dolphin at approximately 38 years, 42 years, and 35 years respectively.\n\n\n==== End of the dolphin exhibit ====\nOn May 14, 2012, the zoo announced that the dolphin exhibit would come to a permanent end come fall. The Minnesota Legislature had recently granted the zoo $4 million towards the renovation of the Discovery Bay dolphin tanks, which were in need of repairs. The zoo had originally intended to temporarily transport its two remaining bottlenose dolphins, Semo and Allie, to other zoos or parks until renovations were complete, but the decision was made to end the dolphin exhibit once Semo and Allie were shipped out.\nIt was unclear at the time where Semo and Allie would be shipped. It was assumed that because the Minnesota Zoo was part of the Dolphin Consortium (essentially a program that ensures genetic diversity among captive bottlenose dolphins), which consists of The Seas with Nemo and Friends at Epcot, the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Indianapolis Zoo, Dolphin Connection, Texas State Aquarium, and the Brookfield Zoo; one or the other were planned to be shipped to one of these locations. Semo's transfer was dubbed a \"retirement\". At nearly 50 years old, he was one of the oldest surviving male dolphins in human care.On October 3, 2012, Semo and Allie were transferred out of the zoo. Semo was moved to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom in Vallejo, California, while Allie was sent back to the Brookfield Zoo just outside Chicago. Semo died on May 1, 2018, at Discovery Kingdom. He was 54 years old and apparently died of natural causes \n\n\n==== Hawaiian monk seals (2015-present) ====\nIn May, 2015, The Minnesota Zoo welcomed five critically endangered Hawaiian monk seals. The seals; \"Nani\", \"Koa\", \"Ola\", \"Paki\", and \"Opua\" are all female and were transferred to the zoo from SeaWorld San Antonio. All had been previously rescued after having been discovered malnourished and subsequently deemed unable to release in the wild. The seals will act as ambassadors to their critically endangered wild cousins as the zoo plans to offer daily, educational demonstrations with the seals in the newly upgraded \"Discovery Bay\" marine mammal tanks which housed the zoo's resident bottlenose dolphins up until 2012.\n\n\n=== Wells Fargo Family Farm ===\n\nThe Wells Fargo Family Farm, which opened in May 2000, allows guests to touch and interact with domestic animals. The Farm exhibit showcases goats, sheep, pigs, cows, chickens, and horses in a beautiful farm landscape. The Farm, a seasonal exhibit, is open every day beginning in April; the popular \"Farm Babies\" event marks the beginning each year. The Farm closes each fall for the season. The zoo has also created an interactive game about the farm called \"Who Pooped @ the Farm\". The farm also gives a chance for visitors to watch the staff milk the cows.\n\n\n=== Russia's Grizzly Coast ===\n\nRussia's Grizzly Coast gives visitors a chance to see animals that live around Russia's Pacific coast, including sea otters, grizzly bears, Amur tigers, Amur leopards, and wild boars in environments reminiscent of their homes in the Russian Far East. The 10,116-square-meter (2.5-acre), $23 million facility was the most expensive project to date at the zoo, and opened in June, 2008.\n\n\n=== 3M Penguins of the African Coast ===\nOn July 9, 2011, the zoo premiered a new exhibit focused on African penguins.\n\n\n=== IMAX Theater ===\nThe Great Clips IMAX Theatre is located on zoo grounds. At seven stories tall, as of 2014 it remains the largest IMAX theatre in Minnesota. It underwent a transition from analog to digital during the summer of 2014.  In an email sent from the Minnesota Zoo to zoo members on January 18, 2019, it was announced that IMAX corporate will permanently close the facility on January 27, 2019. No reason was given. The zoo and IMAX had a partnership in which the zoo would show nature documentaries and IMAX would show mainstream movies.\n\n\n=== Other attractions ===\nThere is also an outdoor amphitheater that is used for bird shows during summer zoo hours. After hours, the amphitheater is used for a popular \"Music in the Zoo\" series. There is also an outdoor amphitheater that is used for bird shows during summer zoo hours. After hours, the amphitheater is used for a popular \"Music in the Zoo\" series. The Minnesota zoo has a conservation carousel. The ride consist 56 animals from around the world. In order to ride the conservation carousel, zoo admission is required.\n\n\n== Past exhibits ==\nOne of the first and perhaps most popular exhibits at the zoo was the beluga whale exhibit. The exhibit was home to two belugas, a male by the name of Anookalik (nicknamed \"Big Mouth\"), and a female by the name of Anana (nicknamed \"Little Girl\"). In later years, a bone infection was found within \"Big Mouth's\" jawbone (resulting from a collision with one of the tank fixtures) and forced immediate transfer of both whales to SeaWorld San Diego in the hopes of obtaining a more sophisticated means of veterinary treatment. In April 1987, a crowd of nearly 30,000 people filled the gates of the Minnesota Zoo to bid their final farewells to the two whales, who were transferred out of the zoo shortly thereafter. Little Girl died of heart failure on June 13, 1989, at the age of fourteen. Big Mouth, whose bone infection eventually proved to be fatal, was euthanized on July 16, 1990, at the age of seventeen.\nThe zoo also was home to a monorail from 1979 until it closed September 2, 2013.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn 1987, the zoo served as the filming location for All About Animals, a title in the Little Schoolhouse series of educational children's videos.\n\n\n== See also ==\nComo Zoo and Conservatory\nNorth Carolina Zoo - The only other zoo in the United States than Minnesota Zoo that is a state agency.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Minnesota Zoo at Wikimedia Commons\nOfficial website",

          "The primates are always my favorite. Some of the zoo is under construction right now. With that said, there are still plenty of animals to see. In addition to primates, they have giraffes, sloths, frogs, birds, toads, snakes, ostriches, \u2026",
          "Great to walk around with out little doggos. The conservatory isn't open at this time for obvious reasons but the rest of the grounds are still pleasant to see and give a nice variety to your walk.",
          "I have always loved this zoo.",
          "Como Zoo has changed so much over the last decade, and all for the better. Every few years, another exhibit is closed and completely renovated. The gorilla and polar bear exhibits are so large and lovely now, I'm excited to see what the new \u2026",
          "Cool little zoo and conservatory, even in the winter it\u2019s open and the animals are very interactive",
          "I love taking my kids here.  Always something new to discover",
          "I most recently went for the Fairy Godmother's 85th birthday party in the banquet room/bonsai area of the Conservatory. It far exceeded my expectations for a venue!!! This event was warm in the winter, social space to mingle, catered, \u2026",
          "Wow this place was awesome! Can't believe it is free will donations. We took the shuttle bus so we didnt have to worry about parking which was very easy, convenient and only minutes from the park. Kids loved all the animals and there were \u2026",
          "Always beautiful and always a good time! I visit regularly and have never been disappointed. There have been a number of new animal births - it\u2019s fun to see the babies!  Be sure to check on the Impressive bonsai collection and Japanese garden.",
          "Wow, what a display of natural plants, flowers, and trees. All in a comfortable and great environment for humans and plants. Enjoying the gardens and walkways is not just relaxing, but invigorating. The music also gives out a unique ambience that makes you want more.",
          "The zoo is well maintained except for the aquarium. You can see many animals like polar bear, wolves, gorilla, different type of apes, zebras, ostrich, giraffe, Siberian tiger, lions, puma, bison, mountain sheep and so on. I felt a bit sad \u2026",
          "For some reason the place is not so good anymore... Too many animals were not in their enclosures, no lions, no polar bear, no seals... I hope the zoo comes back to its former glory... It used to be super nice. There is some construction \u2026",
          "Loved this place since I was a kid. Good memories. Easy way to recharge without going out of town.",
          "The great weekend plan for the whole family. We enjoy coming here every year. Look at these precious animals. Workers take a good care of them, as you can see. All cages are cleaned good.\nSo many activities for kids. \nMake sure to have at least 3 hours free to see all of it.",
          "Beautiful poinsettia display this year, as always! Highly recommend as a lively way to spend the afternoon out of the cold Minnesota elements!",
          "This place was amazing, we got to see lot of animals and birds. Best part of this place is we don\u2019t have a entry fees but we can donate, it\u2019s highly recommended to do some donations to keep this place awesome! Very good descriptions and \u2026",
          "One of the best free places to visit all year round. The animals are always enjoyable to see in the warmer months and even in the winter the indoor ones are fun but it can get cold walking from building to building. The indoor garden is a \u2026",
          "This is the perfect place to escape the snow and cold of Minnesota...tropical paradise and would be a great place for an artist to be inspired...",
          "We love taking our kids here. Its not as big as the Minnesota Zoo, but it has its own things to see. The gardens are beautiful and the have many animals you cannot see at the Zoo.",
          "We had a great time and were able to social distance.",
          "We had our child's birthday party here earlier this month. Anne, our party host, did a great job making sure the party was a success! She was knowledgeable about the zoo and animals. She also made sure the kids had fun and kept the party on track. I recommend having a birthday party here. Thanks Anne!",
          "Had a great time here with my fiance and younger brothers. Has a little bit of something for everybody. Creepy crawlers, birds, big cats, goats and monkeys just a bit of everything. We went in the summer and got to see their butterflies and \u2026",
          "This free zoo is a lot better than many zoo's that charge money to get in.   A must-see if you're in St. Paul, fantastic array of animals to see, reasonable concession prices and very kid friendly.  It's a summer tradition just like the state fair.",
          "We go here frequently, and love that it's open all year round. Really good option for a budget friendly family option! The conservatory looks and feels amazing in the middle of winter.",
          "Free and all the exhibits are clean and exciting to look at plus learn from. Como is ran on donations only and the animals are well fed watered and treated. The gift shop is expensive but all of the money goes to the zoo. Plus they have seasonal exhibits and a gorgeous exotic floral garden!",
          "Beautiful garden place any time of the year !!\nNeed to boost your mood?  Visit this wonderful Green House. Just seat down somewhere around and if you are relaxing you will note that flowers grow all year...under the right conditions!",
          "My family loves coming here when we visit Minneapolis! They encourage a free will Donation, but there have been a few times we couldn't readily afford it due to costs relating to healthcare. It's especially at those times that it means the \u2026",
          "Affordable and pretty place to spend a few hours with the kids!  The park is small and currently remodeling a large space.  Rides, animals, flowers, and plants!  Food is expensive but tasty.  It is a busy place and inside the buildings are \u2026",
          "Great place, especially during winter. The smells alone are enough to help you emerge from a midwinter emotional slump.",
          "The best place for garden therapy. Aww",
          "Not much to see. And hot and uncomfortable wearing a mask outside\u2639\ufe0f",
          "What a great place to take family all year round. Even with construction to improve the exhibits you can get around without any problems. With your donation at any visit you can continue to enjoy the park and keep the zoo a special low cost place for all to enjoy. Always beautiful.",
          "I haven't been to the Como zoo in YEARS, and coming back, I was pleasently surprised. The kiddos enjoyed their visit thoroughly and the animals have a much better situation than they did when I was young. They hold a number of interactive activities where kids and adults can learn about the animals at the zoo.",
          "Breathtaking. Room after room of things to explore, even in the winter. The staff were helpful and had interactive learning opportunities set up to teach my littles about what grows, finding food in plants and environment importance. Can't wait to return!",
          "The conservatory is a really great place to go any time of year, but especially during these unforgiving winter months. You are always welcome to visit regardless of if you're able to make the suggested donation. It's little details like that that makes Como Park an important community resource where people are safe and welcomed!",
          "Great to see animals you would not likely see otherwise.",
          "A great place to visit. The gardens are gorgeous. A nice variety of animals as\nwell. Free to get into but donations are welcomed to keep the place running. Recommend riding the 100+ year old carousel.",
          "Can't believe how gorgeous their grounds are and that they don't have an \"admission fee\" and it's just donations. I would very easily pay more than their recommended donation price for what you get to experience. The conservatory is \u2026",
          "Free zoo. Decent variety of animals both indoor and outdoor. Even some beautiful gardens to explore. They do have donation boxes at the entrance but it is not mandatory.. just appreciated. Good spot to bring the family or practice your photography skills.",
          "Great family place.\nGood for all ages!",
          "Enjoyed walking around como lake",
          "First time , even though it was a quick stop I know I'll be coming back.",
          "Well organized. It was great",
          "What a great zoo & conservatory. It's such a gem to visit. The flora is spectacular! I highly recommend.",
          "So beautiful any time off the year.",
          "Cool place and free, which is such a amazing gift to everyone. Clean, well taken care of and run. The gardens are awesome, the zoo is great. This is a must visit place in Minneapolis. The Japanese garden is cool and the bonsai collection is very interesting",
          "Always love the animals and flowers.",
          "An exceptional place to bring your family.  More than enough learning experiences with great landscaping and architectural features to enjoy.  Look forward to coming back in the spring when it warms up.",
          "Warm as if winter don't exist. Beautiful plants and flowers. Sculpture and everything is detailed in description by their sign.",
          "Best advice- arrive before opening for the best/easiest parking and pack our own lunch. \n\nThis zoo is always getting updated so its always fun to see what is new each time we go. \nThis Zoo is free yet they ask for donations",
          "We had a wonderful time there. A beautiful and relaxing day. So many beautiful flowers and helpful staff. Love the Snow Leopard and Penguins!",
          "Nice place for a trip with grandkids. You do have to go outside to get from building to building, but all the buildings are warm.We arrived at the penguins just in time for thr feeding. This is always fun to watch. That also meant we got to \u2026",
          "The Conservatory is by far my favorite place in Minneapolis St Paul. I\u2019ve been to botanical gardens and conservatory's across Europe and the US The Como Conservatory is by far the best Greenhouse / botanical garden I\u2019ve ever been to.  The \u2026",
          "Como Park is a jewel in the city of Saint Paul.  The Conservatory is the best place to visit in the dead of winter if you are craving green plants, fruit on trees, and the scent of flowers and spices.  There are walking paths around Como \u2026",
          "On a cold day in Minnesota we can go for a walk in an indoor park.  Get some exercise and see the beauty sheltered from the storm.",
          "A gem. Free zoo. Takes about an hour to walk around and see all the animals. Animals are close to you for easy viewing. Zoo is undergoing a major renovation right now that is set to be completed in 2020. Polar Bear and giraffe exhibits are the highlights.",
          "Staff is friendly, and place is always clean",
          "My brother had his wedding ceremony in the Sunken Garden and it was absolutely perfect for a small group. The pictures are idyllic. The staff was also very helpful in figuring out the sounds system and kind during the rehearsal. Highly recommend for small weddings!",
          "It's always a wonderful time at the Conservatory! They work hard to refresh the flowers, curate the bonsai, and create hidden moments among the pathways.",
          "A place not of Minnesota. Experience fragrance and humidity during the winter months. Escape in sitting and observation of all the wonderful themes in growth of vegetation.",
          "My 2 year olds first time there and he had a blast. It was hot out but we all had a great time.",
          "Great place to visit with family, as a couple or by yourself. No entry fee, zoo has a variety of animals. Food prices what you would expect for this type of venue. Conservatory was beautiful as always. \n\nTip: We visited on a weekday in June \u2026",
          "The best things in life are free, and this place in the twin cities is no exception.  Donation appreciated.  A great destination all year round for individuals, couples, families, and children of all ages.  A place for peaceful enjoyment it \u2026",
          "I love Como Zoo, been coming for years, but it's getting pretty rough. The building and grounds are in need of repair, and especially the animals and their enclosures. They need cleaning for sure. It was sad to see the animals this time. \u2026",
          "We loooove como! It's often forgot about this time if year, however we were blessed with a bright and sunny autumn day, and we made the most of it. We had a picnic, lakeside, at como park, then checked out the animals, and finished off the \u2026",
          "What a wonderful piece of property absolutely beautiful and it's free and if you like to make a donation that would be great. I enjoyed the monkeys and the botanical gardens the most the Japanese garden look wonderful just the wrong time of year can't wait to come back",
          "Cheap place to go on a date that's really pretty. Who am I kidding tho, this place was really fun to go to when Pokemon Go was super popular. I'm more of a zoo person but the Conservatory is definitely the more ethical choice of entertainment.",
          "Great entertainment for a free will donation. They are under construction making it nicer in the zoo. Then they have the conservatory where they have exotic flowers and plants.",
          "It was nice but at least half the zoo was blocked off under some type of construction. The primates looked horribly depressed as did most other animals. Kids had fun on the carousel.",
          "Even in the winter when it's nice out it's great going to the zoo. There are still some of the animals outside and then you can go inside and warm up in the buildings that have the animals inside.",
          "I absolutely love this zoo! I have so my good memories here and now so will my daughter. The Conservatory will brighten your day with all the beautiful colors.",
          "A tropical oasis in a Minnesota Winter + a baby giraffe! Open 365 days. Check the website for hours, since they vary seasonally. Very affordable with a suggested donation of $3 per person.",
          "Family outing to the Zoo and Conservatory on a 40-degree beautiful December day. Good sighting for animals, but it is a less than ideal setting for some of the animals. Good improvements underway. \nThe Conservatory was crowded but lovely.",
          "It's FREE! A great place to go anytime you need a little escape. Wonderful place to take children or visitors of all ages in all seasons! Can be crowded so plan ahead. So much to see & do you have to return many times to get it all in. Even though it is \"FREE\" we always donate when we can & shop for gifts in the gift shop! Enjoy",
          "We all had a great time at this zoo and bonus it was free with donation. Very awesome! There were many great animal exhibits, everything was clean and set up very nicely. This a definite must especially with the kiddos.",
          "The conservatory is an absolutely critical element to surviving a St. Paul winter. I visit when I need a boost of the tropics; a dose of humidity, air scented with actually-alive flowers and greenery, and a semi-outdoorsy experience without \u2026",
          "It's amazing, even with the buildings closed..so peaceful\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc0e\ud83d\udc9e",
          "In summer we reached at 12pm and most of the wild animals were sleeping but its not same in winter. Mostly they have every animal with Lion, Tiger and Polar bear but we could not find elephant/panda. Overall good family experience.",
          "How could you not enjoy this lovely place",
          "Excellent family experience.  Beautiful and well-taken-care-of conservatory.  The zoo is the right size to comfortably navigate in one visit.  They are expanding some parts, and that seems needed.  The primates  were delightful to watch. \u2026",
          "Great place to take the kids. I particularly like the conservatory in the winter. \nThere are tons of things to take pictures of, but check the photography policy before you go.\nThe food is alright, but expensive.\nI can't wait for the new seal wing to open in the main park!",
          "Awesome place. 5 start for the zoo and 5 star for the conservatory. A good place to spend some time with kids esp. in summer and early fall. We visited in the early fall and the views were brilliant.",
          "Como Park and The Conservatory are a great and cheap family outing. Give your child the camera and just watch what you get! Year round this is great, just check the daily schedule for any 'special'  activities and if you don't like a big crowd go about the time the activity ends! We particularly enjoy the Japanese Garden.",
          "Fantastic experience. I am happy to see there is a new aquatic exhibit under construction as well as a phenomenal big cat and primate collections. Also, I loved the plant collection in the conservatory. You must find the koi pond! Don't \u2026",
          "It was an awesome experience plus it's free. You sho uh old definently go check it out",
          "We love Como! We love zoos for their educational experience for our kiddos. The animals are very visible and the conservatory is always packed with breath taking flowers and plants. Great family day!",
          "We love coming to the conservatory.  It's especially nice mid winter when we just can't stand the snow any longer.  Parking is always hit or miss at the conservatory and zoo.  There are often small music concerts and the rotation of plants in the south conservatory is nice.",
          "Love taking the kids when we need something to do that is cheap but fun. Easy to find the animals. Free to get in but they accept donations when you walk in. They have a beautiful garden you can walk through and enjoy. They have an amusement park, mini putt golf, and picnic areas too.",
          "Kids enjoyed seeing animals.  Nice there is something in winter other than just conservatory. Smaller venue works good for younger kids.  Price is good.",
          "This place is great so much fun for kids. It's donation based but has a $3 for adults and $2 for kids  donation suggestion sign. Still super cheap and worth it. There's an old carousel you can ride as well as a carnival with rides,but we \u2026",
          "One of my favorite winter activities. So nice to go inside and breathe the fresh air and check out the rotating arrangements in the sunken garden but, my favorite is the tropical spice room and bonsai!",
          "I absolutely LOVE the conservatory! The flowers are beautiful and well cared for and the smell when the door opens to the sunken garden is EVERYTHING.\n\nThe fern room is a nice place to stroll through and/or sit down on the benches, relax, \u2026",
          "The conservatory is a wonderful (donation-based!) place to go in the winter to enjoy some warmth, humidity, and beautiful plant life. The tropics area also has some really big turtles, fish, an anaconda and a sleepy sloth.\n\nThe zoo itself \u2026",
          "Such an amazing place! Beautiful gardens! Animals of all kinds! And super friendly staff! We will definitely be coming back every time we are in the area!!",
          "Very very peaceful. Best place to come if you need to relax and think.",
          "I have been making trips here since I was a small child, this place has many fantastic memories.  We still make trips here several times a year, this is definitely a gem in our state.",
          "For a zoo/botanical garden and park, the area is a must see for families or a date. Not having an admission fee just makes it that much better. For the zoo, the range of animals is more than adequate. From lions, cougars, polar bears to zebras, it's a fantastic place to spend outdoors on a beautiful day.",
          "Free (suggested donation) warm and bright it's a great place to forget the cold in the winter.",
          "Animals and Flowers can bring peace and tranquility to a hectic world. Unleash your inner beast and commune with the giraffe, lion, tiger, seal, buffalo, polar bear, orangutans and others at the zoo. Its free, but a donation is encouraged \u2026",
          "I still like coming here to beat the cold and absorb some tropical plant life.  They have turtles and stingrays along with pretty plants!",
          "Online reservations was fast and easy",
          "Como is a family favorite.  It is a FREE zoo but PLEASE PUT MONEY IN THE BOX WHEN WALKING IN!!!  This zoo runs on donations.",
          "The gardens are all different and absolutely beautiful. I've been going here for my entire life and love it",
          "Had a great time at the zoo! Love their cafe as well.",
          "31 years of memories here but the conservatory is the highlight of the zoo experience. Don't forget to make a wish in the wishing well!",
          "Beautiful place with many plans and animals to see!",
          "The tropical indoor exhibit attached to the conservatory was really cool! Can you find the sloth? First time I've ever seen a sloth and I was really surprised and thrilled to see him/her. The little yellow birds were delightful as well! Also, the formal garden in the conservatory was just gorgeous, a real treat!",
          "This is such a nice place, well maintained and neat. I wonder how they manage with a little donation that we give. This has become one of a go to spot when some friends visit me here.",
          "My favorite time to visit Como Zoo is the winter. The rainforest house provides a warm, humid respite from whatever weather is outside. A quick tropical vacation!",
          "A great park for running and walking with plenty of trails.  The park is well maintained and it's easy to spend an afternoon there relaxing.  The zoo and amusement park is great for people with younger children.  The conservatory is nice \u2026",
          "Remember it's by appointment only for the zoo and aborarium.",
          "Best zoo I've been too in A while. We went from 4pm-6pm all the animals were active it was a bit hot for the polar bear though, napping inside. It was beautiful. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I hope the renovations to the aquatic areas go to plan, it'll make the zoo even better!",
          "Beautiful glass walled, roofed building filled inside with a myriad of exotic plants, flowers and so on that will mesmerize you.\n\nIt's possible to spend hours here in relative ease and comfort with plenty of seats to rest. They day I visited was considered crowded for a flower show but actually one rarely had to rub shoulders...",
          "Always nice in their. Would be a great place to do a wedding but I think you'll have to book it well in advance",
          "Great conservatory. Beautiful grounds to stroll. Ample parking. One of Saint Paul's many gems\n...",
          "Free with donation if you have it. My kids love the zoo. I love Como and Como Town when opened. Alot cheaper than MOA brings the kid out of me. Can't wait till the new remodeling is done.",
          "Awesome zoo. It was super nice and tons of animals, I love how they're extending our too.",
          "There is place to eat and drink coffee. Good place to go with family and friends to take a rest and to have a good weekend. Even though animals are inside in the winter, it is good to go.",
          "Great place to visit and what a price! $3 donation",
          "Very beautiful place, is open during the summer and winter months. Went with my family and on a class trip. Both very enjoyable times. There is no admission fee, but they do take donations. Their botanical garden was very lovely!",
          "We got to watch the keepers put Chloe the sloth to bed. Slowly. The display in the sunken garden was done in blues and purples & smelled like Lily. I love this place in winter... Hot & humid or cool & misty, there are prehistoric specimens, \u2026",
          "Great place. A non expensive option to learn about nature. Definitely a must go if you are near",
          "Love, love this place. Visited on a 15\u00b0 day and was 75\u00b0, humid, and wonderful inside. Great educational opportunities for kids and adults alike, or just enjoy the setting. Wish I still lived in the area; if I did, I\u2019d be here at least once a week to enjoy the lush, tropical beauty of the conservatory.",
          "BEAUTIFUL!  Could be a little cleaner, but such wonderful place to visit and it\u2019s free to get in!",
          "I've been to this Zoo sooo many times I cant even come close to recalling the number. Started visiting monthly as a small child with my Dad. Now that he has passed away every time I walk into Como I'm reminded of those many many visits \u2026",
          "Had a wonderful time with the family. Was able to see the majority of the animals.",
          "The orchid show was amazing. Also humidity in the winter is key. The color green is nice too",
          "A clean and well kept zoo.",
          "Always love coming here.  They do such a nice job.  Colors and arrangements always match the season.",
          "This is a place every Minnesotan and Wisconsinite should visit. The flowers are always divine. There is always something new to see in the conservatory. The zoo is a good will donation so if you are short on cash this is the place to take \u2026",
          "Wonderful place.  I highly recommend it. We went to a private event there and everything was very nicely done. If you have an upcoming event sure to check them out.",
          "It's a little tough in the winter. The animals stayed mostly inside and were inactive. Best to go when they're outside",
          "Como park is always great! All they ask for is a donation. It's hard to believe but it is ran and managed by the City of St. Paul. And, there is plenty to see and do on cold days. The Conservatory is always warm and melts the snow away.",
          "Love it. The polar bear, tiger and the wolfs were my favorites.",
          "Great area! I enjoyed all of it. It\u2019s great for families or just a nice place to walk around alone. The staff is caring and knowledgeable. The animals were pretty active(even when it was raining). I recommend visiting this area. It\u2019s beautiful and a little bit of everything.",
          "Love this place every time!",
          "Amazing place for kids",
          "The zoo itself is on the smaller side but I felt like there was more to do there than most of the ones we have paid for! My children loved the penguins and the polar bear! With a three year old it was also nice that there were restrooms \u2026",
          "Was a great experience to go and see some animals you don't see everyday. Great place to go with family with lots to do and see.",
          "Zoo needs some upkeep. Gardens were beautiful.",
          "I really love this place. In the winter it is a great escape from the cold. In warmer months the Japanese garden is exquisite.",
          "I\u2019ve been coming to the Como Zoo & Conservatory since I was a baby.  I still visit often, but I pick the non-peak hours and days since the area can become congested.  My favorite spot is the Conservatory during our winter months-it\u2019s always warm and tropical!",
          "This place is my Favorite! The palm trees and tropical atmosphere is truly AMAZING. They take such great care to make this place a great place to get away from winter.",
          "Beautiful free zoo and conservatory. Very thankful for this place during the winter. Only downside is that it is always criminally busy.",
          "I would recommend not coming here in the winter/late fall. 85% of the animals are indoors, and the giraffes and ostriches are confined to a small area. It's amazing in the summer, though.",
          "My family, friends and I always love coming here any time of the year! It\u2019s such a relaxing oasis to walk through the warm, humid air during MN winters especially! Check out the sunken garden\u2019s various seasonal flower shows as they change throughout the year! Lots of weddings and other special events are often hosted here as well.",
          "LOVED my day at Como Park Zoo & Conservatory! It is free for all (amazing), but please consider a reasonable donation as it provided such a fun afternoon (one could even spend all day here)! Tons of family friendly activities, great variety \u2026",
          "We had a wonderful day with grandsons.",
          "Concert under glass - Fellow Pynins playing - Aroma of Lilies in the air. What could be better!?",
          "The concerts offered in the conservatory on Sunday afternoons during the depths of Minnesota winter are free and a wonderful respite from the cold and snow. I have enjoyed 3 of them this year and I have also enjoyed good local beers and \u2026",

          "What a beautiful zoo. Excited to see the new exhibit next year.",
          "The Como Park Zoo & Conservatory accepts donations, you don't have to pay but it is kind to at least give a dollar. You can see the Giraffes up really close, and you can pay extra to feed them. The monkeys are really fascinating, they are \u2026",
          "One of St. Paul's treasures. The perfect place to spend an afternoon any time of year. Whether it be seeing all the beautiful plants and flowers in the conservatory or learning about the wide variety of animals kept in the zoo, you can't go wrong at Como.",

          "Beautiful and educational! A spot of bright warmth in the middle of winter!",
          "This place was very disappointing to me for being my first time. Barely any animals in the exhibits. The ones that were, looked miserable. The whole place looks dirty. Fish tanks and penguin exhibits are just filthy and you can barely see \u2026",
          "Great value for the whole family.\n\nI've been visiting Como Zoo since I was a kid. Now that I have my own children, they find it as wonderful as I did, when I was their ages.\n\nThe cost to enter is voluntary and donations are strongly \u2026",

          "I mean I have been at better Zoo's in general. But can't complain much as it's free. (There are boxes at entrance saying recommended donations 3$/adult 2$/child. Definitely needs to be better maintained.  You can visit if you need to spend an hour or so",
          "Absolutely loved the fact that the entire zoo is operated off of donations. Latge selection of animals and phenomenal layout. Enough fun for the entire family. Loved the little theme park inside as well.",
          "Best zoo in the metro area for young children. Many exhibits in a well organized area. Staff on hand to answer questions.  The 4 year old walked most of the day. The seal exhibit was under construction and some animals were kept inside still. Would recommend going in late may or June if possible when the weather warms up more.",

          "Great free zoo. Best in warmer months",
          "Zoo is small but still a great place to take kids or just to walk.  They are adding a sea lion addition with an amphitheater for shows in 2020. Gardens are really nice!

Complete strangers were happily telling you what amazing colored butterfly was on your head or back. A wonderful way to teach kids the value of butterflies and the plants that attract them!",
          "Great Zoo for the price of free or a voluntary donation.  Love walking around looking at the animals, plants and flowers too.  Then toss in the free parking.  Great place to destress.",
          "I go there whenever i can, the air feels good. Always donate.",
          "FREE ENTRY! \nWe were very surprised at how massive and entertaining this zoo was! Super impressed. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit. There was also a small themepark (not free) adjacent to the zoo though I'm not sure if it's a year round attraction or not.",
          "I love that they still can do all they do off of donations. They are continuously expanding the park for the benefit of the animals without making it impossible to see them. Great place for a family day and picnic!",

I personally like the Bonsai garden.\ud83d\udc4c The conservatory and rainforest exhibits are awesome living ecosystems and are nothing to shy away from either. I would recommend visiting to anybody who has yet to experience them.",
          "I love Como Zoo and Conservatory! You see the animals up so much closer than the MN Zoo.  Today when we visited, they had knowledgeable staff and volunteers at many of the animal exhibits, offering helpful info on the habits and behavior of \u2026",

          "I know this is a free zoo! I don\u2019t regret going here at all, but there are some big flaws with the place. I think the fact that it is (technically) free means that they don\u2019t have a ton of extra money for upkeep in some exhibits. The main \u2026",

          "Lots of bang for your buck.  A must see of the twin cities.  Things don't change that often and parking is not ideal.",
          "I had a blast visiting this beautiful free to the public zoo! Will return in the future!",
          "This was such a nice break from the current Minnesota weather! It has breathtaking flowers, spices, and plants. It was so fun to just wander around or even sit for a while there. The bonsai exhibit was also a wonderful get away. I can't recommend this place enough, and the three dollar suggested donation is a steal!",
          "Amazing! So many plants and trees. Another world away from just outside. And the outside is beautiful also. Just loved the different lilies in the pools.",
          "I love Como so much, you pay what you can for amazing plants and animals all the time",
          "My mother grew up in Saint Paul. She went to Como Park often as a child.  I have been going to Como Park since I was a child. I have brought my children and now my grandchildren to the park. It is one of the premier parks in the country \u2026",
          "This is a real treasure! The gardens are always stunning. Even kids enjoy going to the conservatory. It's like a tropical Oasis in Minnesota! And the Japanese garden outside are peaceful and beautiful to stroll also.\n\nThe zoo has a wide \u2026",
          "The zoo part should be shut down. I've been to a lot of zoos before and these were the smallest and most poorly thought out enclosures that I have ever seen. The poor seals were swimming in a small pool similar in width to an inflatable \u2026",
          "One of my very favorite places to go in the Twin Cities.  Small amusement park, small zoo, large, beautiful conservatory that boasts a variety of lush foliage and flowers that take my breath away.  LOVELY!  $2 ride on the 100+ year old merry go round is a must",
          "Great place to take the kiddos. It's big enough to take all day if you want to stroll around and easy to navigate. It's organized in a way that you could easily just see a couple exhibits abs call it for the smaller kids. They have food but \u2026",
          "Such a great place for a family outing! Donations only, no entry fee. Perfect size for an afternoon of animal watching. Totally worth the drive, very walkable with lots of shaded benches and buildings to cool off in. We didnt explore the amusement park but it looked like a good place for little kids.",
          "Love Como! It is a great small zoo and a lot of fun for my family. During the summer there are rides for the kids and there is a food court year round for snacks and treats!",
          "Always a nice place to visit. It's been several years and while the parking remains a pain, I still love the place. Great neighborhood gem",
          "Beautiful plants and flowers. I love the sloths!",
          "Happy to visit after this place, very beautiful and helpful to up your knowledge about different animals as well as atmosphere changes!!",
          "A very good zoo that is dependent on donations. They have some small rides for younger kids which is airways fun. Can be pretty busy on the weekends. More parking would be appreciated",
          "So fun ! A big variety of animals and I think they accommodate the animals fairly well",
          "Wonderful Botanical Garden and Conservatory, truly world class. A must see in the northern United States.",
          "Such a great zoo! And it's free but accept donations!!! The flower house is GORGEOUS!!",
          "Awesome place. A lot to see and essentially almost free. Lots of anymals. Botanical section is great.",

          "This is a great place to take the family to. Plenty of exotic animals to see. They now have a butterfly section! For $1 you can release a butterfly into the space. There is a great place to eat within the info center. If the animals don't excite you, head over to Comotown to ride rides or play in the water fountains.",
          "Open today with beautiful Christmas plants and so much more. Store and cafe open too.",
          "Amazing, tulips when we still have 2 feet of snow on the ground.  Kept two teenagers busy for over an hour.",
          "Although my son was seriously injured by a careless worker who couldn't even bother to ask if he was okay.. we had fun. The rides had my son forgetting about his injury and laughing. The food was a bit pricey but hey I didn't mind.  Our favorite part were the zebras and giraffes..",
          "It's really cool that it's free to go to but the exhibits are really small and some of them like the penguin exhibit dont seem like they are that clean but it could be due to age and that it's small.",
          "Small zoo. Great for the local families. Free entry but donation are appreciated. Buy tickets to ride the carnival rides. They have beautiful water lilies and a planetarium to walk through.",
          "It's beautiful lot's of entertainment for free yet can spend the whole day! Watching different animals, visiting the conservatory or picnicking in the park!!",
          "Glad to have a place like this, where families can go and have an affordable fun day!",
          "It's great for a free zoo. Wonderful place to go on dreary cold days. It is a little small. But then again it is free they can't all be the Smithsonian. I do wish they had less Subsaharian animals and more Artic animals. I just feel bad for \u2026",
          "Went there with my son and his grandparents and he loved it. Such a clean and well kept place, amazing to have access for no admission.",
          "Such a rare and wonderful place is the Conservatory. I would suggest discovering a quiet time. Not sure when that is, but it's a more comtempletive experience when alone. People are great, but rushing and bumping leaves little to be \u2026",
          "Loved it. Very informative. Only got thru the zoo. Next visit to Minnesota we will stop & see the conservatory.",
          "We love our time spent at Como! Our choice zoo",
          "It was just what we needed on a winter day. Love the bonsai trees",

          "Well taken care of forest, lots of free roaming animals and birds, even a sloth!!",
          "My favorite place to bring the whole family! It is free with recommended amount to donate per person, but you are not obligated to donate. A nice size zoo for being free. They have wheelchair and stroller rental for cheap. They truly know \u2026",
          "The orchid show is an amazing break from the winter weather!",
          "I try to stop here every time I'm in town. It's a great place to spend a hour or two walking around the conservatory. If you have more time it's easy to spend a half day walking around the zoo as well. Always well maintained and the price of entry is simply a donation. Highly recommend everyone going here!",
          "Very nice zoo. Plenty of activities for kids. Great place to enjoy being outside for an afternoon.",
          "Wonderful conservatory and AZA zoo.  They have a nice cafe with gluten-free options and gift shop. Our family loved it all. They are currently building a new sea lion exhibit.",
          "Perfect for families looking for a cost effective adventure with learning too!  Make a day of it and have a picnic then enjoy the animals and the plant life.  It is free but donations are suggested.  Definitely worth it!",
          "Love this place could spend all day there.",
          "I really like the conservatory. It can be too crowded some weekends. Great place to take families. $2 recommended donation. The zoo has made some real improvements, especially the primate house is much nicer now.",
          "Very clean park and friendly staff. Very nice place to visit with friends or family! They have a suggested donation price!",
          "Flowers are beautiful. So good to feel like summer for a few hours!",
          "The Zoo & Conservatory are always impressive - especially for the price. We had a poor experience with Alton's BBQ (Burger & Fries food trailer). The staff there seems pretty scanmy. I\u2019d steer clear for something better.",
          "I was amazed to see this place. It has a park, a zoo, rides for kids, play area for kids, a botanical garden or plants conservatory. If you intend to cover all \n of it then a day is not enough. For me snow bear was special attraction, I had \u2026",
          "I love zoos. It matters to me how happy the animals seem. Como is  a bit limited on space, so some of the animals seem borderline on acceptable. But they are doing fairly well given their space limitations.",
          "It's awesome no a scale 50 / 100",
          "The conservatory in the winter is wonderful. All the greenery is beautiful.",
          "Such a classic staple of our community; I absolutely love this place!",
          "Awesome place to see animals and plants, and it's FREE. We stayed inside and warm and still had tons of fun.",
          "It\u2019s fine , a bit underwhelming but it\u2019s something to go to",
          "The conservatory is great, but I'm not a huge fan of the zoo. Kind of old-fashioned, the aquatic building is filthy (though they are redoing it), and I have qualms about keeping great apes in captivity. I would recommend the Minnesota Zoo for a more interesting and educational experience.",
          "It was wonderful place.",
          "Feels like summer.  In the tropics.  It's a mini vacation for a $5 suggested donation.",
          "A great place to take pictures. This is a nice place for all ages to spend the day to walk and enjoy the gardens. There are rides for the younger kids and plenty of food stands.",
          "The next person to try an grab my son will end up facing a world of hurt. He\u2019s 7 months old with a generic disease, not stupid. I will be defensive. You don\u2019t leave your \u201cspecial needs child\u201d 100ft from you, touching everyone and \u2026",
          "The Como Park zoo & conservatory are excellent. Admission is free but they do take donations to help cover costs. They have a variety of well-maintained animal exhibits in their AZA accredited zoo. My favorite animals to try to see are the wolves. You have a better chance of seeing them in cold weather.",
          "A fun place to spend the day. The conservatory is beautiful and a great place to go to get the chill and dryness of winter out of your bones. We enjoy going as a family and sitting in each room to enjoy the plants and beauty of creation. In \u2026",
          "You know, I found myself enjoying the  conservatories more than the rest of the rather run-down and overcrowded main attractions. The lack of funding is very apparent.",
          "Best place to go escape the brutal winter! Go in a weekday when there are fewer crowds and bring a book!",
          "Amazing place... Great day out for the kids!",
          "We love Como. So nice to have a free zoo, though we always contribute. Excited to see it when current construction is done!",

          "Great zoo.  Especially since it is free (based on donations).  Lots of animals in nice enclosures.   Nice little amusement park to go with it too.",
          "Nice, clean, amazing conservatory.  A large part of the zoo was under construction for a remodel. But the areas that where open where updated.",
          "How cool is this place! One of the last free zoos! And it was better than some of the paid zoos I have seen around the country.",
          "Great way to enjoy a warm winter day.",

          "Great place to take children and see animals. Please leave a donation since that's all they have.",
          "Going on a weekday is the best decision I ever made. They are currently under some construction for a new sea lion habitat coming in 2019, looking great! The Japanese gardens are a must. Great place for couples, families and friends.",
          "I just love the fact that this is a \ud83d\udcb2FREE\ud83d\udcb2 Zoo\u203c Yet it still manages to stay full of quality enclosures, animals & staff year after year.  \ud83d\ude0f\ud83c\udf33\ud83d\udc3e\ud83d\ude3b",

          "Como Park is one of those Minnesota institutions. if you grew up here I guarantee you had a field trip here at some point. \n\nIt's an absolute must for anyone who hasn't been. It's nice it's easy and most importantly it's free.",

          "Best place to go on a dreary winter day.",
          "Free, which is always great. Today they had volunteers teaching visitors about the gorillas and orangutans, with molded skulls. Sooo many babies! Baby Kudu, baby giraffes, baby snow leopard, baby orangutan, baby gorilla. Too cute! Also there is a small amusement park attached that can help break up your time at the zoo!",
          "Very good place for tourists, senior citizens, children of all ages. I recommend school children to go on education tour. Botanical gardens are very well maintained.",
          "Love this place! Such a calm and interesting place to go alone or with your family! Kids love it so much, they have a ton of kid friendly activities like story time and plant studies, and the flowers change seasonally. Love it and will always come back.",

          "The place has a free entry, but if time is money then this place is money well spent. Lots of flora and fauna. My wife loved the polar bear and the gorilla habitats the most. They have a few big cats as well. They do have a donation box at the entrance, so its totally up to yiu to decide the price of this experience",
          "Alot of fun and it's free to go to the zoo. They even have a free foam party that my grandson loves!",

          "Construction at moment for new sea lion exhibit but we enjoy this zoo! Free will donation, cheap rides for kids and enough to see with little ones. Walk ways seem great for all the strollers, but buildings get crammed with strollers and not as much space.",
          "Wonderful donation dependent zoo. Many exhibits are sad, so remember to contribute the requested 2-3$ if you can afford it. This zoo has many bright spots but many of the animals need updated living areas and many exhibits need huge \u2026",

        "wiki": "Saint Paul (St. Paul) is the capital of the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is the county seat of Ramsey County, the state's smallest and most densely populated county. As of 2019, its estimated population was 308,096, making it the 63rd-largest city in the United States and the 11th-most populous in the Midwest. Most of the city lies east of the Mississippi River at the confluence with the Minnesota River. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, is across the river to the west. Together they are known as the \"Twin Cities\". They are the core of Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, home to over 3.6 million and the third-largest in the Midwest.Established near existing Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center, the city gained prominence when it was made the capital of the Minnesota Territory in 1849. The Dakota name for where Saint Paul is situated is \"Imnizaska\". The city is known for the Xcel Energy Center, home to the Minnesota Wild. Regionally, it is known for the Science Museum of Minnesota and its new soccer stadium. As a business hub of the Upper Midwest, it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab. Saint Paul and Minneapolis are also known for their high literacy rate.The first structure built in what would become St. Paul was constructed in 1838 at the entrance to Fountain Cave overlooking the Mississippi. It was built by Pigs Eye Parrant near where Randolph Avenue today meets the river. Parrant's \"tavern\" was well known and the surrounding area came to be known as Pigs Eye. That lasted until the Catholic missionary Lucien Galtier arrived in 1840. He did not care for Parrant, his tavern, or the use of his name. The priest's arrival brought the eviction of Parrant from his establishment and the building of a log chapel near where steamboats had an easy landing. Galtier named the chapel St. Paul's, making it known that the settlement was then to be called by that name, as \"Saint Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated, this monosyllable is short, sounds good, it is understood by all Christian denominations\". While Pigs Eye was no longer the settlement's name, it came to refer to wetlands and an island south of the city's center. As the region grew the city became the seat of an archdiocese that built a grand St. Paul's Cathedral overlooking the downtown.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBurial mounds in present-day Indian Mounds Park suggest the area was inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about 2,000 years ago. From the early 17th century to 1837, the Mdewakanton Dakota, a tribe of the Sioux, lived near the mounds after fleeing their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe. The Dakota called the area I-mni-za ska dan (\"little white rocks\") for its exposed white sandstone cliffs on the river's eastern side. In the Menominee language it is called S\u0101\u0113nep\u0101n-Men\u012bk\u0101n, which means \"ribbon, silk or satin village\", suggesting its role in trade throughout the region after the introduction of European goods.Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, US Army officer Zebulon Pike negotiated approximately 100,000 acres (40,000 ha; 160 sq mi) of land from the local Dakota tribes in 1805 to establish a fort. The negotiated territory was on both banks of the Mississippi River, from Saint Anthony Falls in present-day Minneapolis to its confluence with the Saint Croix River. Fort Snelling was built on the territory in 1819 at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers, which formed a natural barrier to both Native American nations. The 1837 Treaty with the Sioux ceded all local tribal land east of the Mississippi to the U.S. government. Taoyateduta (Chief Little Crow V) moved his band at Kaposia across the river to the south. Fur traders, explorers, and missionaries came to the area for the fort's protection. Many of the settlers were French-Canadians who lived nearby. But as a whiskey trade flourished, military officers banned settlers from the fort-controlled lands. Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant, a former fur trader turned bootlegger who particularly irritated officials, set up his tavern outside the military reservation, upriver from Lambert's Landing. By the early 1840s, the community had become important as a trading center and destination for pioneers heading west. Locals called the area Pig's Eye (French: L'\u0152il du Cochon) or Pig's Eye Landing after Parrant's popular tavern. In the 1840s-70s the M\u00e9tis brought their oxen and Red River Carts down Kellogg Street to Lampert's landing to ship buffalo hides to market from the Red River of the North.  St. Paul was the southernmost stop on the Red River Trails. In 1840 Pierre Bottineau became a resident of St. Paul with a claim in the heart of the settlement.\n\nIn 1841, Father Lucien Galtier was sent to minister to the Catholic French Canadians and established a chapel, named for his favorite saint, Paul the Apostle, on the bluffs above Lambert's Landing. Galtier informed the settlement it was to adopt the name Saint Paul in honor of his new chapel and to give up use of Pigs Eye. In 1847, the New York educator Harriet Bishop moved to the area and opened the city's first school. The Minnesota Territory was formalized in 1849 with Saint Paul as its capital. In 1857, the territorial legislature voted to move the capital to Saint Peter, but Joe Rolette, a territorial legislator, stole the physical text of the approved bill and went into hiding, preventing the move. On May 11, 1858, Minnesota was admitted to the union as the 32nd state, with Saint Paul still capital. Soon thereafter the country was torn by the Civil War. When the state learned that Governor Ramsey had volunteered a regiment to fight the South, communities across the state put together companies of volunteers for that regiment. St. Paul contributed A and C Companies to the formation of the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe year 1858 saw more than 1,000 steamboats service Saint Paul, making the city a gateway for settlers to the Minnesota frontier or Dakota Territory. Natural geography was a primary reason the city became a landing. The area was the last accessible point to unload boats coming upriver due to the Mississippi River Valley's stone bluffs. During this period, Saint Paul was called \"The Last City of the East.\" Industrialist James J. Hill constructed his railroad empire into the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway, both headquartered in Saint Paul until merging into the Burlington Northern. Today they are part of the BNSF Railway.The Spanish\u2013American War saw the trans-Atlantic ocean liner SS Saint Paul (1895) converted and commissioned into the United States Navy as an auxiliary cruiser. She was the first ship in the navy to bear the city's name. She was decommissioned and returned to her owners only to be conscripted for service again for WWI, after which she was again decommissioned and scraped.\nCrooks' Haven In 1900 an Irishman named John O'Connor became chief of the St. Paul police and was known on the street as \"the Big Fellow\". That year he instituted the \"O'Connor Layover Agreement\" and made an effort to inform criminals of its existence. St. Paul police would ignore any transgressions of the law that took place outside their jurisdiction as long as criminals \"checked in\" when they arrived in town. There were three conditions to the agreement: check in with the police; pay a \"donation\" to the chief; and commit no crimes in St. Paul. Check-in was at the Savoy Hotel downtown. A great deal of \"business\" was taken care of at the \"Green Lantern\" speakeasy near the train station in Lowertown. It was also known for illegal gaming. More got done in the caves across the river from downtown. In 1930 the local mob even arranged that St. Paul's new police chief would be Tom Brown. The \"Agreement\" lasted through the prohibition until 1935. In that time St. Paul welcomed John Dillinger, Billie Frechette, Ma Barker, Baby Face Nelson, Alvin Karpis, Machine Gun Kelly, Kid Cann and many of their Irish associates. Barker's gang resided a block south of the city line on Robert St.. Karpis is quoted as saying, \u201cThere was probably never before as complete a gathering of criminals in one room in the United States, as there was in the Green Lantern on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1931. There were escapees from every U.S. Penitentiary. I was dazzled.\u201d  Al Capone and Bonnie and Clyde are known to have called on the city also.  According to crime historian Paul Maccabee the only criminal there is no record of visiting St. Paul during this period is Pretty Boy Floyd.  Events in 1935 changed the St. Paul police department and closed St. Paul's open doors.On August 20, 1904, severe thunderstorms and tornadoes damaged hundreds of downtown buildings, causing $1.78 million ($50.65 million today) in damages and ripping spans from the High Bridge.WWII  On the morning of December 7, 1941, the USS Ward was manned by naval reservists. It had a crew of 115, of whom at least 85 were from St. Paul. Duty that morning was patrolling the entrance of Pearl Harbor, T.H. The watch caught sight of a periscope trailing a freighter into the harbor and the Ward took action against the unknown intruder. The crew became the first Americans to fire their weapons in WWII. A 4\"/50 gun from the ship can be seen on the state capitol grounds. WWII brought into being the second USS St. Paul. This time the city had a Baltimore-class cruiser bearing its name. That ship's bell is on display in Saint Paul's city hall.\nDuring the 1960s, in conjunction with urban renewal, Saint Paul razed neighborhoods west of downtown for the creation of the interstate freeway system. From 1959 to 1961, the Rondo Neighborhood was demolished for the construction of Interstate 94. The loss of that African American enclave brought attention to racial segregation and unequal housing in northern cities. The annual Rondo Days celebration commemorates the African American community.Downtown St. Paul had skyscraper-building booms beginning in the 1970s. Because the city center is directly beneath the flight path into the airport across the river there is a height restriction for all construction. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and Sibley Towers), The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were constructed in the late 1980s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition of bringing new immigrant groups to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Saint Paul is the location of the Hmong Archives.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSaint Paul's history and growth as a landing port are tied to water. The city's defining physical characteristic, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, was carved into the region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys. The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.\nThe Mississippi River forms a municipal boundary on part of the city's west, southwest, and southeast sides. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, lies to the west. Falcon Heights, Lauderdale, Roseville, and Maplewood are north, with Maplewood lying to the east. The cities of West Saint Paul and South Saint Paul are to the south, as are Lilydale, Mendota, and Mendota Heights, although across the river from the city. The city's largest lakes are Pig's Eye Lake, which is part of the Mississippi, Lake Phalen, and Lake Como. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 56.18 square miles (145.51 km2), of which 51.98 square miles (134.63 km2) is land and 4.20 square miles (10.88 km2) is water.The Parks and Recreation department is responsible for 160 parks and 41 recreation centers. The city ranked #2 in park access and quality, after only Minneapolis, in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the top 100 park systems across the United States according to the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nSaint Paul's Department of Planning and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into seventeen Planning Districts, created in 1979 to allow neighborhoods to participate in governance and use Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement directly from the city, the councils share a pool of funds. The councils have significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they organize residents. The boundaries are adjusted depending on population changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods. Though these neighborhoods changed over time, preservationists have saved many of their historically significant structures.\nThe city's seventeen Planning Districts are:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSaint Paul has a continental climate typical of the Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, while summers are warm to hot and humid. On the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Saint Paul falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa). The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog.Due to its northerly location in the United States and lack of large bodies of water to moderate the air, Saint Paul is sometimes subjected to cold Arctic air masses, especially during late December, January, and February. The average annual temperature of 47.05 \u00b0F (8.36 \u00b0C) gives the Minneapolis\u2212Saint Paul metropolitan area the coldest annual mean temperature of any major metropolitan area in the continental U.S.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants from about 400 A.D. were members of the Hopewell tradition who buried their dead in mounds (now Indian Mounds Park) on the bluffs above the river. The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century who fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation. The Ojibwe would later occupy the north (east) bank of the Mississippi River.\nBy 1800, French-Canadian explorers came through the region and attracted fur traders to the area. Fort Snelling and nearby Pig's Eye Tavern also brought the first Yankees from New England and English, Irish, and Scottish immigrants who had enlisted in the army and settled nearby after discharge. These early settlers and entrepreneurs built houses on the heights north of the river. The first wave of immigration came with the Irish who settled at Connemara Patch along the Mississippi, named for their home in Connemara Ireland. The Irish would become prolific in politics, city governance, and public safety, much to the chagrin of the Germans and French who had grown into the majority. In 1850, the first of many groups of Swedish immigrants passed through Saint Paul on their way to farming communities in northern and western regions of the territory. A large group settled in Swede Hollow, which would later become home to Poles, Italians, and Mexicans. The last Swedish presence had moved up Saint Paul's East Side along Payne Avenue in the 1950s.In terms of people who specified European ancestry in the 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey, the city was 26.4% German, 13.8% Irish, 8.4% Norwegian, 7.0% Swedish, and 6.2% English. There is also a visible community of people of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, representing 4.2% of Saint Paul's population. By the 1980s, the Thomas Dale area, once an Austro-Hungarian enclave known as Frogtown (German: Froschburg), became home to Vietnamese people who had left their war-torn country. A settlement program for the Hmong diaspora came soon after, and by 2000, the Saint Paul Hmong were the largest urban contingent in the United States. Mexican immigrants have settled in Saint Paul's West Side since the 1930s, and have grown enough that Mexico opened a foreign consulate in 2005.The majority of residents claiming religious affiliation are Christian, split between the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. The Roman Catholic presence comes from Irish, German, Scottish, and French Canadian settlers who, in time, would be bolstered by Hispanic immigrants. There are Jewish synagogues such as Mount Zion Temple and relatively small populations of Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists. The city has been dubbed \"paganistan\" due to its large Wiccan population.As of the 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, White Americans made up 66.5% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 62.1% were non-Hispanic whites, down from 93.6% in 1970. Blacks or African Americans made up 13.9% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 13.5% were non-Hispanic blacks. American Indians made up 0.8% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 0.6% were non-Hispanic. Asian Americans made up 12.3% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 12.2% were non-Hispanic. Pacific Islander Americans made up less than 0.1% of Saint Paul's population. Individuals of other races made up 3.4% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 0.2% were non-Hispanic. Individuals from two or more races made up 3.1% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 2.6% were non-Hispanic. In addition, Hispanics and Latinos made up 8.7% of Saint Paul's population.\nAs of the 2000 U.S. Census, there were 287,151 people, 112,109 households, and 60,999 families residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 67.0% White, 11.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 12.4% Asian (mostly Hmong), 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.8% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 7.9% of the population.\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 285,068 people, 111,001 households, and 59,689 families residing in the city. The population density was 5,484.2 inhabitants per square mile (2,117.5/km2). There were 120,795 housing units at an average density of 2,323.9 per square mile (897.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 60.1% white, 15.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 15.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.9% from other races, and 4.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 9.6% of the population.\nThere were 111,001 households, of which 30.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.1% were married couples living together, 14.8% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 46.2% were non-families. 35.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.47 and the average family size was 3.33.\nThe median age in the city was 30.9 years. 25.1% of residents were under the age of 18; 13.9% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 29.6% were from 25 to 44; 22.6% were from 45 to 64; and 9% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.9% male and 51.1% female.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul\u2013Bloomington area employs 1,570,700 people in the private sector as of July 2008, 82.43 percent of which work in private service providing-related jobs.Major corporations headquartered in Saint Paul include Ecolab, a chemical and cleaning product company which was named in 2008 by the Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal as the eighth best place to work in the Twin Cites for companies with 1,000 full-time Minnesota employees, and Securian Financial Group Inc.The 3M Company is often cited as one of Saint Paul's companies, though it is located in adjacent Maplewood. 3M employs 16,000 people throughout Minnesota. St. Jude Medical, a manufacturer of medical devices, is directly across the northern border of Saint Paul in Little Canada, though the company's address is listed in Saint Paul.The city was home to the Ford Motor Company's Twin Cities Assembly Plant, which opened in 1924 and closed at the end of 2011. The plant was in Highland Park on the Mississippi River, adjacent to Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River, which generates hydroelectric power. The site is now being cleared of all buildings and tested for contamination to prepare for redevelopment. As the lead developer, the Ryan Company has released a proposed set of zoning changes that will shape how the land will be used.The city of Saint Paul has financed city development by use of tax increment financing (TIF). In 2018, the city had 55 TIF districts. Some projects that have benefited from TIF funding include the St. Paul Saints stadium, and the affordable housing along the Twin Cities Metro Green Line.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nEvery January, Saint Paul hosts the Saint Paul Winter Carnival, a tradition that began in 1886 when a New York reporter called Saint Paul \"another Siberia\". The organizers had a model in Montreal Winter Carnival the year before. The event has now been held 135 times  with an attendance of 350,000. It includes an ice sculpting competition, a snow sculpting competition, a medallion treasure hunt, food, activities, and an ice palace when it can be arranged. The Como Zoo and Conservatory and adjoining Japanese Garden are popular year-round. The historic Landmark Center in downtown Saint Paul hosts cultural and arts organizations. The city's recreation sites include Indian Mounds Park, Battle Creek Regional Park, Harriet Island Regional Park, Highland Park, the Wabasha Street Caves, Lake Como, Lake Phalen, and Rice Park, as well as several areas abutting the Mississippi River. The Irish Fair of Minnesota is held annually at the Harriet Island Pavilion area. The country's largest Hmong American sports festival, the Freedom Festival, is held the first weekend of July at McMurray Field near Como Park.\nThe city is associated with the Minnesota State Fair in neighboring Falcon Heights just west of Como Park. The fair dates to before statehood. With the competing interests of Minneapolis and St. Paul, it was held on \"neutral ground\" between both.  That area refused to become part of St. Paul or Roseville and became Falcon Heights in the 1950s. The University of Minnesota Saint Paul Campus is actually in Falcon Heights. \nFort Snelling is often identified as being in St. Paul but is actually its own unorganized territory. The eastern part of Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory (MSP included) has a St. Paul mailing address. The western side has a Minneapolis ZIP code. \n\nSaint Paul is the birthplace of cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, who lived in Merriam Park from infancy until 1960. Schulz's Peanuts inspired giant, decorated sculptures around the city, a Chamber of Commerce promotion in the late 1990s. Other notable residents include writer F. Scott Fitzgerald and playwright August Wilson, who premiered many of the ten plays in his Pittsburgh Cycle at the local Penumbra Theater.The Ordway Center for the Performing Arts hosts theater productions and the Minnesota Opera is a founding tenant. RiverCentre, attached to Xcel Energy Center, serves as the city's convention center. The city has contributed to the music of Minnesota and the Twin Cities music scene through various venues. Great jazz musicians have passed through the influential Artists' Quarter, first established in the 1970s in Whittier, Minneapolis, and moved to downtown Saint Paul in 1994. Artists' Quarter also hosts the Soapboxing Poetry Slam, home of the 2009 National Poetry Slam Champions. At The Black Dog, in Lowertown, many French or European jazz musicians (Evan Parker, Tony Hymas, Beno\u00eet Delbecq, Fran\u00e7ois Corneloup) have met Twin Cities musicians and started new groups touring in Europe. Groups and performers such as Fantastic Merlins, Dean Magraw/Davu Seru, Merciless Ghosts, and Willie Murphy are regulars. The Turf Club in Midway has been a music scene landmark since the 1940s. Saint Paul is also the home base of the internationally acclaimed Rose Ensemble. As an Irish stronghold, the city boasts popular Irish pubs with live music, such as Shamrocks, The Dubliner, and O'Gara's. The internationally acclaimed Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the nation's only full-time professional chamber orchestra. The Minnesota Centennial Showboat on the Mississippi River began in 1958 with Minnesota's first centennial celebration.Saint Paul hosts a number of museums, including the University of Minnesota's Goldstein Museum of Design, the Minnesota Children's Museum, the Schubert Club Museum of Musical Instruments, the Minnesota Museum of American Art, the Traces Center for History and Culture, the Minnesota History Center, the Alexander Ramsey House, the James J. Hill House, the Minnesota Transportation Museum, the Science Museum of Minnesota, and the Twin City Model Railroad Museum.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe Saint Paul division of Parks and Recreation runs over 1,500 organized sports teams.Saint Paul hosts a number of professional, semi-professional, and amateur sports teams. The Minnesota Wild play their home games in downtown Saint Paul's Xcel Energy Center, which opened in 2000. The Wild brought the NHL back to Minnesota for the first time since 1993, when the Minnesota North Stars left the state for Dallas, Texas. (The World Hockey Association's Minnesota Fighting Saints played in Saint Paul from 1972 to 1977.) Citing the history of hockey in the Twin Cities and teams at all levels, Sports Illustrated called Saint Paul the new Hockeytown U.S.A. in 2007.The Xcel Energy Center, a multipurpose entertainment and sports venue, can host concerts and accommodate nearly all sporting events. It occupies the site of the demolished Saint Paul Civic Center. The Xcel Energy Center hosts the Minnesota high school boys hockey tournament, the Minnesota high school girls' volleyball tournament, and concerts throughout the year. In 2004, it was named the best overall sports venue in the US by ESPN.\n\nThe St. Paul Saints is the city's independent league baseball team. There have been several different teams called the Saints over the years. Founded in 1884, they were shut down in 1961 after the Minnesota Twins moved to Bloomington. The St. Paul Saints were brought back in 1993 as an independent baseball team in the Northern League, moving to the American Association in 2006. Their home games are played at the open-air CHS Field in downtown's Lowertown Historic District. Four noted Major League All-Star baseball players are natives of Saint Paul: Hall of Fame outfielder Dave Winfield, Hall of Fame infielder Paul Molitor, Hall of Fame pitcher Jack Morris, and first baseman Joe Mauer. The all-black St. Paul Colored Gophers played four seasons in Saint Paul from 1907 to 1911.The St. Paul Twin Stars of the National Premier Soccer League play their home games at Macalester Stadium.

Minnesota's oldest athletic organization, the Minnesota Boat Club, resides in the Mississippi River on Raspberry Island. Saint Paul is also home to Circus Juventas, the largest circus arts school in North America.On March 25, 2015, Major League Soccer announced that it had awarded its 23rd MLS franchise to Minnesota United FC, a team from the lower-level North American Soccer League. Bill McGuire and his ownership group, which includes Jim Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, Glen Taylor of the Minnesota Timberwolves, former Minnesota Wild investor Glen Nelson, and his daughter Wendy Carlson Nelson of the Carlson hospitality company, had intended to build a privately financed soccer-specific stadium in Downtown Minneapolis near the Minneapolis Farmer's Market. But their plan was met with heavy opposition from former Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, who said her city was suffering from \"stadium fatigue\" after building three stadiums, for the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota Vikings and the Minnesota Golden Gophers, within a six-year span. On July 1, 2015, after failing to reach an agreement with the city of Minneapolis, McGuire and his partners turned their focus to Saint Paul.On October 23, 2015, Bill McGuire of Minnesota United FC and former Saint Paul Mayor Chris Coleman announced that a privately financed soccer-specific stadium would be built on the vacant Metro Transit bus barn site in Saint Paul's Midway neighborhood near the intersection of Snelling Avenue and University Avenue. It is midway between downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis. The stadium, Allianz Field, opened in April 2019 and seats 19,400. The team began playing in the MLS in 2017.On May 15, 2018, the Minnesota Whitecaps joined the National Women's Hockey League as their fifth franchise.

The mayor is the chief executive and chief administrative officer for the city and the seven-member city council is the legislative body. The mayor is elected by the entire city, while members of the city council are elected from seven different geographic wards of approximately equal population. Both the mayor and council members serve four-year terms. The current mayor is Melvin Carter (DFL), Saint Paul's first African-American mayor. Aside from Norm Coleman, who became a Republican during his second term, Saint Paul has not elected a Republican mayor since 1952.\n\nThe city is also the county seat of Ramsey County, named for Alexander Ramsey, the state's first governor. The county once spanned much of the present-day metropolitan area and was originally to be named Saint Paul County after the city. Today it is geographically the smallest county and the most densely populated. Ramsey is the only home rule county in Minnesota; the seven-member Board of Commissioners appoints a county manager whose office is in the combination city hall/county courthouse along with the Minnesota Second Judicial Courts. The nearby Law Enforcement Center houses the Ramsey County Sheriff's office.\n\n\n=== State and federal ===\n\nSaint Paul is the capital of the state of Minnesota. The city hosts the capitol building, designed by Saint Paul resident Cass Gilbert, and the House and Senate office buildings. The Minnesota Governor's Residence, which is used for some state functions, is on Summit Avenue. The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (affiliated with the Democratic Party) is headquartered in Saint Paul. Numerous state departments and services are also headquartered in Saint Paul, such as the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\nThe city is split into four Minnesota Senate districts (64, 65, 66 and 67) and eight Minnesota House of Representatives districts (64A, 64B, 65A, 65B, 66A, 66B, 67A and 67B), all of which are held by Democrats.Saint Paul is the heart of Minnesota's 4th congressional district, represented by Democrat Betty McCollum. The district has been in DFL hands without interruption since 1949. Minnesota is represented in the US Senate by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, a former Hennepin County Attorney, and Democrat Tina Smith, former Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota.\n\n*District also includes Falcon Heights, Lauderdale and Roseville.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nSaint Paul is second in the United States in the number of higher education institutions per capita, behind Boston. Higher education institutions that call Saint Paul home include three public and eight private colleges and universities and five post-secondary institutions. Well-known colleges and universities include the Saint Catherine University, Concordia University, Hamline University, Macalester College, and the University of St. Thomas. Metropolitan State University and Saint Paul College, which focus on non-traditional students, are based in Saint Paul, as well as a law school, Mitchell Hamline School of Law.The Saint Paul Public Schools district is the state's largest school district and serves approximately 39,000 students. The district is extremely diverse with students from families speaking 90 different languages, although only five languages are used for most school communication: English, Spanish, Hmong, Karen, and Somali. The district runs 82 different schools, including 52 elementary schools, twelve middle schools, seven high schools, ten alternative schools, and one special education school, employing over 6,500 teachers and staff. The school district also oversees community education programs for pre-K and adult learners, including Early Childhood Family Education, GED Diploma, language programs, and various learning opportunities for community members of all ages. In 2006, Saint Paul Public Schools celebrated its 150th anniversary. Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen by their families under Minnesota's open enrollment statute.A variety of K-12 private, parochial, and public charter schools are also represented in the city. In 1992, Saint Paul became the first city in the US to sponsor and open a charter school, now found in most states across the nation. Saint Paul is currently home to 21 charter schools as well as 38 private schools. The Saint Paul Public Library system includes a central library and twelve branch locations.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nResidents of Saint Paul can receive 10 broadcast television stations, five of which broadcast from within Saint Paul. One daily newspaper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, two weekly neighborhood newspapers, the East Side Review and City Pages (owned by The Star Tribune Company), and several monthly or semimonthly neighborhood papers serve the city. It was the only city in the United States with a population of 250,000 or more to see an increase in circulation of Sunday newspapers in 2007. Several media outlets based in neighboring Minneapolis also serve the Saint Paul community, including the Star Tribune. Saint Paul is home to Minnesota Public Radio, a three-format system that broadcasts on nearly 40 stations around the Midwest. MPR locally delivers news and information, classical, and The Current (which plays a wide variety of music). The station has 110,000 regional members and more than 800,000 listeners each week throughout the Upper Midwest, the largest audience of any regional public radio network. Also operating as part of American Public Media, MPR's programming reaches five million listeners, most notably through Live from Here, hosted by Chris Thile (previously known as A Prairie Home Companion, hosted by Garrison Keillor, who also lives in the city). The Fitzgerald Theater, renamed in 1994 for Saint Paul native and novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, is home to the show.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Interstate and roadways ===\n\nResidents use Interstate 35E running north\u2013south and Interstate 94 running east\u2013west. Trunk highways include U.S. Highway 52, Minnesota State Highway 280, and Minnesota State Highway 5. Saint Paul has several unique roads such as Ayd Mill Road, Phalen Boulevard and Shepard Road/Warner Road, which diagonally follow particular geographic features in the city. Biking is also gaining popularity, due to the creation of more paved bike lanes that connect to other bike routes throughout the metropolitan area and the creation of Nice Ride Minnesota, a seasonally operated nonprofit bicycle sharing and rental system that has over 1,550 bicycles and 170 stations in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Downtown Saint Paul has a five-mile (8 km) enclosed skyway system over twenty-five city blocks. The 563-mile (906 km) Avenue of the Saints connects Saint Paul with Saint Louis, Missouri.\nThe layout of city streets and roads has often drawn complaints. While he was Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and remarked that the streets were designed by \"drunken Irishmen\". He later apologized, though people had been complaining about the fractured grid system for more than a century by that point. Some of the city's road design is the result of the curve of the Mississippi River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate.\n\n\n=== Mass transit ===\n\nMetro Transit provides bus service and light rail in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area. The METRO Green Line is an 11-mile (18 km) light rail line that connects downtown Saint Paul to downtown Minneapolis with 14 stations in Saint Paul. The Green Line runs west along University Avenue, through the University of Minnesota campus, until it links up and then shares stations with the METRO Blue Line in downtown Minneapolis. Construction began in November 2010 and the line began service on June 14, 2014. Roughly 45,000 people rode on the first day; an average 28,000 riders are expected per day.Metro Transit opened the METRO A Line, Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul's first arterial bus rapid transit line, along Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway. The A Line connects the METRO Blue Line at 46th Street station to Rosedale Center with a connection at the Green Line Snelling Avenue station. The A Line is the first in a series of planned arterial bus rapid transit lines and is set to open in early 2016.\n\n\n=== Railroad ===\nAmtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops twice daily in each direction at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Depot. Ridership on the train increased about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. A Minnesota Department of Transportation study found that increased daily service to Chicago should be economically viable, especially if it originates in Saint Paul and does not experience delays from the rest of the western route of the Empire Builder. Saint Paul is the site of the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. There are several other small yards located around the city.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nHolman Airfield is across the river from downtown St Paul.  It is the location where Lamprey lake existed until it was filled in with dredgings by the Army Corps of Engineers starting in the early 1920's.  Northwest Airlines began initial operations from Holman in 1926.  During WWII Northwest had a contract to install upgraded radar systems in B-24s employing 5,000 at the airfield.  Post WWII Holman Airfield competed with the Speedway Field for the growing aviation industry in the twin cities and lost out in the end.  Today Holman is a reliever airport run by the Metropolitan Airports Commission. It is home to Minnesota's Air National Guard, a flight training school and is tailored to local corporate aviation. There are three runways, with the Holman Field Administration Building and Riverside Hangar on the National Register of Historic Places.  The historical importance of the Northwest Airlines original building was only realized after demolition had commenced.\nFor the most part Saint Paul's aviation needs are served by the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), which sits on 2,930 acres (11.9 km2) in the Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory bordering the city to the southwest. MPS serves three international, twelve domestic, seven charter, and four regional carriers and is a hub and home base for Delta Air Lines, Mesaba Airlines and Sun Country Airlines.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nSaint Paul has eight sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nWalter Abel (1898\u20131987), actor\nLoni Anderson (born 1946), actress\nLouie Anderson (born 1953), comedian\nWendell Anderson (1933\u20132016), US Senator\nRichard Arlen (1899\u20131976), actor\nRoger Awsumb (1928-2002), TV show host \"Casey Jones\"\nHarry Blackmun (1908\u20131999), US Supreme Court Associate Justice, grew up in St. Paul\nWinfield S.

          "There were no tours given on Saturday morning so we did our own with the kids. Absolutely beautiful and worth taking 30+ minutes to gander. After sightseeing, we went in the basement and purchased a few souvenirs. The woman working on October 6 morning was a delight and very",
          "This is an amazing church! Built in the style of many old European churches, it has a number of side altars and an enormous pipe organ. The pew where President Kennedy sat when he visited St. Paul as a candidate is marked - maybe it's only meaningful to the older generations,",
          "This is not just for 'Church'. Lots of History here. The tours are worth it. If you plan to go to Christmas Eve Mass get there at least a half hour early to find a parking spot.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral live nothing I've seen outside of Italy. It would be easy to spend hours looking at the magnificent architecture and statuary. I can not wait to go back to spend more time viewing the treasures within.",

          "Lived here for several years and never visited the Cathedral. Wow was I impressed! Was so much like a European Cathedral and so grand!",
          "My visit to the Cathedral of St. Paul was an architectural, historical and spiritual wonder. The history of the cathedral in the St. Paul landscape is an amazing story that St. Paul and Minnesota natives may want to add to their historical heritage.",
          "This Cathedral looms above St Paul and quietly invited you to come in. We parked on the street near the parking lot and went in the side door. The reception desk is just around the corner. Donations are gratefully received to help preserve this beautiful and historic structure.",
          "This beautiful cathedral is worth visiting. It is a truly magnificent building and represents church architecture that is rarely built today. One usually has to go to Europe to see something of this size and beauty.",
          "I had limited time to wander around the cathedral, but it is beautiful. Worth popping in to. The stained glass and the dome are amazing.",
          "We enjoyed the whole tour and the refurbished spaces. We especially enjoyed the Native American treaty painings in their new \"museum\" location, explaining the whitemen's deception. Thanks.",
          "This cathedral matches any cathedral I've visited anywhere in the world. It is huge with a great alter. Enjoyed visiting. Highly recommend. Rating... excellent",
          "My wife had this on her list to see in St. Paul, Minnesota. So glad we went! This church is absolutely beautiful. The church sits on a hill above the city and the view is incredible. The building is very ornate with amazing detail and the inside is even better. The stained",
          "I've visited many cathedrals in different countries over the years, and I dropped in on Saint Paul to see how it stood up to others. Surprisingly for such an ornate and impressive looking building, it's relatively new - late 19th C, You can wander at your leisure, but there",
          "Definitely worth the stop. Free to enter, we did a self guided tour. The sanctuary is huge and has gorgeous stained glass! There is an option to download a audio version to use with your phone and headphones but we didn't have ours with us. We went on a Friday morning, hardly",
          "I visited the cathedral for Saturday evening mass. It\u2019s a very imposing building, easily visible from quite far away. There is a good amount of parking nearby. Inside it\u2019s very grand, with lovely stained glass windows and marble. The mass was very welcoming (and less than 45",
          "What a beautiful church. It felt warm and inviting, the stained glass windows were stunning, as was the pipe organ. The outside is beautiful also, with a large bronze cross on the top. Worth a visit.",
          "We visited the Church and attended the Saturday Evening Mass. The Church is beautiful with a lot to explore, if time allows. Parking near the church is available. We were glad we took the time to visit and find out more about this cathedral.",
          "Saw this building from several black away and was drawn to it. The architecture is so inspiring and the scale is unbelievable until you see it up close.",
          "Beautiful church. The details are amazing. It\u2019s pretty quite inside. We parked in the parking lot and just walked over to the church. My friend and I also walked over to the state capital which was just a mile away. Remember to wear a hat and bring some water if you decide to",
          "We loved the architecture of the Cathedral of Saint Paul and found the structure to be very interesting and beautiful -- a magnificent building! Parking is easy in a lot across the street. We did find a special, unplanned service taking place when we arrived, so we enjoyed the",
          "It was late when we got there, but the architecture was beautiful and the stained glass windows gorgeous. Grounds were pretty. Next time we are over there, we will make a point of going in.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral, with a stunning interior and lovely views out onto downtown St Paul and Capitol building. There is limited on-street parking but this is a relatively quiet attraction anyway so this should not be a major issue. It is well worth the visit if you",
          "The stained glass windows and marble columns are magnificent. The altar is stunning. Walk around behind the altar to see the statues of the saints from several countries. Incredible architecture. Rivals any church I've seen in Europe. Walk around the grounds to see the",
          "This is a must see. The cathedral sits on a hilltop overlooking the city and capitol. It is a magnificent piece of architecture. We rode bikes all over the city and made a stop here. The view is fabulous from the front steps as well.",
          "Walking into this Cathedral reminds me of being in Europe. It is that beautiful. I moved to the area 20 years ago and had never stepped foot in the building. My Mom came to visit and I took her there and I really wish I had been visiting this magnificent piece of architecture",
          "Visiting the Cathedral of St. Paul is like traveling to one of the great cathedrals of Europe. Stunning architecture and amazing attention to detailed sculptures and carvings. Beautiful acoustics so make sure and hear a choir or organ performing in this sacred spot.",

          "This is an incredible cathedral full of gorgeous artwork and statues. If you love the old Gothic cathedrals, you will love this place.",
          "We took the public bus within a block of the front door. A very beautiful exterior and the atmosphere inside was very reverent. Several alcoves allow you to pray in private while the main altar defies description. The lower level houses the museum - check the website for tours",
          "Facts: It is a beautiful church. Lovely architecture- a tour might be worth it. Even though we arrived 10 minutes before mass, no one welcomed us (or even acknowledged us). I suppose it is just supposed to be a museum?",
          "The architecture is worth visit regardless of your religious persuasion. A beautiful location. For those of the Catholic faith, it should be on your MUST list when you come to the Twin Cities",
          "The Cathedral of St. Paul is a beautiful worship space set on a hill overlooking St. Paul, Minnesota. The state capitol building is in sight. Gives off a sense of majesty as you approach. Inside is huge and includes beautiful artwork including sculptures and stained glass",
          "My husband and I visited this purely accidentally, we saw it while driving through St. Paul and decided to stop and see if we could look around. The intricate designs and details throughout were breathtaking. Our pictures did not do the beauty justice! There is a welcoming",
          "I think I've been to the Cathedral a 1000 times or so - and it never disappoints. This time I went on a guided tour - and the whole place came alive in a completely different way. Just by way of example - I learned that the statue of St. Paul at the back of the church is a",
          "reminds me of some of the cathedrals I've seen in Europe and St. Louis, MO. The acoustics are much better than the cathedral in St. Louis. They do have a brochure with guided audio via your phone through the tour, but we didn't do that and just went on a self tour. I wish we",
          "I happened to see this while driving by the Capitol Building which is a MUST see! This cathedral is so beautiful! Parking on the side of the building on the street or a parking lot behind! Go say a little prayer!",
          "With only a short history, what better idea than to imitate the style of much older European cathedrals in order to produce an aura of ancient wisdom. The cathedral carries this off well, with everything very tastefully done. The interior is actually beautiful but not in a",

          "When in the Twin Cities the Cathedral is a must to visit along with the James J. Hill house, home of The empire builder ( Great Northern Railway) views inside the Cathedral are breathtaking. The Hill house is kitty corner from the church on Summit Avenue.",
          "Striking structure to rival most European cathedrals. Free entry to tour the interior. Photographs of predecessors and construction of current structure are downstairs, even a Lego reproduction. Nice break from walking, just to sit and admire the architecture and stained",
          "Beautiful place to stop and see. While you there drive around the neighborhood and look at all the great architecture.",

          "This Cathedral is probably one of the most beautiful in the United States, inside and out. It is not always open, but there is a museum at the lower level of the building that explains how the Cathedral came about and was built. One cannot go to St. Paul without paying it a",
          "A beautiful church in downtown St. Paul. Definitely worth a visit. Stained glass windows were very impressive. Worth the trip.",
          "Went here for mass. We came early, so we could walk around and explore. Loved it. The view of the city from this property alone is worth the visit!",
          "This very large cathedral whose namesake for the Apostle, St. Paul is fitting that it is located in Minnesota's Capital of St. Paul. I did not go in, due to the fact, parking spaces were all taken on a Sunday. I imagine the inside would have been stunning to see, since the",
          "Absolutely gorgeous church. You can take pictures as long as a service isn\u2019t in session. I missed the museum at the bottom but exploring the church is well worth the trip.",
          "Services always have great music and homily by the priest. We have been there for mass as well as confirmation services. The building is absolutely beautiful! The only thing that they need more of is bathrooms (for women) during large services like confirmation.",
          "I'm Catholic, so I visit often for Mass, but even if I wasn't, it's a lovely monument to history and architecture. The liturgy is beautiful, Confessions are offered often, and the art and architecture are among the best in St. Paul. The only drawback is that the big stone",
          "An architectural gem. I have visited Cathederals throughout Europe and the Americas, this one has its own special place and is among the very best.",

          "Visiting St Paul, a stop at the Catherdral is a must. Enjoy the architecture on both the outside and inside, stay and experience a service at this cathedral. A unique experience every visitor shpuld have. Words cannot adequately describe this personal experience, go and see for",
          "Wow, we could see the Cathedral from the other side of the city, it sits on top of a hill and was easy to find. Parking was no problem and we walked right in, it's so beautiful inside and out. So happy we were able to visit this outstanding Cathedral.",
          "This building is immense! We came around the street corner, looked up and went \u201cWOW\u201d! There\u2019s a nice parking lot for visitors next door (which we found by accident). Inside, the stained glass is amazing as are the statues. I\u2019m not a big Catholic church fan, but the cathedral is",
          "If you love to visit European Cathedrals, you will love our own Cathedral of Saint Paul. It is magnificent! Not only is the building a wonderful piece of architecture, but if you want a real Catholic (and I mean that in the best sense) church experience, attend Mass. I have",
          "One of the most stunning cathedrals in America! Don't miss the hall of saints behind the altar. Each immigrant group that helped build the cathedral has a statue of their patron saint back there. And a slab of their homeland's marble is cobbled into the floor in front of their",
          "I\u2019m widely traveled and have hit most of the great cathedrals in the world or at least in Europe. The interior of this one is up there and worth a visit whether you need to walk or Uber. Gorgeous.",
          "After visiting cathedrals in Europe, I decided to visit the one where I live. It is awe inspiring. The chapels are especially interesting. When visiting St Paul, this is a must see.",
          "St. Paul's Cathedral is a must see if you like grand architecture and ornaments however we were very disappointed that the Thursday tour had been canceled when we got there without any services taking place. When they advertise guided tours only on Thursday at 1:00 you expect it",
          "This cathedral is amazing. It was the most beautiful Catholic Church I have seen. The individual chapels off to the 4 corners. Beautiful and worth the visit.",
          "As a cathedral it is very nice. We were there for a Vocal Essence Concert. The acoustics for this type of concert are really horrible. The text and the sound all turn to mush. The piano accompaniment on a new piece could not be heard as again the sound bounced together so much",
          "A beautiful cathedral and a must to see when in the Twin Cities. A gem. Try to stay for a service. Simple beautiful!",
          "This cathedral is beautiful and well worth the visit. While it doesn't have the overdone ornate decor found in most European cathedrals, it is light and bright and welcoming. Take time to visit the small museum in the basement and learn about the history of the cathedral - the",
          "We attended a service here on Sunday. We are Protestant so the perspective may be colored. The service was very nice and the homily was good. The people made us feel welcome. The structure is breathtakingly beautiful. It is reminiscent of the cathedrals in Europe, possibly",
          "Even a weekday Mass was wonderful. The location allows it to be seen from all around St. Paul and looks astounding.",

          "This gorgeous Cathedral is challenging to reach on a icy day, but well worth the effort. A truly beautiful place.",
          "We walked up from the Saint Paul Hotel on a cold clear day. The cathedral is set on a hill. The sky was clear blue and there was snow on the ground. Picture perfect. Inside is very special. It is a beautiful cathedral. We lit a candle at the statue of the Sacred Heart in memory",

          "What an amazing cathedral, so large so beautiful and awe inspiring. There is so much detail to see & the 6 chapels each have their own uniqueness, if you pay attention. It is absolutely worth stopping in for a visit, a must do in St. Paul.",
          "It's wonderful they allow visitors so much freedom to walk around and take in the majesty of the building. My only complaint is that it wasn't very clear how/where to buy the matches to light the prayer candles.",
          "We were very pleasantly surprised by this visit. The building is beautiful and rivals other cathedrals in the US and Europe. The weekday tour should be fascinating (1:00 M-Th I believe). We were disappointed that we didn't have time to visit the adjacent James J. Hill House.",
          "This is a special landmark in St. Paul. It is a really lovely work of artistic beauty. If you haven't been inside it's well worth the trip!",
          "It is amazing how they were able to build cathedral's such as this. You walk in and are instantly in awe. The size of it is just astounding, as well as the intricacy and detailed work. I definitely recommend visiting it, even if you are not religious.",
          "The Saint Paul Cathedral espectacular. It is very Majestic and compelling. Nothing else like it around. Absolutely worth stopping in or even if you have the chance to attend a service. You would never expect something so beautiful. E-Z Parking. Location on top of the hill gives",

          "Driving through St. Paul we looked up attractions on Trip Advisor. We were surprised to see it ranked number 1. We have visited many churches all over the world and St. Paul measures up with any cathedral we have seen. Do not miss an opportunity to visit if in the area.",
          "Visited this the end of 2016. An art class for high schoolers (I think) was there and I appreciated an education art course involving a building with such stark and well-made architecture. There is a small museum/history room in the basement with the history of the building",

          "If you are in the ST. Paul area this Cathedral is one of the most beautiful in the United States. Amazing that is was build in the early 1900's. Pew near the front right side with plaque noting RFK attendance.",
          "Cathedral of Saint Paul is absolutely beautiful and right up there with many impressive cathedrals in Europe. I was very surprised by the size of the interior. It's magnificent, huge and yet warm and peaceful. I love cathedrals and stop in as many as possible. My husband was",
          "I've spent many hours over the years in this charming old church. Beautiful ongoing restoration keeps it's historic integrity. Growing up in St.Paul I attended weddings, graduations and solemn times of prayer and worship. Miss this beautiful sanctuary.",
          "Note that the walk up the hill to the cathedral is a bid meandering and traffic can be heavy because of the interstate highways converging nearby, but once you get there, you don't even need to go inside--on a clear day, every shot is like a postcard.",
          "WOW we were so impressed with this Cathedral. We have visited amazing churches in Poland, Lithuania, Germany, Great Britain,and here in the USA but this one really stands out! When you walk in you feel a great sense of warmth. It was only 30 degrees outside when we visited but",
          "This cathedral is one of the most beautiful I have seen outside of Europe, and is similar to some I have seen in Europe. Although not as impressive as the European cathedrals, this is probably as close as you will get in the United States. Another cool thing about this place",

          "We just so happened to see the Cathedral while driving and had to find it. Little did we know what it was or that the doors were open and tours were being given! We missed the start of the tour with the guide but we were able to walk on our own. This Cathedral is beautiful.",
          "My husband and I rode the green line from downtown Minneapolis to Saint Paul on the Metro Transit. We got off at Capitol/Rice Station. We walked over to the Capitol. It is also close by to the Cathedral and the Saint Paul skyline. Order your Visitor passes and Go-To cards",
          "We walked up the river, over the river and up, up, up the hill to see the Cathedral. None of us 6 women had ever seen it before. We went inside... absolutely gorgeous! HUGE! Saw the duplicate \u201cPieta\u201d, I have seen the original at St.Peters in The Vatican/Rome. I am sure attending",
          "We couldn't believe the beauty! We were floored to discover that it was only built around 1915. It does compare to churches we have seen in Europe.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral, on par with those in Europe, and not what we expected to see in a US city. The location on a hill above St. Paul gives a commanding view of the city. It is refreshing to see that it is an active, living church rather than just a beautiful structure",
          "Our time at the Cathedral of St. Paul was like going through a sacred museum of art and history. Having been at the Vatican I enjoyed knowing this was built in a similar style to the Vatican. Beautiful marble and stained glass windows with amazing symbolism portrayed in each",

          "I had seen the outside of the Cathedral many years ago when I visited St. Paul. I stopped to look inside as I had extra time on this trip. It was cloudy, gray and drizzling that day. Inside was filled with the glory of celebrating God in the architecture, stained glass,",
          "The first view was from blocks away and it was a beautiful sight. We walked around the city and the Cathedral was high on a hill.As we walked up we first passed the old trolley tunnel which has been closed for years but is still visible. The outside of the building is so ornate",
          "A beautiful cathedral situated on Cathedral Hill. The architecture , both the exterior and interior is beautiful. The stained glass windows are out of the world. Visitors are allowed to move around even when mass is in progress.",
          "I was in the cathedral on the 28th of September 2017 for the funeral of my late brother who lived in Saint Paul for the last 30 years. The Cathedral is most impressive from the outside but even more so inside.The light from the stain glass windows and from the dome is stunning",

          "This is one of the most beautiful cathedrals I've seen. There is a church parking lot to the left of the cathedral, or you can park on the street. The arbor over the altar is like the one in St Peter's Basilica in Rome, which is over St Peter's crypt.The statues of the apostles",
          "I'm alway appreciative of church architecture. The Cathedral of St. Paul was inspiring. Grand, beautiful and peaceful. We had just a few hours to wander around the area, the cathedral perched on the hill created a great destination. There is plenty to see and wander a bit. I",

      "name": "Historic Fort Snelling",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Fort Saint Anthony was renamed Fort Snelling once its construction was completed in 1825.  It is a former  United States Army fortification that was designated a Military Reservation on the bluffs overlooking the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers.  That designation placed fort lands outside territorial administration or jurisdiction.   Over time the location was part of the Louisiana Purchase and was included in the Missouri Territory.  When Missouri became a state in 1812 the land not included became an Unorganized Territory which included Minnesota west of the Mississippi.  When the Wisconsin Territory was formed Minnesota and Fort Snelling were included in the new Territory. When Wisconsin gained statehood in 1848 the Minnesota Territory was formed. By an Act of Congress the Military Reservation was reduced in size on 26 August 1852.  It was again reduced on 4 January 1871.  Today, the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area a National Park Service unit, includes historic Fort Snelling as well as other portions of old fort lands as part of their operations.\nThe fort is located within Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory that is bordered by Hennepin,  Ramsey and Dakota Counties. The Minnesota Historical Society administers the historic Fort. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources administers Fort Snelling State Park at the bottom of the bluff. Fort Snelling once encompassed the Park's land.  It has been designated as a National Historic Landmark and cited as a \"National Treasure\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Bd\u00f3te ===\nIn 1805, on half of the United States, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike made the  Treaty of St Peters 1805 with the Dakota people for 100,000 acres (400 km\u00b2) of land in the area. Part of the treaty were two nine square miles military  Reservations at the confluence of the St. Croix and Mississippi rivers, and  at Bd\u00f3te, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. Bd\u00f3te (\"where 2 rivers meet\") is considered the \"center of the earth\" to the Mdewakanton Dakota. It was a place of importance where Native Americans would sign  more treaties once Fort Snelling was built:  the St. Peter's Treaty \n1837 and the  St.Peter's Treaty 1851 also known as the Treaty of Mendota.  Significant Anglo-European settlement began in the late 1810s. Following the War of 1812, the United States Department of War built a chain of forts and installed Indian agents from Lake Michigan to the Missouri River in South Dakota.  These forts were primarily intended to prevent trade and possible territorial claims from Canadian and British in northwest territories.Lieutenant Colonel Henry Leavenworth commanded the 5th Infantry Regiment (United States) that built the initial outpost in 1819.  That Cantonment was called New Hope and was on the river flats along the Minnesota river.  However, Col. Leavenworth moved the soldiers to a more hospitable site, Camp Coldwater.  It was by a spring on the bluff closer to the construction site of Fort St. Anthony he had started. The spring there would be the source of drinking water to the fort throughout the 19th century.  The spring held a special significance to the Sioux that lived in Minnesota.  The post surgeon began recording meteorological observations at Fort Saint Anthony in January 1820, beginning one of the longest near-continuous weather records in the country.  In 1820 Colonel Josiah Snelling took command of the outpost and the fort's construction.   Upon completion in 1824 he christened his work Fort St. Anthony for the waterfalls just upriver.  That did not last long as it was changed by General Winfield Scott to Fort Snelling in recognition of the fort's architect commander.\nFrom construction in 1820 to closure in 1858 three Army units would garrison the fort, the 1st, 5th and 10th Regiments.  Garrison size varied from 80-300 men.\n\n\n=== Frontier post ===\n\nThe Army at the northwestern frontier outposts tried: to restrict commercial use of the rivers to United States citizens (after the War of 1812 the US banned British-Canadian traders from operating in the US), keep Indian lands free of white settlement until permitted by treaties, enforce law and order, and protect legitimate travelers and traders.  At Fort Snelling, the garrison also attempted to keep the peace among the Dakota people.  Also built on Army land was the St. Peter's Indian Agency.  The Anglo-Euorpeans called the Minnesta River the St. Peter and the Indian Agency would a part of Fort Snelling from 1820-53.\nColonel Snelling suffered from chronic dysentery, and bouts of the illness made him susceptible to anger.  Recalled to Washington, he left Fort Snelling in September 1827.  Colonel Snelling died in summer 1828 from complications due to dysentery and a \"brain fever\".\nJohn Marsh, a native of Danvers, Massachusetts, came to the fort during the early 1820s. There, he set up the first school in the Northwest Territory, \nfor the children of the officers.  He developed a good relationship with the local Dakota people. He compiled a dictionary for the Dakota language. He had studied medicine at Harvard for two years before leaving without earning a degree. He continued his medical studies under the tutelage of the Fort's physician, Dr. Purcell. The physician died before Marsh completed the two-year course, so he still had no medical degree. \nMarsh eventually went west to California.\nIn 1830 Fort Snelling was the birthplace of John Taylor Wood. He served on the Merrimack at the Battle of Hampton Roads during the civil war.  In 1840 the fort commander sent troops to shut down and evict Pigs-eye Parrant from his Fountain Cave establishment south of the fort.  His commercial venture was the first in what would become St Paul and was notorious for his trading of alcohol to both the natives and fort's garrison.   The eviction coincided with the arrival of the catholic missionary Lucian Galtier who would rename Pigs Eye settlement St. Paul.  Another event on 1840 was the arrival of Pierre Bottineau, the Kit Carson of the Northwest. He staked a claim in St.Paul, but would serve officers of the fort as a guide and interpreter.  He could speak French and English, Sioux, Chippewa, Cree, Mandan and Winnebago.Career army officer and artist Lieutenant Colonel Seth Eastman did two tours at Fort Snelling. He commanded the fort during the second in the 1840s. He completed many paintings and drawings of the Dakota while there, recording their customs and lives. He was commissioned by Congress to illustrate the six-volume study of Indian Tribes of the United States by Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, which was published 1851-1857 with hundreds of his works.\n\nAs the towns of Minneapolis and St. Paul grew and with Minnesota Statehood before congress, the need for a forward frontier military post had ceased.  In 1857, with the Fort's deactivation looming, the garrison was sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas to join the other units being sent to Utah for what became known as the Utah War.  With the departure of the 10th Infantry,  Fort Snelling was designated surplus government property.  In 1858, when Minnesota became a state, the Army sold it to Franklin Steele for $90,000.  Steele was a former sutler of the fort and friend of the sitting President, James Buchanan.  At that time the fort sat on 8000 acres (32 km\u00b2).  A small portion of that land was later annexed into south Minneapolis.)  The balance of that original land is now broken into: Historic Fort Snelling interpretive  center (300 acres), Fort Snelling State Park(2,931 acres), Fort Snelling National Cemetery(436 acres), Fort Snelling VA Hospital(160 acres), Minnesota Veterans Home(53 acres), Coldwater Spring National \nPark(29 acres), the  Upper Post Veterans Home, Minneapolis St Paul International Airport and the Minneapolis-St Paul Joint Air Reserve Station(2,930 acres).\n\n\n=== Slavery at the Fort ===\nWhen Fort Snelling was built in 1820, fur traders and officers at the post, including Colonel Snelling, used slave labor for cooking, cleaning, and other domestic chores. Although slavery was a violation of both the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and the Missouri Compromise of 1820, an estimated 15 - 30 enslaved Africans worked at the Fort. US Army officers submitted pay vouchers and to cover the expenses of retaining enslaved workers. From 1855 - 1857, nine individuals were enslaved at Fort Snelling. The last slave-holding unit, the  10th Infantry Regiment (United States), was transferred to Utah in 1857. Slavery was constitutionally  outlawed when Minnesota became a state in 1858. Two enslaved women that had lived at the Fort sued for their freedom and were set free in 1836.  One, named Rachel, was a slaved to a Lieutenant Thomas Stockton at Fort Snelling from 1830 - 1831, then at Fort Crawford at Prairie du Chien until 1834. When Rachel and her son were sold in St. Louis, she sued claiming that she had been illegally enslaved in the Minnesota Territory. The Missouri Supreme Court ruled in her favor in 1836 and she was freed. At this ruling, another enslaved woman named Courtney and her son William, who were sold by a fur trader named Alexis Bailly in St. Louis in 1834, were also freed.Army Surgeon Dr. John Emerson purchased the slave Dred Scott in Saint Louis, Missouri, a slave state. He was stationed at Fort Snelling during much of the 1830s, having brought Dred and his wife Harriet with him. Dred and Harriet were slaves at Fort Snelling from 1836 - 1840. Dr. Emerson's  wife, Irene returned to St. Louis taking the Scotts and their children in 1840.  In 1843 Dred sued for his family's freedom for illegally being indentured in free territory.  Although he lost that first trial, he appealed and in 1850 his family was given their freedom.  In 1852, Emerson appealed and the Scotts were again enslaved.  Dred Scott appealed that decision and in 1857 the US Supreme Court decided that the Scotts would stay enslaved. Dred Scott v. Sandford  was a landmark case that held that neither enslaved nor free Africans were meant to hold the privileges or constitutional rights of United Stated Citizens. This case garnered national attention and pushed political tensions towards the Civil War. A longstanding precedent in freedom suits of \"once free, always free\" was overturned in this case. (The cases were combined under Dred Scott's name.) It was appealed to the United States Supreme court. In Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857), Chief Justice Taney ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional and that Africans had no standing under the constitution, so could not sue for freedom. The decision increased sectional tensions between the North and South.\n\n\n=== Civil War ===\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Franklin Steele leased Fort Snelling back to the War Department for use as an induction station.  When Governor Ramsey offered President Lincoln 1000 troops to fight the south the volunteers he got were organized at Fort Snelling into a Regiment, the 1st Minnesota.  More than 24,000 recruits were trained there.Minnesota units mustered in at Fort Snelling:\n\n1st Minnesota April 1861\n2nd Minnesota June-July 1861\n3rd Minnesota Oct-Nov 1861\n4th Minnesota Oct-Nov 1861\n5th Minnesota Mar-Apr 1862\n6th Minnesota Sep-Nov 1862\n7th Minnesota Aug-Oct 1862\n8th Minnesota Jun-Sep 1862\n9th Minnesota Aug-Oct 1862\n10th Minnesota Aug-Nov 1862\n11th Minnesota Aug-Sep 1864\n1st Minnesota Infantry Battalion Aug-Sep 1864\n1st Minnesota Sharpshooters Company Apr 1864\n2nd Minnesota Sharpshooters Company Jan 1862\n1st Minnesota Heavy Nov 1864\n1st Minnesota Light Artillery Battery Nov 1861\n2nd Minnesota Light Artillery Battery Mar 1862\n3rd Minnesota Light Artillery Battery Feb 1863\n1st Minnesota Cavalry Oct-Dec 1862\n2nd Minnesota Cavalry Regiment Dec 1863\n1st Minnesota Light Cavalry(Bracket's Battalion) Sep-Nov 1861\nMinnesota Independent Cavalry Battalion (Hatch's Battalion) Jul 1863\n\n\n=== Dakota War ===\nDuring the Dakota War of 1862, the Army created an internment camp below the fort on Pike Island for 1,658  Dakota women, children, and elders. They winter there in 1862\u201363. Hundreds died due to the harsh conditions, lack of food, measles and cholera. The following year, the Dakota that survived were loaded on two steamboats in May and taken down the Mississippi and up the Missouri River to  Crow Creek in the Great Sioux Reservation.  Three hundred more died on the way. Those that made it to Crow Creek were forced to move again three years later to the Santee Sioux Reservation in Nebraska.  For the woman it was an extended period of hardship and degradation.  The descendants of the displaced Dakota reside there today. A memorial to their ancestors is located on the river flats outside of the Fort Snelling State Park visitor center commemorating all the Santee Souix that died during this period.   With the non-combatant Sioux removed, Pike island remained a holding facility for the remainder of the war for those Dakota males that managed to turn themselves in without getting killed.  Governor Ramsey had placed a $25.00/scalpe bounty on Dakota males.   His successor Henry A. Swift raised it to $200.00.  Because of the prevailing attitudes towards all \"Indians\" the Ho-Chunk aka Winnebago that were living outside Mankato were also sent to Fort Snelling.   There, they too were put on riverboats for Crow creek.  They lost 500 along the way and once there they and the Sioux would lose another 1,300 to starvation.\n\n\n=== Indian and Spanish American Wars ===\nAfter the Civil war, Steele leased the land around Fort Snelling to settlers, and Minneapolis began to expand into the fort's surroundings.  Steele had made plans and plotted his purchase to build the City of Fort Snelling.  That changed when the Army purchased the fort land back.  The fort became the Hq for the U.S. Army's Department of Dakota in its campaign against the Souix and Blackfoot nations.\nThe United States Army assigned the 3rd Infantry to garrison the Fort from 1877-1898. The fort dispatched troops to protect the interests of European-American pioneers on the frontier from the Dakota people, westward to the Rocky Mountains.  Besides the Indian Wars soldiers from the garrison fought in the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898.  From 1882 until 1888 several Companies of buffalo soldiers from the 25th Infantry were garrisoned at the fort. During one of the last battles of the Indian Wars, six soldiers of the 3rd Infantry from the Fort were killed at the Battle of Leech Lake October 5, 1898. Those killed were Major Wilkinson, Sgt. William Butler, Privates: Edward Lowe, John Olmstead(Onstead),  John Schwolenstocker (aka Daniel F. Schwalenstocker), and Albert Ziebel. The soldiers were buried at Northern end of the Post Ft Snelling Minn.  Ten other soldiers were wounded in the battle. Among them were five Minnesotans, Privates; George R. Wicker, Charles M. Turner, Edward Brown, Jes S. Jensen, and Gottfried Ziegler. \n\n\n=== WWI ===\nOnce the United States entered the war the fort became a recruit processing station.  The Army established an officer training school which closed when the war ended.  At that time the only building seeing use was the base hospital.  It was expanded to 1200 beds and designated  General Hospital 29.  During the 1918 influenza pandemic it saw extensive use.  That hospital would be the forerunner to the VA Hospital at Fort Snelling now.  Between wars, as a duty station, Fort Snelling was considered the \"Country Club of the U. S. Army.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nDuring WWII the fort and its environs serviced both the Army and the Navy.  The Army had an enlistment center there again that the processed 300,000 enlistees.   The War Department chose the base to be the site of the Military Intelligence Service Language School for Japanese language instruction. The Army had a winter warfare school at the fort. The War Department constructed scores of buildings at the Fort for housing and teaching during the war. The Language school was relocated to Monterey, California, in June 1946.\nIn 1943 the Navy opened a Naval  Air Station on the north side of  Minneapolis St Paul airport that existed until 1970.  Those facilities are now used by reserve units and Minnesota Air National Guard.  WWII facilities covered 1,521 acres at wars end.\n\n\n=== Prologue ===\nThe War Department decommissioned Fort Snelling a second time on 14 October 1946.  Various federal agencies were allowed to request land parcels from the land that made up Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory.  Since the Army \ndeparted, the majority of the structures fell into disrepair. In 1960, the fort itself was listed as a National Historic Landmark, citing its importance as the first major military post in the region, and its later history in the development of the United States Army.Many acres of fort land have been lost to roads.  Construction of the Mendota Bridge ran a State highway across old fort land.  More fort land was lost when an Interstate 94 interchange was added as well as access roads to the International Airport, National Cemetery, VA Hospital and bridge into St. Paul.\nIn 1963 Fort Snelling became headquarters of United States Army Reserve 205th Infantry Brigade, that had units throughout the Upper Midwest.  In 1994 that ended as a part of force-structure eliminations. \n\nThe fort has been reconstructed to replicate its original appearance starting in 1965.  Time and use had been hard on the original fort.  The walls, barracks and buildings had been removed There was archaeological work done at the site in 1957-8 and again in 1966-7.  At that time all that remained from the original fort were the round  and hexagon towers.  State archaeologists located the foundations of all that had been demolished allowing them to pin point the structures they reconstructed. The Minnesota Historical Society has  since made the original walled fort or \"Lower Post\" into an interactive interpretive center. It is staffed from spring to early fall with personnel attired for re-enacting early post life.  Although restoring the original fort assures its survival, many buildings constructed from the Indian Wars to WWII and known as the \"Upper Post\" have fallen into serious disrepair and neglect.  In May 2006, the National Trust for Historic Preservation added Upper Post of Fort Snelling to its list of \"America's Most Endangered Places\".  Some restoration on historic Fort Snelling continues. Crews removed the flagpole from the iconic round tower and installed it in the ground, a change since its opening as a historic fort.  Pending funding, the historic fort has planned a massive renovation project for the year 2020. \nThe United States Navy named an amphibious warfare ship, the USS Fort Snelling (LSD-30), to honor the fort.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nArmy on the Frontier\nLawrence Taliaferro\nList of National Historic Landmarks in Minnesota\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Hennepin County, Minnesota\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Other sources ==\nWinstead, Tim (2009). \"John Taylor Wood: Man of Action, Man of Honor\".

      "name": "Minnesota State Capitol",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Minnesota State Capitol is the seat of government for the U.S. state of Minnesota, in its capital city of Saint Paul.  It houses the Minnesota Senate, Minnesota House of Representatives, the office of the Attorney General and the office of the Governor. The building also includes a chamber for the Minnesota Supreme Court, although court activities usually take place in the neighboring Minnesota Judicial Center.\nThe building is set in a landscaped campus.  Various monuments are to its sides and front.  Behind, a bridge spans University Avenue, and in front others were later added over the sunken roadway of Interstate 94, thus preserving the sight lines. Set near the crest of a hill, from the Capitol steps a panoramic view of downtown Saint Paul is presented.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe building was built by Butler-Ryan Construction and designed by Cass Gilbert and modeled after the larger Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. The dome is the largest unsupported marble dome in the world, as Saint Peter's is made of concrete. However, like all capitols with domes in the US it is also inspired by the idea of domed capitols originating with the United States Capitol dome. Work began on the capitol in 1896, its corner-stone laid July 27, 1898, and construction was completed in 1905. It is the third building to serve this purpose: the first capitol was destroyed by fire in 1881, and the second was completed in 1883, but was considered to be too small almost immediately.\nAbove the southern entrance to the building is a gilded quadriga called The Progress of the State which was sculpted by Daniel Chester French and Edward Clark Potter. It was completed and raised to the roof of the capitol in 1906. The four horses represent the power of nature: earth, wind, fire and water. The women leading the horses symbolize civilization, and the man on the chariot represents prosperity. In 1994 and 1995, the statues underwent a restoration procedure which included replacing the gold leaf on the figures. A sphere perched above the capitol dome had similar treatment.\nAny classical dome built since Michelangelo's must expect to be compared to it, and Gilbert's dome is a frank homage, with interesting differences. His drawings show that he originally planned a wider drum and, correspondingly, a more massive dome. The smaller dome as built is smaller than St. Peter's and has a simplified design: single columns round the upper lantern instead of double ones, for instance. The ribs on the capitol dome are less pronounced than those on St. Peter's, but they are still visually apparent. Gilbert knew that St. Peter's dome was on the edge of being unstable: it had cracked and had to be reinforced. His engineer for this project, Gunvald Aus, bound the brick dome in reinforcing steel bands, and Gilbert crowned the paired columns round the drum (which act as buttresses to counter the dome's weight) with additional stone. Other than St. Peter's, additional buildings with marble domes include the Taj Mahal in India, and the Rhode Island State House in the city of Providence.\n\nThe central block under the dome needed three entrances, and Gilbert avoided creating visual references to a triumphal arch, which would have been inappropriate in its position. Equally, he managed to avoid any reference to a palace block that would have been offensive to Minnesotans. However, Gilbert drew ire for choosing stone from Georgia rather than native Minnesota stone. A compromise was eventually made where the base of the building and interior spaces used varieties of native stone, including Kasota stone, and the rare Minnesota Pipestone used by Native Americans for their peace pipes. Upon completion, the exterior and interior of the building drew praise, leading to requests for Gilbert to design capitol buildings for other states such as West Virginia and Arkansas and other notable structures.\nThe capitol cost US$4.5 million at the beginning of the 20th century. It opened its doors to the public for the first time on January 2, 1905. A hundred years later, the building's estimated value was $400 million.\nMost days of the week the building is open for individual visits, guided tours are given free of charge by professional docents from the Minnesota Historical Society hourly and last about 45 mins. Upon entering the building by the south door, one is below the central dome. A large star, symbolizing Minnesota's motto, \"The Star of the North\", is directly beneath the apex. Various portraits of state governors, and flags captured by Minnesota's regiments during the American Civil War, are on display. Paintings showing some of the related battles can be seen in the governor's outer office. Much of the building is open to the public, although one interesting sight is only rarely accessible. This is the cloak room behind the House of Representatives chamber.\nThe structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.\n\n\n== Renovation ==\n\nThe Minnesota State Capitol underwent a comprehensive restoration project from 2013 to 2017, the first major renovation since the building first opened. Work began in 2013, with the project estimated at that time to cost $241 million, funded via a series of appropriations made by the Minnesota legislature. The project repaired and modernized deteriorating building systems, restored the building to Cass Gilbert's original architectural vision, increased public meeting space (including a new classroom for the Minnesota Historical Society to host school groups and provide information about the building), updated life safety systems and improved accessibility for people with disabilities.During renovation, more than 30,000 pieces of marble were restored or replaced. The amount of public space in the building was doubled to nearly 40,000 square feet, with a number of new public spaces opened to the public for reservation and use year round.The project also included a restoration of the capitol's many works of fine art, which prompted discussions over some paintings in the building that feature controversial depictions of American Indians. A series of public input meetings were held around the state to gather feedback and consider options for new policies regarding art in the renovated building. When the building reopened, two of these paintings were relocated to a public space in the building, while others remained in place.\n\nThe renovation forced the House and Senate to hold a special session in the nearby State Office Building in 2015. During the regular 2016 session, the Senate met in the newly completed Senate Office Building, with the capitol open for only limited access to the House chamber during the session.By the time of its completion in 2017, the total cost of the renovation project reached about $310 million. The bulk of construction was completed by the start of the 2017 legislative session in January. The project was officially completed in August 2017, at which point all of the building's newly renovated spaces opened to the public.A three-day grand opening celebration took place on August 11, 12, and 13, 2017. The grand opening celebration featured a ribbon cutting ceremony with state and local leaders, panel conversations with notable Minnesotans (including former U.S. Vice President Walter Mondale and Minnesota Lynx Head Coach Cheryl Reeve), a beer tasting event with more than 25 Minnesota craft brewers, and musical performances from Minnesota bands Poli\u00e7a and Cloud Cult.On June 10, 2020, members of the American Indian Movement torn down the Christopher Columbus statue, dedicated in 1931, located outside the state capitol building and was not a planned renovation. Planning on restoring the statue is ongoing.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Memorials in the rotunda ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Monuments on the grounds ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMinnesota Governor's Residence\nList of state and territorial capitols in the United States\n\n\n== References ==\n\nElmer L.

          "Minnesota's state Capitol is a beautiful structure both inside and out. It is under restoration and not open to the public at present. It is expected to re-open in early 2017. Many beautiful surprises have been found by the meticulous craft persons who are doing the work. It",
          "I was so excited about the visit to the State Capitol (on my bucket list to visit every US capitol), but very disappointed that the building was completely closed and fenced off. Could not even walk on the grounds. Next time.",
          "I moved to Saint Paul two years ago and I have yet to see this building not shrouded in scaffolding. I am sure it will look great one all the work is done.",
          "This building is made of a beautiful and unusual marble. It is currently covered in scaffolding but the parts that are visible are gorgeous. The entire area is also worth walking through as there are many monuments that basically lead to the cathedral which is a must see.",
          "I work blocks away from the capital and teach English to immigrants and refugees. This building has been regoing renovations for years. We have gone there twice, as the students are curious about it, and have been disappointed, only able to see very little of the building.",
          "Walked around the building last week. You can visit the offices, but the dome is under construction. The offices are small but the staff friendly. I really came at the wrong time of year.",
          "We turned up today 13 August and the site was closed for Reno. All some closed off so give give it a miss for a while or ring and check before you turn up.",
          "We took the light rail out to this stop. We expected it to be beautiful, & I'm sure it is, but at present it's under wraps having a large amount of renovation. The gardens & sculptures in front of Capitol are beautiful.",
          "Had this facility on our to-do list when visiting St Paul but had not realized the building and grounds were closed for renovation. The dome was shrouded by scaffolding and the grounds were all torn up. Had been looking forward to seeing the facility.",
          "It was very pretty, but when we went ( July 2016) the top was under remodeling or cleaning so that you couldn't see the top the building. It is also a short 12-14 minutes walk to the cathedral of St. Paul!",
          "This is a great Capitol. I've been there many times and each time I find something new to explore. They are renovating it right now so you can't see all the building from the outside. Check before you go.",
          "My husband is a big fan of visiting stat Capitols, but we seem to have a knack for being there when they are closed for renovations. But the grounds of the Minnesota Capitol made up for it. With memorials to all branches of service, civil rights, law enforcement, and more, it",
          "Beautiful building, still under renovation. Structure wrapped in construction netting.Should be fabulous when the scaffolding and netting comes down!",
          "Nice park but they need to do more to allow better access for tourists. The statues are nice and the structure a delight. Send the politicians home, they do little.",
          "Built to commemorate Civil War and role Minnesota played in preservation of the union. Has confederate battle flag captured by MN 1st at Gettysburg. Is third capitol and the best one. Fun to explore when in or out of session. Tour is worth it! Make sure to get on the roof to",
          "No access right now unless you are a lawmaker. Way too much construction at the State Capitol all the time. You can always go to the State Office Building but you can't really see anything there but offices that are off limits unless you have appts. Parking is a nightmare",
          "Visiting family, we rode the light rail from Minneapolis to tour the area. We got off at the station near the capitol building, however there was renovation happening.",
          "This is a wonderful building in a beautiful city. Its history is interesting and the grandeur of the building, the grounds and its position make it a worthwhile visit.",
          "Was quite surprised to see all the military tributes and memorial scattered across the capitol grounds. Tearjerking quotes from soldier to their loved ones at home was especially unique. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "I have been to the State Capitol numerous times either to visit a legislator and for a photo shoot. All though it is presently closed to the public here are some shots exemplifying the Capitol prior to the renovation both from the outside and in the inside. When the renovation",
          "One of the most beautiful capitols in the US! They offer free tours....and you can even sit and watch our legislators and senators in action during session!",
          "The best food is under the tunnel system to the west, through the basement of the state office building, and into the transportation building. Way better than the Capitol Cafeteria.",
          "I have been there couple of times. I\u00b4m not from the U.S. but it is still fascinating to visit the state capitol!",
          "Unfortunately during our visit the capitol was undergoing what appeared to be major renovations so we really did not get a true feel of the beauty this capitol has to offer. It is conveniently located near the train which is nice. The grounds were beautiful and there were a few",
          "Well, I guess this is one state capitol I won't be visiting anytime soon. The building is closed and the only thing to see is quadriga surrounded by lots of scaffolding.",
          "The capitol building is under complete renovation at this time, so it was draped in cloth. There was nothing visible except the dome, so it was not a good time to visit. Supposed to reopen in 2017.",
          "We planned to stop by before a hockey game, but we didn't get out of the car. The whole building was draped with scaffolding surrounding. I took a picture at an intersection.",
          "We make a point of visiting state capitols and were extremely disappointed to find the capital covered in scaffolding and ringed by a construction fence.",
          "I have seen lots of state capitols and this is one of the nicest. A mini US Capitol with large dome on a hill overlooking St. Paul. Take a tour if one is offered while you are there. Lots of regional art too.",
          "My class attended Social Work Day at the Capital. I had only been to the capital once before at a young age. it was a nice trip but I do not prefer the big city life that some do.",
          "Beautiful, but currently closed for renovation. The Governor and Legislators have been kicked out. Check the web for when it will be open again. I'm a retired Architect and in my opinion it is one of the most beautiful State Capitol Buildings in the country.",
          "Beautiful triple domed building with gold gilted domes and statuary at the top and Georgian marble for the base. Unfortunately, at the time of this review, it is under restoration due to water damage which is expected to last another two years.",
          "Although I was unable to see/visit the Capitol, I enjoyed my brief visit of St. Paul using the Light Rail. On the Capitol Grounds are several statues and sculptures. About 5-10 minutes away are the St. Paul Cathedral, History Museum, Hill Mansion, and Summit Neighborhood. Please",
          "We went hoping to see the capitol in it's finest glory,but were sad to see we were too soon. Scaffolding is up all around the building and dome. Looks like they are restoring it so that future generations can enjoy. Will have to go again at a later date and see what we didn't",
          "We have been trying to visit state capitols whenever we travel. My daughter has a passport book that she gets stamped at each location. It's been fun to see how each one is unique and special. Unfortunately, we didn't get to visit Minnesota's state capitol because it is",
          "Unfortunately the Capital was under construction when we went there, so we really didn't get to check it out. But the area outside of the Capital is beautiful. There are a couple of different war statues along with glass panels that tell different stories. Very nice area outside.",
          "Okay, I don't remember how many years ago I actually did this tour, it is in the fall around Halloween and actors take you through in the twilight and talk about the history of the building. it is professionally done, and a lot of fun!",
          "See the building designed by master architect Cass Gilbert. Stunning views of the structure surround it. The views from the top of the stairs are equally beautiful. Take a tour of the supposedly haunted building.",
          "In past years our children went to a summer day camp day at he capitol. They especially liked the Civil War day. The camp leaders were in costume and my kids went home with interesting projects from the day. Go to the Minnesota Historical Society's web site to find programs,",
          "Now is not a good time to visit the Capitol Even the lawmakers have to go somewhere else to meet. It is undergoing renovations. I am sure it will be beautiful when it is finished",
          "We battled the downtown construction on two consecutive days to get to the Capitol. On the second day of attempting to find it, we parked several blocks away and walked there. It is obviously under construction, but there was no signage to the effect that the entire Capitol is",
          "It's important to know that the Capitol is under construction so photos aren't as good and it isn't quite the same experience to go when it is under construction, but that said, it is great both for school field trips and for families to learn more about our history and",
          "We budgeted an entire day to peruse St. Paul so we started with a windshield tour following our first stop at Landmark Center. It was disappointing to find that the building is undergoing a significant renovation, so we resolved to tour the area and take in some other sights,",
          "Such an impressive, gorgeous building and grounds. We are free to walk through it on our own or take a guided tour with a docent. The tours are hourly, and the docent tour makes the experience very interesting and educational. I learned so much on the tour. I guess my only",
          "As Canadians, we find that state capitol buildings continue to be the best places to learn of a state's history and to meet friendly, helpful public servants who are understandably proud of these buildings. At the time we visited much of this capitol building was temporarily",
          "It really doesn't look too different in design than the capital of Iowa, but the Capital of Iowa has a gold leaf dome. Tour guide was interesting. It is worth a visit if you happen to be in the area, but not a destination.",
          "We were shown around the capital by a extraordinary young woman who really understood what she was talking about. Very informative tour. Nice to see it before it closes down for complete renovation. A beautiful capital.",
          "While I love the Minnesota capitol - my most recent visit during the renovation left something to be desired but the tour and tour guide were wonderful.",
          "We loved the architecture of the building and the elegance of the rooms visible to visitors. Unfortunately, the building is under renovation, so there were areas we could not see. I'd advise those interested to check in advance to see whether it's all done. Once finished,",
          "The building itself is beautiful. See the legislative chambers and the supreme court. The tours give you a sense of how state government operates.",
          "Visited the inside of the Capital. Beautiful interior. A very interesting band was playing on the capital lawn. the Solidarity band, local musicians with interesting instruments. A political band for the people.",
          "Every Minnesotan should visit the State Capitol to see its beautiful interiors and Marble facade. Quite an architectural treasure that even out-of-state travelers should not miss.",
          "This has been somewhat of a disappointment showing out of state visitors as we drive around the twin cities. With all the work from the unsightly \"light rail\" traveling too close and too much construction and building. Now with the new office building going to be built nearby,",
          "We are so grateful we arrived too early for a docent led tour and instead self guided. Outside is covered in scaffolding and the electricity on the 2nd floor was out so my husband held the bathroom door ajar so I could see. If you have been to other state capitol you will find",
          "A must see if you are from Minnesota or you just love architecture. I found it beautiful and interesting.",
          "The capitol is under renovation, but it's still worth taking the time for the guided tour. They run every hour.",
          "Two big disappointments- the rotunda was closed for repair, and the guide we had treated us like we were in the third grade. Perhaps she had to fill time because of no access to the rotunda, but I've been to many state capitol buildings and this was by far the worst tour.",
          "I visited during their evening ghost tour. The building was lighted with the old lighting, the guides pointed out the imported stone, the Minnesota stone, the photos, changes, carvings, etc in the Capitol. Was great fun and very spooky.",
          "Minnesota's state capitol building in St Paul is iin a great accessible location with ample parking. It is open to tourists and is a great place to explore, since it is a historical building and has many floors and passageways. You really get a sense of the awesome",
          "State capitol buildings are some of the best examples of public architecture we have in this country, and Minnesota's is prettier and more interesting than most. It bears more than a passing resemblance to the U.S. Capitol and to St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, and when it was",
          "it's beautiful and grand, I think most of the State capital is similar, yet it's worthwhile to go and take a look, it's free, it seems has guided tour, but need to check the time on it's webpage. think senate chamber is the most beautiful one among the 3 chambers (other 2 are",
          "This is a beautiful capital building, but it is currently going through extensive remodeling and restoration so main parts are not available. still, it is wort seeing. the staff were very helpful in taking us through the areas that were open.",
          "Yuo can wander around this building on your own if you like, but the free tour is well worth the time. It lasts about 40 minutes, and the guide (ours was excellent) explains all the different features of the public rooms that you are allowed into. The tours leave at the top of",
          "I was by the outside of the capital building several years ago and was very impressed. This time I had the luxury of going inside. What I had not planned on was the building being under almost total renovation. Much of it was closed to the public and many of the state offices",
          "Even with the construction going on at the Capitol, it's still worth a stop. Surely one of the finest structures of its kind in the country, the MN State Capitol Building is a work of art. Cass Gilbert, the architect, designed several local buildings and this building has to",
          "We couldn't figure out where to park and someone walking by said that it was closed for renovations. So, we didn't go in. It was pretty from the outside though.",
          "undergoing renovations so some areas closed and the tour was shortened, but we enjoyed it. Some nice architecture, beautiful marble. Really liked the war memorials on the lawn so be sure to see those.",
          "The building itself with all of it's locally sourced materials and history was fascinating however the tour guide was rather dull.",
          "If you're into architecture at all, plan a visit. An enthusiastic tour guide gave us lots of insight and takes the visitor to rooms/roof otherwise not accessible. Building was designed by Cass Gilbert (of US Supreme Court fame). Ornate decor includes a marble dome, interior",
          "Having spent 30 minutes trying to park, when we finally got into the building, it was well worth it. The guides at the front desk were very helpful and sympathetic to our parking plight. It wasnt their fault! The free tour was excellent, including a trip up to the roof to see",
          "Cass Gilbert's masterpiece and jewel of St. Paul is currently under renovation. The Minnesota State Capitol is always worth a visit, however there will be limited access to the building until renovation of the historic 1905 building is completed in 2015",
          "I was in St Paul recently and made time to check out the Minnesota State Capital. This is certainly a wonderful work of architecture with an art deco theme. It has some great art work and sculptures with great detail on the doors and elevators. A good visit for sure! Enjoy!",
          "After Minnesota State House majority leader, Matt Dean, called the North Dakota State Capitol \"embarrassing\"; we just had to see what was so grandiose of the Minnesota State capitol that made his so pompous that he felt the need to insult others. I'm going to take the high road",
          "This grand building has spectacular architectural and decorative features. It is wide open to the public and it is fascinating to see the three branches of state government at work. Enjoy the panoramic view of downtown St. Paul from the front steps.",
          "Visited here for Arts Advocacy Day last month. It is a beautiful old building with lots of character. There is much construction going on right now, but you can still see much of the nice architecture.",
          "The first time I took a tour of our state capitol I was surprised at how interesting it was. It is a gem: designed by Cass Gilbert, it captures the aspirations of a young state. Be sure to visit the Ratskeller!",
          "The design and interior decorations make this one of the better capitol buildings. Well worth taking the tour and seeing all the work that went into creating it.",
          "This was one of the first state capitol buildings I had ever visited and I was thoroughly enamored with what I saw. Designed by Cass Gilbert and modeled after St. Peter's in Rome, the exterior with its majestic approach cannot help but impress. The interior is also beautiful and",
          "We took the guided tour of the Mn State Capitol with our grandson. All of us loved the tour, the architecture, and the history. We would rank it a step below Wisconsin's capitol building in Madison, but still worth a visit.",
          "Yes it's beautiful and yes, there's a good tour. But I think it's great to bring kids to meet with their legislators and if possible to testify at a committee hearing. This is the \"people's house!\" If you make an appointment ahead of time, local legislators will be glad to",
          "Beautiful building finished in 1905. Cass Gilbert used St. Peter's Basilica, Rome, as his model. There is a very interesting tour available. Be sure to see the Rathskeller with attendant German phrases extolling beer.",
          "I loved seeing all of the granite and carved wood decoration in the interior and furniture. The great white marble dome was fashioned after St Peter's in Rome. I liked the paintings of all of the governors, esp the husband & wife governors. If you are from MN, it is worthwhile",
          "I alwasy compare the extra money used to make buildings 'beautiful' and now they are mostly utilarian. I like it when people cared about aesthitics as well as usefulness. Great!",
          "The tour was very historical and you get to see everything in the building. The guide was very nice, however it would've been nice if the guide was a little more knowledgable about current affairs. Every time I asked a question about the current state of politics in the",
          "Our group decided to tour the Minnesota State Capitol, a beautiful looking edifice. We arrived in time for the last tour of the day and were taken on a 45 minute tour. We got to go outside on the deck surrounding the dome and were able the view the golden statue placed there.",
          "I love the lead up to the Capitol! It\u2019s on top of a hill and there is lovely green space, trees, and flowers all around. The building is beautiful. It was a really hot day when we walked there to check it out and we were happy to see there were street food vendors located",
          "I've been to almost 30 state capitals over the years, and visited many state capitols (amazing what a difference a letter can make). Minnesota has another good one. It has the usual features. The building is up on a hill overlooking St. Paul. It is the setting for the",
          "Very nice building and grounds. We just started visiting state Capitol buildings and this is a nice one but not at the top of our list.",
          "Went downtown to the Capital Building and it was gorgeous!! Hardly anybody there so was able to take pictures without people or cars in the way. Groundskeepers were making the place look fantastic and the flowers definitely made it beautiful.",
          "By accident I started touring statehouses a few years ago. I have seen 17 so far. This is a very impressive building. They made it impressive to show the easterners that Minnesota was not a backwoods place in the early 1900s. One of the best I have seen. You can tell they",
          "I wasn't expecting to spend as much time in this beautiful building as i did. It's simply gorgeous and filled with lovely art. The toilets are clean and well maintained. The staff were helpful and friendly. I took my time walking round, took many many photos and truly had a",
          "My family and I had an opportunity to take the 45 minute free guided tour of the Minnesota state capitol. The tour guide (a volunteer) was quite knowledgable and passionate about the history of the state and the architecture of the capitol building. The interior of the capitol",
          "That was my first time I visited this capitol while during my trip to St. Paul, MN. I got around between Minneapolis and St. Paul.",
          "good to see if in the area, capitol is very nice to see the front lawn of this state capitol litlle different than most which has a huge open lawn. overal it was ok to see",
          "Facility has impressive architecture (exterior and interior) You can choose between guided tours and tours on their own. Free admission.",
          "Seems that way from the reviews. Sorry, I've seen a number of state capitols and this ranks near the bottom. To be sure, almost all are impressive structures, well worth seeing. But this is not a favorite. For one thing, it's the only one we've been in that charges a",
          "I have seen quite a number of state capitol buildings in my travels and I truly feel that the Minnesota State Capitol building is one of the best. Its magnificent architecture and large outdoor expanse of lawn as you approach its front, though not as large in size, is more",
          "I went to U of M College Rally Day at the Capitol & it was great! It's so fun to walk up the vast stairs & just go right in! It is beautiful, the granite is really interesting & it was a cool experience. Stop by the MN History Center when you're done at the Capitol.",
          "This is a beautiful and historic building. We are extremely privileged to be able to use the facility",
          "No, not the trite \"amazing.\" This is the real thing. The granite columns, marble staircases, magnificent domes, gilt statues, beautiful meeting halls for ALL the brances of Minnesota in one building - not to be missed. Visit your own state capitol and compare . . . I'm",
          "I took a Halloween themed tour which led my girlfriend and I through various rooms of the capitol. Tour was a little slow , but seeing everything in there was worth it.",
          "As usual, buildings like this reeks of history. Cass Gilbert built it in all specifications and it shows Minnesota in its prime of artistic splendour. You'll simply wonder how it all was done in its time. It's over a hundred years old and the designer expects it to last for five",
          "This building is the center of the government in Minnesota. It is a stately, historic building and the tour is very educational.",
          "And fabulous art. The tour guides are well trained and have lots of good stories. A great place to spend an afternoon that few people think about.",
          "Visited here yesterday (Saturday) with spouse. Arrived in time for 10am tour. Doors to Capitol are on time lock, so they do not open until 10am, regardless of how cold, hot or miserable it might be outside. There are several benches where you can wait if you arrive before the",
          "A very stately and magnificent capitol building. View from the steps is worth it. Good parking. Don't miss this!",
          "Excellent docent led tour. (Finding an alternative entry is tricky if you do not want to climb the steps.)",
          "A visit to the Minnesota State Capitol is both a historic and decorative arts tour. Visitor brochures are provided free of charge along with guided tours throughout the day. Don't miss the portraits of past governors or the current governor's anteroom with furnishings and",
          "I was surprised at the beautiful details in the capitol and I learned some good history, too. Definitely get a tour guide first but then also take some time on your own for exploring. And bring your camera as there are interesting spots and exhibits.",
          "You can get a 45 minute tour of the Capitol for a donation (suggested $5). Our guide was very informative. I recommend the tour because you get to see places that are not available by self-guiding. We were able to go up to the dome walkway, and see the beautiful skyline of",
          "beautiful building to see. Be sure to see the rathskellar in the basement and see the reasons why it had been painted over 20+ times during prohibition and prior to WWII.",
          "Spent a wonderful afternoon touring this grand building. The magnificent dome with the famous Quadriga invited us in. We did not take the official tour but instead went off on our own to explore all the nook and crannies. There was nothing going on (ie nothing was in session)",

          "With time to kill while waiting for the finish of the American Solar Car race, we went for a tour of the Minnesota capitol. The building itself is quite beautiful inside. (Look for the gophers in the ironwork and woodwork!) However, it was our tour guide Kerry who brought the",
          "Nothing wrong with this place, and in fact there are very eager workers ready to share history and lead tours. Nice building, too, but unless you are a true history buff there is only so much you want of busts of famous statesmen. (Yes, all men, I believe.)",
          "Very impressive State Capitol Building. Well worth a visit. Very nice guided tour offered. No charge. Interesting Beer Garden decor restaurant in basement.",
          "exterior is impressive, interior is a spectacular bit of architecture and history",
          "Very pretty & tour was interesting. A bit of construction around the capitol, so allow your self a buffer when getting there.",
          "I took my 4 small children (ages 5 & 7) on the tour of the Capitol. It really is a beautiful and amazing building! The tour was paced just right for us; informative and intesting with a nice mix of architecture, technology, innovation and history; yet it was not so in depth to",
          "The day we visited, the legislature was in session so it was a very busy place. This is not one of the more ornate capital buildings, but it's so worth seeing. Everyone should visit their state capital if they have a chance. The building is very pretty and the artwork is",
          "The tour is very interesting even if you don't particularly care about the history of Minnesota. The architeture is amazing and worth stopping for alone. Tour is less than an hour and allows enough time to enjoy the building and ask questions.",
          "First time visitors will be impressed to see where the governor sits. I think this is a worthwhile visit for people of all ages. The tour guides are good- and you're in and out in a short amount of time.",

          "Want to learn more about Minnesota? Then walk the halls of this great institution and see the multitude of displays within and see where the peoples business is conducted. The grounds are awesome!!! We are Minnesota Proud!!!",
          "I just love seeing how government works. You can send little notes in for legislators while they are in session. They may come out to talk to you between votes. You can see paintings of the governors of yore--more interesting than you think. Amazing quotations etched in",
          "Date of visit: Sat 3/31/12 Tips: 1. wear comfortable, quiet shoes 2. arrive in time to use the bathroom BEFORE the tour starts (we lost a few people because they went downstairs and didn\u2019t make it back up before we left the lobby) 3. try to go on a day when it\u2019s warm enough",
          "If you like history, enjoy exquisite architecture, and enjoy walking then this is a great place to tour. There is no fee for a guided tour yet donations were appreciated.",
          "Usually reasonable place to talk to all sides of the issues, not since 2010 for the GOP however, so in that sense its frustrating. But very nice architecture and structural design of building, quite beautiful actually if your in to architecture and structural design from an",
          "I was last there for a special event after hours so my experience is somewhat unique, but the architecture is beautiful, and we were able to meet with a legislator in the chambers and in the office building, and we had dinner in the Gasthaus. My first trip to the MN State",
          "From the gold horses atop the structure to the marble hallways and artistic expression throughout, this is truly a state treasure!",

          "A typical state capitol building with paintings, statues and lots of latin words. The supreme court is pretty though.",
          "Massive dome and beautiful spaces. One of the largest and most beautiful state capitols. Don't miss an opportunity to view the Quadriga, the gilded equestrian sculpture that can be seen above the main entrance to the Capitol. The adjacent grounds are expansive and peaceful,",
          "Beautiful working building. Incredible dome, staircase and rotunda.",
          "This is a very impressive building. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and the building itself has beautiful architecture. I liked seeing the golden horses statue outside. Parking is at a premium around the Capitol, but overall it was well worth a look-see.",
          "BUT, this is where the idiot Legislature meets and is so dysfunctional",
          "I love coming here and make sure I visit yearly. The architecture and artwork are exemplary. I love the restaurant downstairs. Check out the history of the artwork on the walls there and why it was covered up for many years.",
          "We go here every year with students on a field trip. It's interesting. Do a tour though because the guides do such a great job of explaining things",
          "Super tour guide that really made the history come alive!",
          "Amazing Building that has a lot of history inside of it. The tour guide was great!",
          "Beautiful domed building in heart of St. Paul. On Interstate 94 for easy access. Limited parking available. Museums located on grounds make for interesting school tours.",
          "Learn all about how the MN Capitol was built, where different types of marble came from, why certain stones are inlaid in certain places...It's a fascinating tour.",
          "This was a great visit for me; not so much the family but I love looking at old buildings. I guess I just love architecture.",
          "Great Bulding, interesting artefacts, nice people, guided tour Got a citiation at a parking meter after 5 Minutes over....was the only car at this time",
          "Visited on a beautiful sunny day. Stopped by the info desk and got a map. It was cool to see the Senate Chamber and House Chamber. I was just amazed by the architecture and the marble staircases. Even the statues were cool. Walked outside around the building and grounds,",
          "The MN Historical Society offers tours on the hour. If your schedule lines up properly, it is very much worth it. The guides are incredibly knowledgeable, and mix in some very kid-friendly stuff (the Lego replica of the building has to be seen to be believed). Worth your time.",
          "My 10 year old and 16 year old had requested we visit the Capitol. First of all, it was hard for us to find a parking space. When we asked the lady at the information desk about it, because we thought we had surely missed some parking area, she said \"don't bring that up,",
          "We have been to the Twin Cities many times, and never did the capitol tour. It was very nice. It lasted about 45 \". We learned a lot about the capitol and also the state of Minnesota. I highly recommend the tour. Be sure to visit the St Paul Cathedral about 3 minutes from",
          "A few days ago,I visited the Minnesota State Capitol.It is a splendid work of interior architecture and a credit to the legacy of Cass Gilbert.The complimentary tour of the state capitol was very special.My guide,Bill was very informative and I learned quite a bit about the",

        "wiki": "Science Museum of Minnesota is an American museum focused on topics in technology, natural history, physical science, and mathematics education.  Founded in 1907 and located in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the 501(c)(3) nonprofit institution is staffed by over 600 employees and over 1,600 volunteers. The museum's mission statement is to \"Turn on the science: Inspire learning. Inform policy. Improve lives.\"\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was formed during a luncheon in 1906 when Charles W. Ames, a prominent businessman, met with a group and discussed \"the intellectual and scientific growth of St. Paul\". The museum, originally named the St. Paul Institute of Science and Letters, was first located at the St. Paul Auditorium on Fourth Street. In 1909, the St. Paul School of Fine Arts (now known as the Minnesota Museum of American Art) briefly merged with St. Paul Institute.In 1927 the museum moved to Merriam Mansion on Capitol Hill, the former home of Col. John Merriam. This move provided more storage space for exhibits. As the Science Museum continued to outgrow its facilities, it moved to the St. Paul-Ramsey Arts and Sciences Center at 30 East Tenth Street in 1964. In 1978, this expanded across a skyway into a new space on Wabasha between 10th and Exchange, greatly increasing exhibit space and adding an IMAX Dome (OMNIMAX) cinema.\nIn the early 1990s, plans for a new and more modern facility, to be located adjacent to the Mississippi River, were formed. With aid from public funding initiatives, the new museum broke ground on May 1, 1997 and opened on December 11, 1999. During the move, 1.75 million artifacts were transported.\n\n\n== Resident exhibits ==\n\nThere are a number of exhibits that are always in the museum, including:\n\nDinosaurs & Fossils showcases several original and replicated dinosaur skeletons, as well as many complete and preserved animals. Some highlights include a Triceratops, Diplodocus, Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Camptosaurus.\nThe Human Body Gallery shows visitors the various tissues, organs, and systems (such as blood or digestion) that make up the human body. There is a mummy on display here, as well as many cultural artifacts from the Museum of Questionable Medical Devices. The museum acquired these pieces in 2002 when its original owner Bob McCoy, son of Wilson McCoy, retired and donated the collection.\nThe Experiment Gallery allows visitors to explore concepts in physics, math, and physical and earth science with interactive displays.\nRACE: Are We So Different? is the first national exhibition to tell the stories of race from the biological, cultural, and historical points of view. Combining these perspectives offers an unprecedented look at race and racism in the United States.\nThe We Move & We Stay features artifacts and historical content about the Dakota and Ojibwe people.\nThe Mississippi River Gallery takes advantage of the museum's proximity to the river and a National Park to educate visitors about its natural resources. Visitors can learn about the environment and animals of the river. It is also home The Collectors' Corner. Traders (primarily children) bring in natural artifacts they have found to trade them for points or another artifact. The more information they can discuss about their item, the more points they earn.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n\n=== Omnitheater ===\nThe new building has a dual-screen IMAX/Omnimax theater with both a wall screen, for IMAX films and other flat presentations, and a rotatable dome, for viewing Omnitheater films, the first such convertible theater in the northern hemisphere. The counterweights for the system were so massive that they had to be put in place before the rest of the building. The theater boasts \"the largest permanently installed electronic cinema projector in the world\", an advanced computer system to coordinate the theater's facilities, and a complex sound system to accommodate both viewing formats, according to the website.\nThe museum has been a leading producer of Omnitheater films, with ten to its credit so far:\n\nGenesis (1978)\nLiving Planet (1979)\nThe Great Barrier Reef (1981)\nDarwin on the Galapagos (1983)\nSeasons (1987)\nRing of Fire (1991)\nTropical Rainforest (1992)\nSearch for the Great Sharks (1995)\nThe Greatest Places (1998)\nJane Goodall's Wild Chimpanzees (2002)The theater was closed for a brief time in early 2014 to repair a leaky roof.\n\n\n=== Mississippi River Visitor Center ===\nInside the lobby of the Science Museum is the National Park Service Visitor Center for the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, which is open free of charge. Mississippi River exhibits and National Park Rangers are available to help people learn about and experience the Mississippi River. The visitor center is also equipped with resources to help plan trips to any of the more than 390 national parks.\n\n\n=== Collections Vault ===\nThe museum houses a collection of over 1.7 million artifacts and objects in its vault, ranging from dinosaur and other animal remains and fossils, preserved animals and plants, and cultural artifacts from extinct and extant civilizations. The collections division maintains a staff of scientists and researchers including paleontologists, archaeologists, ecologists, biologists, ethnologists, and archivists. Researchers visit the vault to take advantage of the unique collection, but it is not open to regular museum visitors.\n\n\n=== Lee and Rose Warner Nature Center ===\nThe museum is associated with the Lee and Rose Warner Nature Center, which is located approximately 30 miles (48 km) offsite in Washington County. The center provides natural history education opportunities for all ages on over 600 acres (2.4 km2) of lakes, bogs, woodlands, and grasslands.\n\n\n=== Kitty Andersen Youth Science Center ===\nThe Kitty Andersen Youth Science Center (KAYSC) is an informal learning environment for young people between 11 and 18 years old. The mission of the KAYSC is to \"empower youth to change our world through science\". Although there are some volunteers in the KAYSC who are too young for jobs, most of the teens in the KAYSC are actual museum employees, engaging in activities ranging from staffing the Cell Lab on the museum floor to engaging in community activism around urban agriculture and climate change. The teens are guided and mentored in science, technology, work, and life skills by the adult staff.\n\n\n== Special exhibitions ==\nThe museum hosts 3-4 special exhibitions a year, with past exhibitions having included:\n\nWhen Crocodiles Ruled (2000)\nMysteries of Catalhoyuk (2001)\nPlaying with Time (2002)\nVikings: The North Atlantic Saga (2002)\nRobots and Us (2004)\nSeasons of Life and Land (2004)\nInvention at Play (2005)\nStrange Matter (2006)\nBody Worlds (2006)\nRace: Are We So Different? (2007)\nWild Music (2007)\nA Day in Pompeii (2007)\nDeadly Medicine (2008)\nAnimation (2008)\nStar Wars: Where Science Meets Imagination (2008)\nCSI: The Experience (2008)\nGoose Bumps! The Science of Fear (2009)\nWater (2009)\nTitanic: The Artifact Exhibition (2009)\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls: Words that Changed the World (2010)\nGeometry Playground (2010)\nTutankhamun: The Golden King and the Great Pharaohs (2011)\nIdentity: An Exhibit of YOU (2011)\nNature Unleashed (2011)\nReal Pirates: The Untold Story of the Whydah from Slave Ship to Pirate Ship (2012)\nLost Egypt: Ancient Secrets Modern Science (2012)\nBody Worlds & The Cycle of Life (2013)\nMaya: Hidden Worlds Revealed (2013)\nUltimate Dinosaurs (2014)\nDesign Zone (2014)\nSpace: An Out-of-Gravity Experience (2015)\nMummies: New Secrets from the Tombs (2016)\nMindbender Mansion (2016)\nMythic Creatures (2017)\nThe Science Behind Pixar (2017)\n\n\n== Memberships ==\nThe Science Museum of Minnesota is a founding member of NISE Net and participates in NanoDays.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe museum also has an extensive science learning division. In addition to many on-site youth and family classes, day camps, and summer camps, museum programs are also hosted at various schools throughout the region. Day classes and summer camps often involve science, technology, nature, and art themes. Overnight camp-ins let large groups sleep on the exhibit floor and have time to explore the galleries and view an Omnitheater film as a group. The museum is also one of the leading professional development resources for teachers in the state.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn 2017, the character Dustin appeared on the popular television show Stranger Things, set in the 1980s, wearing a brontosaurus hoodie sold by the museum in that era. The museum was quickly flooded with requests to purchase the garment, so they began manufacturing it again and took orders totaling $400,000 in a single day.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Science Museum of Minnesota's official website",

          "Our day at the Science Museum began in the Omni Theater to see \"Living in the Age of Airplanes,\" a fascinating movie for adults but not so for toddlers and young children. After the movie, we worked our way to \"Chomp\" on the 3rd level for a lunch break. Food was fresh with",
          "A beautiful setting on the river bluffs in St. Paul. This museum is good for hours of enjoyment. Make sure to take in a film in the Omni Theater, which is quite a bit more spectacular than the regular IMAX as the Omni screen comes down all around you in almost 360 fashion.",
          "Great venue for meetings and a great museum for both old and young. There hours of operation need to be extended epsecially during the holiday season.",
          "This place has something for everyone. the exhibits rotate regularly and they have lots of hands-on things for kids. The Omnitheater is great fun and their movies vary throughout the year.",
          "Science, beautifully presented in a compelling way for all. A great wander of discoveries. The Omni Theatre was a real treat, but so were the numerous other interactive displays. Covered parking is easy.",

          "So many things to see and do, we didn't know where to start! We should have done a quick walk-through and gone back to the highlights. We were under a time restraint and didn't get to fully enjoy the favs. We'll be back with a better plan!",

          "Took my grandson here for a day long visit. All in all a very enjoyable day. The one negative (a super negative) is trying to park my rental car. To call it a nightmare would be an understatement. The parking lot was full...all nearby lots were full...after driving around for",
          "Enjoyed a quick Sunday morning visit. History of local area, dinos, music, science, athletics, experimentation etc. The best part was the special exhibit which had to be paid extra for. Think it was almost as much as regular admission. Plus omnotype theater showings as well.",
          "Can easily spend and entire afternoon here. Many, many exhibits to keep everyone entertained and curious. Great for all ages but not really great for the very young. I would say 4 or 5 years old is the minimum age otherwise you'll want to visit the Children's Museum (which is",
          "We took a large group of out-of-town family to the museum and there was something for everyone to enjoy. From Legos for the youngest to sports focused science for the teens, the Science Museum of Minnesota does a great job making science fun and interesting.",
          "My \"guy friend\", his parents, brother, and I, saw Dream Big, which was so cool. You would think that you were moving, but you weren't, and it was very informative. The staff was gracious to us, as my guy's father uses a wheelchair, as he can't walk long distances. The staff",

          "We have a membership, which pays for itself after a few visits. We enjoy the omni theater. There is a sports-themed area that is great for kids who try to outrun the dinosaur projected on the screen. There is currently a Lego exhibit that goes well with the engineering \u201cDream",
          "I've been to the Science Museum for years, and some of the exhibits haven't changed much (dino fossils for example) and some they have moved and some are new and updated. If you go, see it all. It's all worth it, fun for all ages and",
          "We have been taking our kids here for decades . It's so interesting to see the updates and also how the kids {who ate now adults} ideas and perspectiveschange as they have grown. For me no matter what age, it never gets old!",
          "Reading other reviews, I wasn't sure if this was the place for a 36-year-old and his mom. It sure was! Before it opened, we walked literally across the street to see the Mississippi River. Inside the free part of the museum is a free National Parks exhibit about the river. One",
          "My wife and I spent five hours at the Science Museum of Minnesota, and didn\u2019t see or do everything which was offered. It\u2019s WAY more than just the old dino skeletons! There are things geared to kids, of course, but the museum is really for all ages. Examples of what was on site",
          "We went to the Science Museum to visit the Lego Exhibit because we have some Lego lovers in our family. It was worth it! The kids totally loved it and even asked to go back a second time. The other exhibits were good as well. And during the summer, they have an outdoor exhibit",
          "This exhibit is fun for kids and adults. The troughs of Legos provide ample access to the \u201ctools of the trade\u201d. And then you can display your own handiwork in the exhibition section. The video showing the architecture and engineering of how the skyscraper were built in Legos is",
          "After reading the many reviews saying that you don't need to bring kids to have fun, we thought we would give it a try. We found most of the exhibits to be uninformative for adults. The dinosaur exhibit was the only exception. If you have young ones to bring - they would have",

          "This museum was clearly delightful to the hundreds of kids from local schools who were there, but has a confusing layout with few things of interest to sophisticated adult visitors. The noise level was horrible, and we two seniors did not last long enough to make the $12.50",
          "Our family of five found this museum to be the highlight of our time in Minneapolis. The quality and diversity of exhibits meant that every person in our family (ages 4, 10, 12, 40, and 40) found enough things to keep us engaged, learning, and having fun for an entire day. Bonus",
          "I nearly skipped this as we are two adults with no children and I was unsure whether it was mainly for the kids or not. Having been, I can confirm that it's for everyone! Some really great exhibits - from native fauna/flora to sports science, lego skyscrapers, fake",
          "Science Museum?!?!?! This place was more like the Wonder Emporium! If you can't find something of interest here then it is on you. Truly a place for everyone in the family. Space, weather, sport's science, dinosaurs, mental health, race, body health... still skeptical? Well they",

          "I really like the Science Museum, but best of all in the winter. It is a great way to get the family out of the house when it is too cold to skate, sled, ski or hike. The exhibits are truly wonderful and chasing. Who doesn't like the IMax theater? Best of all, join the",
          "My daughter loved the medical exhibit (with some hands on demonstrations she could do). We saw a great film at the theater. The exhibits, overall, flowed well and kept our interests. It's a bit spendy - I think museums should be free, but I digress - but worth a four-hour tour.",
          "The Science Museum has exhibits for everyone! The exhibit about race is thought provoking. The current exhibit about mental illness addresses an extremely important issue. The Omnitheater is entertaining. My children loved to visit here when growing up. My special needs",

          "We have found most museums in Minnesota disappointing - we just added this to our list of overpriced museums in MN. Our children did have some fun but it was not worth the admission price.",
          "I went with a group of 50 middle school students. We had several chaperones also. We saw a movie in the omnitheater. They provided a place for us to eat lunch. Students had a lot of fun exploring the exhibits. Was very crowded while we were there.",
          "The science museum can be a great all day event. There is convenient parking. The Imax theater usually has great performances. The Museum is well curated with local Minnesota items and items of global interest. There are so many fun hands on exhibits to entertain and teach kids",
          "Went here for the day & we all had a blast! Lots to enjoy for all ages. Our little ones favorites were the dinosaur bones, weaving & sand table that has a projector that shines down to make the sand look like land & water, very cool! Our favorites were the mummy, medical &",

          "We spent the afternoon here while visiting friends. It wasn't too busy & it was easy to access / use all of the exhibits. We spent a lot of time in both the local & dinosaur areas, very educational. We liked seeing the science area too. It was fun to play with the different",

          "We are members and have been enjoying the Science Museum for years. The exhibits are interactive, active and kid friendly. Though very young ones may not find as much to keep them busy. Children from 3 on up will certainly be able to stay busy here for several hours. On busy",
          "We started taking our kids here when they were in elementary school, but the science museum is nice for all ages. They offer multiple levels and the hands-on opportunities are different on each. The special, travelling exhibitions are extra, but we have enjoyed them. There are",

          "Always a nice time for the price, good value and if you have a membership you also get discounted parking in Downtown Saint Paul. As a family expense the Science Museum of MN is well worth it. just over $100.00 for an annual membership which sounds like a lot but if you use it",
          "One of the coolest places in the state. It's not the cheapest place to go but one of the most educational by far. If you have kids, make it a point to explore with them. There is a lot of knowledge to be gained but it's not all just sitting there. You'll have to get hands on",
          "I brought my 8 year old daughter here for the day. We arrived at 10 am. Starting early was a good idea as it wasn't too busy yet. I'd suggest starting with the exhibits on the entry level floor and make your way down. We lunched at the museum, which was a huge",

          "We have a membership, which pays for itself after a few visits. We enjoy the omni theater. They have recently put in a sports-themed area that is great for kids who try to outrun the dinosaur projected on the screen. All ages will enjoy the museum but it's most fun with kids.",
          "This place was a bit spendy and the movies and other exhibits cost more on top of the $60 we paid for a family of 3. We had a few hours to kill before we flew out of MN, so it was fun for my daughter. The food there was terrible - the $9 \"croissant\" sandwich was a bun and the",

          "We only got the basic ticket for the museum but it was well worth it. There are several interesting exhibits, including one on race that was poignant and informative. Plus, who can go wrong with dinosaur fossils? It's a fun time for all ages.",
          "This is a really neat museum with so much to see! It even has putt putt outside as a fun outdoor break. We have been twice and the kids loved it each time! The only thing to note is that the restaurant does close early so there are no 'snacks' by mid/late afternoon and you",

          "This is a great science museum! They work hard to have it be educational, interactive and have a wide variety of topics represented. There are multiple levels and many interactive activities that engage the minds and limbs of the kids. My children ranged in age from 9-17",

          "Really loved this place. Checked it out for the 1st time in about 3 years with our 3 kids (ages 3 & 6) and there was soo much to do. We stayed for about 3 hours and probably only saw about half of everything. The new Sportsology Exhibit was awesome. Our kids loved it.",
          "Visited this good useful with our 8 year old grandson and I wouldn't take a child much younger than that. He's a curious kid, but many of the exhibits were over his head. Of courage the mummy was a huge hit along with the IMAX space movie and the gift shop. For younger kids,",

          "We got here right when the museum opened at 9:30 and stayed for nearly 6 hours. There were so many different things to do and my son absolutely loved it. We did pay extra to do the Omnitheater which was OK, but not a must. Overall we had a great time and could go back and see",

          "We have been going to the Science Museum for over 20 years now. It was a several times a year staple when our children were young. The exhibits change frequently, so there is always something new to look at. The Omnitheater movies are worth a visit just on their own.",

          "I used to work for the Science Museum of Minnesota, so I know a lot about it. First off, I will say that prices here have really increased since they built the new museum. If you think that you might attend it more than once in a given year, or go to see more than one",
          "Spent several hours wandering the exhibits.Good amenities of a cafe and gift shop. Not impressed with the children's science theater. IMAX good . Dinosaur exhibit and special mummies exhibit outstanding.",
          "What a delight-filled day. Be sure to take in the musical staircase, fantastic views of the riverfront, Omni theatre.",
          "Paid almost 80 to see the mummies and museum (first time back in 4 years) we were super excited about the mummies but then really disappointed. It was $10 each for admission for that exhibit and to us it really wasn't worth it. Plus the museum it's self seems like it's a one",
          "What a wonderful museum! It's geared towards family and kids, but I went with my fianc\u00e9 to see the mummies and we had a blast! There was never a dull moment. The views are phenomenal, the staff is so friendly, and it's the one of the greatest museums I've been too!",

          "We have visited twice when in the area, and are always amazed at the layout and quality of this site. Our grandson found a lot of things that interested him. We spend 2-3 hours per visit, and it does not seem like enough. The admission price is reasonable. There are some",

          "My friends like to come here sometimes with me, and we like to visit the Omni Theater when we come. It is always my favorite part, but honestly, you have to walk around the museum and look at a bunch of average-looking artifacts and displays.",
          "Well I live in St Paul and have been coming here fir 30 years. Omni theater movies -Great. But, heresy here, the museum just does nothing for me. Lots of stuff, but nothing new or curious for me. You might be satisfied with less. I just wish it was more like Chicago's Science",
          "This review is solely about the National Parks movie playing in the Omni Theater...my parents wanted to check out the movie, I joined them. My dad & I are really into the history and current park info...well to cut to the chase, we were disappointed in the movie. It touched on",

          "We came for the Omnifest and saw three movies as well as several exhibits on medical quakery which was interesting. We did not see the Mummy exhibit as we had seen mummies before and you have to pay extra for the special exhibit. You always have to be aware of when classes are",

        "wiki": "Saint Paul (St. Paul) is the capital of the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is the county seat of Ramsey County, the state's smallest and most densely populated county. As of 2019, its estimated population was 308,096, making it the 63rd-largest city in the United States and the 11th-most populous in the Midwest. Most of the city lies east of the Mississippi River at the confluence with the Minnesota River. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, is across the river to the west. Together they are known as the \"Twin Cities\". They are the core of Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, home to over 3.6 million and the third-largest in the Midwest.Established near existing Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center, the city gained prominence when it was made the capital of the Minnesota Territory in 1849. The Dakota name for where Saint Paul is situated is \"Imnizaska\". The city is known for the Xcel Energy Center, home to the Minnesota Wild. Regionally, it is known for the Science Museum of Minnesota and its new soccer stadium. As a business hub of the Upper Midwest, it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab. Saint Paul and Minneapolis are also known for their high literacy rate.The first structure built in what would become St. Paul was constructed in 1838 at the entrance to Fountain Cave overlooking the Mississippi. It was built by Pigs Eye Parrant near where Randolph Avenue today meets the river. Parrant's \"tavern\" was well known and the surrounding area came to be known as Pigs Eye. That lasted until the Catholic missionary Lucien Galtier arrived in 1840. He did not care for Parrant, his tavern, or the use of his name. The priest's arrival brought the eviction of Parrant from his establishment and the building of a log chapel near where steamboats had an easy landing. Galtier named the chapel St. Paul's, making it known that the settlement was then to be called by that name, as \"Saint Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated, this monosyllable is short, sounds good, it is understood by all Christian denominations\". While Pigs Eye was no longer the settlement's name, it came to refer to wetlands and an island south of the city's center. As the region grew the city became the seat of an archdiocese that built a grand St. Paul's Cathedral overlooking the downtown.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBurial mounds in present-day Indian Mounds Park suggest the area was inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about 2,000 years ago. From the early 17th century to 1837, the Mdewakanton Dakota, a tribe of the Sioux, lived near the mounds after fleeing their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe. The Dakota called the area I-mni-za ska dan (\"little white rocks\") for its exposed white sandstone cliffs on the river's eastern side. In the Menominee language it is called S\u0101\u0113nep\u0101n-Men\u012bk\u0101n, which means \"ribbon, silk or satin village\", suggesting its role in trade throughout the region after the introduction of European goods.Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, US Army officer Zebulon Pike negotiated approximately 100,000 acres (40,000 ha; 160 sq mi) of land from the local Dakota tribes in 1805 to establish a fort. The negotiated territory was on both banks of the Mississippi River, from Saint Anthony Falls in present-day Minneapolis to its confluence with the Saint Croix River. Fort Snelling was built on the territory in 1819 at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers, which formed a natural barrier to both Native American nations. The 1837 Treaty with the Sioux ceded all local tribal land east of the Mississippi to the U.S. government. Taoyateduta (Chief Little Crow V) moved his band at Kaposia across the river to the south. Fur traders, explorers, and missionaries came to the area for the fort's protection. Many of the settlers were French-Canadians who lived nearby. But as a whiskey trade flourished, military officers banned settlers from the fort-controlled lands. Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant, a former fur trader turned bootlegger who particularly irritated officials, set up his tavern outside the military reservation, upriver from Lambert's Landing. By the early 1840s, the community had become important as a trading center and destination for pioneers heading west. Locals called the area Pig's Eye (French: L'\u0152il du Cochon) or Pig's Eye Landing after Parrant's popular tavern. In the 1840s-70s the M\u00e9tis brought their oxen and Red River Carts down Kellogg Street to Lampert's landing to ship buffalo hides to market from the Red River of the North.  St. Paul was the southernmost stop on the Red River Trails. In 1840 Pierre Bottineau became a resident of St. Paul with a claim in the heart of the settlement.\n\nIn 1841, Father Lucien Galtier was sent to minister to the Catholic French Canadians and established a chapel, named for his favorite saint, Paul the Apostle, on the bluffs above Lambert's Landing. Galtier informed the settlement it was to adopt the name Saint Paul in honor of his new chapel and to give up use of Pigs Eye. In 1847, the New York educator Harriet Bishop moved to the area and opened the city's first school. The Minnesota Territory was formalized in 1849 with Saint Paul as its capital. In 1857, the territorial legislature voted to move the capital to Saint Peter, but Joe Rolette, a territorial legislator, stole the physical text of the approved bill and went into hiding, preventing the move. On May 11, 1858, Minnesota was admitted to the union as the 32nd state, with Saint Paul still capital. Soon thereafter the country was torn by the Civil War. When the state learned that Governor Ramsey had volunteered a regiment to fight the South, communities across the state put together companies of volunteers for that regiment. St. Paul contributed A and C Companies to the formation of the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe year 1858 saw more than 1,000 steamboats service Saint Paul, making the city a gateway for settlers to the Minnesota frontier or Dakota Territory. Natural geography was a primary reason the city became a landing. The area was the last accessible point to unload boats coming upriver due to the Mississippi River Valley's stone bluffs. During this period, Saint Paul was called \"The Last City of the East.\" Industrialist James J. Hill constructed his railroad empire into the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway, both headquartered in Saint Paul until merging into the Burlington Northern. Today they are part of the BNSF Railway.The Spanish\u2013American War saw the trans-Atlantic ocean liner SS Saint Paul (1895) converted and commissioned into the United States Navy as an auxiliary cruiser. She was the first ship in the navy to bear the city's name. She was decommissioned and returned to her owners only to be conscripted for service again for WWI, after which she was again decommissioned and scraped.\nCrooks' Haven In 1900 an Irishman named John O'Connor became chief of the St. Paul police and was known on the street as \"the Big Fellow\". That year he instituted the \"O'Connor Layover Agreement\" and made an effort to inform criminals of its existence. St. Paul police would ignore any transgressions of the law that took place outside their jurisdiction as long as criminals \"checked in\" when they arrived in town. There were three conditions to the agreement: check in with the police; pay a \"donation\" to the chief; and commit no crimes in St. Paul. Check-in was at the Savoy Hotel downtown. A great deal of \"business\" was taken care of at the \"Green Lantern\" speakeasy near the train station in Lowertown. It was also known for illegal gaming. More got done in the caves across the river from downtown. In 1930 the local mob even arranged that St. Paul's new police chief would be Tom Brown. The \"Agreement\" lasted through the prohibition until 1935. In that time St. Paul welcomed John Dillinger, Billie Frechette, Ma Barker, Baby Face Nelson, Alvin Karpis, Machine Gun Kelly, Kid Cann and many of their Irish associates. Barker's gang resided a block south of the city line on Robert St.. Karpis is quoted as saying, \u201cThere was probably never before as complete a gathering of criminals in one room in the United States, as there was in the Green Lantern on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1931. There were escapees from every U.S. Penitentiary. I was dazzled.\u201d  Al Capone and Bonnie and Clyde are known to have called on the city also.  According to crime historian Paul Maccabee the only criminal there is no record of visiting St. Paul during this period is Pretty Boy Floyd.  Events in 1935 changed the St. Paul police department and closed St. Paul's open doors.On August 20, 1904, severe thunderstorms and tornadoes damaged hundreds of downtown buildings, causing $1.78 million ($50.65 million today) in damages and ripping spans from the High Bridge.WWII  On the morning of December 7, 1941, the USS Ward was manned by naval reservists. It had a crew of 115, of whom at least 85 were from St. Paul. Duty that morning was patrolling the entrance of Pearl Harbor, T.H. The watch caught sight of a periscope trailing a freighter into the harbor and the Ward took action against the unknown intruder. The crew became the first Americans to fire their weapons in WWII. A 4\"/50 gun from the ship can be seen on the state capitol grounds. WWII brought into being the second USS St. Paul. This time the city had a Baltimore-class cruiser bearing its name. That ship's bell is on display in Saint Paul's city hall.\nDuring the 1960s, in conjunction with urban renewal, Saint Paul razed neighborhoods west of downtown for the creation of the interstate freeway system. From 1959 to 1961, the Rondo Neighborhood was demolished for the construction of Interstate 94. The loss of that African American enclave brought attention to racial segregation and unequal housing in northern cities. The annual Rondo Days celebration commemorates the African American community.Downtown St. Paul had skyscraper-building booms beginning in the 1970s. Because the city center is directly beneath the flight path into the airport across the river there is a height restriction for all construction. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and Sibley Towers), The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were constructed in the late 1980s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition of bringing new immigrant groups to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Saint Paul is the location of the Hmong Archives.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSaint Paul's history and growth as a landing port are tied to water. The city's defining physical characteristic, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, was carved into the region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys. The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.\nThe Mississippi River forms a municipal boundary on part of the city's west, southwest, and southeast sides. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, lies to the west. Falcon Heights, Lauderdale, Roseville, and Maplewood are north, with Maplewood lying to the east. The cities of West Saint Paul and South Saint Paul are to the south, as are Lilydale, Mendota, and Mendota Heights, although across the river from the city. The city's largest lakes are Pig's Eye Lake, which is part of the Mississippi, Lake Phalen, and Lake Como. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 56.18 square miles (145.51 km2), of which 51.98 square miles (134.63 km2) is land and 4.20 square miles (10.88 km2) is water.The Parks and Recreation department is responsible for 160 parks and 41 recreation centers. The city ranked #2 in park access and quality, after only Minneapolis, in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the top 100 park systems across the United States according to the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nSaint Paul's Department of Planning and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into seventeen Planning Districts, created in 1979 to allow neighborhoods to participate in governance and use Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement directly from the city, the councils share a pool of funds. The councils have significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they organize residents. The boundaries are adjusted depending on population changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods. Though these neighborhoods changed over time, preservationists have saved many of their historically significant structures.\nThe city's seventeen Planning Districts are:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSaint Paul has a continental climate typical of the Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, while summers are warm to hot and humid. On the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Saint Paul falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa). The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog.Due to its northerly location in the United States and lack of large bodies of water to moderate the air, Saint Paul is sometimes subjected to cold Arctic air masses, especially during late December, January, and February. The average annual temperature of 47.05 \u00b0F (8.36 \u00b0C) gives the Minneapolis\u2212Saint Paul metropolitan area the coldest annual mean temperature of any major metropolitan area in the continental U.S.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants from about 400 A.D. were members of the Hopewell tradition who buried their dead in mounds (now Indian Mounds Park) on the bluffs above the river. The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century who fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation. The Ojibwe would later occupy the north (east) bank of the Mississippi River.\nBy 1800, French-Canadian explorers came through the region and attracted fur traders to the area. Fort Snelling and nearby Pig's Eye Tavern also brought the first Yankees from New England and English, Irish, and Scottish immigrants who had enlisted in the army and settled nearby after discharge. These early settlers and entrepreneurs built houses on the heights north of the river. The first wave of immigration came with the Irish who settled at Connemara Patch along the Mississippi, named for their home in Connemara Ireland. The Irish would become prolific in politics, city governance, and public safety, much to the chagrin of the Germans and French who had grown into the majority. In 1850, the first of many groups of Swedish immigrants passed through Saint Paul on their way to farming communities in northern and western regions of the territory. A large group settled in Swede Hollow, which would later become home to Poles, Italians, and Mexicans. The last Swedish presence had moved up Saint Paul's East Side along Payne Avenue in the 1950s.In terms of people who specified European ancestry in the 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey, the city was 26.4% German, 13.8% Irish, 8.4% Norwegian, 7.0% Swedish, and 6.2% English. There is also a visible community of people of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, representing 4.2% of Saint Paul's population. By the 1980s, the Thomas Dale area, once an Austro-Hungarian enclave known as Frogtown (German: Froschburg), became home to Vietnamese people who had left their war-torn country. A settlement program for the Hmong diaspora came soon after, and by 2000, the Saint Paul Hmong were the largest urban contingent in the United States. Mexican immigrants have settled in Saint Paul's West Side since the 1930s, and have grown enough that Mexico opened a foreign consulate in 2005.The majority of residents claiming religious affiliation are Christian, split between the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. The Roman Catholic presence comes from Irish, German, Scottish, and French Canadian settlers who, in time, would be bolstered by Hispanic immigrants. There are Jewish synagogues such as Mount Zion Temple and relatively small populations of Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists. The city has been dubbed \"paganistan\" due to its large Wiccan population.As of the 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, White Americans made up 66.5% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 62.1% were non-Hispanic whites, down from 93.6% in 1970. Blacks or African Americans made up 13.9% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 13.5% were non-Hispanic blacks. American Indians made up 0.8% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 0.6% were non-Hispanic. Asian Americans made up 12.3% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 12.2% were non-Hispanic. Pacific Islander Americans made up less than 0.1% of Saint Paul's population. Individuals of other races made up 3.4% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 0.2% were non-Hispanic. Individuals from two or more races made up 3.1% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 2.6% were non-Hispanic. In addition, Hispanics and Latinos made up 8.7% of Saint Paul's population.\nAs of the 2000 U.S. Census, there were 287,151 people, 112,109 households, and 60,999 families residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 67.0% White, 11.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 12.4% Asian (mostly Hmong), 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.8% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 7.9% of the population.\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 285,068 people, 111,001 households, and 59,689 families residing in the city. The population density was 5,484.2 inhabitants per square mile (2,117.5/km2). There were 120,795 housing units at an average density of 2,323.9 per square mile (897.3/km2).

St. Jude Medical, a manufacturer of medical devices, is directly across the northern border of Saint Paul in Little Canada, though the company's address is listed in Saint Paul.The city was home to the Ford Motor Company's Twin Cities Assembly Plant, which opened in 1924 and closed at the end of 2011. The plant was in Highland Park on the Mississippi River, adjacent to Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River, which generates hydroelectric power. The site is now being cleared of all buildings and tested for contamination to prepare for redevelopment. As the lead developer, the Ryan Company has released a proposed set of zoning changes that will shape how the land will be used.The city of Saint Paul has financed city development by use of tax increment financing (TIF). In 2018, the city had 55 TIF districts. Some projects that have benefited from TIF funding include the St. Paul Saints stadium, and the affordable housing along the Twin Cities Metro Green Line.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nEvery January, Saint Paul hosts the Saint Paul Winter Carnival, a tradition that began in 1886 when a New York reporter called Saint Paul \"another Siberia\". The organizers had a model in Montreal Winter Carnival the year before. The event has now been held 135 times  with an attendance of 350,000. It includes an ice sculpting competition, a snow sculpting competition, a medallion treasure hunt, food, activities, and an ice palace when it can be arranged. The Como Zoo and Conservatory and adjoining Japanese Garden are popular year-round. The historic Landmark Center in downtown Saint Paul hosts cultural and arts organizations. The city's recreation sites include Indian Mounds Park, Battle Creek Regional Park, Harriet Island Regional Park, Highland Park, the Wabasha Street Caves, Lake Como, Lake Phalen, and Rice Park, as well as several areas abutting the Mississippi River. The Irish Fair of Minnesota is held annually at the Harriet Island Pavilion area. The country's largest Hmong American sports festival, the Freedom Festival, is held the first weekend of July at McMurray Field near Como Park.\nThe city is associated with the Minnesota State Fair in neighboring Falcon Heights just west of Como Park. The fair dates to before statehood. With the competing interests of Minneapolis and St. Paul, it was held on \"neutral ground\" between both.  That area refused to become part of St. Paul or Roseville and became Falcon Heights in the 1950s. The University of Minnesota Saint Paul Campus is actually in Falcon Heights. \nFort Snelling is often identified as being in St. Paul but is actually its own unorganized territory. The eastern part of Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory (MSP included) has a St. Paul mailing address. The western side has a Minneapolis ZIP code. \n\nSaint Paul is the birthplace of cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, who lived in Merriam Park from infancy until 1960. Schulz's Peanuts inspired giant, decorated sculptures around the city, a Chamber of Commerce promotion in the late 1990s. Other notable residents include writer F. Scott Fitzgerald and playwright August Wilson, who premiered many of the ten plays in his Pittsburgh Cycle at the local Penumbra Theater.The Ordway Center for the Performing Arts hosts theater productions and the Minnesota Opera is a founding tenant. RiverCentre, attached to Xcel Energy Center, serves as the city's convention center. The city has contributed to the music of Minnesota and the Twin Cities music scene through various venues. Great jazz musicians have passed through the influential Artists' Quarter, first established in the 1970s in Whittier, Minneapolis, and moved to downtown Saint Paul in 1994. Artists' Quarter also hosts the Soapboxing Poetry Slam, home of the 2009 National Poetry Slam Champions. At The Black Dog, in Lowertown, many French or European jazz musicians (Evan Parker, Tony Hymas, Beno\u00eet Delbecq, Fran\u00e7ois Corneloup) have met Twin Cities musicians and started new groups touring in Europe. Groups and performers such as Fantastic Merlins, Dean Magraw/Davu Seru, Merciless Ghosts, and Willie Murphy are regulars. The Turf Club in Midway has been a music scene landmark since the 1940s. Saint Paul is also the home base of the internationally acclaimed Rose Ensemble. As an Irish stronghold, the city boasts popular Irish pubs with live music, such as Shamrocks, The Dubliner, and O'Gara's. The internationally acclaimed Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the nation's only full-time professional chamber orchestra. The Minnesota Centennial Showboat on the Mississippi River began in 1958 with Minnesota's first centennial celebration.Saint Paul hosts a number of museums, including the University of Minnesota's Goldstein Museum of Design, the Minnesota Children's Museum, the Schubert Club Museum of Musical Instruments, the Minnesota Museum of American Art, the Traces Center for History and Culture, the Minnesota History Center, the Alexander Ramsey House, the James J. Hill House, the Minnesota Transportation Museum, the Science Museum of Minnesota, and the Twin City Model Railroad Museum.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe Saint Paul division of Parks and Recreation runs over 1,500 organized sports teams.Saint Paul hosts a number of professional, semi-professional, and amateur sports teams. The Minnesota Wild play their home games in downtown Saint Paul's Xcel Energy Center, which opened in 2000. The Wild brought the NHL back to Minnesota for the first time since 1993, when the Minnesota North Stars left the state for Dallas, Texas. (The World Hockey Association's Minnesota Fighting Saints played in Saint Paul from 1972 to 1977.) Citing the history of hockey in the Twin Cities and teams at all levels, Sports Illustrated called Saint Paul the new Hockeytown U.S.A. in 2007.The Xcel Energy Center, a multipurpose entertainment and sports venue, can host concerts and accommodate nearly all sporting events. It occupies the site of the demolished Saint Paul Civic Center. The Xcel Energy Center hosts the Minnesota high school boys hockey tournament, the Minnesota high school girls' volleyball tournament, and concerts throughout the year. In 2004, it was named the best overall sports venue in the US by ESPN.\n\nThe St. Paul Saints is the city's independent league baseball team. There have been several different teams called the Saints over the years. Founded in 1884, they were shut down in 1961 after the Minnesota Twins moved to Bloomington. The St. Paul Saints were brought back in 1993 as an independent baseball team in the Northern League, moving to the American Association in 2006. Their home games are played at the open-air CHS Field in downtown's Lowertown Historic District. Four noted Major League All-Star baseball players are natives of Saint Paul: Hall of Fame outfielder Dave Winfield, Hall of Fame infielder Paul Molitor, Hall of Fame pitcher Jack Morris, and first baseman Joe Mauer. The all-black St. Paul Colored Gophers played four seasons in Saint Paul from 1907 to 1911.The St. Paul Twin Stars of the National Premier Soccer League play their home games at Macalester Stadium.

Minnesota's oldest athletic organization, the Minnesota Boat Club, resides in the Mississippi River on Raspberry Island. Saint Paul is also home to Circus Juventas, the largest circus arts school in North America.On March 25, 2015, Major League Soccer announced that it had awarded its 23rd MLS franchise to Minnesota United FC, a team from the lower-level North American Soccer League. Bill McGuire and his ownership group, which includes Jim Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, Glen Taylor of the Minnesota Timberwolves, former Minnesota Wild investor Glen Nelson, and his daughter Wendy Carlson Nelson of the Carlson hospitality company, had intended to build a privately financed soccer-specific stadium in Downtown Minneapolis near the Minneapolis Farmer's Market. But their plan was met with heavy opposition from former Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, who said her city was suffering from \"stadium fatigue\" after building three stadiums, for the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota Vikings and the Minnesota Golden Gophers, within a six-year span. On July 1, 2015, after failing to reach an agreement with the city of Minneapolis, McGuire and his partners turned their focus to Saint Paul.On October 23, 2015, Bill McGuire of Minnesota United FC and former Saint Paul Mayor Chris Coleman announced that a privately financed soccer-specific stadium would be built on the vacant Metro Transit bus barn site in Saint Paul's Midway neighborhood near the intersection of Snelling Avenue and University Avenue. It is midway between downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis. The stadium, Allianz Field, opened in April 2019 and seats 19,400. The team began playing in the MLS in 2017.On May 15, 2018, the Minnesota Whitecaps joined the National Women's Hockey League as their fifth franchise. Founded in 2004, the team originally played in the Western Women's Hockey League before going independent in 2010 when that league folded.

The team began playing in the NWHL in 2018.The Timberwolves, Twins, Vikings, and Lynx all play in Minneapolis.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nSaint Paul has a variation of the strong mayor\u2013council form of government. The mayor is the chief executive and chief administrative officer for the city and the seven-member city council is the legislative body. The mayor is elected by the entire city, while members of the city council are elected from seven different geographic wards of approximately equal population. Both the mayor and council members serve four-year terms. The current mayor is Melvin Carter (DFL), Saint Paul's first African-American mayor. Aside from Norm Coleman, who became a Republican during his second term, Saint Paul has not elected a Republican mayor since 1952.\n\nThe city is also the county seat of Ramsey County, named for Alexander Ramsey, the state's first governor. The county once spanned much of the present-day metropolitan area and was originally to be named Saint Paul County after the city. Today it is geographically the smallest county and the most densely populated. Ramsey is the only home rule county in Minnesota; the seven-member Board of Commissioners appoints a county manager whose office is in the combination city hall/county courthouse along with the Minnesota Second Judicial Courts. The nearby Law Enforcement Center houses the Ramsey County Sheriff's office.\n\n\n=== State and federal ===\n\nSaint Paul is the capital of the state of Minnesota. The city hosts the capitol building, designed by Saint Paul resident Cass Gilbert, and the House and Senate office buildings. The Minnesota Governor's Residence, which is used for some state functions, is on Summit Avenue. The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (affiliated with the Democratic Party) is headquartered in Saint Paul. Numerous state departments and services are also headquartered in Saint Paul, such as the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\nThe city is split into four Minnesota Senate districts (64, 65, 66 and 67) and eight Minnesota House of Representatives districts (64A, 64B, 65A, 65B, 66A, 66B, 67A and 67B), all of which are held by Democrats.Saint Paul is the heart of Minnesota's 4th congressional district, represented by Democrat Betty McCollum. The district has been in DFL hands without interruption since 1949. Minnesota is represented in the US Senate by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, a former Hennepin County Attorney, and Democrat Tina Smith, former Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota.\n\n*District also includes Falcon Heights, Lauderdale and Roseville.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nSaint Paul is second in the United States in the number of higher education institutions per capita, behind Boston. Higher education institutions that call Saint Paul home include three public and eight private colleges and universities and five post-secondary institutions. Well-known colleges and universities include the Saint Catherine University, Concordia University, Hamline University, Macalester College, and the University of St. Thomas. Metropolitan State University and Saint Paul College, which focus on non-traditional students, are based in Saint Paul, as well as a law school, Mitchell Hamline School of Law.The Saint Paul Public Schools district is the state's largest school district and serves approximately 39,000 students. The district is extremely diverse with students from families speaking 90 different languages, although only five languages are used for most school communication: English, Spanish, Hmong, Karen, and Somali. The district runs 82 different schools, including 52 elementary schools, twelve middle schools, seven high schools, ten alternative schools, and one special education school, employing over 6,500 teachers and staff. The school district also oversees community education programs for pre-K and adult learners, including Early Childhood Family Education, GED Diploma, language programs, and various learning opportunities for community members of all ages. In 2006, Saint Paul Public Schools celebrated its 150th anniversary. Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen by their families under Minnesota's open enrollment statute.A variety of K-12 private, parochial, and public charter schools are also represented in the city. In 1992, Saint Paul became the first city in the US to sponsor and open a charter school, now found in most states across the nation. Saint Paul is currently home to 21 charter schools as well as 38 private schools. The Saint Paul Public Library system includes a central library and twelve branch locations.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nResidents of Saint Paul can receive 10 broadcast television stations, five of which broadcast from within Saint Paul. One daily newspaper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, two weekly neighborhood newspapers, the East Side Review and City Pages (owned by The Star Tribune Company), and several monthly or semimonthly neighborhood papers serve the city. It was the only city in the United States with a population of 250,000 or more to see an increase in circulation of Sunday newspapers in 2007. Several media outlets based in neighboring Minneapolis also serve the Saint Paul community, including the Star Tribune. Saint Paul is home to Minnesota Public Radio, a three-format system that broadcasts on nearly 40 stations around the Midwest. MPR locally delivers news and information, classical, and The Current (which plays a wide variety of music). The station has 110,000 regional members and more than 800,000 listeners each week throughout the Upper Midwest, the largest audience of any regional public radio network. Also operating as part of American Public Media, MPR's programming reaches five million listeners, most notably through Live from Here, hosted by Chris Thile (previously known as A Prairie Home Companion, hosted by Garrison Keillor, who also lives in the city). The Fitzgerald Theater, renamed in 1994 for Saint Paul native and novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, is home to the show.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Interstate and roadways ===\n\nResidents use Interstate 35E running north\u2013south and Interstate 94 running east\u2013west. Trunk highways include U.S. Highway 52, Minnesota State Highway 280, and Minnesota State Highway 5. Saint Paul has several unique roads such as Ayd Mill Road, Phalen Boulevard and Shepard Road/Warner Road, which diagonally follow particular geographic features in the city. Biking is also gaining popularity, due to the creation of more paved bike lanes that connect to other bike routes throughout the metropolitan area and the creation of Nice Ride Minnesota, a seasonally operated nonprofit bicycle sharing and rental system that has over 1,550 bicycles and 170 stations in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Downtown Saint Paul has a five-mile (8 km) enclosed skyway system over twenty-five city blocks. The 563-mile (906 km) Avenue of the Saints connects Saint Paul with Saint Louis, Missouri.\nThe layout of city streets and roads has often drawn complaints. While he was Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and remarked that the streets were designed by \"drunken Irishmen\". He later apologized, though people had been complaining about the fractured grid system for more than a century by that point. Some of the city's road design is the result of the curve of the Mississippi River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate.\n\n\n=== Mass transit ===\n\nMetro Transit provides bus service and light rail in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area. The METRO Green Line is an 11-mile (18 km) light rail line that connects downtown Saint Paul to downtown Minneapolis with 14 stations in Saint Paul. The Green Line runs west along University Avenue, through the University of Minnesota campus, until it links up and then shares stations with the METRO Blue Line in downtown Minneapolis. Construction began in November 2010 and the line began service on June 14, 2014. Roughly 45,000 people rode on the first day; an average 28,000 riders are expected per day.Metro Transit opened the METRO A Line, Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul's first arterial bus rapid transit line, along Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway. The A Line connects the METRO Blue Line at 46th Street station to Rosedale Center with a connection at the Green Line Snelling Avenue station. The A Line is the first in a series of planned arterial bus rapid transit lines and is set to open in early 2016.\n\n\n=== Railroad ===\nAmtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops twice daily in each direction at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Depot. Ridership on the train increased about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. A Minnesota Department of Transportation study found that increased daily service to Chicago should be economically viable, especially if it originates in Saint Paul and does not experience delays from the rest of the western route of the Empire Builder. Saint Paul is the site of the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. There are several other small yards located around the city.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nHolman Airfield is across the river from downtown St Paul.  It is the location where Lamprey lake existed until it was filled in with dredgings by the Army Corps of Engineers starting in the early 1920's.  Northwest Airlines began initial operations from Holman in 1926.  During WWII Northwest had a contract to install upgraded radar systems in B-24s employing 5,000 at the airfield.  Post WWII Holman Airfield competed with the Speedway Field for the growing aviation industry in the twin cities and lost out in the end.  Today Holman is a reliever airport run by the Metropolitan Airports Commission. It is home to Minnesota's Air National Guard, a flight training school and is tailored to local corporate aviation. There are three runways, with the Holman Field Administration Building and Riverside Hangar on the National Register of Historic Places.  The historical importance of the Northwest Airlines original building was only realized after demolition had commenced.\nFor the most part Saint Paul's aviation needs are served by the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), which sits on 2,930 acres (11.9 km2) in the Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory bordering the city to the southwest. MPS serves three international, twelve domestic, seven charter, and four regional carriers and is a hub and home base for Delta Air Lines, Mesaba Airlines and Sun Country Airlines.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nSaint Paul has eight sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nWalter Abel (1898\u20131987), actor\nLoni Anderson (born 1946), actress\nLouie Anderson (born 1953), comedian\nWendell Anderson (1933\u20132016), US Senator\nRichard Arlen (1899\u20131976), actor\nRoger Awsumb (1928-2002), TV show host \"Casey Jones\"\nHarry Blackmun (1908\u20131999), US Supreme Court Associate Justice, grew up in St. Paul\nWinfield S.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The James J. Hill House in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, was built by railroad magnate James J. Hill.  The house, completed in 1891, is near the eastern end of Summit Avenue near the Cathedral of Saint Paul.  The house, for its time, was very large and was the \"showcase of St. Paul\" until James J. Hill's death in 1916.  It is listed as a U.S. National Historic Landmark, operated by the Minnesota Historical Society. It is also a contributing property to the Historic Hill District.The home has 36,000 square feet (3,344 square meters) of living area and 44,552 square feet of total space.\n\n\n== History ==\nHill bought three lots on Summit Avenue in 1882, during an era when wealthy citizens were scrambling to build fashionable homes in the neighborhood.  The street offered a commanding view of downtown St. Paul and the Mississippi River area, making it a highly desirable location.  The family previously lived in the Lowertown area in St. Paul, near Ninth and Canada streets.  As new warehouses and railroad tracks crowded the Lowertown residential area, and as Hill's collection of paintings and sculpture overflowed the house, the Hill family thought it was desirable to move.  Hill also realized that recent improvements in home technology, such as electric lighting, plumbing, ventilation, and fireproofing, could be incorporated into a new home.  Moreover, since Hill was becoming a socially prominent person in the community, a new home would stand as a tribute to his status as the \"Empire Builder\".\nThe house was designed by an East Coast architectural firm, Peabody, Stearns and Furber, at a time when other homes in the neighborhood were designed by local architects such as Clarence Johnston and Cass Gilbert.  The house was designed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, with a massive, rugged style featuring randomly sized blocks of stone, sturdy pillars, rounded arches, and a generally strong horizontal emphasis.  Hill supervised the design and construction closely.  As an example, when the Lewis Comfort Tiffany Company submitted designs for the stained glass windows, Hill replied that they were, \"anything but what I want,\" and the job went to A.B. Cutter and Company of Boston.  Later, in 1889, Hill fired the architects because they had overridden his orders to the stonecutters in Massachusetts, and hired the Boston firm of Irving and Casson to finish the project.  The St. Paul Pioneer Press reviewed the house just before it was completed in 1891, saying:\n\nSolid, substantial, roomy, and comfortable is the new home of James J. Hill and family. ... There has been no attempt at display, no desire to flaunt an advertisement of wealth in the eyes of the world.  Just a family home ... impressive, fine, even grand in the simplicity of design, but after all a St. Paul home.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe interior features an art gallery that housed Hill's collection of painting and sculpture.  It even had a pipe organ, installed after someone suggested to Hill that other wealthy people had pipe organs in their homes.  The house had a hybrid system of gas and electric lighting, with rotary switches on the walls to turn on the electric lights.  However, there were no electrical outlets installed, because during that era electricity was only used for lighting.  The woodwork in the house is very intricate, with hand-carved woodworking in the central hallway, the formal dining room, and the music room.  Other rooms in the house, particularly on the second floor where most of the family members lived, do not have hand carved woodwork, but the woodwork is still richly colored and nicely detailed.\n\nThe first floor, in addition to the art gallery, music room, hall, and formal dining room previously mentioned, also had a library, a drawing room, and Mr. Hill's home office.  The second floor contained Mr. and Mrs. Hill's rooms, two guest rooms, and rooms for their five daughters, Gertrude, Rachel, Clara, Ruth, and Charlotte.  The third floor contained rooms for their sons James, Walter, and Louis (who later succeeded his father as president of the Great Northern Railway).  It also had a room that served as a gymnasium and school room for the children, as well as quarters for the servants.\n\n\n== Later history ==\nAfter James J. Hill died in 1916 and his wife died in 1921, the children eventually moved out.  In 1925, four of the daughters purchased the house from the estate and donated it to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis.  The church used it for the next fifty-three years as space for offices, residences, and a teacher's college for women.  The church preserved it well and did not make any significant alterations, although most of the original furniture was sold during this period.  In 1961, the United States Department of the Interior designated the house a National Historic Landmark.  The Minnesota Historical Society acquired the house in 1978, after the Archdiocese consolidated its offices elsewhere.  The house has been restored and is now open for tours.\n\n\n== Photo gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of National Historic Landmarks in Minnesota\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Ramsey County, Minnesota\n\n\n== References ==\n\nJohnson, Craig (1993).

          "Great job by Sophie our host. She gave us a great tour of the location, told us about the history and the family. If you have some time it is worth the stop. The house was way ahead of its time for the era. James Hill was an interesting person who was very well off .",
          "This house was certainly built to impress, no money spared! Great location, prime site on its street with equally impressive neighbours. It would seem that James Hill didn\u2019t actually spend much time in the house as he was a workaholic but his wife did, sharing her time between",

          "This house was certainly unique and interesting at every turn. Beautiful wood features, and typical classic styling of turn of the century Robber Barons' homes. Enjoyed learning about James Hill and the home itself. Only downside was that the tour seemed rushed. Guide was always",
          "While I enjoyed Summit Avenue and this historic home, I personally disliked this approach to seeing the house: 1 1/2 hour tour with a control-freak of a tour guide. \"Don't step there...Stop at landing...Don't look in that room till I say you can.\" The house needs more period",
          "Our family loves taking a tour of the James J Hill house! Our guide was great and did an amazing job of sharing the history of the house with us. Our 10 year old was entertained the entire time it was a little long for our 5 year old to handle but they did a great job of trying",
          "James Hill started his life working on the docks and built an incredible empire. This house was outfitted with the cutting edge of technology for its day. The tour covered about 80% of the house and included a short video on the life of James Hill. Well worth the visit.",
          "It is an spectactular home that was way ahead of its time in terms of electicity and heating. It shows the opulence of the Gilded Age but also the sense that this was still just a home. The grand staircase, the concert hall/gallery with the beautiful organ that still works,",
          "We have been here twice. My 11 and 12 year old enjoyed it. The first tour guide we had was excellent. She told a lot of history, was very informative, and had great stories that kept us interrested and made the whole tour! Second tour guide was ok, she lacked the stories, didn't",

          "The first floor of the mansion was clearly made for entertaining and impressing others. The 2nd & 3rd floors I was disappointed at the lack of furniture in the rooms and the lack of descriptions of the rooms, specifically the master bedroom. There are also several areas closed",

        "wiki": "The Wabasha Street Caves is an event hall built into the sandstone caves located on the south shore of the Mississippi River in downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota. The caves have been home to mobsters, speakeasies, and in more recent years have begun hosting a \"Swing Night\" on Thursday nights with live big-band music. The Wabasha Street Caves also provide historical tours of the sandstone caves in Saint Paul, Minnesota.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe caves, which technically are mines because they are manmade, are carved out of sandstone and date back to the 1840s.  Throughout history the caves have been used for a number of different activities, including growing mushrooms, storage of food and belongings, music, and dancing.In the 1920s, the caves were used as a restaurant and nightclub venue known as the Wabasha Street Speakeasy. The speakeasy was said to have been frequented by gangsters such as John Dillinger and Ma Barker, however there is no evidence that these visits occurred; thus, these stories are considered legend.On October 26, 1933, Josie & William Lehmann opened the Castle Royal, which was built into the side of the caves.  Castle Royal was closed in the late 1930s due to the start of World War II and went back to primarily being a place to grow mushrooms.  Some time in the 1970s, Castle Royal 2 was opened as a venue for Disco music.  The caves have also been used as a place of storage for debris and belongings that were washed up from flooding.  Some of these things can still be found in the caves today.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWabasha Street Caves Website",

          "We went to the Sunday tour of the Caves, and it was packed! It was a great tour with a lot of history. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and an animated story teller. I do not want to give it all away in this review, so I suggest you visit! Well worth the $8 price of admission",

          "It was fun to see it. Quite unique. Easy to get to. Went to dance to a great band, but unfortunately there were several hundred people there and few in any knew how to really dance. Many young dancers who were really quite rude on the floor. People lacking dance skills often",
          "Pay a modest fee and for 45 minutes a guide shows you around the place, tells you some stories about glass-making, mushrooms, gangsters, prohibition, and historic geology. They also have dances and a bar--in a cool historic underground speakeasy. I think it would be more fun to",

          "This was a very interesting tour. It is not a real cave but all man made caves. It was part of history of the area and the caves put to use a lot of ways. They have gangster tours if you prefer those, since gangsters were allowed to stay (protected) in the city if they did not",
          "I went to Wabasha Street Caves thinking it would be like most other caves I have been to, not that that's a bad thing. I was surprised to see this cave is very different. It may not be as pretty as the other caves, but what these lack in beauty, stalagtites and stalagmites, it",

          "We normally take a ghost tour in the city we are visiting, its entertainment for an evening and a way of hearing those stories that are not usually told in a day walking tour. At the very minimum I expect to be entertained, this tour fell way below that threshold. It was just",
          "Booked this tour for myself and my husband for a fun date night. Tickets are $25 per person for a two hour tour. Our tour had two guides. While the male guide was entertaining and kept the evening rolling, his female coguide was a little uneven in the delivery of her stories.",

          "We enjoyed hearing all about the history of this cave, also seeing the inside walls and pictures were very interesting too.",
          "Be sure to wear a jacket or sweater & wear thick soled shoes. It is amazing how quickly you can get chilled in this cave. Great & interesting history. Guides are very knowledgeable. Ask about the Gangster Tour, too. In the Fall, ask about the Ghost Tour. This company is a gem",
          "This was a very unique experience. The caves were very cool, and our guide did a great job explaining the history of the place. We read somewhere that the tour guides dressed up in clothing from that period but I was a bit disappointed that our guide didn't dress up. However,",
          "The tour of the caves (about 6 or 8 sandstone rooms) is very entertaining. The tour guides are all actors dressed in period clothing and they give a humorous review of each room and its uses from prohibition, to mushroom production, curing cheese, all the way through the 70s",
          "We did a cave tour followed by a tour of all the gangster homes in the area. If you have never been to the Twin Cities, I think you'd really enjoy it.",
          "The tour guide was great!! Very energetic and knowledgable about the caves. A lot of great and interesting history behind these caves. We took the Light Rail into Saint Paul. Exited at Union Depot. Spent an hour at the Farmer's Market and then walked over the bridge to the caves",
          "We visited this cave just for something different to do in the Twin Cities. I was a bit ho-hum about going as the gangsters of the 1930's didn't really interest me at all. Was I ever wrong. We had an excellent tour guide and the information and history he told us was",
          "I went on this tour not knowing what to expect. The tour was only $6 (cash only) and led by an energetic guide who knew a lot about the history of St. Paul, the caves, and the time of prohibition. The inside is actually a night club, which I wasn't expecting. Much of it is",
          "What a neat place!! We thoroughly enjoyed the tour and especially our guide, \"Edna.\" Not only did we have her for the cave tour, but she was our guide on the Gangster bus tour. She was awesome and the trip went by so fast! We loved learning history in such a fun way! Looking",
          "The history of the caves including the use as growing mushrooms and visits by gangsters during prohibition was very interesting. The talk about \"ghosts\" and other mysteries was unnecessarily corny. The weak minded in our group even thought that they \"saw or experienced\"",
          "This unique bar and restaurant in caves was once a speakeasy where Dillinger hung out! The tour and mystery play are well done even if the dinner is a bit bland and unexceptional. This place is perfect for a group meeting or conference attendee event. Be sure to bring a sweater",
          "The tours are conducted by a fellow in a suit and hat of the period most talked about, the 'gangster' period of St Paul. He talks about the caves of course, and the formation, but everyone wants to know what went on when it was a speakeasy and the tours don't disappoint.",
          "We opted for the traditional tour and really enjoyed it. The cave is full of gangster stories and a surprisingly rich history. A solid choice for 40 minutes of fun for a relatively small price with the pay off of a being a quintessential St. Paul attraction. Snoopy's sad state",
          "Best lattes at coffee prices! Friendly cute coffee shop! But be mindful of the cave tours! ! The line gets long! But, they are quick to keep things moving. This cozy shop IS NOT open gas station hours... it more like extended McDonald's Breakfast hours!",
          "We went on the general historic caves tour. It was very interesting and has a lot of wonderful history behind it. It also costs only $6 dollars a person for a 45 min tour. We are surely planing on going again some day for the ghost tour. The tour lady was very theatrical. :)",
          "I was looking for something I'd not seen before, being that I have family in St. Paul, the tour of the Wabasha Caves was just that. As a adolescent in the 60'sI had snuck inside the caves through a small opening with some friends which was before they had to tell people to stay",
          "We started out with the cave tour that took about an hour. Departing from the coffee shop on the premises, the small group gathered with beverages and delicious home-made cookies. Our guide was very friendly and explained how the caves came to be. The history behind these doors",
          "Awful 2 hour bus tour. Should be called the 2 hour bus tour with stories they took from a book. Started with us loading the bus (late) and then driving a block from the health partners parking lot to the cave parking lot. Really... we couldn't walk? Spent some time in the",

          "You might be thinking \"caves, so what?\" There is a lot of history here if you're interested in the history of St. Paul and gangsters. The tour is a good length and very cheap. If you're debating on visiting or passing on this attraction, stop and take the tour. Tours are",
          "We went for a tour of the caves in the morning and the tour guide was very knowledgeable. The history of the caves was fascinating. Who knew St Paul was so popular with 1930's gangsters!? I then attended my sister's wedding there that evening. The atmosphere is wonderful!",
          "I had not heard of this attraction until a friend told me about it. A very interesting and enjoyable experience. I recommend it.",
          "The Wabasha Street Caves is a visit into the history of St. Paul. The caves are impressive but the tour guide was the best. She was acting and told the story with a lot of humor. Also nice to visit with kids. Next time we will take the criminal tour!",
          "Went on the 30-40 min cave tour which explained the history of caves. Although I have lived in the Twin Cities for over 15 years now, and knew about the caves, I didn't realize all the history behind them. It was fun to hear the stories. For $6 it wasn't anything fancy, but was",
          "They're not caves, they're old mines that were subsequently used as a night club frequented by gangsters. After that, they were used as storage. We also took the Gangster tour and the two tours combined ran about 3 hours--a little too long for my taste.",
          "That was when Disco was a big deal and there was a group of gay people that opened up a Bar in these caves and it was a fun place to hang out, but there were rules and regulations that had to be followed. No entering into the closed doors to the caves back in the rear of the",
          "The Caves used to be a good outing on Thursdays, but now management and ownership have implemented new policies without updating their website and utilize non-uniformed, non-identifiable enforcement staff. An orange vest or a sign would have been sufficient, instead there's an",
          "My boyfriend and I were back in Minnesota for a visit. I wanted to find a unique thing for us to do in the Cities since we'd been to Minneapolis and St. Paul several times but never visit as tourists. We settled on a Thursday tour of the Wabasha Street Caves with a plan to stay",
          "This place was a cool tour and well worth the money. Intersting mushroom shaped doorways and tales of gangster shootouts. This place is a real gem. There is something cool about going into an old cave that has been fashioned into a cool resteraunt. Kevin Garnett even spent",
          "Nobody knows! In fact nobody knows lots of stuff about that particular era in Saintly City -- 'cos it wasn't that saintly see... But if you go on The Gangster Tour and down into the caves with Babyface Nelson (shhhh don't tell him I called him that) or Dillinger, you'll get the",
          "Tried to book this tour for the last 2 years, but it has been sold out. This year we remembered to book the Caves and Graves tour over a month early. It was pathetic. First they had us waiting in the cold to get on a bus in the parking lot. They called us by names and then",

          "The food was catered, and not too bad. The discussion and tour of the caves was very interesting, and well worth the fee. It included a tour of the St. Paul area, with a verbose guide telling us all about the gangster period in the city.",
          "We went to the Caves as part of a historical tour of St Paul so we heard all about the Prohibition times and the parties here in the caves. Really interesting. And the ghosts that sit on the barstools are REAL!",
          "I was disappointed in the tour. There just really isn't much to them. A few rooms where there was a nightclub. A bit of history. But too much money for a somewhat boring tour.",
          "Cross a bridge and enter into a piece of St Paul's history. The caves are just below downtown St Paul along limestone cliffs near the river banks. Many caves have been closed off but there is a tour available . They were the scene of bootlegger activities during prohibition.",
          "I have lived in St Paul over 30 years, but I learned a lot about my town on these tours. St Paul is peaceful now, but it has a wild gangster past. The tour guide was an actor playing the part of one of the old gangsters. He was great. I took out of state guests on it, but it",

          "Take this tour before you do the gangster tour which is at the same place. Allow 3 hours for both. It was very entertaining and interesting to hear the facts of the cave, and our tour guide did a great job of telling us the history of the cave.",
          "This place has a lot of history, including gangsters, but today is a fun location for dances.",
          "If you're ever looking for something to do, this is a very family friendly activity for a pretty cheap price. My husband and I went there one evening and just went through the tour. It was fun and informational. We havne't tried the little restaraunt, but it looks cute. I'd also",
          "Interesting history with mining, shrooms, then manmade for events, dancing etc. When it's dark half the year in St. P. why not go underground. The haunted tour was interesting. the actors took the experience to commercially comical level, to fake for me, but perfect for kids!",
          "I mean that in every sense, too. The mushroom caves are a little chilly, and a light jacket is recommended when taking the tour. Included in the tour, is the history of the caves and the night club which was known as the Castle Royale. It was THE place for the gangster high life",
          "It was OK for $6.00. The caves are man made. They mined silica back in the 1800's for glass. Well when that was done they grew mushrooms there. Then it became a speak easy and later a nightclub. Now they give tours and it is an event center. It is supposed to be haunted.",
          "Every Thursday is Swing Night. Live music from amazing swing bands. The atmosphere is wonderful, the place is always active, and you even can get a short dancing lesson if you get there early in the evening.",
          "This is a one of a kind experience. Nothing like it if you are not claustrophobic. Makes any event memorable and special.",
          "Visited these caves in my own backyard when a friend visited from out of state. We enjoyed the tour and the historic bit unique to St. Paul - glad we had the tour.",
          "The history of what they were used for is another insight into socio-political stuff, in the era of the gangs in particular. And before refrigeration you had to keep stuff like beer cool, and them some. Fascinating to see how we adapted and modified a natural structure over",
          "We checked out Wabasha Street Caves for our wedding reception...uhmmm, no! Too dark and creepy for a joyous occasion like that, unless you are the Bonnie and Clyde type. Plus our guests would have all been seated in different rooms. Strange place.",
          "I would not put this at the top of my list but it is interesting. If you have done some of the other top things in Minneapolis/St.Paul then this may be worth your time.",
          "They offer swing dancing on Thursday evenings. It's literally in a cave so there's no smoking, which is nice because I hate when you go to a bar and reak like smoke afterwards.",

          "We went on the Historic Cave Tour, which costs $7 and gives you a brief history of the caves and a couple of gangster and ghost stories. If you\u2019re going just to hear the gangster stories, take the gangster tour instead but if you want a little bit of everything that\u2019s the tour",

          "What a neat little place. There is so much history packed into these little caves from gangsters, to bootlegging. The tour is well worth the $5. Just seeing the old bar gives you an old school feeling. I'm not one for dancing but I'd love to check the place out after hours.",
          "Our son and daughter in law just moved to St. Paul and this was our first time visiting them. They took us to the street caves for the first time and we had so much fun. First of all, in any tour, the guide always has the chance to make the activity so much more fun...and in",
          "Our tour guide was great. She totally made the experience worthwhile with her humor she incorporated along with the history of the caves. We were told that numerous people had found orbs of light in their photos, the place is reported to be haunted. You get to see bullet holes",
          "This was my first trip here. I was very impressed with our tour and terrific and animated tour guide. Not sure of her name but she was fantastic. The background history was fantastic along with the stories. After the tour we left to eat and then came back for the swing dance.",
          "We took the 45 minute, $5 tour. We were looking for something that kept everyones interest. Our teenaged daughter did not roll her eyes at all! Our 10 year old son thought it was quite an adventure. We all learned a bit of history and it was fun. The staff was polite,",

It was designed by Willoughby J. Edbrooke, who served as Supervising Architect of the U.S. Treasury Department in 1891\u201392. Edbrooke designed a body of public architecture, much of which, like this structure, was completed after his 1896 death. Landmark Center stands at 75 West Fifth Street in Rice Park and is now an arts and culture center.\nThe exterior is pink granite ashlar with a hipped red tile roof, steeply pitched to shed snow and adorned by numerous turrets, gables and dormers with steeply peaked roofs; cylindrical corner towers with conical turrets occupy almost every change of projection. There are two massive towers, one of which houses a clock. The exterior is almost devoid of carved detail. The interior features a five-story courtyard with skylight and rooms with 20-foot ceilings, appointed with marble and carved mahogany and oak finishes. Its Romanesque Revival architecture is similar to Edbrooke's Old Post Office Building in Washington D.C.\nJohn Dillinger's girlfriend Evelyn Frechette, Alvin \"Creepy\" Karpis, \"Doc\" Barker and other members of the Barker-Karpis gang were tried in the building when it served as a federal courthouse.Judges Walter Henry Sanborn and John B. Sanborn, Jr. kept their chambers here while serving on the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun worked in the building as a law clerk to the younger Sanborn in 1932\u201333.\nIn the 1970s, a citizens' group saved the building from demolition and restored it to its previous grandeur. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places and reopened to the public as Landmark Center in 1978.\n\nAfter its comprehensive 1972\u201378 renovation, the center became home to many prominent Twin Cities arts organizations, now including: \n\nAmerican Association of Woodturners and the AAW Gallery of Wood Art\nRamsey County Historical Society Gallery and Research Center \u2013 changing exhibits and research area for local history topics\nThe Schubert Club Museum of musical instruments\nLandmark Gallery \u2013 permanent and temporary exhibits from its local history collection\n\"Uncle Sam Worked Here\" \u2013 a permanent interactive exhibit opened in 2007 about activities in Landmark Center over its history [1]\nExhibition space for music, dance, theater, and public forums.For a time the high school St. Paul Conservatory for Performing Artists also held classes on the fifth floor. It has since moved to 16 West 5th Street. The fifth floor now houses the offices of the American Composers Forum.\nOwned by Ramsey County, Landmark Center is managed by Minnesota Landmarks, a not-for-profit organization. Landmark Center also houses Anita's Cafe, Landmarket Gift Shop, and five galleries.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Landmark Center (St. Paul, Minnesota) at Wikimedia Commons\nLandmark Center (official website)\nRamsey County Historical Society\nPress article from the St. Paul Pioneer Press about the \"Uncle Sam Worked Here\" exhibit",

        "wiki": "Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul is a major metropolitan area built around the Mississippi, Minnesota and St. Croix rivers in east central Minnesota. The area is commonly known as the Twin Cities after its two largest cities, Minneapolis, the most populous city in the state, and its neighbor to the east Saint Paul, the state capital. It is an example of twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity. Minnesotans living outside of Minneapolis and Saint Paul often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) simply as \"the Cities.\"\nThere are several different definitions of the region. Many refer to the Twin Cities as the seven-county region which is governed under the Metropolitan Council regional governmental agency and planning organization. The Office of Management and Budget officially designates 16 counties as the \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul\u2013Bloomington MN\u2013WI Metropolitan Statistical Area\", the 16th largest in the United States. The entire region known as the \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul MN\u2013WI Combined Statistical Area\", has a population of 4,014,593, the 16th largest, according to 2018 Census estimates.\nDespite the 'Twin' moniker, the cities are independent municipalities with defined borders. Minneapolis sits mostly on the west side of the Mississippi, and is somewhat more modern with a relatively young Downtown and trendy Uptown. Saint Paul, which sits mostly on the east side of the river, has been likened to an East Coast city, with quaint neighborhoods and a vast collection of well-preserved late-Victorian architecture. The distinct urban cultures of the cities led an observer to note that \"St. Paul is the last city of the East; Minneapolis the first city of the West.\"Minneapolis was influenced by its early Scandinavian and Lutheran heritage, while Saint Paul was influenced by its early French, Irish and German Catholic roots.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first European settlement in the region was near what is now known as the town of Stillwater, Minnesota. The city is approximately 20 miles (30 km) from downtown Saint Paul and lies on the western bank of the St. Croix River, which forms the border of central Minnesota and Wisconsin. Another settlement that began fueling early interest in the area was the outpost at Fort Snelling, which was constructed from 1820 to 1825 at the confluence of the Minnesota River and the Mississippi River.Fort Snelling held jurisdiction over the land south of Saint Anthony Falls, thus a town known as Saint Anthony grew just north of the river. For several years, the only European resident to live on the south bank of the river was Colonel John H. Stevens, who operated a ferry service across the river. As soon as the land area controlled by Fort Snelling was reduced, new settlers began flocking across to the new village of Minneapolis. The town grew quickly, and Minneapolis and Saint Anthony eventually merged. On the eastern side of the Mississippi, a few villages such as Pig's Eye and Lambert's Landing developed and would soon grow to become Saint Paul.\n\nNatural geography played a role in the settlement and development of the two cities. The Mississippi River Valley in this area is defined by a series of stone bluffs that line both sides of the river. Saint Paul grew up around Lambert's Landing, the last place to unload boats coming upriver at an easily accessible point, some seven miles (11 km) downstream from Saint Anthony Falls, the geographic feature that, due to the value of its immense water power for industry, defined the location of Minneapolis and its prominence as the Mill City. The falls can be seen today from the Mill City Museum, housed in the former Washburn \"A\" Mill, which was among the world's largest mills in its time.\nThe oldest farms in the state are located in Washington County, the easternmost county on the Minnesota side of the metropolitan area. Joseph Haskell was Minnesota's first farmer, harvesting the first crops in the state in 1840 on what is now part of Afton Township on Trading Post Trail.\n\nThe Grand Excursion, a trip into the Upper Midwest sponsored by the Rock Island Railroad, brought more than a thousand curious travelers into the area by rail and steamboat in 1854. The next year, in 1855, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published The Song of Hiawatha, an epic poem based on the Ojibwe legends of Hiawatha. A number of natural area landmarks were included in the story, such as Lake Minnetonka and Minnehaha Falls. Tourists inspired by the coverage of the Grand Excursion in eastern newspapers and those who read Longfellow's story flocked to the area in the following decades.\nAt one time, the region also had numerous passenger rail services, including both interurban streetcar systems and interstate rail. Due to the width of the river at points further south, the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area was briefly one of the few places where the Mississippi could be crossed by railroad. A great amount of commercial rail traffic also ran through the area, often carrying grain to be processed at mills in Minneapolis or delivering other goods to Saint Paul to be transported along the Mississippi. Saint Paul had long been at the head of navigation on the river, prior to a new lock and dam facility being added upriver in Minneapolis.\nPassenger travel hit its peak in 1888 with nearly eight million traversing to and from the Saint Paul Union Depot. This amounted to approximately 150 trains daily. Before long, other rail crossings were built farther south and travel through the region began to decline. In an effort by the rail companies to combat the rise of the automobile, some of the earliest streamliners ran from Chicago to Minneapolis/Saint Paul and eventually served distant points in the Pacific Northwest. Today, the only vestige of this interstate service comes by Amtrak's Seattle/Portland to Chicago Empire Builder route, running once daily in each direction. It is named after James J. Hill, a railroad tycoon who settled on Summit Avenue in Saint Paul at what is now known as the James J. Hill House.\nLike many Northern cities that grew up with the Industrial Revolution, Minneapolis and St. Paul experienced shifts in their economic base as heavy industry declined, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Along with the economic decline of the 60s and 70s came population decline in the central city areas, white flight to suburbs, and, in the summer of 1967, race riots on Minneapolis's North Side. By the 1980s and 1990s, however, Minneapolis and Saint Paul were frequently cited as former Rust Belt cities that had made successful transitions to service, high-technology, finance, and information economies.In May and June 2020, the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area became a focus of international attention as a MPD officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes. The killing sparked local, nationwide and international protests against racism and police brutality, bringing considerable spotlight on the MPD. Bob Kroll, head of the MPD union, characterized Floyd as a \"violent criminal\" and called the protests a \"terrorist movement\". In June 2020, Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender announced that the city should dismantle its police department and replace it with a \"transformative new model of public safety.\"\n\n\n=== Rivalry ===\nMinneapolis and Saint Paul have competed since they were founded, resulting in some duplication of effort. After Saint Paul completed its elaborate Cathedral in 1915, Minneapolis quickly followed up with the equally ornate Basilica of St. Mary in 1926. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the rivalry became so intense that an architect practicing in one city was often refused business in the other. The 1890 United States Census even led to the two cities arresting and/or kidnapping each other's census takers, in an attempt to keep either city from outgrowing the other.The rivalry could occasionally erupt into inter-city violence, as happened at a 1923 game between the Minneapolis Millers and the St. Paul Saints, both baseball teams of the American Association. In the 1950s, both cities competed for a major league baseball franchise (which resulted in two rival stadiums being built), and there was a brief period in the mid-1960s where the two cities could not agree on a common calendar for daylight saving time, resulting in a period of a few weeks where people in Minneapolis were one hour \"behind\" anyone living or traveling in Saint Paul.The cities' mutual antagonism was largely healed by the end of the 1960s, aided by the simultaneous arrival in 1961 of the Minnesota Twins of the American League and the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, both of which identified themselves with the state as a whole (the former explicitly named for both Twin Cities) and not with either of the major cities (unlike the earlier Minneapolis Lakers). Since 1961, it has been common practice for any major sports team based in the Twin Cities to be named for Minnesota as a whole. In terms of development, the two cities remain distinct in their progress, with Minneapolis absorbing new and avant-garde architecture while Saint Paul continues to carefully integrate new buildings into the context of classical and Victorian styles.\n\n\n== Geography and geology ==\n\nAlong with much of Minnesota, the Twin Cities area was shaped by water and ice over the course of millions of years. The land of the area sits on top of thick layers of sandstone and limestone laid down as seas encroached upon and receded from the region. Erosion caused natural caves to develop, which were expanded into mines when white settlers came to the area. In the time of Prohibition, at least one speakeasy was built into these hidden spaces\u2014eventually refurbished as the Wabasha Street Caves in Saint Paul.\nLakes across the area were formed and altered by the movement of glaciers. This left many bodies of water in the region, and unusual shapes may appear. For example, Lake Minnetonka out toward the western side of the Twin Cities consists of a complex arrangement of channels and large bays. Elevations in the metropolitan area range from 1,376 feet (419 m) above sea level in the northwest metro to 666 feet (203 m) at the edge of the Mississippi River in the southeast.\n\nBecause it is comparatively easy to dig through limestone and there are many natural and man-made open spaces, it has often been proposed that the area should examine the idea of building subways for public transportation. In theory, it could be less expensive in the Twin Cities than in many other places, but the cost would still be much greater than surface projects.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nOwing to its northerly latitude and inland location, the Twin Cities experience the coldest climate of any major metropolitan area in the United States. However, due to its southern location in the state and aided further by the urban heat island, the Twin Cities is one of the warmest locations in Minnesota. The average annual temperature at the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport is 45.4 \u00b0F (7.4 \u00b0C); 3.5 \u00b0F (1.9 \u00b0C) colder than Winona, Minnesota, and 8.8 \u00b0F (4.9 \u00b0C) warmer than Roseau, Minnesota. Monthly average daily high temperatures range from 21.9 \u00b0F (\u22125.6 \u00b0C) in January to 83.3 \u00b0F (28.5 \u00b0C) in July; the average daily minimum temperatures for the two months are 4.3 \u00b0F (\u221215.4 \u00b0C) and 63.0 \u00b0F (17.2 \u00b0C) respectively.\n\nMinimum temperatures of 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) or lower are seen on an average of 29.7 days per year, and 76.2 days do not have a maximum temperature exceeding the freezing point. Temperatures above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) occur an average of 15 times per year. High temperatures above 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) have been common in recent years; the last occurrence was on July 6, 2012. The lowest temperature ever reported at the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport was \u221234 \u00b0F (\u221237 \u00b0C) on January 22, 1936; the highest, 108 \u00b0F (42 \u00b0C), was reported on July 14 of the same year. Early settlement records at Fort Snelling show temperatures as low as \u221242 \u00b0F (\u221241 \u00b0C). Recent records include \u221240 \u00b0F (\u221240 \u00b0C) at Vadnais Lake on February 2, 1996 (National Climatic Data Center)\nPrecipitation averages 29.41 inches (74.7 cm) per year, and is most plentiful in June (4.34 inches (11.0 cm)) and February (0.79 inches (2.0 cm)) the least so. The greatest one-day rainfall amount was 9.15 inches (23.2 cm), reported on July 23, 1987. The city's record for lowest annual precipitation was set in 1910, when 11.54 inches (29.3 cm) fell throughout the year; coincidentally, the opposite record was set the following year, which observed a total 40.15 inches (1,020 mm). At an average of 56.3 inches (1,430 mm) per year, snowfall is generally abundant.The Twin Cities area takes the brunt of many types of extreme weather, including high-speed straight-line winds, tornadoes, flash floods, drought, heat, bitter cold, and blizzards. The costliest weather disaster in Twin Cities history was a derecho event on May 15, 1998. Hail and Wind damage exceeded $950 million, much of it in the Twin Cities. Other memorable Twin Cities weather-related events include the tornado outbreak on May 6, 1965, the Armistice Day Blizzard on November 11, 1940, and the Halloween Blizzard of 1991. In 2019, Minnesota experienced its coldest temperatures since 1996, when a polar vortex dropped temperatures as low as \u221256 \u00b0F (\u221249 \u00b0C) in Cotton, MN with windchills lower than \u221260 \u00b0F (\u221251 \u00b0C) in much of the state. These temperatures are colder than those found on the surface of Mars. (See: Department of Natural Resources - Cold Outbreak: January 27-31, 2019)\nA normal growing season in the metro extends from late April or early May through the month of October. The USDA places the area in the 4a plant hardiness zone.\n\n\n== Communities ==\n\n\n=== MSA ===\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, or Twin Cities, includes 16 counties, of which 14 are in Minnesota and two in Wisconsin. The Minnesota portion accounts for almost two-thirds of Minnesota's population.\nNote: Counties that are bolded are under jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Council. Counties that are italicized were added to the metropolitan area when the Office of Management and Budget revised its delineations of metropolitan statistical areas in 2013.\n\n\n==== Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul\u2013Bloomington MN\u2013WI Metropolitan Statistical Area ====\n\n\n=== CSA ===\nThe Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, MN\u2013WI Combined Statistical Area is made up of 20 counties in Minnesota and two counties in Wisconsin. The statistical area includes two metropolitan areas and four micropolitan areas. As of the 2010 Census, the CSA had a population of 3,682,928 (though a July 1, 2012 estimate placed the population at 3,691,918).  In 2013, Owatonna, MN Micropolitan Statistical Area was added. The CSA definition encompasses 12,130 sq mi (31,400 km2) of area.\n\n\n==== Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, MN\u2013WI Combined Statistical Area ====\nNote: Owatonna MSA was not part of CSA in 2010.\n\n\n=== Cities and suburbs ===\nThere are approximately 218 incorporated municipalities within the Twin Cities metropolitan region. This includes census-designated places along with villages in Wisconsin, but excludes unincorporated towns in Wisconsin, known as civil townships in other states.\nEstimates are as of 2018 for cities with 25,000 or more inhabitants and 2020 for cities with 50,000 or more inhabitants.Principal cities (2018 / 2020 estimates)\nMinneapolis (437,069)\nSaint Paul (311,895)Places with 50,000 to 99,999 inhabitants\n\nPlaces with 25,000 to 49,999 inhabitants\n\nPlaces with 10,000 to 24,999 inhabitants\n\nPlaces with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants \n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Fine and performing arts ===\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area fine art museums include the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Walker Art Center, the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum, Minnesota Museum of American Art and The Museum of Russian Art. The Minnesota Orchestra and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra are full-time professional musical ensembles. The Guthrie Theater moved into a new building in 2006 overlooking the Mississippi River. The Minnesota Fringe Festival is an annual celebration of theatre, dance, improvisation, puppetry, kids' shows, visual art, and musicals.The Twin Cities is also the home of Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), the second largest public radio station in the country. It hosts both a classical station and a contemporary station, The Current, which plays music from regional and other contemporary artists. The MPR program A Prairie Home Companion, hosted by Minnesota native Garrison Keillor aired live for many years from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul. The show ended its run in 2016, with its successor Live from Here also airing from the same venue. This radio program was the basis of the 2006 film of the same name, A Prairie Home Companion.\nThe Current and the Walker Art Center also host an annual music festival Rock the Garden, which features nationally recognized and local artists. The festival has been annually presented since 2008 and has featured artists such as Lizzo, Hippo Campus, Chance the Rapper, Bon Iver, The Flaming Lips, Wilco and Sonic Youth.The Basilica of Saint Mary in the city of Minneapolis also hosts the annual Basilica Block Party, another annual music festival which brings in nationally recognized artists such as Weezer, Andy Grammer, Deathcab for Cutie and Panic! at the Disco. The festival is used as a fundraiser for the restoration of the basilica. The event draws approximately 25,000 people to the downtown area.\nAside from the music festivals that take place in the region, the Twin Cities area is also home to a number of venues where artists come to perform. Minneapolis is home to the famous First Avenue. First Avenue is known for being the starting venue for many famous artists and bands that have come from the area including Prince, The Replacements, Atmosphere, Manny Phesto and others. It became one of the most recognizable venues in Minnesota following the release of the Prince movie Purple Rain, in which the venue is featured.\n\n\n=== Outdoors ===\n\nThere are numerous lakes in the region, and cities in the area have some very extensive park systems for recreation. Organized recreation includes the Great River Energy bicycle festival, the Twin Cities Marathon, and the U.S. pond hockey championships. Some studies have shown that area residents take advantage of this, and are among the most physically fit in the country, though others have disputed that. Nonetheless, medicine is a major industry in the region and the southeasterly city of Rochester, as the University of Minnesota has joined other colleges and hospitals in doing significant research, and major medical device manufacturers started in the region (the most prominent is Medtronic). Technical innovators have brought important advances in computing, including the Cray line of supercomputers.\nIt is common for residents of the Twin Cities area to own or share cabins and other properties along lakes and forested areas in the central and northern regions of the state, and weekend trips \"up North\" happen through the warmer months. Ice fishing is also a major pastime in the winter, although each year some overambitious fishermen find themselves in dangerous situations when they venture out onto the ice too early or too late. Hunting, snowmobiling, ATV riding and numerous other outdoor activities are also popular. This connectedness with the outdoors also brings a strong sense of environmentalism to many Minnesotans.\nIn 2011 and 2012, the American College of Sports Medicine named Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul the healthiest metropolitan area in America.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe Twin Cities is one of thirteen American metropolitan areas to have teams in all four major professional sports \u2014 Baseball (MLB), Football (NFL), Basketball (NBA) and Ice Hockey (NHL). Including Major League Soccer (MLS), it is one of eleven metro areas to have five major sports. To avoid favoring either of the Twin Cities, most teams based in the area use only the word Minnesota in their name, rather than Minneapolis or Saint Paul.\nMinneapolis was the site of two Super Bowls \u2013 Super Bowl XXVI in 1992 and Super Bowl LII in 2018. It was the farthest north that a Super Bowl has ever been played. Minnesota has played in four Super Bowls - IV in 1970, VIII in 1974, IX in 1975 and XI in 1977.\nThe World Series has been played in the Twin Cities three times \u2013 1965, 1987 and 1991 \u2013 as well as three Major League Baseball All-Star Games \u2013 1965, 1985 and 2014. All-Star games in the National Hockey League were hosted in 1972 and 2004, the National Basketball Association in 1994 and the Women's National Basketball Association in 2018.\nThe Stanley Cup Finals have been played in the Twin Cities twice \u2013 1981 and 1991 \u2013 as well as the NHL Stadium Series played host to a game in 2016.\nThe Final Four Men's National College Athletics Association (NCAA) basketball tournament has been hosted by Minneapolis four times \u2013 1951, 1992, 2001 and 2019 \u2013 and Women's one time \u2013 1995. The women's tournament will return to Minneapolis in 2022.\n\nMajor golf tournaments hosted in the Twin Cities include: US Open \u2013 1916, 1930, 1970, 1991; US Women's Open \u2013 1966, 1977, 2008; PGA Championship \u2013 1932, 1954, 2002, 2009; Women's PGA Championship - 2019; Walker Cup \u2013 1957; Solheim Cup \u2013 2002 and the Ryder Cup \u2013 2016. The Ryder Cup is scheduled to return in 2028.\nThe 1998 World Figure Skating Championships was held at Target Center in Minneapolis.\nThe 2017, 2018 and 2019 X Games were held in Minneapolis.  The 2020 X Games was cancelled on April 25 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Twin Cities host three nationally competing Roller Derby leagues: The Minnesota Roller Derby of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association Division 1, the North Star Roller Derby of WFTDA Division 2, and Minnesota Men's Roller Derby, a league of the Men's Roller Derby Association. MNRD and NSRD possess four home teams each: the Dagger Dolls, Garda Belts, Rockits, and Atomic Bombshells of MNRD and the Banger Sisters, Delta Delta Di, Kilmores, and Violent Femmes of NSRD, as well as two traveling teams each. MMRD possesses three home teams: The Gentlemen's Club, Destruction Workers, and Thunderjacks, and two traveling teams.\nThe annual Twin Cities Marathon is held in the fall with a course running through Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Minneapolis was the birthplace of Rollerblade and is a center for inline skating, as well as home to the most golfers per capita of any city in the U.S. Additionally, water skiing got its start on Lake Pepin, a lake southeast of the metropolitan area, located in the Mississippi River about 50 miles (80 km) downstream from Saint Paul.Some other sports teams gained their names from being in Minnesota before relocating. The Los Angeles Lakers get their name from once being based in Minneapolis, the City of Lakes. The Dallas Stars also derived their present name from their tenure as a Minnesota team, the Minnesota North Stars.\n\n\n==== Professional sports teams in Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul ====\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\n\n==== Print ====\nThe Twin Cities have two major daily newspapers: the Star Tribune and the Saint Paul Pioneer Press. Additionally, the Minnesota Daily serves the University of Minnesota's Twin Cities campus and surrounding neighborhoods. There is one general-interest neighborhood weekly newspaper still in the cities: The East Side Review, devoted to the 90,000 residents in the eastern third of Saint Paul. Other weekly papers are devoted to specific audiences/demographics including City Pages.\n\n\n==== Television ====\n\nThe region is currently ranked as the 15th largest television market according to Nielson Media Research. Three duopolies exist in the Twin Cities: Twin Cities PBS operates both KTCA and KTCI, Hubbard Broadcasting (built by Stanley E. Hubbard) owns both ABC affiliate KSTP-TV and independent station KSTC-TV, and Fox Television Stations operates both Fox owned-and-operated station KMSP-TV and MyNetworkTV O&O WFTC. Diversified from radio, KSTP-TV became the first television channel to air in the region with a show reaching 3,000 television sets in 1948, and the 17th station to broadcast in the U.S.\n\nThe only station with its main studios in Minneapolis is CBS O&O WCCO, while Saint Paul is host to KSTP/KSTC, KTCA/KTCI, and CW affiliate WUCW. NBC affiliate KARE has a sprawling broadcasting complex in west suburban Golden Valley. KMSP is located in southwest suburban Eden Prairie. Other stations are located in the suburbs. For much of the last two decades, WCCO and KARE have shared in having the most popular evening newscasts of the area channels. On the other end, KSTP has struggled to maintain ratings on its news programs. KMSP has had a 9 o'clock newscast since at least the early 1990s when it was an independent channel.\nCommunities in the region have their own Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable television channels. One channel, the Metro Cable Network, is available on channel 6 on cable systems across the seven-county region.\nSeveral television programs originating in the Twin Cities have been aired nationally on terrestrial and cable TV networks. KTCA created the science program Newton's Apple and distributes a children's program today. A few unusual comedic shows also originated in the area. In the 1980s, KTMA (predecessor to WUCW) created a number of low-budget shows, including cult classic Mystery Science Theater 3000. The short-lived Let's Bowl started on KARE, and PBS series Mental Engineering originated on the Saint Paul cable access network.\n\n\n==== Radio ====\nThe radio market in the Twin Cities is ranked 15th by Nielsen in 2018, similar to its TV market size. In November 2018, the top five morning radio shows in the area were all FM stations: KSTP, KXFN, KQQL, KDWB, and KXXR. Three of the top five morning radio stations are owned by iHeartRadio. Most radio stations broadcast on air, and can be heard as well over the internet, as live streams from the web site of each radio station.\n\nKSTP, a television station, also has radio stations, with pop music format on FM and ESPN Radio on AM. KSTP-AM and FM are owned by Hubbard Broadcasting. In 1985, Hubbard \u2013 valued at $400 million \u2013 was one of the larger corporate media companies in the United States; in 2005, valued at US$1.2 billion, Hubbard is a fairly small major-market media operation.The Twin Cities have a mix of commercial and non-commercial radio stations. The city's market is dominated by iHeartRadio which operates seven stations. Two small, independent stations are award winners \u2014 KUOM operated by the University of Minnesota and KFAI public access radio in Cedar Riverside.Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) airs on KNOW 91.1 FM, KSJN 91.5 FM and KCMP 89.3 FM, with separate programs on each station. It is a major player in the state and across the country, first known across the U.S. for the variety show A Prairie Home Companion, which ceased production in 2016. Doing business under the name American Public Media, the company is the second largest producer of National Public Radio content, behind National Public Radio (of which MPR is an affiliate). KCMP is also known as The Current.\n\n\n==== Independent media ====\nThe Twin Cities is also home to many independent media organizations, including The UpTake, MinnPost and Twin Cities Daily Planet.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Place of birth ===\nApproximately 93.2% of the metropolitan area's population was native to the United States. Approximately 92.6% were born in the U.S. while 0.6% were born in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, or born abroad to American parents. The rest of the population (6.8%) were foreign-born.\nThe highest percentages of immigrants came from Asia (38.2%), Latin America (25.4%), and Africa (20.1%); smaller percentages of newcomers came from Europe (13.1%), other parts of North America (3.0%), and Oceania (0.2%).With regards to ethnicity, the metropolitan area is predominantly white, with every county having at least 70% of its population coming from that background. However, the area is gradually becoming more diverse over time.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul is also a major center for religion in the state, especially Christianity. The state headquarters of five major Christian churches are found here: the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, the Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota, the Presbyterian Synod of Lakes and Prairies, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The Presbyterian and LDS churches both have missions in Saint Paul, Minneapolis, and Bloomington as well as the Orthodox Church in America.\nThe headquarters of the former American Lutheran Church (ALC), Evangelical Lutheran Church, Lutheran Free Church and the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church were located in Minneapolis; the headquarters of Augsburg Fortress publishing house still is. The Minneapolis Area Synod and the Saint Paul Area Synod are the first and third largest synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), respectively.\nThe Evangelical Free Church of America has its headquarters in Bloomington, and the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations is headquartered in Plymouth, along with its seminary and a Bible School.\nThe Twin Cities are home to several synagogues serving the Jewish population, which is concentrated in the western Minneapolis suburbs of Golden Valley, St. Louis Park, Plymouth and Minnetonka. There is also a Hindu temple located in the Twin Cities suburb of Maple Grove. A recent influx of immigrants from Laos and Northern Africa has brought many more religions to the area. There are several Islamic Masjids in the area. There is a temple for the religion of Eckankar in the suburb of Chanhassen known as the Temple of Eck. In addition, many Hmong and Tibetan Buddhist peoples live in Saint Paul; a Hmong Buddhist temple opened in suburban Roseville in 1995. The LDS St. Paul Minnesota Temple opened in Oakdale, a suburb east of Saint Paul, in 2000. There are several very strong Unitarian Universalist communities such as the First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis, as well as several Pagan and Buddhist groups. The cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis have been called Paganistan due to the large numbers of Pagans living there. There are an estimated 20,000 Pagans living in the Twin Cities area.Minneapolis is where the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association started and was its home for more than fifty years.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe 2008 Republican National Convention was held at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul. Minneapolis and Saint Paul submitted combined bids to host the 2008 Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention. Minneapolis hosted the 1892 Republican National Convention.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area is home to 21 Fortune 1000 headquarters \u2013 2019 rankings\n\nA number of private companies are also headquartered in the Twin Cities area, including Cargill, the country's largest private company, Carlson, Radisson Hotel Group, Mortenson, Holiday Stationstores, and Andersen. Foreign companies with U.S. headquarters in the Twin Cities include Aimia, Allianz, Canadian Pacific, Coloplast, Medtronic, Pearson VUE, Pentair and RBC.\nThe Twin Cities's economy is the 13th largest in the U.S. and ranks second in the Midwest. The Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area also ranks as the second largest medical device manufacture center in North America and the fourth-biggest U.S. banking center, based on total assets of banks headquartered in the metro area, ranking behind New York, San Francisco, and Charlotte, N.C. metropolitan areas.The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis covers the 9th District of the Federal Reserve System, which is made up of Minnesota, Montana, North and South Dakota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Its geographical territory is the third largest of the 12 Federal Reserve banks.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\n\n==== Libraries with # of branches ====\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Buildings and structures ===\n\nThe four tallest buildings in the area are located in downtown Minneapolis. Today there is some contention over exactly which building is the tallest\u2014most Minnesotans would immediately think of the IDS Center if queried on the point, although most sources seem to agree that Capella Tower is slightly taller. But in early 2005, it was found that the IDS Center is taller by a 16-foot (5 m) washroom garage on top, which brings its total height to 792 feet (241 m). Capella Tower and the Wells Fargo Center only differ in height by a foot or two, a rather negligible amount.\nBuildings have gone up and been torn down rapidly across the region. Some city blocks have been demolished six or seven times since the mid-19th century, and will undoubtedly reach an eighth or ninth cycle in short order. No single architectural style dominates the region. Instead, the cities have a mish-mash of different designs, although structures from a few eras stand out. There were once a great many stone buildings constructed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style (or at least Romanesque-inspired variants). Minneapolis City Hall is one prominent example of this, though buildings of all types\u2014including personal residences such as the James J. Hill House\u2014were similarly designed. A few decades later, Art Deco brought several structures that survive today, including St. Paul City Hall, the Foshay Tower, and the Minneapolis Post Office. The style of buildings in the two cities varies greatly. In Minneapolis, the trend has been buildings with sleek lines and modern glass facades while Saint Paul tends to follow a more traditional style of buildings so as to better accompany its older structures.\n\nSaint Paul and Minneapolis in particular went through some massive urban renewal projects in the post-World War II era, so a vast number of buildings are now lost to history. Some of the larger and harder to demolish structures have survived. In fact, the area might be signified more by bridges than buildings. A series of reinforced concrete arch spans crossing the Mississippi River were built in the 1920s and 1930s. They still carry daily traffic, but remain pleasing to the eye despite their age (a number have undergone major repair work, but retain the original design). Several of the bridges are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They include the 10th Avenue Bridge, Intercity Bridge (Ford Parkway), Robert Street Bridge, and the longest, the 4,119 ft (1,255 m) Mendota Bridge next to Fort Snelling. The area is also noted for having the first known permanent crossing of the Mississippi. That structure is long gone, but a series of Hennepin Avenue Bridges have been built since then at the site. Both downtowns have extensive networks of enclosed pedestrian bridges known as skyways.\n\nSeveral prominent buildings in Minneapolis have helped modernize the city. These include the Walker Art Center, Central Public Library, Weisman Art Museum and the Guthrie Theater. Opening in April 2005, the new Walker Art Center, nearly double in size, includes increased indoor and outdoor facilities. The Walker is recognized internationally as a singular model of a multidisciplinary arts organization and as a national leader for its innovative approaches to audience engagement. The Guthrie received a large amount of media coverage for its opening in June 2006. The design is the work of architect Jean Nouvel and is a 285,000 square feet (26,500 m2) facility that houses three theaters: the theater's signature thrust stage, seating 1,100; a 700-seat proscenium stage; and a black-box studio with flexible seating. In 2002, the National Trust for Historic Preservation put the old Guthrie building on its list of the most endangered historic properties in the United States in response to plans announced by the Walker Art Center to expand on the land occupied by the theater. However, the original Guthrie building was torn down in 2006. These building projects have rejuvenated the downtown area.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\n\n==== Hospitals with # beds ====\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Roads and highways ====\n\nIn the 20th century, the Twin Cities area expanded outward significantly. Automobiles made it possible for suburbs to grow greatly. The area now has a number of freeways to transport people by car. The area incorporates a large number of traffic cameras and ramp meters to monitor and manage traffic congestion. There is some use of HOV (high-occupancy vehicle) express lanes, which is becoming much more common. In order to use an express lane, a driver must have a MnPASS transponder or have at least one passenger. MnPASS rates are determined by the amount of traffic on the road and/or the time of day. During non-peak times, the MnPASS express lanes, with the exception of those on Interstate 394 (I-394) between Minnesota Highway 100 (MN 100) and I-94, are open to all traffic.\nI-94 comes into the area from the east and heads northwest from Minneapolis. Two spur routes form the I-494/I-694 loop, and I-394 continues west when I-94 turns north. Additionally, I-35 splits in Burnsville in the southern part of the Twin Cities region, bringing I-35E into Saint Paul and I-35W into Minneapolis. They join together again to the north in Columbus, (just south of Forest Lake) and continue to the highway's terminus in Duluth. This is one of only two examples of an Interstate Highway splitting into branches and then rejoining into one again; the other split occurs in Dallas-Fort Worth, where I-35 also splits into east and west branches.\nOn August 1, 2007, a large portion of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge near University Avenue in the city of Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River around 6:05pm CDT. A replacement bridge opened on Thursday, September 18, 2008.\n\n\n==== Air travel ====\nThe main airport in the region is Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), which is a major hub for Delta Air Lines. The airport is also the main hub and operating base for Sun Country Airlines. There are six smaller (relief) airports in the area which are owned and operated by the Metropolitan Airports Commission (the same agency operates the main MSP airport). Some people even commute by air to the Twin Cities from the northern part of the state.\n\nRelief airports in the metropolitan area are:\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\n\nMetro Transit, by far the biggest bus service provider in the area, owes its existence to the old streetcar lines that ran in the area. Metro Transit provides about 95% of the public transit rides in the region with over 900 buses, although some suburbs have other bus services. The University of Minnesota, Twin Cities operates a free bus system between its campuses. This system includes the Campus Connector bus rapid transit line which travels between the Minneapolis and Saint Paul campuses by a dedicated bus line, and throughout the two campuses on normal access roads. The METRO Blue Line LRT (light rail) began operations in June 2004, connecting downtown Minneapolis, Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport and the Mall of America in Bloomington. It was followed by the METRO Red Line BRT (bus rapid transitway) in 2013 connecting the Mall of America with Lakeville along Cedar Avenue through the southern suburbs. The METRO Green Line LRT connecting downtown Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota campus and downtown Saint Paul along University Avenue opened in June 2014. All three lines are operated by Metro Transit. Additionally, the Northstar Line commuter rail line connecting Minneapolis with Big Lake opened in November 2009; the line may be extended to St. Cloud as ridership numbers warrant.\nIn many ways the light rail of today is a return to the streetcars that existed in the past, it is being used as a stepping-stone to other projects.\n\nA variety of rail services are currently being pondered by state and local governments, including neighborhood streetcar systems, intercity light rail service, and commuter rail options out to exurban regions. In addition, Minnesota is one of several states in the Midwest examining the idea of setting up high-speed rail service using Chicago as a regional hub.The Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area has been criticized for inadequate public transportation. Compared to many other cities its size, the public transportation system in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area is less robust. As the metropolitan area has grown, the roads and highways have been updated and widened, but traffic volume is growing faster than the projects needed to widen them, and public transportation has not expanded enough to commensurate with the population. The Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area is ranked as the fifth worst for congestion growth of similar-sized U.S. metropolitan areas.\nAdditional lines and spurs are needed to upgrade public transportation in the Twin Cities. Plans are underway for Green Line extension connecting downtown Minneapolis to the southwest suburb of Eden Prairie. A northwest LRT (Blue Line extension) along Bottineau Boulevard is being planned from downtown Minneapolis to Brooklyn Park. The METRO Orange Line BRT will open in 2021, connecting downtown Minneapolis with Lakeville to the south along I-35W. The METRO Gold Line BRT is planned to connect downtown Saint Paul to the eastern suburbs within the next few years.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nThe United States Navy currently has one ship named for the region, USS Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul, a Los Angeles-class submarine launched in 1983.

        "wiki": "Alexander Ramsey (September 8, 1815 \u2013  April 22, 1903) was an American politician. He served as a Whig and Republican over a variety of offices between the 1840s and the 1880s. He was the first Minnesota and Wisconsin Territorial Governor.\n\n\n== Early years and family ==\nBorn in Hummelstown, Pennsylvania, on September 8, 1815, Alexander was the eldest of five children of Thomas Ramsey and Elizabeth Kelker (also K\u00f6lliker or K\u00f6llker). His father was a blacksmith who committed suicide at age 42 when he went bankrupt in 1826, after signing for a note of a friend. Alexander lived with his uncle in Harrisburg, after his family split up to live with relatives. His brother was Justus Cornelius Ramsey, who served in the Minnesota Territorial Legislature.Ramsey first studied carpentry at Lafayette College but left during his third year. He read law with Hamilton Alricks, and attended Reed's law School in Carlisle (now Pennsylvania State Dickinson Law) in 1839. He was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in 1839.In 1844 Ramsey married Anna Earl Jenks, daughter of Michael Hutchinson Jenks, and they had three children. Only one daughter, Marion, survived past childhood.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nAlexander Ramsey was elected from Pennsylvania as a Whig to the U.S. House of Representatives and served in the 28th and 29th congresses from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1847. He served as the first Territorial Governor of Minnesota from June 1, 1849, to May 15, 1853, as a member of the Whig Party.\nRamsey was of Scottish and German ancestry.  In 1855, he became the mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota. Ramsey was elected the second Governor of Minnesota after statehood and served from January 2, 1860, to July 10, 1863. Ramsey is credited with being the first Union governor to commit troops during the American Civil War.  He happened to be in Washington, D.C., when fighting broke out. When he heard about the firing on Ft. Sumter he went straight to the White House and offered Minnesota's services to Abraham Lincoln.\nHe resigned the governorship to become a U.S. Senator, having been elected to that post in 1863 as a Republican. He was re-elected in 1869 and held the office until March 3, 1875, serving in the 38th, 39th, 40th, 41st, 42nd, and 43rd congresses. He supported the Radical Republicans, who called for vigorous prosecution of the Civil War, and a military reconstruction of the South. He voted for the Impeachment of Andrew Johnson.Ramsey is also noted for his statements calling for the killing or removal of specific Native Americans, chiefly the Sioux (Dakota) people that lived in the state of Minnesota.  These statements came in response to attacks by the Sioux on American settlements, resulting in the death of not less than 800 men, women and children, as mentioned in Abraham Lincoln's Second Annual Message on December 1, 1862.  Ramsey declared on September 9, 1862: \"The Sioux Indians of Minnesota must be exterminated or driven forever beyond the borders of the state.\" He went as far as offering money for scalps of Dakotas.Ramsey served as Secretary of War from 1879 to 1881, under President Rutherford B. Hayes. He was one of the commissioners to govern Utah from 1882 to 1886 under the Edmunds Act. The act made it illegal for polygamists to vote or hold office.

        "wiki": "The Lowertown Historic District is a historic district in the Lowertown neighborhood of Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States.  This 16-block warehouse and wholesaling district comprises 37 contributing properties built 1870s\u20131920. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 for the significance of its river and rail connections, economic impact, architecture, and urban planning. Lowertown was originally the lower landing on the Mississippi River; the first port of access to the Twin Cities. Several warehouse, railroad, banking, and distribution buildings served the entire Upper Midwest from 1880 to 1920. A significant concentration of these buildings survive, unified by similar architectural styles and construction materials. Many were designed by the city's most prestigious architects, including Cass Gilbert and Clarence H. Johnston Sr.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Lowertown neighborhood declined after the Depression. The renovation of the Merchant's National Bank Building (now McColl Building) in the late 1960s was the first project to focus attention on revitalization potential. The conversion of the Noyes Brothers and Cutler Building into a complex of offices, shops, and restaurants (now known as Park Square Court) soon followed. The city's Housing and Redevelopment Authority (HRA) became involved in 1973 when Mears Park was redesigned by William Sanders and renamed after Norman B. Mears, a Saint Paul businessman.\nIn April 1978 the Lowertown Redevelopment Corporation (LRC) was organized with the goal of creating \"a place for people, a highly livable urban village in the midst of the city, which will bring new jobs, housing, commercial development, and year round activities to Lowertown and infuse the city with renewed vitality.\" Enabled by an unprecedented $10 million grant by the McKnight Foundation, the LRC assumed the role and responsibility of driving the revitalization of Lowertown. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, artists moved to Lowertown, attracted by low rents, raw space and relative quiet. This new population began to bring life to the buildings and the streets of Lowertown. Initiated by the LRC and supported fully by the City of St. Paul, Lowertown was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983; the next year, the City of St. Paul designated the Lowertown Historic District as a Heritage Preservation Site.\n\n\n== Redevelopment ==\nAided by these designations and the associated tax credits, Artspace, the LRC, the City and others partnered to renovate three buildings dedicated to the arts. The Lowertown Artists Lofts Cooperative, the Tilsner and the Northern Warehouse were renovated and became the anchors for the arts community. Throughout the years, there has been a steady commitment to incrementally reinvest in the assets of Lowertown. Instead of demolishing and building new, Lowertown remained committed to a slow, deliberate and steady approach to redevelopment. This approach allowed Lowertown to remain a relatively quiet neighborhood on the edge of downtown. Such an approach was particularly supportive of the artist community, as it respected the financial and environmental needs of working artists. In 1982, the St. Paul Farmers\u2019 Market moved to Lowertown. An institution since the late 1800s, the Farmers\u2019 Market was an anomaly of sorts for Lowertown - it was a destination in the middle of a relatively quiet neighborhood. The market now draws 20,000 people each weekend in the summer. In 2006 the LRC transformed into the Lowertown Future Fund to continue supporting Lowertown redevelopment.\nNew residences have been built in the neighborhood, attracting new residents paying market rate for condominiums. Restaurants, festivals, weddings and other regional attractions, such as the restored Union Depot, have opened in Lowertown. The St. Paul Art Crawl is held twice a year and exemplifies the cultural atmosphere that local residents have worked so hard to maintain. In 2013, USA Today named Lowertown one of \"10 up-and-coming neighborhoods around the USA\" after it was announced RealtyTrac named Lowertown at the top of its \"hipster zip codes\" list. The \"hipster\" designation implies the neighborhood's high proportion of \"people between 25 and 34 years old who use public transportation and rent their housing.\"In 2015, the St. Paul Saints professional baseball team opened its season in the new CHS Field. The stadium stands in the space of the former Gilette/Diamond Products plant at 5th Street and Broadway. Designs for the stadium were presented to the public in December 2013. Art installations from local artists adorn the exterior of the ballpark. CHS Field sits outside the official 18 blocks that make up the Lowertown Heritage Preservation District, roughly bound by Kellogg Boulevard, Broadway, 7th Street and Jackson Street.\n\n\n== Mears Park ==\n\nPreviously known as Smith Park, Park Square, and Baptist Hill, Mears Park is bounded by 5th, 6th, Sibley and Wacouta streets. The site was originally the home of the First Baptist congregation, who built their church on top of a hill in the middle of a city block. In 1849 the land was donated to the city by a man named Robert Smith after the church expanded to a new location a few blocks north. The hill was leveled and the square was formally created in 1888.For most of the next century, the park was a traditional city square with a central fountain and sidewalks radiating about it. In the early 1970s, the park became known as the \u201cBrickyard\u201d after a renovation covered much of the square in bricks. After his death in 1974, the park was officially renamed after Norman Mears, a St. Paul inventor in the printing and etching field; his inventions were used to fight World War II and make color televisions. After retirement, Mears had set his sights on the revitalization of Lowertown.Modern-day Mears Park was opened in 1992 following a major reconstruction designed by landscape architect Don Ganje and artist Brad Goldberg. The new design received rave reviews for brilliantly mixing natural and manmade elements, from the rocky stream to the metal bandshell, and has proven popular year after year. Today the park sits in the middle of a re-energized Lowertown, hosting handfuls of fairs and festivals throughout the season including Music in Mears, the Twin Cities Jazz Festival, and Concrete and Grass Music Festival. Volunteers known as the Friends of Mears Park maintain the gardens.\n\n\n== Crane Ordway Building ==\nCrane and Ordway manufactured valves, fittings, and supplies for steam engines. Rogers and Ordway was the successor company to Wilson & Rogers, the oldest firm in the line of plumbing and steam fittings in the Northwest. At one time, The Crane Company was the largest manufacturer of valves, fittings, and steam supplies in the world, employing over 3,000 men at the factory in Chicago factory. In 1892 Crane bought out the Rugg-Fuller Company in Minneapolis.On January 1, 1893, Richard T. Crane of Chicago and Lucius Pond Ordway of Saint Paul incorporated the Crane & Ordway Company. It consolidated the firms of Rogers and Ordway of Saint Paul and Duluth with a branch of the Crane Company in Minneapolis, uniting all the large interests in this line of business in the Northwest. Lucius Ordway became vice president and general manager of Crane & Ordway. Ordway came to Saint Paul from Providence, Rhode Island, in 1883 and worked for Wilson & Kogers until 1886, when he became a member of the firm of Rogers & Ordway.\nThe company dealt in a general line of pipe, fittings, boilers, pumps, pumping machinery, and plumbers' and steam-fitters' supplies. It did an extensive business in well-drilling machinery, windmills, and large irrigating plant outfits of all descriptions, furnishing estimates and designs and complete plans for water works. Crane later became part of American Standard. Ordway went on to help build the 3M company.\nThe building, completed in 1904, was designed by Reed and Stem, the architectural firm that designed Grand Central Terminal in New York and the St. Paul Hotel in downtown St. Paul. It had been vacant for 30 years prior to Aeon, a non-profit developer of affordable housing, restoring it in 2006. The historic warehouse now offers 70 units of affordable rental apartments.\n\n\n== Union Depot Train Station ==\nSaint Paul's Union Depot is a historic railroad station and intermodal transit hub in the Lowertown neighborhood of the city of Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. It serves light rail, intercity rail, intercity bus, and local bus services. \n\n\n== Neighborhood architects ==\nArchitects who contributed to the neighborhood include Cass Gilbert, J. Walter Stevens, and Charles Sumner Frost.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Media related to Lowertown Historic District (Saint Paul, Minnesota) at Wikimedia Commons\nLowertown.info - an online visitor\u2019s guide, news magazine, and community information portal serving the arts neighborhood of Lowertown, Saint Paul, Minnesota.\nLowertown Landing neighborhood organization",

        "wiki": "The Mississippi National River and Recreation Area protects a 72-mile (116 km) and 54,000-acre (22,000 ha) corridor along the Mississippi River from the cities of Dayton and Ramsey, Minnesota to just downstream of Hastings, Minnesota. This includes the stretch of Mississippi River which flows through Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. This stretch of the upper Mississippi River includes natural, historical, recreational, cultural, scenic, scientific, and economic resources of national significance. This is the only national park dedicated exclusively to the Mississippi River. It is located in parts of Anoka, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, and Washington counties, all within the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area.\nThe Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is a long name and therefore is frequently referred to as MNRRA (often pronounced like \"minnra\") or MISS (the four letter code assigned to the park by the National Park Service).\nThe Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MISS) was established in 1988 as a new unique type of National Park known as a partnership park. Unlike traditional national parks, MISS is not a major land owner and therefore does not have control over land use. MISS works with dozens of \"partners\" (local, state, and federal governments, non-profits, businesses, educational institutions, and individuals) who own land along the river or who have an interest in the Mississippi River to achieve the National Park Service's mission to protect and preserve for future generations.\nSome of the most prominent attractions within the park include the St. Anthony Falls Historic District (including Mill City Museum, the Guthrie Theater, the Stone Arch Bridge, and Mill Ruins Park), the Historic Fort Snelling and the adjacent Fort Snelling State Park, Minnehaha Falls, and the rustic Winchell Trail. There are many additional attractions, trails, and programs all within the Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul metropolitan area.\nAs of 2016 MNRRA has two visitor centers, one located inside the Science Museum of Minnesota in St. Paul, MN and the other at Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock & Dam in Minneapolis, both of which are staffed by National Park Rangers. The Minneapolis visitor center offers three free tours daily of the Upper St. Anthony Lock and surrounding area.\nEach year, the rangers manage community activities, including interpretive sessions, bike rides, and movies, that help to educate the local community about the natural and human history of the area.\n\n\n== Places to visit ==\nThe park's website lists the following locations or features as partner sites.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMississippi National River and Recreation Area\nMississippi River Fund The Mississippi River Fund supports stewardship and community engagement programs that support the park and its mission. These programs include water quality protection, habitat restoration, formal education, and interpretive programs that share with the public the significant role our national park plays in American history and culture.\nFriends of the Mississippi River (organizes volunteer restoration and education events in the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area)",

        "wiki": "The Green Party of Minnesota is a green political party in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is affiliated with the Green Party of the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Minnesota Greens Confederation, founded c. 1990/91, fostered the development of local Green Party organizations in the state. The Green Party of Minnesota was organized in December 1993. It was officially established in February and June 1994 at two founding conventions.Twin Cities Greens was organized in 1988. The Green Party of St. Paul was established in 1997 to 1998.The Green Party of Minnesota was founded in 1994 on the Four Pillars of the Green Party: Ecological Wisdom, Social and Economic Justice, Grassroots Democracy, and Nonviolence and Peace.\nIn the 2000 Presidential Election, Green Party Presidential nominee Ralph Nader and Vice Presidential nominee Winona LaDuke received 5% of the vote in Minnesota, which earned major party status for the Green Party in Minnesota. But in the election of 2004, neither Green Party presidential nominee David Cobb nor any candidate for statewide office received 5% or more, thus losing major party status in the state.In 2003 Elaine Fleming became the first elected Green mayor in Minnesota. Fleming is mayor of Cass Lake, Minnesota, and was elected mayor for her first term by seven votes. Fleming was elected mayor for a second term as a write-in candidate. As of 2006, Fleming was serving her second and last term as Mayor.\nWhile the party is currently defined as a minor political party, it has had recent success in some city elections, especially in Minneapolis and St. Paul. In 2005, Cam Gordon, a former chair of the Green Party of Minnesota, was elected in Ward 2 to the Minneapolis City Council, winning over DFLer Cara Letofsky in a 51% to 48% vote. Ward 2 is considered one of the most diverse areas of Minneapolis, representing the University of Minnesota Minneapolis Campus and the Cedar-Riverside and Seward neighborhoods. Despite this gain on the council, two Green incumbents on the council, Natalie Johnson Lee (Ward 6) and Dean Zimmermann (Ward 7), were unseated during the 2005 election. Redistricting had pitted both against other council incumbents.\nWhile initially elected as a Democrat in 1986 to the Minneapolis Park Board, Annie Young ran as a Green from her third term on, becoming one of the longest serving Park Board Commissioners in Minneapolis history.In 2009 Cam Gordon was re-elected to Minneapolis City Council. In 2011 Green Party endorsed Laura Libby was elected to the Section 1 seat of the City Council of Crystal, Minnesota. Cam Gordon was elected to a third term on the Minneapolis City Council in 2013.In 2014 the Green Party of Minnesota ran former DFL State Representative Andy Dawkins for Attorney General receiving 1.49% of the vote statewide and regaining minor party status.Despite restrictive Minnesota ballot access laws, volunteers collected three times the required signatures to place Green endorsed Presidential candidate Dr Jill Stein on the ballot in 2016. Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon refused to replace the ballot petitions stand-in Vice Presidential candidate Howie Hawkins with Ajamu Baraka, the only candidate of color in the race, despite no law denying his ability to do so. Dr Jill Stein went on to receive 1.26% of the vote statewide \u2013 double the Green Presidential vote from 2012 \u2013 and again securing minor party status for the Green Party of Minnesota until 2020.Three additional Greens were elected in 2016, including the first elected Green in Ramsey County history \u2013 Lena Buggs winning a seat on the Ramsey County Soil & Water District Board unseating the incumbent. In Anoka County, Greens Sharon Lemay and Steve Laitinen were both elected to the Anoka County Soil and Water District Board as well.\n\n\n== Current elected officials ==\nCity councils\n\nCam Gordon, Minneapolis City Council, Ward 2\nBryce Lange, Lewiston City Council, At-LargeBoards and commissions\n\nSteve Laitinen, Anoka County Soil and Water Conservation Supervisor, District 1\nLatrisha Vetaw, Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board Commissioner, At-Large\n\n\n== Ideology ==\nThe Green Party of Minnesota follows the ideals of green politics, which are based on the Four Pillars of the Green Party: Ecological wisdom, Social justice, Grassroots democracy and Nonviolence.  The \"Ten Key Values,\" which expand upon the four pillars, are as follows:\n\nGrassroots democracy\nSocial justice\nEcological wisdom\nNonviolence\nDecentralization\nCommunity-based economics\nWomen's rights\nRespect for diversity\nGlobal responsibility\nFuture focusThe Green Party of Minnesota constitution Article XI Section 2 prohibits donations from corporations or political action committees (PACs). The party's platforms and rhetoric harshly criticize any corporate influence and control over government, media, and society at large.\n\n\n== Platform ==\nThe Green Vision of the Green Party Minnesota is as follows:\nGreen political philosophy is inspired by four basic values: Ecology, Nonviolence, Social and Economic Justice, and Grassroots Democracy. Fundamentally, we believe human beings should understand themselves as part of a living planet, rather than attempting to dominate and exploit it, or each other. We seek to return to our nation\u2019s original ideal government of, by, and for the people by empowering all of our citizens through direct, grassroots democracy.\nWe envision a world where people can live fulfilled lives by achieving their personal destiny as a contributing member of a living planet.\nWe envision the revitalization of culture and human interaction that can occur in communities of people living close together who play together, work together, share sorrows and joys together and care about the well-being of their neighbors.\nWe envision each community applying human-scale technologies in their workplaces and having a diversified base of businesses, which supply many of the product and service needs of that community.\nWe envision each community having a strong level of control over community affairs and over businesses within its boundaries. We envision national and regional governments which are truly democratically-controlled and which take true leadership in protecting the environment, bringing peace to the world, alleviating human suffering and promoting human development.\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nThe party is led by a 17-member coordinating committee which sets the party's long-range goals, budget, and strategy. These decisions are then implemented by an executive committee made of five party co-chairs, each of whom is responsible for one of five portfolios of party business (membership, political affairs, finances, communications, and internal organization). Each portfolio co-chair oversees a number of committees and party functions. While the coordinating and executive committees handle day-to-day operations of the state party, most organizing, activism, and decision-making is decentralized into a number of autonomous local party organizations (or \"seedlings\") located throughout the state.\n\n\n== GPMN Coordination Committee ==\nBrian Mueller \u2013 Fundraising Co-Chair\nAndy Hamerlinck \u2013 Politics Co-Chair\nKashish Jain\nAdam Schneider\nCarol Mellom\nChelsea Palmer\n\n\n== See also ==\nPolitics of Minnesota\nList of political parties in Minnesota\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGreen Party of Minnesota records, Box: 153.I.3.2F; 153.I.3.3B, ID: 002963450.

This includes the stretch of Mississippi River which flows through Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. This stretch of the upper Mississippi River includes natural, historical, recreational, cultural, scenic, scientific, and economic resources of national significance. This is the only national park dedicated exclusively to the Mississippi River. It is located in parts of Anoka, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, and Washington counties, all within the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area.\nThe Mississippi National River and Recreation Area is a long name and therefore is frequently referred to as MNRRA (often pronounced like \"minnra\") or MISS (the four letter code assigned to the park by the National Park Service).\nThe Mississippi National River and Recreation Area (MISS) was established in 1988 as a new unique type of National Park known as a partnership park. Unlike traditional national parks, MISS is not a major land owner and therefore does not have control over land use. MISS works with dozens of \"partners\" (local, state, and federal governments, non-profits, businesses, educational institutions, and individuals) who own land along the river or who have an interest in the Mississippi River to achieve the National Park Service's mission to protect and preserve for future generations.\nSome of the most prominent attractions within the park include the St. Anthony Falls Historic District (including Mill City Museum, the Guthrie Theater, the Stone Arch Bridge, and Mill Ruins Park), the Historic Fort Snelling and the adjacent Fort Snelling State Park, Minnehaha Falls, and the rustic Winchell Trail. There are many additional attractions, trails, and programs all within the Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul metropolitan area.\nAs of 2016 MNRRA has two visitor centers, one located inside the Science Museum of Minnesota in St. Paul, MN and the other at Upper St. Anthony Falls Lock & Dam in Minneapolis, both of which are staffed by National Park Rangers. The Minneapolis visitor center offers three free tours daily of the Upper St. Anthony Lock and surrounding area.\nEach year, the rangers manage community activities, including interpretive sessions, bike rides, and movies, that help to educate the local community about the natural and human history of the area.\n\n\n== Places to visit ==\nThe park's website lists the following locations or features as partner sites.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMississippi National River and Recreation Area\nMississippi River Fund The Mississippi River Fund supports stewardship and community engagement programs that support the park and its mission. These programs include water quality protection, habitat restoration, formal education, and interpretive programs that share with the public the significant role our national park plays in American history and culture.\nFriends of the Mississippi River (organizes volunteer restoration and education events in the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area)",

Additional animals followed, when more room was needed to house the animals they were moved to facilities at Como Park. Como Zoo continued to grow through donations of animals and money.\nThe Art Deco Zoological Building was designed in 1936 by Charles Bassford as part of the federally funded Works Progress Administration. Other WPA structures were completed in the 1930s, including Monkey Island (now Seal Island), barn and bear grotto.\nIn the 1980s several new exhibits were added as part of a major renovation project, including the Large Cat exhibit (1980), Aquatic Animal Building and conversion of Monkey Island to Seal Island (1982), the Primate Facility (1985), the Land and Water Bird exhibit (1986) and the African Hoofed Stock Facility (1987).\n\n\n=== Art at Como Zoo ===\nDon the Gorilla - Bronze and stone statue of a popular gorilla named Don donated by artist Betty Sievert in 1982.

Visitors were ushered to safety as zoo staff shot Casey with a tranquilizer and returned him to his enclosure.  This resulted in the zoo building a temporary slanted wall around the enclosure to keep this from happening again and the zoo is planning on building a new area for the gorillas making it safer and impossible to escape from.  The zoo opened a new exhibit in 2013 called Gorilla Forest.  Casey has since been moved to the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans.\n\n\n== Marjorie McNeely Conservatory ==\nThe Marjorie McNeely Conservatory (0.5 acres) was first opened to the public in November 1915.

          "Como zoo was very nice (except the giraffe/zebra enclosure was super stinky). It\u2019s a small zoo but well worth the visit. No set admission fee but a donation is asked for. A nice way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "We just found out about this phenomenal event called the Valentines dinner at Como Conservatory from our friends. All tables are located in different parts of the Conservatory, the sunken garden, the Palms room, the green pathways. There is a stunning atmosphere, beautiful",

          "Sometimes I thought there could have been more animals inside the cages and fewer people on the outside of the cages. Zoos always keep me thinking there should be more animals. There were plenty of rides for the kids and food stands like you would find at a county fair plus",

The museum has had a home in Saint Paul since 1934, where it first started as a club. In later years the museum established a home in the Saint Paul Union Depot, and later in Bandana Square. On October 16, 2015, the museum announced that it was looking for a new home. The museum subsequently announced it would be moving to a new location in spring of 2016. The museum reopened on May 17, 2016, in their new location at 668 Transfer Road, Suite 8. The new location is just south of the former Amtrak Midway Depot along the Minnesota Commercial railyard.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nThe Twin City Model Railroad Club/Museum 1934\u20132009, Compiled by Ray Barton, Michael Mackner and Robert Neiderkorn.\n\n\n== External links ==\nTwin City Model Railroad Museum",

          "This was a great place to visit. We highly recommend this place. We tood our grandson who loved it. But both my wife and I said we should go back ourselves. It was fantastic. The big train layout was from the old MIlwaukee Train Depot from decades ago. There are numerous",
          "The staff does a great job of keeping all these trains running. My 6 year old grandson especially liked the huge Lego train layout!",
          "Great locomotive and also good history of trains. The children had a lot of fun and there was a large crowd. The volunteer staff sere pleasant and patient answering many questions that we asked.",
          "The DW and I just love model railroad museums and this one is up there with best that we have seen.Especially because they have so many buttons to push. One layout was of a theme park and even had a working roller coaster with a loop.",
          "Great volunteer staff here and the model train layouts are very well done with a lot of hands on things for adults and kids alike to get the trains rolling. Good historical exhibits on the evolution of model railroading and it's heyday after WWII until 1960 when the hobby was",
          "I like the ideas of hands on experience for young children, instead of saying do not touch. The various model train sizes that are on display is amazing. Maybe one day you can have a real train.",
          "This wonderful place has trains for the serious hobbyist, trains from Germany (Marklin), old Lionel trains and many working layouts. Kids can run many of them which is fun. The could probably use a little more help in terms of keeping things running but this is understandable",
          "I am in my second childhood and my granddaughter is in her first...we both loved the museum. People were very nice. The detail and layouts intrigued me very much, and the museum was more than ready to entertain and teach the children. Close enough to almost touch and plenty",
          "There are a ton of great things about the Museum. First is that their largest layout is in O Scale. Most others are in HO or N, and you can really see the details and appreciate their details at this larger scale. Also, it is great to see a \"working\" version of the Stone Arch",
          "The real genius here is two-fold: 1) operating layouts of all gauges - z, n, ho, s, o, and g. 2) it's extremely kid-friendly. Lots of buttons to press to make the trains go and accessories to operate. Most are kid level to see, too. Adults who had trains as kids will have great",
          "I have visited here 4 times with my granddaughter . She liked it even when she was just 2 years old. Now she is turning 3 and lives it even more. There are many types of trains surrounded by detailed interesting scenes that change seasonally. Kids love pushing the buttons",
          "I enjoyed my visit to the museum. This was my first trip to the new location. I had been to the old location several times. This location is perfect for a train museum right next to a railroad tracks and just up the road from the old Amtrak depot. There are about six model",
          "If you are into vintage gear (Lionel etc), this place is for you. If you have a toddler who would like to run & control trains, there are about 3 such layouts. If you seek to see a convincing model railway with realistic scenery & sound-equipped locomotives, you will not find",
          "This I sent a speciality museum run by dedic dedicated volunteers who love model trains. There is enough hands on activity to engage small kids.",
          "It's hard to find things that fascinate a 41 year old, a 7 year old, and a 5 year old. This place fascinated my whole family. We could have spent at least another hour in the museum. There were big trains and little trains. There were buttons for my kids to push that did",
          "If you like trains. Take public transportation. Parking anywhere in twin cities is a challenge. Kids love this place.",
          "With grandsons at the 2 and 4 years, this ranks as one of the highlights of our train experiences. Both of our boys are very much into trains with Papa having build both boys trains tables for their Brio trains. Thomas is one of our favorite! The volunteers, mostly railroad",
          "We visited with our 3 year old grandson. He was mesmerized by the model trains and loves the interactive trains. Easy to find and free parking. Will definitely visit again when we are in the cities.",
          "This is a museum that markets itself to young children. That said, 20 feet from the entrance, unguarded is a display that is not for touching, yet with no signs or ropes indicating not. My 5 year old grandson runs in and goes right for it, because it is at 5 year old height and",
          "Granddaughters loved it, and the little area where they can run the Thomas trains was a big hit. We used to take our own kids when they were small to the museum when it was at Bandana Square.",
          "Well this is the Twin Cities they call it I'm actually in St Paul Minnesota at the moment at Days Inn I've rode the railroad train Light Rail to call it all over I write it free because I'm a veteran and I went to see the stadium that the Minnesota Vikings play in down by US",

        "wiki": "Saint Paul (St. Paul) is the capital of the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is the county seat of Ramsey County, the state's smallest and most densely populated county. As of 2019, its estimated population was 308,096, making it the 63rd-largest city in the United States and the 11th-most populous in the Midwest. Most of the city lies east of the Mississippi River at the confluence with the Minnesota River. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, is across the river to the west. Together they are known as the \"Twin Cities\". They are the core of Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, home to over 3.6 million and the third-largest in the Midwest.Established near existing Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center, the city gained prominence when it was made the capital of the Minnesota Territory in 1849. The Dakota name for where Saint Paul is situated is \"Imnizaska\". The city is known for the Xcel Energy Center, home to the Minnesota Wild. Regionally, it is known for the Science Museum of Minnesota and its new soccer stadium. As a business hub of the Upper Midwest, it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab. Saint Paul and Minneapolis are also known for their high literacy rate.The first structure built in what would become St. Paul was constructed in 1838 at the entrance to Fountain Cave overlooking the Mississippi. It was built by Pigs Eye Parrant near where Randolph Avenue today meets the river. Parrant's \"tavern\" was well known and the surrounding area came to be known as Pigs Eye. That lasted until the Catholic missionary Lucien Galtier arrived in 1840. He did not care for Parrant, his tavern, or the use of his name. The priest's arrival brought the eviction of Parrant from his establishment and the building of a log chapel near where steamboats had an easy landing. Galtier named the chapel St. Paul's, making it known that the settlement was then to be called by that name, as \"Saint Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated, this monosyllable is short, sounds good, it is understood by all Christian denominations\". While Pigs Eye was no longer the settlement's name, it came to refer to wetlands and an island south of the city's center. As the region grew the city became the seat of an archdiocese that built a grand St. Paul's Cathedral overlooking the downtown.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBurial mounds in present-day Indian Mounds Park suggest the area was inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about 2,000 years ago. From the early 17th century to 1837, the Mdewakanton Dakota, a tribe of the Sioux, lived near the mounds after fleeing their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe. The Dakota called the area I-mni-za ska dan (\"little white rocks\") for its exposed white sandstone cliffs on the river's eastern side. In the Menominee language it is called S\u0101\u0113nep\u0101n-Men\u012bk\u0101n, which means \"ribbon, silk or satin village\", suggesting its role in trade throughout the region after the introduction of European goods.Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, US Army officer Zebulon Pike negotiated approximately 100,000 acres (40,000 ha; 160 sq mi) of land from the local Dakota tribes in 1805 to establish a fort. The negotiated territory was on both banks of the Mississippi River, from Saint Anthony Falls in present-day Minneapolis to its confluence with the Saint Croix River. Fort Snelling was built on the territory in 1819 at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers, which formed a natural barrier to both Native American nations. The 1837 Treaty with the Sioux ceded all local tribal land east of the Mississippi to the U.S. government. Taoyateduta (Chief Little Crow V) moved his band at Kaposia across the river to the south. Fur traders, explorers, and missionaries came to the area for the fort's protection. Many of the settlers were French-Canadians who lived nearby. But as a whiskey trade flourished, military officers banned settlers from the fort-controlled lands. Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant, a former fur trader turned bootlegger who particularly irritated officials, set up his tavern outside the military reservation, upriver from Lambert's Landing. By the early 1840s, the community had become important as a trading center and destination for pioneers heading west. Locals called the area Pig's Eye (French: L'\u0152il du Cochon) or Pig's Eye Landing after Parrant's popular tavern. In the 1840s-70s the M\u00e9tis brought their oxen and Red River Carts down Kellogg Street to Lampert's landing to ship buffalo hides to market from the Red River of the North.  St. Paul was the southernmost stop on the Red River Trails. In 1840 Pierre Bottineau became a resident of St. Paul with a claim in the heart of the settlement.\n\nIn 1841, Father Lucien Galtier was sent to minister to the Catholic French Canadians and established a chapel, named for his favorite saint, Paul the Apostle, on the bluffs above Lambert's Landing. Galtier informed the settlement it was to adopt the name Saint Paul in honor of his new chapel and to give up use of Pigs Eye. In 1847, the New York educator Harriet Bishop moved to the area and opened the city's first school. The Minnesota Territory was formalized in 1849 with Saint Paul as its capital. In 1857, the territorial legislature voted to move the capital to Saint Peter, but Joe Rolette, a territorial legislator, stole the physical text of the approved bill and went into hiding, preventing the move. On May 11, 1858, Minnesota was admitted to the union as the 32nd state, with Saint Paul still capital. Soon thereafter the country was torn by the Civil War. When the state learned that Governor Ramsey had volunteered a regiment to fight the South, communities across the state put together companies of volunteers for that regiment. St. Paul contributed A and C Companies to the formation of the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe year 1858 saw more than 1,000 steamboats service Saint Paul, making the city a gateway for settlers to the Minnesota frontier or Dakota Territory. Natural geography was a primary reason the city became a landing. The area was the last accessible point to unload boats coming upriver due to the Mississippi River Valley's stone bluffs. During this period, Saint Paul was called \"The Last City of the East.\" Industrialist James J. Hill constructed his railroad empire into the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway, both headquartered in Saint Paul until merging into the Burlington Northern. Today they are part of the BNSF Railway.The Spanish\u2013American War saw the trans-Atlantic ocean liner SS Saint Paul (1895) converted and commissioned into the United States Navy as an auxiliary cruiser. She was the first ship in the navy to bear the city's name. She was decommissioned and returned to her owners only to be conscripted for service again for WWI, after which she was again decommissioned and scraped.\nCrooks' Haven In 1900 an Irishman named John O'Connor became chief of the St. Paul police and was known on the street as \"the Big Fellow\". That year he instituted the \"O'Connor Layover Agreement\" and made an effort to inform criminals of its existence. St. Paul police would ignore any transgressions of the law that took place outside their jurisdiction as long as criminals \"checked in\" when they arrived in town. There were three conditions to the agreement: check in with the police; pay a \"donation\" to the chief; and commit no crimes in St. Paul. Check-in was at the Savoy Hotel downtown. A great deal of \"business\" was taken care of at the \"Green Lantern\" speakeasy near the train station in Lowertown. It was also known for illegal gaming. More got done in the caves across the river from downtown. In 1930 the local mob even arranged that St. Paul's new police chief would be Tom Brown. The \"Agreement\" lasted through the prohibition until 1935. In that time St. Paul welcomed John Dillinger, Billie Frechette, Ma Barker, Baby Face Nelson, Alvin Karpis, Machine Gun Kelly, Kid Cann and many of their Irish associates. Barker's gang resided a block south of the city line on Robert St.. Karpis is quoted as saying, \u201cThere was probably never before as complete a gathering of criminals in one room in the United States, as there was in the Green Lantern on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1931. There were escapees from every U.S. Penitentiary. I was dazzled.\u201d  Al Capone and Bonnie and Clyde are known to have called on the city also.  According to crime historian Paul Maccabee the only criminal there is no record of visiting St. Paul during this period is Pretty Boy Floyd.  Events in 1935 changed the St. Paul police department and closed St. Paul's open doors.On August 20, 1904, severe thunderstorms and tornadoes damaged hundreds of downtown buildings, causing $1.78 million ($50.65 million today) in damages and ripping spans from the High Bridge.WWII  On the morning of December 7, 1941, the USS Ward was manned by naval reservists. It had a crew of 115, of whom at least 85 were from St. Paul. Duty that morning was patrolling the entrance of Pearl Harbor, T.H. The watch caught sight of a periscope trailing a freighter into the harbor and the Ward took action against the unknown intruder. The crew became the first Americans to fire their weapons in WWII. A 4\"/50 gun from the ship can be seen on the state capitol grounds. WWII brought into being the second USS St. Paul. This time the city had a Baltimore-class cruiser bearing its name. That ship's bell is on display in Saint Paul's city hall.\nDuring the 1960s, in conjunction with urban renewal, Saint Paul razed neighborhoods west of downtown for the creation of the interstate freeway system. From 1959 to 1961, the Rondo Neighborhood was demolished for the construction of Interstate 94. The loss of that African American enclave brought attention to racial segregation and unequal housing in northern cities. The annual Rondo Days celebration commemorates the African American community.Downtown St. Paul had skyscraper-building booms beginning in the 1970s. Because the city center is directly beneath the flight path into the airport across the river there is a height restriction for all construction. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and Sibley Towers), The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were constructed in the late 1980s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition of bringing new immigrant groups to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Saint Paul is the location of the Hmong Archives.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSaint Paul's history and growth as a landing port are tied to water. The city's defining physical characteristic, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, was carved into the region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys. The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.\nThe Mississippi River forms a municipal boundary on part of the city's west, southwest, and southeast sides. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, lies to the west. Falcon Heights, Lauderdale, Roseville, and Maplewood are north, with Maplewood lying to the east. The cities of West Saint Paul and South Saint Paul are to the south, as are Lilydale, Mendota, and Mendota Heights, although across the river from the city. The city's largest lakes are Pig's Eye Lake, which is part of the Mississippi, Lake Phalen, and Lake Como. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 56.18 square miles (145.51 km2), of which 51.98 square miles (134.63 km2) is land and 4.20 square miles (10.88 km2) is water.The Parks and Recreation department is responsible for 160 parks and 41 recreation centers. The city ranked #2 in park access and quality, after only Minneapolis, in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the top 100 park systems across the United States according to the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nSaint Paul's Department of Planning and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into seventeen Planning Districts, created in 1979 to allow neighborhoods to participate in governance and use Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement directly from the city, the councils share a pool of funds. The councils have significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they organize residents. The boundaries are adjusted depending on population changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods. Though these neighborhoods changed over time, preservationists have saved many of their historically significant structures.\nThe city's seventeen Planning Districts are:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSaint Paul has a continental climate typical of the Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, while summers are warm to hot and humid. On the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Saint Paul falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa). The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog.Due to its northerly location in the United States and lack of large bodies of water to moderate the air, Saint Paul is sometimes subjected to cold Arctic air masses, especially during late December, January, and February. The average annual temperature of 47.05 \u00b0F (8.36 \u00b0C) gives the Minneapolis\u2212Saint Paul metropolitan area the coldest annual mean temperature of any major metropolitan area in the continental U.S.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants from about 400 A.D. were members of the Hopewell tradition who buried their dead in mounds (now Indian Mounds Park) on the bluffs above the river. The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century who fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation. The Ojibwe would later occupy the north (east) bank of the Mississippi River.\nBy 1800, French-Canadian explorers came through the region and attracted fur traders to the area. Fort Snelling and nearby Pig's Eye Tavern also brought the first Yankees from New England and English, Irish, and Scottish immigrants who had enlisted in the army and settled nearby after discharge. These early settlers and entrepreneurs built houses on the heights north of the river. The first wave of immigration came with the Irish who settled at Connemara Patch along the Mississippi, named for their home in Connemara Ireland. The Irish would become prolific in politics, city governance, and public safety, much to the chagrin of the Germans and French who had grown into the majority. In 1850, the first of many groups of Swedish immigrants passed through Saint Paul on their way to farming communities in northern and western regions of the territory. A large group settled in Swede Hollow, which would later become home to Poles, Italians, and Mexicans. The last Swedish presence had moved up Saint Paul's East Side along Payne Avenue in the 1950s.In terms of people who specified European ancestry in the 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey, the city was 26.4% German, 13.8% Irish, 8.4% Norwegian, 7.0% Swedish, and 6.2% English. There is also a visible community of people of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, representing 4.2% of Saint Paul's population. By the 1980s, the Thomas Dale area, once an Austro-Hungarian enclave known as Frogtown (German: Froschburg), became home to Vietnamese people who had left their war-torn country. A settlement program for the Hmong diaspora came soon after, and by 2000, the Saint Paul Hmong were the largest urban contingent in the United States. Mexican immigrants have settled in Saint Paul's West Side since the 1930s, and have grown enough that Mexico opened a foreign consulate in 2005.The majority of residents claiming religious affiliation are Christian, split between the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. The Roman Catholic presence comes from Irish, German, Scottish, and French Canadian settlers who, in time, would be bolstered by Hispanic immigrants. There are Jewish synagogues such as Mount Zion Temple and relatively small populations of Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists. The city has been dubbed \"paganistan\" due to its large Wiccan population.As of the 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, White Americans made up 66.5% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 62.1% were non-Hispanic whites, down from 93.6% in 1970. Blacks or African Americans made up 13.9% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 13.5% were non-Hispanic blacks. American Indians made up 0.8% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 0.6% were non-Hispanic. Asian Americans made up 12.3% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 12.2% were non-Hispanic. Pacific Islander Americans made up less than 0.1% of Saint Paul's population. Individuals of other races made up 3.4% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 0.2% were non-Hispanic. Individuals from two or more races made up 3.1% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 2.6% were non-Hispanic. In addition, Hispanics and Latinos made up 8.7% of Saint Paul's population.\nAs of the 2000 U.S. Census, there were 287,151 people, 112,109 households, and 60,999 families residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 67.0% White, 11.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 12.4% Asian (mostly Hmong), 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.8% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 7.9% of the population.\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 285,068 people, 111,001 households, and 59,689 families residing in the city. The population density was 5,484.2 inhabitants per square mile (2,117.5/km2). There were 120,795 housing units at an average density of 2,323.9 per square mile (897.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 60.1% white, 15.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 15.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.9% from other races, and 4.2% from two or more races.

St. Jude Medical, a manufacturer of medical devices, is directly across the northern border of Saint Paul in Little Canada, though the company's address is listed in Saint Paul.The city was home to the Ford Motor Company's Twin Cities Assembly Plant, which opened in 1924 and closed at the end of 2011. The plant was in Highland Park on the Mississippi River, adjacent to Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River, which generates hydroelectric power. The site is now being cleared of all buildings and tested for contamination to prepare for redevelopment. As the lead developer, the Ryan Company has released a proposed set of zoning changes that will shape how the land will be used.The city of Saint Paul has financed city development by use of tax increment financing (TIF). In 2018, the city had 55 TIF districts. Some projects that have benefited from TIF funding include the St. Paul Saints stadium, and the affordable housing along the Twin Cities Metro Green Line.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nEvery January, Saint Paul hosts the Saint Paul Winter Carnival, a tradition that began in 1886 when a New York reporter called Saint Paul \"another Siberia\". The organizers had a model in Montreal Winter Carnival the year before. The event has now been held 135 times  with an attendance of 350,000. It includes an ice sculpting competition, a snow sculpting competition, a medallion treasure hunt, food, activities, and an ice palace when it can be arranged. The Como Zoo and Conservatory and adjoining Japanese Garden are popular year-round. The historic Landmark Center in downtown Saint Paul hosts cultural and arts organizations. The city's recreation sites include Indian Mounds Park, Battle Creek Regional Park, Harriet Island Regional Park, Highland Park, the Wabasha Street Caves, Lake Como, Lake Phalen, and Rice Park, as well as several areas abutting the Mississippi River. The Irish Fair of Minnesota is held annually at the Harriet Island Pavilion area. The country's largest Hmong American sports festival, the Freedom Festival, is held the first weekend of July at McMurray Field near Como Park.\nThe city is associated with the Minnesota State Fair in neighboring Falcon Heights just west of Como Park. The fair dates to before statehood. With the competing interests of Minneapolis and St. Paul, it was held on \"neutral ground\" between both.  That area refused to become part of St. Paul or Roseville and became Falcon Heights in the 1950s. The University of Minnesota Saint Paul Campus is actually in Falcon Heights. \nFort Snelling is often identified as being in St. Paul but is actually its own unorganized territory. The eastern part of Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory (MSP included) has a St. Paul mailing address. The western side has a Minneapolis ZIP code. \n\nSaint Paul is the birthplace of cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, who lived in Merriam Park from infancy until 1960. Schulz's Peanuts inspired giant, decorated sculptures around the city, a Chamber of Commerce promotion in the late 1990s. Other notable residents include writer F. Scott Fitzgerald and playwright August Wilson, who premiered many of the ten plays in his Pittsburgh Cycle at the local Penumbra Theater.The Ordway Center for the Performing Arts hosts theater productions and the Minnesota Opera is a founding tenant. RiverCentre, attached to Xcel Energy Center, serves as the city's convention center. The city has contributed to the music of Minnesota and the Twin Cities music scene through various venues.

In 2004, it was named the best overall sports venue in the US by ESPN.\n\nThe St. Paul Saints is the city's independent league baseball team. There have been several different teams called the Saints over the years. Founded in 1884, they were shut down in 1961 after the Minnesota Twins moved to Bloomington. The St. Paul Saints were brought back in 1993 as an independent baseball team in the Northern League, moving to the American Association in 2006. Their home games are played at the open-air CHS Field in downtown's Lowertown Historic District. Four noted Major League All-Star baseball players are natives of Saint Paul: Hall of Fame outfielder Dave Winfield, Hall of Fame infielder Paul Molitor, Hall of Fame pitcher Jack Morris, and first baseman Joe Mauer.

Bill McGuire and his ownership group, which includes Jim Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, Glen Taylor of the Minnesota Timberwolves, former Minnesota Wild investor Glen Nelson, and his daughter Wendy Carlson Nelson of the Carlson hospitality company, had intended to build a privately financed soccer-specific stadium in Downtown Minneapolis near the Minneapolis Farmer's Market. But their plan was met with heavy opposition from former Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, who said her city was suffering from \"stadium fatigue\" after building three stadiums, for the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota Vikings and the Minnesota Golden Gophers, within a six-year span. On July 1, 2015, after failing to reach an agreement with the city of Minneapolis, McGuire and his partners turned their focus to Saint Paul.On October 23, 2015, Bill McGuire of Minnesota United FC and former Saint Paul Mayor Chris Coleman announced that a privately financed soccer-specific stadium would be built on the vacant Metro Transit bus barn site in Saint Paul's Midway neighborhood near the intersection of Snelling Avenue and University Avenue. It is midway between downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis. The stadium, Allianz Field, opened in April 2019 and seats 19,400.

Both the mayor and council members serve four-year terms. The current mayor is Melvin Carter (DFL), Saint Paul's first African-American mayor. Aside from Norm Coleman, who became a Republican during his second term, Saint Paul has not elected a Republican mayor since 1952.\n\nThe city is also the county seat of Ramsey County, named for Alexander Ramsey, the state's first governor. The county once spanned much of the present-day metropolitan area and was originally to be named Saint Paul County after the city. Today it is geographically the smallest county and the most densely populated. Ramsey is the only home rule county in Minnesota; the seven-member Board of Commissioners appoints a county manager whose office is in the combination city hall/county courthouse along with the Minnesota Second Judicial Courts. The nearby Law Enforcement Center houses the Ramsey County Sheriff's office.\n\n\n=== State and federal ===\n\nSaint Paul is the capital of the state of Minnesota. The city hosts the capitol building, designed by Saint Paul resident Cass Gilbert, and the House and Senate office buildings.

Several media outlets based in neighboring Minneapolis also serve the Saint Paul community, including the Star Tribune. Saint Paul is home to Minnesota Public Radio, a three-format system that broadcasts on nearly 40 stations around the Midwest. MPR locally delivers news and information, classical, and The Current (which plays a wide variety of music). The station has 110,000 regional members and more than 800,000 listeners each week throughout the Upper Midwest, the largest audience of any regional public radio network. Also operating as part of American Public Media, MPR's programming reaches five million listeners, most notably through Live from Here, hosted by Chris Thile (previously known as A Prairie Home Companion, hosted by Garrison Keillor, who also lives in the city). The Fitzgerald Theater, renamed in 1994 for Saint Paul native and novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, is home to the show.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Interstate and roadways ===\n\nResidents use Interstate 35E running north\u2013south and Interstate 94 running east\u2013west. Trunk highways include U.S. Highway 52, Minnesota State Highway 280, and Minnesota State Highway 5. Saint Paul has several unique roads such as Ayd Mill Road, Phalen Boulevard and Shepard Road/Warner Road, which diagonally follow particular geographic features in the city. Biking is also gaining popularity, due to the creation of more paved bike lanes that connect to other bike routes throughout the metropolitan area and the creation of Nice Ride Minnesota, a seasonally operated nonprofit bicycle sharing and rental system that has over 1,550 bicycles and 170 stations in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Downtown Saint Paul has a five-mile (8 km) enclosed skyway system over twenty-five city blocks. The 563-mile (906 km) Avenue of the Saints connects Saint Paul with Saint Louis, Missouri.\nThe layout of city streets and roads has often drawn complaints. While he was Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and remarked that the streets were designed by \"drunken Irishmen\". He later apologized, though people had been complaining about the fractured grid system for more than a century by that point. Some of the city's road design is the result of the curve of the Mississippi River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate.\n\n\n=== Mass transit ===\n\nMetro Transit provides bus service and light rail in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area. The METRO Green Line is an 11-mile (18 km) light rail line that connects downtown Saint Paul to downtown Minneapolis with 14 stations in Saint Paul. The Green Line runs west along University Avenue, through the University of Minnesota campus, until it links up and then shares stations with the METRO Blue Line in downtown Minneapolis. Construction began in November 2010 and the line began service on June 14, 2014. Roughly 45,000 people rode on the first day; an average 28,000 riders are expected per day.Metro Transit opened the METRO A Line, Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul's first arterial bus rapid transit line, along Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway. The A Line connects the METRO Blue Line at 46th Street station to Rosedale Center with a connection at the Green Line Snelling Avenue station. The A Line is the first in a series of planned arterial bus rapid transit lines and is set to open in early 2016.\n\n\n=== Railroad ===\nAmtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops twice daily in each direction at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Depot. Ridership on the train increased about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. A Minnesota Department of Transportation study found that increased daily service to Chicago should be economically viable, especially if it originates in Saint Paul and does not experience delays from the rest of the western route of the Empire Builder. Saint Paul is the site of the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. There are several other small yards located around the city.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nHolman Airfield is across the river from downtown St Paul.  It is the location where Lamprey lake existed until it was filled in with dredgings by the Army Corps of Engineers starting in the early 1920's.  Northwest Airlines began initial operations from Holman in 1926.  During WWII Northwest had a contract to install upgraded radar systems in B-24s employing 5,000 at the airfield.  Post WWII Holman Airfield competed with the Speedway Field for the growing aviation industry in the twin cities and lost out in the end.  Today Holman is a reliever airport run by the Metropolitan Airports Commission. It is home to Minnesota's Air National Guard, a flight training school and is tailored to local corporate aviation. There are three runways, with the Holman Field Administration Building and Riverside Hangar on the National Register of Historic Places.  The historical importance of the Northwest Airlines original building was only realized after demolition had commenced.\nFor the most part Saint Paul's aviation needs are served by the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), which sits on 2,930 acres (11.9 km2) in the Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory bordering the city to the southwest. MPS serves three international, twelve domestic, seven charter, and four regional carriers and is a hub and home base for Delta Air Lines, Mesaba Airlines and Sun Country Airlines.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nSaint Paul has eight sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nWalter Abel (1898\u20131987), actor\nLoni Anderson (born 1946), actress\nLouie Anderson (born 1953), comedian\nWendell Anderson (1933\u20132016), US Senator\nRichard Arlen (1899\u20131976), actor\nRoger Awsumb (1928-2002), TV show host \"Casey Jones\"\nHarry Blackmun (1908\u20131999), US Supreme Court Associate Justice, grew up in St. Paul\nWinfield S.

          "The Children's Museum used to be a family favorite for us. We used to have a membership and attend almost every month, but after they reconstructed, none of us ever want to come back. Since they remodeled, the museum is very loud, busy and cold. It lacks the nurturing,",
          "We stopped by, late on a Friday night, so our child could visit a new place. The Science Museum was closed for cleaning, so we tried the Children's Museum. Since they were closing soon, the ticket counter gave us vouchers for another visit. Basically two visits for the price of",

          "We were visiting Minneapolis/St. Paul for the first time with our twin toddlers. Our friend suggested that we meet up at the Children's Museum, but we weren't sure what to expect. We wondered if it would be worth our time and money. Well, it was amazing! Our girls absolutely",
          "Children like to do things, not just look, so the children's Museum gives 'em what they want such as go in a make believe full-size fire truck or bus, play with ping pong balls that are propelled with compressed air, wash a full size vehicle with soap and water, etc. Some things",

          "This museum has a bevy of interactive experiences for children of all ages. What impressed me, was that my 16 month old granddaughter entered a room with all kinds of things to capture her attention...especially the water area where she could don a raincoat and play with a",

          "We went to the museum with our two-year old grandson and our daughter. They have gone several times previously because my grandson loves the place. We now know why. We will be giving them a family membership as a Christmas gift.",
          "With the pretty substantial fee to get in plus the $15mm renovation in the past year, you would think every single activity areas would just be so fun and exciting for young children to explore. About half of areas were a lot of fun for our grandkids and about half were so",
          "We read about it, and would probably called it more like a Childrens Explorer house. You can test and play with a lot of scientific stuff in a good way. Also a couple of good playhouses. A little place for kids 0-3 was good. Cafe on site with food that keeps you going. A couple",
          "This is by far the best indoor only time we\u2019ve spent with the Grandkids (Boy 8, Girl 4). Busy, busy, busy! We spent an entire day there and they still weren\u2019t ready to leave. At least 3 hours were spent in Our Town with most of that working in the Post Office. We\u2019ll be back!",
          "We have taken our grandkids to this museum many times and they love it. Since their ages have ranged from 2 through 9 on these visits, I know the museum is fun for those ages. Since the parents and grandparents have had fun, too, I'm not sure it isn't great for all ages! Ages",
          "Everyone was great, however, there is one young man, Jordan, that is exceptional! So knowledgeable and great with the kids... young and old! Thank you for a wonderful time!",

          "We have been members since 2010 and were very happy with the museum before the renovation. Then the renovation happened where they spent $30 million to shift rooms around and add exhibits. They ended up getting rid of the exhibits that our kids loved and replacing them with new",
          "I love taking my daughter to this place. Whenever we go there, we always spend spend more time there than we expect to. There's so much to do and so much for my daughter to learn that I always fight the urge to come home so she can spend a little more time to learn all there is",
          "The kids say they only want to go for a little bit, which invariably turns into hours and hours. The 2017 redesign is fantastic with the laser maze and giant slide. Stay away from the museum on the 3rd Sunday of the month it is free and jam packed. We love it and have",
          "The recently renovated museum is amazing! So many great static and rotating exhibits that no two trips are ever the same. We love the water table in the Sprouts room, the car wash in the bottom floor, the mail room and Dinosaur Train exhibit upstairs, and of course The Scramble",

          "Went today with my 6 year old grandson. He seemed to thoroughly enjoy the museum as did most of the other kids from my observation. What struck me was how simple everything was. Both in design and function. I was trying to see the educational value of the stations wherever we",
          "I was very impressed with this place immediately. I found that the parking was aweful around the area and I thought the price could be adjusted, but all in all I found the place to be very good and good for all ages.",

          "My kids aged 9 and 2 had a lot of fun at this four-story museum in downtown St. Paul. There are ample hands-on exhibits for everyone under 12, from toddlers to early middle schoolers. Parking is adjacent to the facility in the World Trade Center garage and connected by skywalks",
          "Go at opening and kids won't let you leave. Kids could live and learn here. One of the few places where you can see your tax money working and worth every penny. Kids learn by doing, that's a new concept-ha! Parking is easier than most but still challengenging. Take bus.",
          "My daughter and I took her 2 1/2 year old daughter here recently. We like the sprout area for under 3's here. It is a busy - but safe - place for younger visitors to learn and play. The special exhibit was also fun - an area with information and activities about dinosaurs. There",
          "My grandchildren are now old enough to really enjoy the Children's Museum, so we joined. If you go more than one or twice a year, it is well worth it. Our grandchild range from 2 to 15 and there are things for everyone (even adults) to do and enjoy. Another great activity all",
          "We took our 1.5 year old daughter to the museum since they had a Daniel Tiger Exhibit going on and she loves him. She was a touch too little for most of the things, but the tot areas she really enjoyed. Very clean and wasn't very busy at all on the Friday afternoon we went.",
          "For visitors and locals alike, great place to spend a couple hours just letting kids play! Put a bunch of kids together with something as basic as a box and you will see the creativity of children. My four year old granddaughter played for 30 minutes with a group of ten",
          "I would definitely recommend coming here for ages 2-8. they just re-did it. My 14 year old came and she even liked the lazer maze. The cafe prices are really high so I would bring your own snacks. If you want to get in for free go on the 3rd Sunday of the month",
          "Spent almost 4 hrs. there with a 1 1/2 year old & 3 year old. Numerous things to do. All are interactive & exciting. Kids were having so much fun. We will be returning to finish up seeing items we didn't get to.",
          "Children\u2019s Museum in Saint Paul is without exception the best place to spend a few hours inside with the family. I have grandchildren ranging from 1 - 13 and every single one of them enjoy visiting here. The Scramble, Green Board and Lazer Maze entertain the older kids. The",
          "Visited with wife and two young sons (1 & 3). A lot of different areas to see and do things for the kids. My son was working the Post Office for a good amount of time. Every station seemed chaotic from an adult's standpoint, but to see the smiles on the boys' faces was well",
          "Not all Children's Museums are created equal. The St. Paul museum is a professional level, fantastic for kids and families museum. Plan to spend several hours interacting with all of the fun, hands on exhibits.",
          "When I was a child, I remember my mother would bring me to the Children's museum for a day full of laughter, learning, and fun! Now, with three children of my own, I couldn't imagine a better way to spend a rainy Saturday than exploring all of the delightful ins and outs of this",
          "Seriously - the revamp that was done here is amazing! My daughter absolutely loves every visit. Cannot recommend this enough, your kids will love it.",
          "Was previously a member at MCM, but found that the various children we brought seemed either too young or too old for many of the exhibits so had not renewed. Renewed at a discount price when we were with children at the MOA temporary exhibit. So this was first visit since the",
          "Any season is the perfect time to enjoy the Children's museum. The kids get to play with all kinds of fun things, very interactive hands on experience for Children and Adults, too. I love bringing nieces, nephews and grand kid to the Children's Museum.",
          "We took our two kids here on the free Third Sunday of the month. Any other day would have cost us $52.00, so it was worth it to go on this day. This place has a ton of activities for kids of all ages, and our son (4) loved it. To be honest, I hate places like this because it",
          "Love the place. Home of the Chicago Mix Popcorn (you won't be able to stop eating). If you are near Candyland you must stop by!",
          "We went right at opening with an eight-year-old and a four-year-old. The kids had been before so they led the way. They had a great time all morning long. The crowd grew throughout the morning, but it didn't impact the kids much. We stopped for lunch a bit after 11:00 and",
          "There are numerous areas of entertainment here. My son is 3 and had a great time, especially at the \u201cOur World\u201d stop and the Car Wash. The staff is also very friendly. One item that they need to address, and I\u2019m hoping that enough comments will make it happen, is to put decals",
          "We had not been to the Minnesota Childrens Museum since our children were you, now we took our granddaughter who is just over 2 years old. There is a great variety of things to do, just not for a 2 year old. If she was 6-12 it would be a great place. The disappointing part is",
          "This was an absolutely awesome place for my 3 young boys (ages 9, 7, and 2). They all had a great time and were busy. Activities definitely geared towards younger kids, but there was still plenty for my oldest to do as well. We have been to multiple children's museums in",
          "The Minnesota Children's Museum will engage your children of all ages...even if over 70! It provides a great learning experience for parents and children.",
          "The energy level was extremely high all around us. The children kept moving from one activity to the next. Very safe with friendly attendants helping with experiments and projects. Even had a special '3 & under' section that my 2 year old granddaughter could have stayed in",
          "A lot for kids to do So many hands on activities you'll be here for hours! Many different exhibits to keep your kids engaged and entertained. They won't even realize they are learning.",
          "Went with our grandchildren ages 16 months, 4 and 6 years. They had a blast! There was something for everyone. The postal service room was wonderful and the car wash and outdoor activity areas were great.",
          "We changed our plans from going to the state fair to the children's museum due to the rain on a Saturday, along with everyone else I think! The line to purchase tickets was all the way back to Subway at 10:30am and then as we were leaving at 1:30pm. The museum and snack place",
          "My mom and I brought my niece here so she could play and explore a bit. It has 4 floors worth of interactive puzzles, climbing, toys and exhibits for kids to play with. Kept my niece and most other kids entertained for a few hours. Great spot for large families or even just one",
          "Cold or wet in St Paul with the next gen in tow? Well, if they are between 2 and 12, then this place has you covered. We visited with our 4 year old daughter and she had a blast. Particularly the long slide (Scrambler) and the (real water) car wash exhibit let with her",
          "So many choices for toddlers. The toddler area had water features and kids put on raincoat. Lots of toddler friendly activities. My grandson liked the sticker room. Also a sensory room with lots of corn kernels in buns to play and pour. Another room full of balls and activities",
          "We were members before the renovation, and excitedly waited for the grand re-opening. I've been reading reviews here on TA and am so relieved that we are not the only ones highly disappointed in the changes. Both of my kids were very sad about the changes to Our World, which",
          "I read about the \"bigger, better\" museum yet we were unimpressed. We took my 11 year-old niece and my 4 year-old nephew. They played in the Scramble, there is a post office exhibit, a car wash, a room to place stickers on (?), and a do-your-own face painting area. If there was",
          "We absolutely adored the old museum and came almost every weekend with our daughter, starting when she was about 6 months old. Now she's two and half, and we were so excited for her to explore the \"new museum\" (as she calls it), but we have all been disappointed. We renewed our",
          "I took the 2-year-old sweet little girl that I nanny for a nice little outing to the museum. It was one of the more stressful experiences I have ever had. The museum was packed full of kids much older than her to the point where even I was feeling claustrophobic. With the museum",
          "I took my 11 year old nephew last week and there were only two things he was even remotely interested in. If I had known that, I wouldn't have taken him here.",
          "Our daughter has been begging us to go back to the Minnesota Children's Museum ever since the remodel has been occurring. We have held off until today. I can't begin to say how disappointed I am with the new design. I am so frustrated that I need to comment. First...I cannot",
          "Took the kids, (12,9,4) to the new meseum to check out the new exhibits. It. Was packed with daycares and families....... Which is to be expected. However, what caught me off guard was the cleanliness of the place. Way too many kids, but still kept clean!!!!! I truly liked that.",
          "Before the museum went under renovation, I really liked it, the exhibits there were great! When the renovation was completed, this museum was getting boring with nothing to do. The only things I liked there were the car wash and Tip Top Terrace. I'll give you my opinions on all",
          "If you have the time I recommend visiting the Museum, and maybe take in a show. You will not be disappointed.",
          "The Minnesota Children's Museum was recently renovated and I was able to bring my 13 month old to check it out. What a fantastic place to bring your kiddos - even as young as my daughter. So many different areas to explore, use of imagination, creativity and even a nature spot",
          "We took the family to this spot hoping we could spend a couple hours entertaining the kids (6, 9 and 12). I had no idea what to expect, but this place is fantastic! This fits all children, no matter their age or interests. The museum provides activities from climbing and slides,",
          "Great for kids under the teenage years. takes about 3-4 hrs. For most kids. Ours loved it. Second visit.",
          "Our eight, nine, and one year old had a marvelous time. The attractions kept them busy for two hours. Lots of physical activity that made this place fun for busy boys. Great play place and super staff.",
          "This museum is all about kids! Staff are very helpful and they do a great job of getting the kids engaged in the activities. The ideal age range is probably 4-10. They have a room for younger kids. Parking in the nearby World Trade is $5.00 and there are skywalks to access the",
          "We looooooove the children's museum! There is a fantastic variety of entertainment for many ages and skills. My children, 6 and 4, never seem to tire or get bored of the pretend play and water areas. Most areas have one way in/out, making it possible for me to turn them loose!",
          "Great fun for all ages.... I can't think of anything els to say... crap I still have 30 more to go.. Ah 100 ....",
          "The Minnesota Children's Museum has just completed a $30 million dollar renovation. It was great before, now it will be really great. Every year for the last 6 years I bought an annual membership for my great grandson, 2 parents and one grandparent. I think it was about $110",
          "The family or grandparent annual membership is a great option for anyone or family who expects to take a few children to the museum more than twice a year. Our grandsons are always ready and eager to visit the Children's Museum. We have enjoyed their learning while they think",

          "We are from out of town and went knowing many of the areas were under construction. We loved it! The areas that were open were fun and interactive. The staff and volunteers were so friendly, patient and were always interacting with the children. I can only imagine how amazing",
          "This is fun place to let kids explore and play! We went during early morning (10ish) and it was a bit crowded. It got better around lunch time as parents left with their younger kids. Lots of hands on and creative activities!",

          "The Children's Museum is fun for very small kids - kindergarten and younger probably. It's a bit pricey for what it is though and can be very crowded. I'd save this as a trip for one of those bad weather days when you're desperate for an indoor family activity.",
          "There are a lot of activities for kids under 10. There are art projects, climbing opportunities, water and bubbles, paper making, special exhibits and other activities. If you are looking for some thing to do this is a good option.",

          "Sad to say, a formerly excellent museum needs a major investment in both facilities and a exhibits to live up to its former glory. It's a shame, too, because it comes close in so many areas. The settings are wearing out, many of the creative manipulatives are shopworn and",
          "It's amazing...3 stories with multiple things to do on each floor. We had a hard time getting the kids away from the 1st room, telling them there's more! And boy was there. It's a little pricey, but if you stay for a few hours, it's well worth the money.",

          "A good portion was closed during our visit and remaining exhibits were largely ones shared in other children's museums we have visited: a water works / bubble zone, an ant-hill climbing zone, big foam blocks. All fun stuff, fine to burn half-a-day with kids, but it didn't take",
          "Brought our 2 yr. old grandchild with his mom on New Year's Day. If your child can walk this is a great place to be. The activities and displays seem to be largely for kids 2-10. Older than that, they would probably be bored to death, except for adults of any age that happen to",

          "The museum had something for all my three kids of different ages and personalities. There is lots of room for active, physical, imaginative play. The water area was particularly popular with the little ones. And the roof top play area was great for sunny days. Honestly, I could",

          "I spent hours there with a 6 year old. There were so many activities, he had a blast! We easily spent 3 hours playing without getting bored. Outdoor activities on the roof, water play, building, dress up, animals, you name it, they've got it. Highly recommended.",
          "There is nothing much in this CM. There was craft class going on, which was ok but apart from the class there was nothing much to do for the kids (except one climing activity, which lasts 3-4 minutes). Our daughter was very excited going there but once she was out of craft",

          "My children have enjoyed playing here for years. It is especially a nice break on a cold day. Their favorite place is the building area with the crane you can try and the water area. Beware the museum can become too crowded especially on their free Sunday each month. I have also",
          "The kids, 2 & 4, both gave this attraction two thumbs up. Everything is geared to kids and they were very comfortable exploring what the museum had to offer. Everything was very clean and organized too. My only complaint would be the washrooms. There weren't enough which",

          "This is an amazing Children's Museum, one of the best I have ever been to. My only regret is that we do not live here to take advantage of such an amazing museum more often. If you are in the area and need to find a place for your child to get some exercise, this is certainly",
          "We were visiting Saint Paul and went to the children's museum for two dayswith a 5 and 2 year old. The facility is set up in rooms, perfect for watching two children of different ages. It was well stocked, the exhibits were in pristine condition, and there was a perfect blend of",
          "My kids are always in a wonder when we go to this museum. They have a lot of fascinating activities for children to enjoy and my kids are always so happy when they get to go there. Not many things I dislike, as long as my children are happy, then I'm happy as well.",
          "I can't believe we spent two full days there, but we did. Our one and five year old found so much to do we just couldn't leave. Excellent facility, clean, organized, and nothing was broken. Loved it!",
          "We spent a good portion of a day here with a 3 and 1 year old. There was lots to do, they were worn right out. The admission is very reasonable, especially with the $2 off coupon found at tourist booths.",
          "With many activites from science to everyday living, everything is hands-on. The one problem I thought I would have was when the school buses arrived. They addressed that issue by closing off certain areas for an hour to just families so we wouldn't have to deal with the",
          "There are many areas in the museum for different age groups. Some of the spaces need some refreshing as the look a bit worn. There were a lot of items that seemed to be germ magnets to me--like stuffed animals and costumes that couldn't be easily cleaned on a daily basis.",
          "Our family has been to multiple children's museums in the midwest. This has by far been the best! My 11 year old was entertained enough to not be completely bored and my 3 year old loved it as well. We went on a Sunday and it was rather busy, but tolerable. There were lots",
          "This is a great museum for kids ages 6 and under. My boys are 3 and 5. It's clean, well organized, has a terrific variety of activities, and easy access to bathrooms! There are 5 floors which can be a little daunting, but there are elevators. One of the exhibits changes about",
          "if you have little ones this is the place to spend the day! the kids get to do sooooo many hands on fun it will be a rewarding day",
          "I took 2 of my nieces there. The 1 year old was too young for it, and the 8 year old was beyond what it had. I would have thought a children's museum would cater to an 8 year old, but it seemed more designed for those around 5. It was also pretty small, and we saw pretty much",
          "I took my daughter there on Sunday and we had a great time. Several regular exhibits for kids to learn and play, and my girl was thrilled with the Sid the Science Kid traveling exhibit.",
          "We love the museum, and the Sid exhibit was awesome. The other new exhibit was great as well, looking forward to see what the future holds for the remodel. Definitely worth getting a membership yearly. Our kids love it anytime we come visit.",
          "This is a great place for the kids under 8 or so. The younger the better. Fun things for tikes and dress up/store play is awesome! Not much for adults to do while kids are playing is the only reason for the loss of a star. Would be neat if there were more things to read or",
          "We had time to kill before heading to the airport so we chose this. Our child was 11 months at the time and while there were alot of things she was unable to enjoy, there were a few things she could enjoy. The Tots room leaves much to be desired - what a complete letdown.",

          "So glad we stopped here on our trip. Kids (3 and 1) had so much to do and had so much fun. We've been to children's museums before but this one took the cake! Kids of all ages would not get bored here. Staff was very helpful and nice. Would make the trip just to visit again!",
          "I went here for an afternoon with my 3 year old and 6 year old. My impression of the place is this is an expensive indoor play area with some opportunities for learning. Some of the displays were out of service. I struggle to describe this experience because it doesn't seem so",
          "Not the cheapest Museum, but not that expensive either. My 5 and & year olds had a ball for over 3 hours. Its a great interactive space for kids to hang out, really well set up with toilets everywhere, and a eating room for those who had brought their own lunch and snacks. No",
          "The grandkids loved it. It is educational and hands on experiences for the kids. Science, medical, how things work. They can even shop in a pretend supermarket or be the cashier!",
          "We have taken our grand children to the children's museum for years. They are a bit too old for it now but they remember it fondly. What a fun space to freely explore and learn. I believe the children carry a memory of this great place with them all their lives.",
          "I've chaperoned multiple elementary school field trips. The kids always have a great time and I do too!",
          "A fun day for children 2-6 or 7. There are quite a few activities on multiple floors. while it seemed a little disorganized, the child we took had fun. I can't imagine, however, taking multiple children because it was so crowded that it would be difficult to keep track of",
          "I took my nine and four-year-old grandsons and they had a blast. I was worried that the nine-year-old would be bored but I was worried for nothing. I will be back not only because the kids had such an awesome time but because there is so much to see and do that we couldn't do",
          "We went on a Sunday thinking it was the free Target Sunday, but we were off a week. No regrets. I'd gladly pay the price of admission (only $9.95 per person) many times over for the experience, and far less crowding than on the free day. So much stuff to do for all ages. My son",
          "My son wanted to go to Thomas the Train Museum so I did some research and found the Minnesota Children's Museum had and exhibit. So I planned his trip. The negative first: parking was a nightmare. Anyone visiting from out of town make sure you keep your parking ticket on",
          "We are frequent visitors of the Children's Museums in Wisconsin (Green Bay and Appleton) but the Children's Museum in St. Paul takes the cake. There are two big highlights: The 'ant' area, which has an extensive system of carpeted child-size tunnels where the kids can pretend",
          "Kids loved it! Tons of fun things to do. Tunnels for kids to crawl around. Could go dozens of times and not see the same things.",
          "This is my first time to see a so great place for children to play, learn, and interact with other children. It also provides many opportunities to explore creativity for both children and adults. A wonderful museum for a family!!",
          "We took our three and a half year old and almost one year old to this museum. We stayed about three hours but really needed at least six hours to really let the kids go crazy and have free reign. This is a wonderful place for children, even down to babies. Our baby is not",
          "I want to love the Children's Museum. We have been members in the past. Unfortunately, I never really did. I don't know what didn't work about it for me. Overall, my children were bored with the museum after the first time through. That being said, the staff is wonderful",
          "We took 4 kids, ages 3-11, to the Minnesota Children's Museum and loved it. There was something for all of the kids to do there, although I will say that the 11-year old is at the top of the age range for this museum. In any case, they had great fun crawling around in the ant",
          "This \"museum\" is too expensive and dirty to enjoy. Our own toys are more educational and enjoyable. The kids all seemed to share without being coached which was nice to see.",
          "My husband and I took our 2-year-old daughter here when we were in town visiting family, and we thought it was really great. She especially loved the city bus and the Thomas Train exhibit, and we could not pry her away from the water tables. I was a little surprised to see it",
          "We head to the museum a lot and don't get bored. There is interactive hands-on play and exhibits and play areas of all kinds, and all germ-free. I have three daughters (eleven, nine, and newly three) and it is fun for all ages! Best museum ever!",
          "I visited this museum with my family (2 adults, a 2-yr old and 4-yr old), and another family (1 adult, a 7-yr old and twin 5-yr olds). We all had a blast! We went on a Sunday, and found free street parking (woot!). Unfortunately, there was no cafe or restaurant inside of the",
          "When I am in town to see my children, we often go to the museum. They love the crane where they can experiment and pick up things, the water room, and the room at the top where they can create a storm! They especially like the room where it is like a town with the bus and all",
          "We took our son to see the Thomas Train exhibit. He loved seeing Thomas and Percy and playing on the huge train table. However the exhibit was somewhat small for the amount of visitors (a Friday afternoon). We found the rest of the museum to be an enjoyable experience despite",
          "First time in MANY years I have been to the Minnesota Children's Museum and I was impressed! Took our 2 New York City granddaughters for a rainy summer afternoon when they visited recently. I was impressed by the quality and variety of the exhibits we encountered. The girls",
          "We made the trip to St. Paul this summer with our three-year-old son to primarily see the Thomas & Friends exhibit. We didn't tell him where we were going or what we would be seeing so he became so excited when he saw the Thomas the Train picture on the front of the building! He",
          "Having a five year old boy, a stop at the local children's museum is always a must on our family vacations. This museum is definitely in the top five we have experienced. There are great exhibits for all ages that incorporate large motor and fine motor skill development as well",
          "By far the best museum for kids that I've seen. My three-year-old granddaughter spent a couple of hours here -- it's one of her favorite places -- and there's always something to do. Staffers are kind and patient. Parking is relatively inexpensive and nearby.",
          "I wasn't sure how much my 2 year-old would get out of this visit, but he LOVED it. In one of the exhibits, the kids pretend to be ants in a colony. My son was running up and down the ramps and saying \"Mommy! So fun! So fun!\" I loved that they had such a variety of play - large",
          "I took my daughter, who loves Thomas the Train to MCM and she had a blast. With every turn there was something new to see and do.",
          "It is a wonderful place to take your kids with you. Even better than an amusement park, my son spent hours on each station. If so good for their brain. They leant and get to know a lot. It's quite huge and totally worth of money. If you are new to children's museum like me. Come",
          "We took a 4 year old and he absolutely loved it! Thomas the Train was the special exhibit, but he wasn't nearly as excited about that as he was the \"anthill\". He couldn't get enough of this! There were child sized tunnels with a couple of levels. Inside the tunnels, there",
          "We have been going to the MN Children's Museum for the last 10 years and have always had a very positive experience. We have been there with four kids who just turned one year old and they had fun in the Habitot area which is designed especially for the little ones. On summer",
          "This was the best rainy day play solution!! The sheer volume of outstanding educational play opportunities was astounding. Its location, layout and variety of exhibits were highlights. Parking was a bit dicey but that's to be expected in any downtown area. The hands on,",
          "My aunt gave us free passes while we visited last summer. We have 3 kids, aged 2, 7 and 10. There was something to do for all of them. The 2-year-old especially loved the water play area and the \"motor room.\" Everything was bright and clean.",
          "Totally child friendly place. Everything is at their level and interactive. Kids are learning while they play. Has always been a favorite",
          "The pint size town is a must see. The dinosaur exhibit was great but could have been more informative. The Earth sounds exhibit was closed due to a child \"accident\" eww.",
          "We live about an hour away so we usually only visit the museum annually. My children are now 7 and 10 and we just came back from our spring break visit. My kids played so hard in the 4 hours we were there they both fell into bed exhausted that night. Their favorite areas are the",
          "This is an excellent children's museum, especially for preschool and young elementary kids. It is beautiful, bright, spacious, and well-designed for keeping an eye on kids because the exhibits are separated with one main atrium space. It has the regular children's museum",
          "We went to the MCM with our 2 & 4 year olds. They loved the exhibits, and we parents did too. I liked that there were different rooms to explore. Our favorites were the toddler room, which allowed lots of gross motor play, and the dinosaur exhibit. We packed a lunch and",
          "We took our 6 year old and he was pretty bored- the only thing he really enjoyed was the ant tunnel. I think that the Science Museum has much more to offer.",
          "We enjoyed our holiday visit to the MCM. The exhibits were fun for our almost 2 year old and the parents and grandparents enjoyed it as well. There are water tables (bubbles too!), a factory with lots of conveyor belts, a play area for the very young, craft room, giant ant",
          "This place is great for young children. I think that the majority of the exhibits are geared toward young children, there isn't really anything for kids 8-10. I think anyone over 7 would be a little bored. I took my 9 year old here and she had fun, but she definitely found some",
          "I have 3 young children, and have been to the Minnesota (and many other) Children's Museum before. In general, I have not found the special attractions to be interesting and engaging for all ages. Either the kids have enjoyed them, and I was bored, or they were bored and I",
          "Is it February and the kids are bouncing off the walls? Tired of being cooped up indoors because of the 3rd snowstorm in March? Can't stand the idea of visiting Mall of America with out of town relatives again? Take the kids to the Minnesota Children's museum. This attraction",
          "This is not a traditional walk and see museum, but a play and do stuff kind of museum. They have fun play and learning activities for kids of all ages. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The rooms are laid out in different themes and activities- makes for a great day out",
          "We did not get to stay long enough, but my 6 year old and I had a great time here. A variety of science related exhibits. Friendly folks.",
          "Excellent place for the toddlers and preschoolers. Not just a go-see museum, kids can give a try on everything and each one gives good learning opportunity. There are lot of simple things (light, water, environment, animals, birds) which are made into fun-filled activities.",
          "This was a fabulous children's museum. Absolutely worth the admission price. Plan to stay at least 4 hours.",
          "My children had a great time at MCM! There are plenty of hands on activities: face painting, water table, building blocks and a great infant play area. The Dora exhibit was neat!",
          "If you have children you absolutely have to take them here. They will have a wonderful time exploring the interactive exhibits. They even have a separate area for tiny ones!",
          "We visited with a 2 year old and a 10 year old, and they both had a lot of fun! It was also very wheelchair accessible so my mother could see all the fun. There are several galleries,with some permanent exhibits as well as changing exhibits, so we spent the whole day there.",
          "This place is a blast for younger kids! Three floors of things to explore, everything is interactive so the kids can actually play and learn instead of just \"look but don't touch\". Great place to go any time of year but particularly nice in the dead of winter. Ample restroom and",
          "The Children's Museum is best for very small children, with activities that will appeal to preschoolers. The emphasis is more on playing activities then on educational museum learning, but that is OK for the smaller crowd. There is even a room just for babies to play. I highly",
          "The Children's Museum is constantly changing and is a must see for visitors with all ages of children. The grandchildren just love going there.",
          "We came here after discovering that the Science Museum was closed Mondays. My 5 year old had a ball. Very active hands on play in various different rooms with different themes. We were there or a little over 3 hours and she did not want to leave. Lots of benches for parents or",
          "Visited the museum mid-afternoon during the week. There were quite a few daycares there, but still plenty to see and do. Younger children will love the Dora and Diego room, while our older children loved the paper factory portion where you make recycled paper sculptures.",
          "I went with my daughter on no group Tuesday, which meant a smaller crowd of kids. We arrived right as the museum opened at 9 am and were among the first inside. For about 10 minutes she even had the whole \"Habitot\" gallery to herself (we started there, since that was recommended",
          "This Museum is right downtown St. Paul and parking is easy to access. It is always full of kids of all ages exploring the exhibits and doing the activities.Younger, very active kids will need to go back when they are older, since they just love the freedom of running around and",
          "Our boys are 2 and 4 and they had a blast here. I think it was well worth the money and time to go see. We spent two hours there and had to get going but i think the kids could have easily spent another 2 there! If your in the area with younger kids i would make this a must see",
          "Wow this place was awesome for our kids and i wish I had a place like this to explore when I was younger.",
          "We took our three grandchildren - 4, 2 & almost 2 - on a Sunday morning. The activities were well suited to small children and the staff were especially attentive. There is a variety of activities, both creative and exploratory, the are perfect for the attention span of",
          "Went here with a 2 year old during the middle of the week in early June. Very easy to get to, and parking is accessible and reasonably priced. That was sort of where my enjoyment stopped. The set up of the museum is very vertical. On 4 different floors, so you always need to",
          "My 2 year old daughter LOVED it here. So much to do and see, and all of it safe for her little hands. I wish there was more supervision from parents but that can be a problem anywhere...just need to keep a close eye on your little one. I'd love to bring her back soon!",
          "We recently visited friends in St. Paul, so we decided to go to the museum on a rainy Wednesday. Unfortunately, the place was packed with visitors and school groups. There were children running and screaming everywhere, and the noise level was unbearable. Some of the displays",
          "Our 20 month old grandson was happy to roam and explore every room. Children, from tiny toddlers to pre-teens packed the museum when we were there. Their excitement was palpable. The museum had tons to do and explore from a city bus to a room where kids can make it rain. The",
          "I brought my son to the museum around 11am, and he had a great time. Granted, I should have gottten their earlier so that it wouldn't be so busy. Overall, we had a great time. It's so big and so much stuff to do, it takes more than 1 visit for a kid to explore everything.",
          "Great time. purchased part of Big Ticket. Parking was high in ramp $10 but otherwise very interesting for daughter 9.",
          "What a fun place to visit! The biggest problem was keeping up with our 5 and 8-year-old grandchildren. Be prepared, there are lots of children everywhere enjoying all the activities. There is a plethora of interactive learning rooms throughout the building. At Mom\u2019s insistence,",
          "Great place to let the kids explore and to be a kid yourself. Some free days but worth admission price also.",
          "We've been taking our son to the museum since he was about a year old. They have a toddlers only section to play in which he loved. As he grew older, he has loved different sections of the museum with the water stations his favorite all along. I personally love the roof top art",
          "We went here on Thanksgiving weekend 2012. We took a 3 year old and a 14 year old grandson with us. It was great for both age groups. I was surprised the 14 year old enjoyed it almost as much as the 3 year old. I've been to other Children's Museums, and this is by far the",
          "We take our two preschool grandchildren to the Children's Museum on a regular basis. It can be very crowded so I make a very deliberate plan. We arrive just as the doors open, 9 a.m.. We hit the activities that you want to most do without crowds. This is the time of day where",
          "We love this place. We have had a membership since our son turned about 1 1/2 and only wish we had gotten one sooner. There is so much to do and the different exhibits are great. I think it's great for kids once they start crawling as they have \"Habitot\" which is for kids under",
          "This is a great place with endless activities for kids to enjoy. I've been taking my daughter here since she was 2 (they have a spacious toddler play room and many other areas that work for smaller kids) and every year we enjoy different things and the new focus exhibits. We",
          "I have two small children, and both of them loved this place. There is a lot of interactive stuff for them to do. It was hard getting them to leave. The staff is very friendly, and very willing to help. We bought annual passes to come back later.",
          "We love the MN Children's Museum. As soon as your little one can walk, they are ready to explore the museum. Check out the free admission every third Sunday- esp. first thing in the morning before it gets too busy. There is a lot to see and do and this place never gets old",
          "Another great place to go and learn. Love how they keep having new things. Also the Omni Theater is wonderful. Love this place.",
          "I was probably 16 when I stopped going to the Children\u2019s Museum because I wanted to play there. I really liked it and have good memories from there. I am in the BBBS program and I was excited when my Little wanted to go there for Grossology. Parking is a hassle, there is a",
          "What a great place to spend the day. My grandson is 3 and has a great time here. Mini golf, hands on activities, and a great water station! A must visit!",
          "Great place to visit with kids. Lots of \"hands on\" things to do. Great place to visit when it is cold outside. Will be returning again when we spend time with our grandkids in MN.",
          "I took my almost 2 year old twins to the Museum and they had a fantastic time. We also had a great time watching them enjoy and absorb all of the activities, and adventures they were able to experience. The exhibits were great, although some were geared toward older children. We",
          "We have visited various children's museums on both coasts and in between and none is finer than Minnesota's. The size, variety and quality of the museum are all outstanding. Every visit brings something new. The staff is great.",
          "Two grandchildren, frequent visits...I know every inch of this place. The 7 and 9 year old still love it, and so do I. Just plain exciting. Don't forget to go up to the outside deck where the water play and messy arts live...and where you can catch a break from the frenetic kid",
          "We have visited the MN Children's Museum many times over the past 15 years, having held memberships many times. The attractions are always creative, safe, and interactive. Children of different ages can interact at different levels with all the exhibits and adults can learn",
          "The exhibits are more geared towards the 7 and under set, but our at that time 9 year old enjoyed himself very much. He grumbled when he heard he was going to a Children's Museum, but it was hard to get him to leave.",
          "There's sure to be something to interest and occupy every little person, from toddlers to older children. Our toddler loves the activites in the toddler room - just his size and interest level.",
          "Our granddaughter loves this place, and so do we. It is all hands-on, and the exhibits are structured so that the children can explore and learn without a lot of adult interference. We seem to manage to go there at least once every time we visit.",
          "The Habitot was a great area for my daughter when she was an infant/toddler because it was a safe place to explore for younger kids. Now that she is 2.5 years old, she enjoys the changing exhibits (e.g. Curious George), the rooftop art area, the minature town and definitely the",

          "We can here for my nephew's birthday. My sister in law rented a room so we can have food and cake before going off on an adventure. For a cheap price, the kids can play allllllll day long. As long as they want. I have always love this place as a kid and still enjoying it til",
          "You can easy spend a whole day here. Up and down. Left and right. Press buttons and make yourself wet. Some car parks give discounts when you go to the museum. We found this childen museum better than the one in Chicago",
          "Great exhibits and interactive things to do. Our \"play date\" was a blast, and we learned lots about our world. On a Sunday afternoon, the museum wasn't busy at all (September), and we only had to wait to see a few things. Definitely worth the money to go. If you had kids, it",
          "We were visiting the area & were looking for things to do with our 4 & 2 yr old. We were drawn to the museum because they had a section with Curious George, who my son loves. We were there about 5 hours, including the time we took to have lunch. There are vending machines",
          "We only planned on a few hours but my kids loved it's we could not even finish the whole museum. They loved everything and were in heaven, one is 6 and the other is 8. It was amazing to see how engaged they were with the exhibits. Awesome job and we, be back",
          "I would put this at the top of my list for things to do with kids in the Twin Cities. It's geared towards infants to 10 year olds they say, but 10 might be pushing it. Although we heard they had a dinosaur exhibit that we missed. That might have been better. Our fave parts were",
          "This venue deserves it's high rating. My four year old son loved it and could have spent the entire day there. Good value for the price.",
          "We visited on a rainy day. It provided a lot of room for the kids to get their energy out, but it was pointless activity. I like my kids' activities to have some sort of learning objective clearly outlined, and I didn't see that here. Kids had a fine time; I was bored.",
          "Took our 5 year old there who normally loves children's museums, not this one. In the store and doctors office most of the items in enclosed cases, can't handle the items at all. A few interactive activities but not enough. Way too many children running around without a parent",
          "Has to be one of the best in the country! It is great for adults too! So much fun. Highly recommend.",
          "During a business trip to the area, our son and his wife brought our 1-year old grandson to meet us for the afternoon. We decided to go to this museum. This is a very well-designed chuldren's museum. Our grandson thoroughly enjoyed discovering new sights and things to try out.",
          "We took my four year old and eight month old here in July. I mention the eight month old as there has to be enough to keep you occupied while holding the baby, and letting the four year old explore. They hit the mark perfectly and the morning flew by, the roof garden was",
          "It is so hands on! A wonderful place for the little kids.",
          "The MN Children's Museum is probably the best children's museum I have taken my grandchildren to (and there have been many all over the country). It is great!!",
          "My kids loved this place when they were young. Lots of hands-on exhibits, switched out on a regular schedule.",
          "This was our first trip to the Children's Museum since I was a child myself and I wanted to bring my kids. They had a lot of fun and the tiny town was the best. Could have spent HOURS just in that section. Only cons was it was a little pricy for us as we are on a budget but",
          "Kids out of elementary school will probably get bored. However, younger kids will have a blast! My 9 month old loved it.",
          "My four year old loves this place. We go on rainy days, sunny days, weekends and everyday we can think of. It's always changing so he doesn't get bored. Always have to leave before he's had enough so I know we will continue our membership.",
          "Kids love this place. I've been here several times with all four of my kids and time flies when you're there. There's so much to do, you can't actually get it done all in one day. Almost all of it is hands-on, and kids don't even realize their learning something while they have",
          "Several different floors and special exhibits let the children explore on their own. The museum is setup for different ages. Well worth the trip.",
          "Lots of educational experiences for kids, many cleverly disguised as games.",
          "We got a family membership as a gift from our parents for Christmas, and we have put it to good use! My 4 yr. old loves it there. We go 2-3 times a month. They have galleries for kids of all ages (even toddlers), but it's especially geared for younger grade-school kids. I",
          "This place is amazing. The ant hill was my son's favorite!",
          "A great place for kids to experience science and many other important topics. Very hands on so the little ones love it. Can get noisey but is worth it.",
          "My daughter loved this museum! If it was cheaper we would go every weekend!!",
          "We loved the Childrens Museum. The children had a blast playing and learing new things. I really love visiting this location and recommend this to all ages.",
          "We spent the day in St Paul and took in a few attractions including the children's museum. Our two boys ages 2 1/2 and 7 had an excellent time. (They both fell asleep on the way back to the hotel). This Children's Museum has a toddler area, and several attractions for all",
          "This place has it all, infant space, toddler spaces and preschool and older spaces. My kids loved it.",
          "With 4 floors there was something to appeal to kids of every age. At the Children's Museum in our own city, we rarely stay more than an hour with our young child, but here we had to drag the wee one out after three hours. If we'd planned better, we'd have gone and ate lunch,",
          "Not so much for the older kids pre-teens. But for the under 10's a great place to visit",
          "Whether you are a child or a parent or a grandparent or a friend...this place is great! The exhibits rotate so check before you go. Also, Target sponsors third Sundays for free, a great opportunity for all to explore but it gets very busy, so if you can afford another day, i",

          "Play like you're a kid again! Bring your smile and your attitude and lots of energy cuz there is so much to see and do! The features change on a regular basis so you can visit every few months and find new things to see and do. Our girls LOVE this place and it's in a great",
          "Wonderful hands on activities, like paper making and learning how water flow and currents work. Warning, Kids mostlikely will get wet!!!",
          "I will return at least twice per year with my 4 and 5 year old. Great family experience.",
          "We've visited so many children's museums around the country, and this one is superb! Here are a couple of helpful tips based solely on my experience. This may not reflect every single day and every single visit. * We thought we'd beat the crowds by getting there early. Nope.",
          "The fun is endless for parents, kids and grandparents. Now that my kid is older, I'd like to borrow someone else's kids just so I could go and play there. Any age could go- from toddler on up!",

          "Disappointing. We had taken our grandsons to the museum several times before the renovation and thought very highly of it. After all the money spent on it we expected much more. The eating areas were better and there were more bathrooms. \u2026",
          "Used to be members when we lived here before it was updated. Came back to town to visit and was excited to see the new place. The old museum was better. So much unused space here. My kids are 2 and 4 and didn't really enjoy.",
          "Newly renovated and modern space with lots of engaging and fun activities for the whole family! The cafe serves Caribou espresso and a good variety of healthy (and not so healthy but yummy) choices. We love it here.",
          "My 2 year old son loved this place. There is a nice little are for smaller kids, there were some more boisterous bigger kids, but the staff made sure they were careful.",
          "I don't even want to give this place one star! All I can say is that I really wish they didn't do the remodel. It sucks. It's plain, the exhibits are boring. There's hardly any exhibits where the kids can interact (mainly the \u2026",
          "Really isn\u2019t much to do for the cost. $7.50 for parking and $52 for a family of 4. Were in and out in 30 minutes......",
          "This weekend I was visiting my poor parents in Minnesota and I wanted to enrich my already very large artistic palet by visiting my parents local museum. The first thing that put me off was the name who names a museum after children. And \u2026",
          "Had a great day with the kindergarteners from Osceola. We spent five fun and loud hours trying everything we could. The car wash was awesome.",
          "Great place for kids! My kids can play here for hours while I sit on a bench and relax. It is a perfect place to go for cold winter days, and a yearly membership is more than worth it. They even have a play area for children 3 and under, \u2026",
          "All I can say is very disappointed!! I prefer the old museum instead of the new one. I remember our first time visit the museum was back in 2015, we were very impressed by everything especially the \"our world\" room. My kids love it. So we \u2026",
          "We could spend 5 hours here no problem!  I just wish they had doors or Gates on more of the areas.  When there's lots of kids and you're trying to keep track of multiple little ones it gets stressful knowing they can easily walk out of the area.",
          "Visited with an eight year old and a four year old who had been before. They had a great time all morning. Lunch from the cafe was good and not expensive. We played for an hour after lunch, got tired and went home. A pretty perfect day for the kids.",
          "I really enjoyed the new amenities at the refurbished Children's Museum. There are lot of things to see and do...many more activities on each floor that were geared toward multiple age groups. It was a great way to spend an afternoon.",
          "Calling this place a museum is a big stretch. As an indoor playground this place is a five star. Without any educational value, this \"museum\" gets a solid 1 star.",
          "Please give this place a good cleaning.  It\u2019s quite dirty. Not very sanitary for kids or anyone else. It\u2019s making enough money to take care of this part of any  daily busy place involving children",
          "We forgot socks, my kids decided to wear flip flops, so we could not do the climbing exhibit.  My kids loved the fire truck, post office, and car wash.  I liked the laser maze and carpet skate park.",
          "The old was way better... this place is boring and nothing but chaos.  So disappointed ...  The interactive restaurant and medical and post office was lame... nothing like the old one...which was way better. Will not waste my money ever again.",
          "I was planning on bringing my son there this Saturday and now I see they will be closed. So lame! We live 3 hours away so not many opportunities for us to visit.",
          "Great place to take kids of all ages!  Lots to do with a variety of activities from slides, a climbing wall, a small town and kitchen, laser room, and more.",
          "My 2 year old daughter had the time of her life. It was so enjoyable to watch her excitement as she played and interacted with other children while exercising her body and brain.",
          "Great experiences for my 10 mo and 2.75 yo.  Parking is difficult during peak hours. The ramp across the street fills quickly. After speaking with a manager, they said they're working on increasing parking availability for this new location.",
          "If I did this review before the remodel it would have been a 4.  The remodel makes it a 1.  We liked the original museum better!  The outdoor terrace went from hours of fun and fascination to 5 minutes of bore.  The Our World exhibit is far \u2026",
          "My kids (ages 2 & 6) loved ever area!  Hours of fun!  I disagree with some of the comments about t being better for little kids only- my 6 year old loved it and never got bored.  They are doing a good job of keeping it fun and functional during construction! ",
          "Absolutely amazing! Every exhibit was so fun we stayed for 7 hours (until close) because they wouldn't leave even when offered candy.  The Minnesota Children's Museum is better than candy. ",
          "Terrible. Went with school fieldtrip today. It is basically now a 4 story McDonald's playplace but not that cool. The kids love to climb but could do that anywhere. Zero educational value. The our world room is now antiseptic and boring \u2026",
          "New entrance, new toys, new fun experiences! The updated layout really shows you how stale the other was getting. We now have lasers! Now the space seems more open and the activities are sure to please and tease the minds of your little \u2026",
          "This would have been a 5 before the remodel. The spaces are too open on the first two floors. It's Sooooo easy loose a child and find him 3 or 4 exhibits over. I  don't think I have to tell you that is very frightening. \n\nAlso a lot of the \u2026",
          "My little one liked it but it's just a play area. Minor real learning.",
          "We absolutely love love love spending time here!!!! We have a family membership and it is worth every penny. From my 10 year old to my 1 year old there is something fun for everyone.",
          "We thought it was VERY over priced for what they offered. Way different than I remember. Not much of a 'museum' for children. More of a large indoor playground. Where our 2 & 3 year old daughter's were charged the same amount as we were. \u2026",
          "My almost 2 year old LOVED the exhibits. It\u2019s clean, well kept and a really great value for younger kids.",
          "5 stars every time! Any child 10 and under will love it! 35 yr old children like myself love it too. ;-)",
          "It is absolutely great for kids under 5.  \nThe 8 year old kids got bored very quickly.  It seems to be geared more towards 5 and under.  It would be nice to see some more big kids stuff, like experiments and hands on learning.  It is VERY clean and everything is organized and looks nice and colorful!",
          "Great time for my nephew!!!! Easily the best children's museum!! Bring a change of clothes for tots and toddlers so they can get wet! Eat or bring own food cafeteria has fake display food\\dessert that is not on menu strange decision. \ud83d\ude36",
          "Not worth the $60 I spent. All the exhibits seemed very underfunded and didn't have very much to actually have kids interact with. Could have just taken my kids to a local FREE park and they would have had just as much fun and kept my $60 \u2026",
          "I would not recommend the newly designed Museum. We (My 3rd year old and I) went today (8/18) and I thought we would eat there. However, we found the food to be over priced as well as refreshments. It was also hot inside the \u2026",
          "It is a great place to bring younger kids. We have a 4 year old and a 2 year old and they have a great time. I'd say it's a great place for kids under 6 years old to visit. For kids around 6 years old and older, the Science Museum may be more appropriate for them. We are members of both.",
          "Really fun place that is constantly changing.\n(Currently under major construction.) We have gone with the family many times and have had great educational experiences by just letting the kids run around, build, craft, and explore. ",
          "This place is not to be missed by families with children of any age. What a fantastic bargain. I look forward to my next St. Paul visit as I will bring my daughter here each and every time we visit the area. Wonderful. Full of learning and fun activities. Must go. ",
          "I went with my 8, 6 and 2 year old and fun for the entire family, on every floor. I had to pry the kids out of their just to go and eat... so glad I have a membership here huge for the winter time here in Minnesota for sure. \n\nThanks",
          "A wonderful place to allow for your child to use their imagination!! Staff are very pleasant and helpful!!",
          "Lots of fun things for children to do. I think it was money well spent. I was impressed. Lots of hands on things for small children so they learn how things work. ",
          "Great for the kids - if you live close I would encourage a season pass for the family.  The kids learn interactively, get tired out, get to play in the water, sand, or other environments, and they always have special exhibits.  The Halloween Party was a special favorite when our kids were younger!",
          "Awesome place for kids to learn and play!  Very helpful and friendly staff.",
          "I would give 6 stars if I could!  The new exhibits are all wonderful.  Our kids would have spent all day.  You simply must go.",
          "You guys have got to be kidding! Like an idiot I payed for the year pass. I was in and out in 20 minutes with my 2 year old who couldn't care less. How can this place be called a museum? There was nothing look at. A sad attempt at a jungle \u2026",
          "I liked coming here when I was younger.  My favorite exhibits were One World and Animal Habitats.  If you have little kids with you, it would be a good place to bring them.  Right across the street from the Wells Fargo building and shopping center.",
          "Lots of stuff to do, and the kids love it. Which room gets the most attention varies and changes over time.",
          "Yes - they do have coffee drinks and trasonably priced kids meals.",
          "I've been taking my kids here for almost a year now and every time we've gone the building is always under construction. The exhibits are pretty boring. There's not much space for parents to sit and watch their kids. I still take my kids \u2026",
          "I love the new exhibits they introduced and how they have incorporated areas for toddlers on each floor. The only thing keeping it from a 5 star rating in my book is it seems to struggle keeping up with being clean for how many kids come in to play.",
          "We used to love this place until the remodel.  All of my kids said they think is boring now and asked we not come here again.  Unfortunate because it used to be one of theit favotite places to go.  :-(",
          "Remodelled completely from years back. Modern design. Lots of new exibits for small kids. Very oversimplified. Used to be more challenging and  interesting staff for kids to do.",
          "My kids love this place, been bringing them here since they were babies. They just turned 4 and still love coming here. Great variety for the kids & friendly staff. ",
          "Worst place I've ever worked! \nDO NOT WORK HERE SPECIFICALLY SECURITY.\nSecurity Manager consistently harassed me for making minor mistakes and always put me down. THIS IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK. \nThe Managers do not care for feedback and \u2026",
          "Great place for the kiddos to burn off a ton of energy!",
          "Its a good place to bring kids there is alot of different activities for them to do and they all have some sort pic learning experience to go with it.. The staff are nice and good with all the kids.. My only real complaint is that the parking garage is really cramped and parking is kinda expensive...",
          "Extremely disappointed I just wasted time and money bringing my family to this so-called museum...nothing more than a few toys thrown in some conference rooms. Even with the construction it wouldn't have taken much effort to come up with \u2026",
          "Went there for a free event with grandchildren. Imagination playground! Kids enjoyed it also learning experience for me too.",
          "Too many loud annoying kids",
          "Amazing after the remodel, really the best place for kids! Each floor has great offerings. Don't miss the free parking.",
          "Block party is Amazing!  Would love to see this become an annual event!!  Freebies for kids...lots to see and do both outside and in the museum.  Completely worth the trip!!!",
          "Fun place for kids, my older lids love the upgrade. My yougest (2 years old) loved his first experience a week ago.  Tons of fun explore a new experience evertime you go.",
          "This is a good place for the kids. There are a lot of fun activities and opportunities to play and learn. I wish the admission was a little less for adults. We've been here twice with our 3 year old, and both trips ended in a meltdown. I \u2026",
          "My kids have fun and enjoy interacting with staff\nGabby, Jennifer, Sarah and Teal deserve raises!",
          "So much to do! Very fun and interesting activities. The sprouts area was perfect for the little ones!!",
          "Great place for sure, lots of new and improved cool places. Wish they had a Autism sensory calming room for kids who need a place to regroup and more affordable food options.",
          "This place has been 90% under construction for our entire membership. And now it is completely closed for another 4 months. Conveniently just after our membership expires. I'm pretty sure we won't get another year added on to use when it's \u2026",
          "Great for kids older than 4. Decent for kids younger. Needs more toddler activities.",
          "Been taking my kids to the children's museum since 2007 as members.  First place we would always go is Habitot.  Loved the carpeted walls, floors, and stairs of the old museum.  Then the renovation happened and now it looked like the dining \u2026",
          "Annual membership is a great value! My children (infant - preschool) ask to go constantly! Staff and volunteers are always friendly and helpful; permanent exhibits are worth the visit even when the report ones don't peak my kids' interests. \u2026",
          "The staff is so helpful and the exhibits ap fun!",
          "Always a great time with the kids and family tons of great things to do for adults and kids",
          "Lots of activities for kids. Plenty of stimulating experiments. Great place to spend the day with the kids.",
          "Honestly, it's just ok. Open ended play means a lot of the time I found myself thinking we should have just done this at home. There really isn't enough space in the cafe, the food is average at best and you feel like you're forced to eat in the gift shop.",
          "Love this place so many thing for kids to do",
          "This is nothing like a museum.  The dinosaurs exhibit was very small and the whole place was geared  towards kids 5 and younger.  My two boys that are 7 and 8 got board quickly ",
          "If you are expecting a museum of sorts this is not the place. This is essentially a large play place.",
          "Love the place! Love the renovations! Couldn\u2019t be a nicer place! Definitely worth the money!",
          "My kids loved it",
          "The updates are terrible. It look like a huge ikea. They have a store right when you walk in which distracts the child from everything else.  The play food is a piece of cloth unlike what it used to be. the updates is cheap but they keep getting donations and increase prices on everything in there.",
          "Our 2 year old loves the Sprout room. It's an incredibly well thought out museum.  ",
          "Me and my boys always enjoy ourselves here. Especially after the remodel.",
          "Love the new renovations and the staff is super friendly. Great place to keep the kids busy for the day! ",
          "Great activity center for kids. Price is high, but it was packed on Friday anyway. Service was kind and friendly. Pass is for all day.",
          "Amazing! So much fun for our little one. Lots to do for toddlers. It did get crowded around noon. ",
          "Had so much fun with our 2 year old grandson!  Something for everyone!",
          "It was a great place and my kids had a blast!!! We spent about 5 hours there and every staff member was awesome and friendly!!!",
          "Love this place my family goes all the time..free 3rd sundays of every month a safe fun place for kids to have fun and they just did a huge renovation",
          "This is the time of day to go to the children's museum. I love the updates, they have plenty of activities to ware the little ones out.",
          "The new museum is amazing and has so much to offer both my infant and toddler. They are both exhausted and had so much fun",
          "We like the new museum. However, the staff needs better training in the art and crafts room.",
          "Fun for kids of all ages. We have been members for several years & just love MCM!",
          "The renovation is terrible.  It actually seems dangerous in many ways.  The railings don't seem to be a safe height, there are ping pong balls flying at your head, the water area is not slip-proof, there are dangerous sliding hills, and they have hot glue guns sitting out for any child to touch.  Not worth your time or money!",
          "Like others have said, I liked the museum much better before the renovation. It was more engaging and the kids I nanny would focus for longer periods of time on the different exhibits/activites. We definitely miss the water explore area, \u2026",
          "It's a great place to go and check it out. It's a really great place to take the kids and family to learn of family history of Minnesota. I had a blast going there.",
          "I had the absolute worst experience here this past week. All of the exhibits besides one in the basement and one on the third floor were open. I paid for parking, waited in line for 35 minutes and then paid to enter into a demolished \u2026",
          "Had a blast with all six of the boys. I couldn't get them to leave",
          "A great place to bring kids of all ages! Also enjoyable for adults \ud83d\ude42 ",
          "Love the new remodel! Even better than before. Very unimpressed with the new restaurant though. Slow and overpriced. ",
          "This place is ok. We came here a couple years ago and then again today and they had the same beat up castle - err, I mean 'Amazing Castle' - exhibit from past years set up again. Nothing new and improved, nothing very interesting for kids \u2026",
          "I loved going here as a kid! So much fun stuff to do!",
          "today was an awful experience at the new children museum. there was a fire alarm n my son was nowhere insight. the staff were not prepare to handle a fire alarm. the staff kept saying we will re-unite your family outside. After 5 minute \u2026",
          "My kids Love coming here again and again. We are long time contributors, because who can say kids exploring and having fun is not a worthy cause to donate to. ",
          "The new exhibits are interesting and engaging for kids of all ages. Really nice job on the remodel. ",
          "Better than the average children's museum.  They have a good number of traveling exhibits so it isn't always the same.",
          "For me no stars are worth it because it has nothing exciting and fun. Four years ago before the renovations, all the gallerys and exhibits had a lot more, especially the \"Our World \" has nothing fun compared to the one before and many more \u2026",
          "My whole family loved it but very unfriendly slide staff today.  Easy for a kid to get lost here maybe some kind of wristbands or other security would help.",
          "My 2 year old loved this place. So much for her to do between the water area to the mock town setup. will go again.",
          "It's great if you have young kids. Older than 10 and you'd be better off at the science museum. ",
          "Absolutely amazing place,  every kids should be able to visit. Though I don't agree with  $12 per child. ",
          "I have a membership great place for the grandkids to play but the food is over priced",
          "Meh! We brought our 4 year old, she had a little fun on the lower level with the hands on rooms but was board after an hour. Check out other places like minnesota zoo or mall of America. Non-childrens museum was 100x better",
          "Great renovation! Much better for the very little ones. ",
          "Lotsa noise lotsa fun!  Kids get choices, which is so good.",
          "Best place for my kids so far.",
          "The remodel is looking real good! Lots of activities and wait times for certain activities were really short",
          "Kids love it here - passport deluxe membership is definitely worth it. Bring snacks with and it can be a super cheap outing for just a couple hours or all day long.",
          "I loved this place when I was a kid. This was the memories and I had a lot of fun over. I missed being a kid.",
          "Nice place to learn. Thoroughly enjoyed it",
          "Our kids love this place. Lot's of different things to do.  Different adventure every time we go!",
          "Pro tip - start on 4th floor and work your way down.  Climber is great.",
          "Cool updates but for the most part only really seems geared towards the much younger children. Our 6yo seemed like she didn't have enough to stimulate her. ",
          "This is very good place to visit if you have kids . ",
          "I had as good of a time as the kids I was with,  if not more.  Super place,  lots to see.   5 STAR Attraction.",
          "A big disappointment with cheap equipment and sand/water toys.  I loved the place  BEFORE it was remodeled.",
          "The renovation is fantastic! Great for ages from crawling to about 11 or 12.",
          "This was one of my favorite places to go as a kid. The best part was when we would go to the ant hill in the wilderness exhibit and my dad would pretend to be the anteater and chase us around in the tunnels.",
          "Last time we were there over a year ago there was alot more to do. Today alot of stuff is under construction and the main areas my toddler liked was the habitat room and the room with the bubbles and water area. They also got rid of the gift shop and food since I was there last so that was disappointing as well. Oh well. ",
          "New renovations are wonderful! And we loved the new cafe!",
          "Great place for little kids.",
          "Great place to keep kids entertained and learning while playing.",
          "A good place to take the kids on a cold winter day.",
          "Get a membership! If you have kids ages 1-10 they'll love this place! Worth a few visits a year.",
          "This place is amazing and is well well worth the yearly membership.",
          "There's soo much for the kids to interact with. A membership is well worth it. Today was our first time an we'll be back again and again. ",
          "I can't recommend this place if your child is over 4 years of age. It's a glorified playground with only rudimentary knowledge being presented. Any child with a hot wheels track or a bath tub can learn what's here. 4th and 5th floor redeem it some. I've just seen much better.",
          "Fun place for the kiddos!",
          "New renovation sucks. Not worth it. The old one was a DREAM COME TRUE for all children. I miss it. Sadly I won\u2019t be able to share the same memories I had with my children."

        "wiki": "The Minnesota Transportation Museum (MTM, reporting mark MNTX) is a transportation museum in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States.\nMTM operates several heritage transportation sites in Minnesota and one in Wisconsin. The museum is actively involved in preserving local railroad, bus and streetcar history.\nMTM was formed in 1962 to save a streetcar that had been built and operated by Twin City Rapid Transit (TCRT) in Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul.  Many of the museum's early members were formerly part of the Minnesota Railfans Association, which had organized railfan trips from the 1940s to the 1960s.\nIn 2004\u20132005, the organization's streetcar operations became the Minnesota Streetcar Museum, with the steamboat Minnehaha, originally built by TCRT in a style similar to its streetcars, becoming a major attraction of the Museum of Lake Minnetonka.\n\n\n== Minnehaha Depot ==\n\nAfter the first streetcar, TCRT No. 1300, was successfully restored, other projects were examined in the time before the streetcar could be put on its own set of rails.\nThe Minnehaha Depot was a former Milwaukee Road depot at Minnehaha Falls. The station, built in 1875, was nicknamed \"The Princess\" because of its delicate architecture.  The depot is a contributing property to the Minnehaha Historic District. Trains running on special routes have sometimes stopped at the station, and it was eventually integrated into the area streetcar system.  Tracks owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway reach the station, though it is at the disused end of a rail spur.\nThe depot is owned by the Minnesota Historical Society and operated by the Minnesota Transportation Museum. In 1967, the depot became the first building to be restored by the museum and it was outfitted with exhibits. In 2004, the METRO Blue Line's Minnehaha Park station opened across the road from the old depot.\n\n\n== Classic buses ==\n\nSeveral buses from the 1940s and 1950s are also operated by the museum. Most equipment in the bus collection were built by the GMC division of General Motors, and represent vehicles that replaced the streetcars in the Twin Cities in the 1950s. The conversion from a streetcar to bus system required two years. The last trolley run was on Hennepin Avenue on June 18, 1954.The collection consists of buses operated in and across Minnesota. Earliest is a 1942 Mack (occasionally used in conjunction with the Commemorative Air Force) which transported war workers to the B-24 final assembly point at what is now St Paul's Holman Field, and a block of 1953/54 GMC transit units, two of which are painted in original Twin Cities Lines colors. The buses are used in regular charter service, and form a very visible part of the museum's collection, often used in wedding and corporate charters, and on the museum's city tours.\nThis part of the collection is sponsored by Richfield Bus Company, graciously providing maintenance and licensing to operate them.\nAs the museum has acquired much of its bus collection from Metro Transit, the bus company sometimes requests the use of the old buses for special events.\n\n\n== Osceola and St. Croix Valley Railway ==\nMTM, in conjunction with the Historical Society of Osceola, Wisconsin, operates a heritage railroad called the Osceola and St. Croix Valley Railway.  Excursion trains are operated on trackage formerly owned by Wisconsin Central Ltd., now part of Canadian National Railway.\nExcursion trains operate from the historic Osceola Depot, north to Dresser, Wisconsin, and southbound to and through the scenic St. Croix River Valley. Regular schedules begin on the first weekend in May, continuing through the last week of October. Special Event trains operate through the season, including Mother's Day and Father's Day dining specials, the popular fireworks train to Marine on St. Croix, the Pumpkin Train (Halloween) and Fall Leaf Viewing trains through the River Valley.\nPassenger classes are General Tourist, First Class and Dining Car. Dining Car service is handled by the Osceola and St Croix Dinner Train, operating on alternating weekends. Service includes Brunch and Dinner, classic affairs done in the old \"high dollar style\". All Dinner Trains are \"full service,\" with properly uniformed staff serving meals on matched white linens & original diner china, most 70 to 90 years old.\nAt the Osceola service area, several locomotives and pieces of rolling stock are on display. All equipment has been reconditioned to standard operating condition, including classic 1920s open-window coaches, Great Northern express coaches and a refreshment car (Baggage car 265). Locomotives currently in running condition are classic diesel-electric.\nIn past years the classic steam engine, Northern Pacific No. 328 (4-6-0) was used to pull the trains, but has been placed in restoration status due to its age (107 yrs).\nThe regular service train route runs approximately 50 minutes to/from Dresser, Wisconsin, and 100 minutes to/from Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota.\nThe Museum also operates the Dresser Depot at the northeast terminus of the line in Dresser, WI. The Depot has been preserved exactly as if the staff stepped out for a break, down to calendars and railroad notices. It is also the site of Pumpkin Train Park, hosting several thousand visitors during the pre-Halloween weekend.\n\n\n== Jackson Street Roundhouse ==\n\nThe Jackson Street Roundhouse is MTM headquarters in St. Paul, as well as a fully functional railroad roundhouse, one of the last of its kind in the country. During winter months, the Roundhouse is a functioning work area for Museum rolling stock, often with the volunteer workforce welding, grinding and sending sparks flying.\nOpen Wednesday & Saturday, year-round, and on Friday during the summer months it is a maintenance & restorations base for the museum's locomotives and rolling stock.  It is highly interactive, offering train rides (Saturdays) as well as hands-on exhibits about surface transportation history of Minnesota and the upper Midwest.\nThe building was erected by the Great Northern Railway in 1907, replacing another, older roundhouse. The site has been used for rail transportation since the first railroad came to Minnesota (1860s). The Roundhouse and surrounding grounds are a near complete display of American industrial history from the 19th century through the mid-20th century.\nThe Roundhouse is base for equipment as varied as Pullman coaches, Northern Pacific RR mail & baggage cars, an operating 115-foot (35 m) turntable, a 200-ton lifting crane, an F7A passenger engine (under long term restoration to operating status), a Brill Car (one of the last of its kind) and the Minnesota Transportation Museum's fleet of classic buses.\nThe roundhouse is also home to the famous Northern Pacific Railway steam engine No. 2156, known to many Twin Cities children as Casey Jones's steam engine, from the popular children's program \"Lunch With Casey\" starring Roger Awsumb as Casey Jones, in the 60's & 70's. No. 2156, currently torn down for restoration, is undergoing stabilization to become part of a \"Steam Bay\" exhibit, demonstrating the inner workings of steam locomotives. It will be displayed next to its sister engine No. 2153, restored cosmetically to original operating configuration.\n\n\n== Train Equipment ==\n\n\n=== Steam Locomotives ===\n\n\n=== Diesel Locomotives ===\n\n\n=== Passenger Cars ===\n\n\n=== Cabooses ===\nBurlington Northern #11214\nChicago, Burlington & Quincy #13500\nGreat Northern #X71\nMilwaukee Road #992040\nNorthern Pacific #1264\nNorthern Pacific #1631\nSoo Line #31\n\n\n=== Service & miscellaneous equipment ===\nGreat Northern #X1735 Derrick Wrecking Crane\nNorthern Pacific #30 Russel Snow Plow\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMinnesota Transportation Museum\nMinnesota Historical Society: Minnehaha Depot",

        "wiki": "\"...as an act to provide for a geological and natural history survey of the state. And in turn, that natural history and geological specimens be prepared, and a museum be established at the University.\".\nThe Bell Museum, formerly known as the James Ford Bell Museum of Natural History, is located at the University of Minnesota. The museum's new location on the St. Paul campus opened July 13\u201315, 2018. The world-renowned Minnesota wildlife dioramas, numerous animal specimens from all over the world, and the 120-seat digital Whitney and Elizabeth MacMillan Planetarium theater are highlighted features of the new facility. The museum's former location in Minneapolis is closed as the work to move to the University of Minnesota's St. Paul campus began in January 2017. The museum is part of the University's College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum was established by state legislative mandate in 1872 to collect, preserve, skillfully prepare, display, and interpret Minnesota's diverse animal and plant life for scholarly research, teaching and for public appreciation, enrichment, and enjoyment. Its governance belongs, by state legislative designation, to the University of Minnesota.\nThe museum was first located in a single room in a building on the University of Minnesota's Minneapolis campus. The museum was reorganized by physician and ornithologist Thomas Sadler Roberts with the help of his friend James Ford Bell, the founder of General Mills and a passionate conservationist, who put up half the cost ($150,000) for a new building to house some new nature dioramas. Bell wanted the university to add a diorama of gray wolves in their natural environment, in order promote their conservation, since the state paid hunters a bounty for killing wolves in the 1930s. The remaining funds were raised through donations and federal government funding, and the James Ford Bell Museum of Natural History opened in 1940 at University Avenue and Church Street. The building was expanded in the 1960s and 1970s, but by the 1980s the building was suffering from leaks, cracks, mold and water damage, which threatened the collections and the dioramas.After a decades-long planning and legislative process, led by State Representative Alice Hausman, the Minnesota Legislature struck an agreement where the university would borrow $51.5 million for the project and the state would pay the debt service on the bonds over a span of 25 years. James Ford Bell's grandson, Ford Bell, is president of the American Alliance of Museums and a trustee of the James Ford Bell Foundation, which donated $3 million for the new museum.  The university broke ground on the project on Earth Day, April 22, 2016.\n\n\n=== New building details ===\nThe Bell Museum finished development of a new facility to house their public collections, a 120-seat digital planetarium, and serve as a public gateway to University of Minnesota research. Designed by Perkins and Will, the new museum finished construction on the St. Paul Campus of the University of Minnesota at 2088 Larpenteur Ave W, Falcon Heights, MN. New enhancements include outdoor learning landscapes, a dedicated parking lot, and new permanent and temporary exhibit galleries. The estimated project budget of the new facility and moving is $64.2 million. In 2014, the Minnesota Legislative session passed the bonding bill which included $51.5 million in funding for the new facility.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nWith more than 4 million specimens, the Bell's scientific collections have provided opportunities for research and teaching since the museum's inception in 1872. The museum recently launched the Minnesota Biodiversity Atlas, an online, searchable interface integrating over 5 terabytes of data from the Bell Museum on birds, mammals, fishes, plants, and fungi to enhance research capacity to perform a range of activities from biological surveys to conservation planning. (bellatlas.umn.edu) This database contains over 400,000 scientific records and as many as 175,000 high-resolution images with plans to expand entries and specimen photographs.\nAmphibian and Reptile Collection \nThe Amphibian and Reptile Collection is a diverse collection that has a heavy focus on the upper Midwest region and represents one of the best collections of herpetological material for this region.\nBird Collection \nThe Bird Collection Collection specimens come from the upper midwest and the majority of these are from Minnesota. In addition to this research collection, the Bell Museum maintains a dedicated teaching collection that is actively used in courses at the University.\nFish Collection \nThe Fish Collection contain specimens from the Menage expedition to the Philippines in the 1890s; fish from Hawaii collected in the early 1900s; and many other specimens from across the continental United States.\nFungi Collection \nThe Fungi Collection comprise about 10% of Minnesota fungi, and the remainder are from North America and elsewhere.\nLichen Collection \nThe Lichen Collection is one of the largest lichen herbaria in the US, and one of the few fully digitalized in the world. It houses collections of lichens worldwide.\nInvertebrate Collection \nThe Mollusks and Crustaceans Invertebrate Collection house freshwater mollusks collected in Minnesota, and represent an important Upper Midwest Collection. The invertebrate collection holds the old Minneapolis Library collection of Indo-Pacific mollusks.\n\nMammal Collection \nThe majority of the Mammal Collection  are standard, dry skin and skull preparations, but the Bell has a reasonably large collection of full skeletons and a growing collection of fluid preserved specimens.\nVascular Plant Collection \nThe Vascular Plant Collection contains samples of vegetative parts, cones, fruit, and seeds.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\n\nThis description refers to exhibits in the museum's former location on 10 Church St.Dioramas \nThe Bell Museum's dioramas were located on two floors of the Minneapolis site, and displayed Minnesota's habitats, along with the birds, animals, plants and insects that populate them. There are moose, elk, bear, beavers, cranes, fish, and more. The dioramas serve as an opportunity to learn animal facts, observe animal behavior, and find out how species survive. Constructed between 1920 and the late 1940s, the Bell Museum's dioramas illustrate what Minnesota was like before the ax and plow.\nRenowned artist Francis Lee Jaques completed backgrounds on nine of the large dioramas and ten of the medium-size dioramas. Jacques grew up in Minnesota where he pursued his passion for painting and illustrating nature.\nTouch and See Room \nThe Touch and See Room came into being in 1968. Public Education Coordinator Richard Barthelemy, known as Bart, realized that young and old visitors alike wanted to get their hands on all the specimens that are traditionally behind glass in museums.\nBart started by sitting down with groups and passing around bones and furs and feathers and such and talking with them about what was there. He teamed with Dr. Roger Johnson from the University of Minnesota's Department of Curriculum and Instruction in the College of Education to figure out how to make the experience work at its best. Shortly after Touch and See opened, the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C. visited the Bell and then launched its famous discovery room.\nNow, the touch and see room is home not only to the original collections, but also to multiple live specimens, including snakes, frogs, geckos, cockroaches, and tarantulas.\nRainforest Gallery \n\u201cUnder the Fig Leaf\u201d is a living rainforest and active research project managed by the museum's Curator of Plants, Professor George Weiblen. Many of the plants were grown from seeds collected by Weiblen in tropical forests around the world like Papua New Guinea. Visitors can get a ground floor and canopy view of the mini rainforest and learn about related University of Minnesota research.\nExploraDome \nThe museum's former film screening room was retrofitted to house a halfdome planetarium theater. Museum staff lead audiences on a virtual voyage from the surface of the Earth to the edge of the known universe in an intimate environment, holding up to 15 people per show. All presentations are given live by a planetarium educator and allow for audience interaction, unless noted as \"pre-recorded.\"\nGeodome \nThe museum's inflatable geodome is the traveling version of the ExploraDome that is brought to the school and locations across the state and region. It was the first geodome theater in Minnesota. Primarily used for educational outreach visits, the geodome also makes an annual trip the Minnesota State Fair for STEM Day.\nTraveling Exhibits \nThe Bell Museum of Natural History develops and circulates exhibitions on a broad range of topics. With these exhibitions, the Bell seeks to instill a greater appreciation of our natural world and promote a better understanding of contemporary ecological issues. Although many of the exhibitions are designed for small-to medium-sized spaces, the Bell's exhibits have traveled to museums of all sizes throughout the United States and Canada. Most of the exhibits require gallery installation, but several are self-supporting, lightweight, and easily assembled. These are ideal for bookings in either museum or non-museum settings, such as visitor centers, schools, and libraries.\n\n\n== Whitney and Elizabeth MacMillan Planetarium ==\nThe Minnesota Planetarium Society (MNPS) was a Minnesota-based organization for the promotion of an education in astronomy which operated the Minnesota Planetarium from 1960 until it was closed in 2002. When the Minneapolis Central Library was torn down in 2002, the former planetarium was closed with the understanding that it would be rebuilt as part of the new library. In September 2011, the Planetarium Society merged with the University of Minnesota's Bell Museum of Natural History instead. The new building features a digital planetarium that uses INSIGHT Dual Laser 4K projection system.The planetarium is named after Whitney MacMillan and his wife.\n\n\n== Programs ==\nThe museum has a variety of programming and events that caters to a range of age groups. Science labs, summer camps, Saturday with a Scientist, Sensory Friendly Saturdays, After Hours, and Star Parties  are several of the offerings that spark an interest and appreciation for science, technology, art, engineering and math. The museum also cosponsors the Sustainability Film Series, with environmentally-focused documentary screenings each Spring semester.\n\n\n== Admission ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBell Museum Homepage\nWhitney and Elizabeth MacMillan Planetarium\nCollege of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences Homepage\nBell Museum of Natural History records, University Archives, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities",

          "Everything is about MN.  There is only a small fraction of what the bell museum used to put on display. The planetarium show was only 40 mins. The cost of the ticket is way more than what the museum has to offer.",

          "Don't miss the Bell Museum! Up to date, in a new location, it is remarkable. The fields and prairie grounds make you forget you're in the city! Well laid out and explained, the exhibits depict the universe, the earth, DNA, fossils, \u2026",

          "Super dissapointed in the planetarium show. It felt like the show was only 20 min long. Not at all was I expected . They also only spent like 5 min on mars and saturn. The description of the show sounded like they were going to do more in \u2026",
          "Really enjoyed my visit. Many great diaramas. Be sure to visit the planetarium.",
          "Beautiful, modern venue for your next event (after Aug 1, 2018)!  Thoughtfully designed interior and exterior spaces combine with the great dioramas, an awesome new planetarium, and an experienced event planner to make the most of your event!",

          "My wife and I visited for the first time, yesterday. We absolutely loved it! We didn't check out the planetarium yet, but the rest of the exhibits were great. Great place to learn about space, and natural history. There is even a wooly \u2026",

          "Awesome",

          "Touch and see lab is a joke.  Nothing marked so, they want you to wait around to find a staff member to discuss what you are looking at and there are many items. This would take forever to get through.  They aren't planning on fixing this \u2026",
          "The new Bell Natural History museum opened in mid July, 2018; I visited in mid-August. The building and surrounding landscaping is lovely and sits at the corner of Larpenteur and Cleveland ave's where a one room school house once stood. \u2026",

          "The best museum in the Twin Cities. The planetarium in amazing.",
          "A cool museum that has sweet dioramas. I definitely recommend seeing this place. The problem with the bell is that you can tell that everything is done for money gains and not for the people. The staff is standing around bored, volunteers \u2026",
          "I have never been to a more engaging place. Truly a museum for all ages. It has the best articulated signs and plaques I've ever seen. The information is easy to understand for people of any education level on the subject matter, but is \u2026",

          "Pretty awseome place... ibreally liked the food exibit and the specific Minnesota wildlife exhibit.  The exhibit of how the earth formed was great and will get some people huffin and puffin about hownthe world is only 2k years old. All in all a very nice interactive and fun learning place.",
          "The museum was boring and poorly labeled. The interactive exhibits didn't work well and the rest of the exhibits are pretty to look at for a bit, but super stale. The staff was mostly unhelpful and standoffish. The location is horrible (in \u2026",

          "Planetarium show was disappointing. Thought it would be a geniune planetarium like the old Mpls Planetarium, but is instead just a small Imax with uncomfortable seating. The student staff is enthusiastic but should receive training on elocution and pronunciation as the narration was distracting.",

          "Neat little place. Can't wait for the new on to open. ",
          "Disappointing. Planetarium show was above most peoples heads especially when more than half were kids. Many things we looked at were not labeled. Need more interactive displays. I would much rather go to History Center or Science Museum. Hopefully since it just opened kinks will be worked out.",
          "Free museum admission for UMN students.",
          "We had to park far away because the University traffic was crazy. Also, it was $23 for myself and 3 kids to get in. But there are lots of beautiful displays and the touch and see room was great. The helpers there are super good with kids, \u2026",
          "The planetarium show was ok. I thought I was going to see the night sky like the older planetarium.\nThe stars are protected? It didn't feel like you were transported into the night sky. It was like Google earth meets a spinning ride from \u2026",

          "Fantastic Natural History museum. The staff in the touch and see room were in enthusiastic and very knowledgeable.",
          "I took my kids since they offer free admission on Sundays.  I would suggest this museum to anyone,particularly people with kids.  they have an entire room that is 98% kid friendly and they have different amphibians that they will gladly \u2026",
          "I just got done The planetarium is great and the rest of it was good",
          "It was extremely dated. I see they are building a new facility set to open in 2018, that will be spectacular I am sure. \n\nThis one is closing Dec 31, 2016 and there is only 1 room that is interactive (I held a cockroach & snake) otherwise \u2026",
          "This museum is mostly taxidermy animals. The touch and see room is the only highlight. They have a few aquariums with reptiles that you can ask to touch.

The museum has been housed in a variety of St. Paul locations throughout its history, including the Jemne Building, Landmark Center, and through January 2009, the West Publishing Company.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded in 1894 as St. Paul School of Fine Arts, and membership at the time cost $3. In 1909, the name changed to St. Paul Institute (or St. Paul Institute of Art and Science) and briefly became part of the forerunner to the Science Museum of Minnesota. From 1910 to 1918, artist Lee Woodward Zeigler was the director of the Saint Paul Institute.The museum incorporated in 1926. In 1939 it was renamed the St. Paul Gallery and School of Art. The institution began collecting art in 1940 after receiving a collection of Chinese jade art pieces in a bequest. In 1962 it was known as the St. Paul Art Center. It was renamed the Minnesota Museum of Art in 1969 and they changed locations to the Jemne Building, an art deco building.It was renamed the Minnesota Museum of American Art (MMAA) in 1992, after a failed fundraising effort which included the sale of the Jemne Building and a move to the Landmark Center building.In 2009, the museum was on the brink of bankruptcy, the MMAA galleries closed after losing its gallery space to redevelopment, though they maintained offices and traveling exhibitions. Most of the works were put in storage. In 2012, MMAA announced they would reopen for limited hours in the Pioneer Building in Lowertown in October of that year. In December 2018, the museum opened an expanded permanent facility designed by Minneapolis-based architects VJAA in the Pioneer Endicott building complex.  Further expansion, including a new wing for the museum's permanent collection galleries, is scheduled to open in 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\nScience Museum of Minnesota\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAbout\nHistory",

Visitors were ushered to safety as zoo staff shot Casey with a tranquilizer and returned him to his enclosure.  This resulted in the zoo building a temporary slanted wall around the enclosure to keep this from happening again and the zoo is planning on building a new area for the gorillas making it safer and impossible to escape from.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Indian Mounds Regional Park is a public park in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States, featuring six prehistoric Native American burial mounds overlooking the Mississippi River.  The oldest mounds were constructed 1,500\u20132,000 years ago by people of the Hopewell tradition.  Later the Dakota people interred their dead there as well.  At least 31 more mounds were destroyed by development in the late 19th century.  They were the tallest Native American mounds in Minnesota or Wisconsin (except for the unique 45-foot (14 m) Grand Mound outside International Falls, Minnesota), and comprise one of the northwesternmost Hopewellian sites in North America. Indian Mounds Regional Park is a component of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a unit of the National Park System. The Mounds Group is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The 2014  nomination document provides a description of the archaeology and the context.\n\n\n== Early history ==\nThere were once at least 18 mounds, plus another 19 a short distance to the northwest directly above Carver's Cave.  The mounds of the second group were all quite small, under two feet (0.6 m) high.  Anthropologists ascribe the oldest mounds to mound builders of the Hopewell Tradition, but later cultures also added to the mounds.  No evidence of habitation has been found among the mounds, so the builders lived elsewhere nearby, probably in a village below the bluff.The Dakota village of Kaposia was established at the foot of the bluff before 1600 CE.  English explorer Jonathan Carver described the site in 1766 and visited the recent burial of a Dakota leader among the mounds.\n\n\n== Excavation ==\nBurial mounds were first excavated by Edward Duffield Neill in 1856, followed by a dig sponsored by the Minnesota Historical Society.  In 1879 Theodore H. Lewis conducted a more thorough investigation.  Both mound groups revealed a variety of burial styles.  At least three mounds were built around log tombs, and two others contained multiple cists made of limestone slabs.  Hopewellian grave goods included nothing but  mussel shells in the simplest and most common burials, but projectile points, perforated bear teeth, and copper ornaments in others.  One burial contained a child's skull with clay pressed onto it in an apparent recreation of the individual's features.  No other such death masks have ever been documented in contemporaneous Native American burials.  Human remains in funeral bundles found in the upper parts of some mounds were interpreted as burials from more recent cultures.The early archaeologists exhumed around 20 mostly complete skeletons (though many were missing their skulls) and fragments of perhaps another 30 individuals.  Since the burials were likely made over several generations, only a relatively small number of individuals were marked with mounds.  Who was chosen for mound burial, and what was done with the rest of the dead, are unknown.These 19th-century archaeologists, \"some of them amateurs in their day, all of them amateurs by today's standards,\" may have destroyed as much information as they preserved.  Theodore Lewis was a sophisticated researcher for his time, but worked hastily \u2014 once excavating seven mounds in one day \u2014 and didn't make detailed descriptions of his finds.  Most of his artifacts have since been lost, so it is impossible for modern archaeologists to identify more certainly the cultural affiliations and periods of the various mound users.In the late 19th century the bluff-face was successively demolished to widen the rail yard at its foot, destroying several mounds as well as the outer chamber of Carver's Cave.  In a time \"when digging into a mound was a respectable Sunday pastime,\" locals also repeatedly looted and vandalized the mounds.The mound site received a modern archaeological field survey in 1981 from the Minnesota Historical Society.\n\n\n== Park development ==\nInterest in preserving the open land along the blufftop arose in the 1880s as the local population boomed.  The City of Saint Paul struggled to buy the land from its various private owners, as some proved unwilling to sell and others sold to real estate speculators first.  Enough property was assembled by 1896 for the city to begin landscaping and building visitor amenities.  In sharp contrast to modern practices, 11 mounds were leveled on the grounds that they blocked the view of the river.  Only the six largest mounds were left.The park was expanded to 82 acres (33 ha) in 1900, and in 1914 a still-standing brick pavilion was built to house a refreshment stand, restrooms, and space for open-air concerts.Indian Mounds Regional Park received a major restoration in the 1980s using state and federal funds for developing the Great River Road.  The pavilion was restored, new amenities added, and houses and a road were removed.  The Dayton's Bluff Community Council raised funds and placed decorative fences around the mounds as a protection from visitors.\n\n\n== Airway beacon ==\n\nAdjacent to the mounds is a 110-foot-high (34 m) airway beacon built in 1929 as part of a national network to aid pilots delivering airmail.  The Indian Mounds Park \"Airway\" Beacon, as it is officially known, helped mark the route between Saint Paul and Chicago.  There were once over 600 of these beacons, but electronic navigation systems rendered them obsolete.  Restored to its historical black and chrome-yellow color scheme in the mid-1990s, the Indian Mounds Park beacon has been kept operational and flashes its rotating light every 5 seconds.  It is one of the few remaining airway beacons in the United States.\n\n\n== Recreation ==\nCurrently Indian Mounds Regional Park provides two electrified picnic shelters which can be rented by private groups.  Other visitor amenities in the park include a playground, barbecue grills, fire rings, restrooms and a drinking fountain, paved trails, and a ball field and tennis courts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Hopewell sites\nList of burial mounds in the United States\nMississippi National River and Recreation Area\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Ramsey County, Minnesota\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIndian Mounds Regional Park\nExcavation Records for Indian Mounds Park Group",

        "wiki": "Lilydale is a outer suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 34 km north-east from Melbourne's central business district situated in the Yarra Valley. At the 2016 census, Lilydale had a population of 15,530. It began as a town within the Shire of Lillydale and is also notable as the burial site of Dame Nellie Melba (Lilydale Cemetery).\nIt is both a residential area of metropolitan Melbourne and an industrial area on the city's rural-urban fringe.\n\n\n== Toponomy ==\nSome prefer to believe the town was named after an 1852 song \"Lilly Dale\" by H. S. Thompson but evidence shows it was named after an early settler, Lilly de Castella.  Most of Victoria has been named after prominent citizens or with traditional Aboriginal names. Lilly de Castella was one of four daughters of Colonel Joseph Anderson and wife Mary. Joseph Anderson was one of eight nominated (non-elected) members of Victoria's first parliament.  Lilly was born Elizabeth Anne on Norfolk Island, where her father was commandant from 1835 to 1839.  Lilly was a typical Victorian pet-name for girls named Elizabeth.  The family settled in South Yarra in 1848 and were friends of Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe and his wife Sophie.  Mary Anderson was a pioneer member of the Melbourne Mechanics Institute.  Colonel Anderson was also a close friend of Crown Surveyor Clement Hodgkinson and was a pallbearer at the funeral of Governor Hotham, who died on 31 December 1855.  Lilly married Paul de Castella in 1856; Colonel Anderson co-owned the couple's Yering Station.  Anderson Street in Lilydale was named after the Colonel, and the parallel Castella Street was named after his son-in-law, Lilly's husband Paul.\n\n\n== History ==\nLillydale township was surveyed in 1860 by Clement Hodgkinson.The Post Office opened on 1 September 1860 as Brushy Creek, and was renamed Lillydale in 1861 and Lilydale around 1872.The Lilydale Hotel opened in 1862.  The railway came to town with the opening of the station in 1882.\nThe first town hall was built in 1888 along with the Mechanics Institute Free Library building.\nLilydale has an active CFA (Country Fire Authority) volunteer fire brigade, first established in 1905. There was an unregistered brigade dating back to the 1880s prior to this. The brigade also has a satellite station in Chirnside Park. [1]\n\n\n== Commercial area ==\nLilydale has franchises of McDonald's and KFC. Lilydale also has shopping centres named 'Lilydale Marketplace' and 'The Lilydale Village' as well as shops on both sides of Main Street. There is also a 'Baby Bunnings', and many other commercial shops.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nLilydale station is the terminus for the Lilydale railway line offering half hourly metropolitan rail services. It is due to be rebuilt as part of the Level Crossing Removal Project \nA bus station and taxi rank operates from the railway station servicing many of Melbourne's far eastern suburbs.\nLilydale has segregated bicycle facilities including the start of the Lilydale to Warburton Rail Trail which follows the course of the Lilydale-Warburton railway line which was built in 1901 but closed in 1964.\nColdstream Airport is located approximately 5 km north east in Coldstream which has a sealed, all-weather strip to service the area with recreation, charter and fire bombing flying facilities for the local community. Coldstream Airport is home to Yarra Valley Flight Training, Coldstream Flyers Club and ACMA - Australian Centre for Mission Aviation.\nLilydale Airport is located in Yering 5 km north of Lilydale. It is for use by local pilots.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThere was also a campus of Swinburne University of Technology, which offered TAFE and university courses, since announcing closure other institutes have come forward wanting to run the facilities. Box Hill Institute and the Centre for Adult Education opened their John St Lilydale Community Campus in 2015 offering the people of Lilydale and surrounding districts access to more than 20 quality accredited, short courses and pre-accredited pathway programs.\nOn 15 February 2016 Box Hill Institute reopened the much larger former Swinburne campus as the Lilydale Lakeside Campus offering vocational training, TAFE and higher education. The Lilydale library, a branch of Eastern Regional Libraries, is also located at the Lakeside Campus. It offers free events for all ages, including children and seniors. Lilydale has four main secondary schools: Lilydale High School, Mount Lilydale Mercy College, Lilydale Heights College, and Lilydale Adventist Academy. Many primary schools are located in the suburb as well.\nOther institutions based in Lilydale include the Yarra Ranges Regional Museum, Australia offices for Institute in Basic Life Principles and Advanced Training Institute.\n\n\n== Parks and reserves ==\n\nOlinda Creek runs through Lilydale having its source in the nearby Dandenong Ranges and is a tributary of the Yarra River.\nLilydale is well known for Lillydale Lake, a recreational area where children play and learn about the wetlands environment. Surrounding the lake are modern housing estates, such as Lakeview Estate.\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nA popular ground covering product from the long established quarry on the edge of the town, used in pathways, driveways, backyards and composed of crushed limestone of varying grades, is commercially and popularly known as \"Lilydale Toppings\".The town is mentioned briefly in the Augie March song The Cold Acre.\nIn Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries Series 3 episode Death at the Grand, Phryne arranges to have her troublesome father, Henry, housed there until leaving the country, saying \"Even you can't get yourself into trouble in Lilydale.\"\n\n\n== Sport ==\nThe suburb has an Australian Rules football team, The Lilydale Falcons, competing in the Eastern Football League.It also has a cricket team, competing in the Ringwood District Cricket Association.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nNotable people from or having lived in Lilydale include:\n\nElizabeth Catherine Usher AO (1911\u20131996), pioneering speech therapist\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLilydale Airport",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Fort Snelling State Park is a state park of Minnesota, USA, at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers. Its most notable feature is the historic Fort Snelling, which dates from 1820.  The fort itself is operated by the Minnesota Historical Society and requires a separate entrance fee.  The bulk of the state park preserves the bottomland forest, rivers, and backwater lakes below the river bluffs.  The park was opened in 1962. Both the State Park and Historic Fort are part of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, a National Park Service site.\nAs of 2005, the park hosts 400,000 visitors annually and contains the restored fort, a visitor center, 18 miles (29 km) of cross-country skiing trails, 18 miles (29 km) of hiking trails, and 5 miles (8.0 km) of biking trails. These trails connect the park to the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge, Minnehaha Park, and regional trail systems like the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway and the Big Rivers Regional Trail.  Minnesota State Highway 55 crosses over the park on the Mendota Bridge, and many jets taking off and landing at the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport fly directly over the park.\n\n\n== Landscape ==\nToday the bottomlands of the river confluence boast a floodplain forest of cottonwood, silver maple, green ash, wood nettle, jewelweed, and willow.  There are also marshes, backwater lakes, and wet meadows.  Abundant wildlife includes white-tailed deer, fox, woodchuck, badger, skunk, turkey, and coyote. Reptiles include the snapping turtle, painted turtle, soft-shelled turtle, and the non-venomous western fox snake.  In 1864 a railroad was built through the area, connecting St. Paul with the riverboat landing.\n\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of historical times, Mdewakanton Dakota lived in this area.  The confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers was to them the center of the world.  In 1805 Lieutenant Zebulon Pike met with the Mdewakanton on the island between the two rivers and negotiated the purchase of land along the blufftops.  The treaty site is now known as Pike Island.  Details of Fort Snelling, which was built between 1820 and 1825 on the land Pike acquired, are contained in its own entry.\nThe soldiers from Fort Snelling had gardens, livestock, bakery, and boat storage sheds in the low river valley.  After the Dakota War of 1862, over 1600 Dakota men, women, and children were forcibly confined in a camp in this area through the winter of 1862\u20131863, before being expelled to Nebraska.  Over the winter, approximately 300 died due to malnutrition, disease, and exposure.\nDuring the 1950s, the state government had planned to build a freeway interchange and bridge over the site of the fort, prompting concerned locals and Russell W. Fridley, director of the Minnesota Historical Society, to call a meeting to examine how to preserve the fort. Eventually, the state agreed to build a tunnel underneath the fort, thus preserving the old structures. In 1960, A.R. Nichols, a landscape architect, submitted plans for a 2,400-acre (9.7 km2) park on the site. Based on a much earlier plan, this design would become the basis for the final form of the park. This caught the interest of Thomas C. Savage who wrote State Parks director U.W. Hella.  Hella urged Savage to form an association of interested citizens which became the Fort Snelling State Park Association, putting money and public relations effort into the promotion of the park's establishment. While there was widespread support for preserving the old fortifications, some local landowners were not enthused about plans to purchase additional lands, claiming that the price the government proposed to pay was not adequate. In response, the Park Association began to raise funds privately to buy out at least some of the owners. A second consideration was whether or not the federal government would grant the actual fort property to the state as surplus land.\n\nOn the last day of the 1961 legislative session, a $65,000 appropriation was made and the park's boundaries were set (on a much smaller scale than can be seen today) so as to acquire the federal land. On October 29, the federal government donated 320 acres (1.3 km2) of land, including portions of the fort, to the State of Minnesota under the 1944 Surplus Property Act. The park was officially opened on June 3, 1962.\nThe restoration of the fort had begun as early as 1957, and with the establishment of the park, such efforts received new momentum. Old plans were found in the National Archives and the state legislature granted regular appropriations to fund the project until 1979. Limestone to match the original building material was taken from lands owned by the City of Saint Paul and the Webb Publishing Company. Eventually, the remaining half of the fort, which had been occupied by the Department of Veterans Affairs was also donated to the park and restoration of the entire fort could proceed. Structures including walls, the round tower, barracks, the commandant's house, gatehouse, magazine, school, and others were either restored or rebuilt to 19th-century condition. Workers went so far as to recreate the rough trowel tuckpointing of the original stone blocks. Controversially, WPA murals from the 1930s were removed from the interior of the tower.\nIn 1970 a swimming beach was opened in the park and visitation increased by 75%.  An interpretive center was opened in 1974, the first year-round interpretive center in the Minnesota state park system.  Even without a campground, this is the most visited state park in Minnesota for most years.\n\n\n== Recreation ==\nBicycling: 5 miles (8.0 km) of paved trail, connecting to regional paved trails.  10 miles (16 km) of gravel trails.\nBoating: Public boat ramp on Minnesota River by picnic area.  Canoe access to lakes and rivers.\nCross-country skiing: 12 miles (19 km) of groomed ski trails in the park.\nFishing: Lake and river fishing.  Fishing pier on Snelling Lake.\nHiking: 18 miles (29 km) of hiking trails in the park.\nInterpretation:\nThomas C. Savage Visitor Center with exhibits and year-round programs, operated by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\nTours of historic Fort Snelling (separate fee), operated by the Minnesota Historical Society.\nSports:\nMinneapolis Parks and Recreation operates a nine-hole golf course and a sports field west of the fort, on its historic polo ground.\n2 playgrounds, by beach and by picnic area.\nPark office lends beach volleyball equipment.\nSwimming: Beach on Snelling Lake.\nWeddings and funerals: The Fort Snelling Memorial Chapel, built in 1926, is reservable.\nNo camping.

          "We spent an entire afternoon at Ft. Snelling, immersed in the exhibits, hands-on activities and speaking with the costumed volunteers. It was great to learn about the history of Minnesota and the Fort itself, but even more fun because of all of the activities they have. We",

        "wiki": "Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald (September 24, 1896 \u2013 December 21, 1940) was an American novelist, essayist, screenwriter, and short-story writer, although he was best known for his novels depicting the flamboyance and excess of the Jazz Age\u2014a term which he coined. During his lifetime, he published four novels, four collections of short stories, and 164 short stories.  Although he temporarily achieved popular success and fortune in the 1920s, Fitzgerald only received wide critical and popular acclaim after his death. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest American writers of the 20th century.\nFitzgerald was born into an upper-middle-class family in St. Paul, Minnesota, but was primarily raised in New York. He attended Princeton University, but due to a failed relationship and a preoccupation with writing, he dropped out in 1917 to join the army. While stationed in Alabama, he fell in love with rich socialite Zelda Sayre. Although she initially rejected him due to his financial situation, Zelda agreed to marry Fitzgerald after he had published the commercially successful This Side of Paradise (1920).\nIn the 1920s, Fitzgerald  frequented Europe, where he was influenced by the modernist writers and artists of the \"Lost Generation\" expatriate community, particularly Ernest Hemingway. His second novel, The Beautiful and Damned (1922), propelled him into the New York City elite. To maintain his lifestyle during this time, he also wrote several stories for magazines. His third novel, The Great Gatsby (1925), was inspired by his rise to fame and relationship with Zelda. Although it received mixed reviews, The Great Gatsby is now widely praised, with some even labeling it the \"Great American Novel\". While Zelda was placed at a mental institute for her schizophrenia, Fitzgerald completed his final novel, Tender Is the Night (1934).\nFaced with financial difficulties due to the declining popularity of his works, Fitzgerald turned to Hollywood, writing and revising screenplays. After a long struggle with alcoholism, he died in 1940, at the age of 44. A fifth, unfinished novel, The Last Tycoon (1941), was completed by Edmund Wilson and published after Fitzgerald's death.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nBorn in 1896 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, to an upper-middle-class family, Fitzgerald was named after his second cousin thrice removed, Francis Scott Key, but was always known as Scott Fitzgerald.  Fitzgerald was also named after his deceased sister, Louise Scott Fitzgerald, one of two sisters who died shortly before his birth. \"Well, three months before I was born,\" he wrote as an adult, \"my mother lost her other two children ... I think I started then to be a writer.\" His father, Edward Fitzgerald, was of Irish and English ancestry, and had moved to St. Paul from Maryland after the American Civil War. His mother was Mary \"Molly\" McQuillan Fitzgerald, the daughter of an Irish immigrant who had made his fortune in the wholesale grocery business. Edward's first cousin once removed, Mary Surratt, was hanged in 1865 for conspiring to assassinate Abraham Lincoln.\n\nFitzgerald spent the first decade of his childhood primarily in Buffalo, New York, where his father worked for Procter & Gamble, with a short interlude in Syracuse, (between January 1901 and September 1903). Edward Fitzgerald had earlier worked as a wicker furniture salesman; he joined Procter & Gamble when the business failed. His parents, both Catholic, sent him to two Catholic schools on the West Side of Buffalo, first Holy Angels Convent (1903\u20131904, now disused) and then Nardin Academy (1905\u20131908). Fitzgerald's formative years in Buffalo revealed him to be a boy of unusual intelligence with a keen early interest in literature. His mother's inheritance and donations from an aunt allowed the family to live a comfortable lifestyle. In a rather unconventional style of parenting, Fitzgerald attended Holy Angels with the arrangement that he go for only half a day\u2014and was allowed to choose which half.In 1908, his father was fired from Procter & Gamble, and the family returned to Minnesota, where Fitzgerald attended St. Paul Academy in St. Paul from 1908 to 1911. At the age of 13, Fitzgerald had his first work published, a detective story in the school newspaper. In 1911, Fitzgerald's parents sent him to the Newman School, a Catholic prep school in Hackensack, New Jersey. Fitzgerald played on the 1912 Newman football team. At Newman, he was taught by Father Sigourney Fay, who recognized his literary potential and encouraged him to become a writer. After graduating from Newman in 1913, Fitzgerald enrolled at Princeton University, where he tried out for the football team and was cut the first day of practice. At Princeton he became friends with future critics and writers, including Edmund Wilson and John Peale Bishop. Fitzgerald wrote for the Princeton Triangle Club, the Nassau Lit, and the Princeton Tiger. He also was involved in the American Whig-Cliosophic Society, which ran the Nassau Lit. His absorption in the Triangle\u2014a kind of musical-comedy society\u2014led to his submission of a novel to Charles Scribner's Sons where the editor praised the writing but ultimately rejected the book. Four of the University's eating clubs sent him bids at midyear, and he chose the University Cottage Club (where Fitzgerald's desk and writing materials are still displayed in its library).\n\nIt was while attending Princeton that Fitzgerald met Chicago socialite and debutante Ginevra King on a visit back home to St. Paul. King and Fitzgerald had a romantic relationship from 1915 to 1917. Immediately infatuated with her, according to Mizner, Fitzgerald \"remained devoted to Ginevra as long as she would allow him to\", and wrote to her \"daily the incoherent, expressive letters all young lovers write\". She would become his inspiration for the character of Isabelle Borg\u00e9, Amory Blaine's first love in This Side of Paradise, for Daisy in The Great Gatsby, and several other characters in his novels and short stories. Her father reportedly warned Fitzgerald that \"Poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls.\" After their relationship ended in 1917, Fitzgerald requested that Ginevra destroy the letters that he had written to her. However, he never destroyed the letters that King had sent him. After his death in 1940 his daughter \"Scottie\" sent the letters back to King where she kept them until her death. She never shared the letters with anyone.At Princeton, Fitzgerald's writing pursuits came at the expense of his studies, consequently causing him to be placed on academic probation. In 1917, Fitzgerald pivoted, dropping out of Princeton to join the Army. During that winter, he was stationed at Fort Leavenworth, under the command of future United States President and General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower, whom he intensely disliked. Worried that he could die in the War without ever publishing anything, Fitzgerald hastily wrote The Romantic Egotist in the weeks before reporting for duty\u2014and, although Scribners rejected it, the reviewer praised Fitzgerald's writing and encouraged him to resubmit the novel after further revisions. Fitzgerald would later regret not serving in combat, as detailed in his short story \"I Didn\u2019t Get Over\" (1936).\n\n\n=== Zelda Fitzgerald ===\n\nIn 1918, Fitzgerald was commissioned a second lieutenant and dispatched to Camp Sheridan near Montgomery, Alabama, serving with the 45th and 67th Infantry Regiments. While at a local country club, Fitzgerald met and fell in love with Zelda Sayre, the youngest daughter of Alabama Supreme Court Justice Anthony D. Sayre and the \"golden girl\", in Fitzgerald's terms, of Montgomery society. They began a courtship, but were briefly interrupted in October when he was summoned north. He expected to be sent to France, but was instead assigned to Camp Mills, Long Island. While stationed there, the Armistice with Germany was signed. He then returned to the base near Montgomery and began meeting Zelda again. Together again, they embarked on what he would later call \"sexual recklessness,\" and by December, they were inseparable. In what became a lifetime practice, Fitzgerald relied on Zelda for literary inspiration, going so far as to plagiarize her diary while revising his first novel.Upon his discharge on February 14, 1919, he relocated to New York City, where he unsuccessfully begged each of the city editors of the seven newspapers for a job. He then turned to a career in advertising, hopeful that it would be lucrative enough to persuade Zelda to marry him. Fitzgerald wrote to Zelda frequently, and by March 1920, he had sent Zelda his mother's ring, and the two had become engaged. Many of Zelda's friends and members of her family were wary of the relationship, as they did not approve of his excessive drinking, and Zelda's Episcopalian family did not like the fact that he was a Catholic. At the time, Fitzgerald was working for the Barron Collier advertising agency, living in a single room at 200 Claremont Avenue in the Morningside Heights neighborhood on Manhattan's west side. Although he received a raise for creating a slogan for a laundry in Iowa: \"We keep you clean in Muscatine\", Fitzgerald was still relatively poor. Still aspiring to a career in literature, he wrote several short stories and satires in his spare time. Rejected over 120 times, he was only able to sell a single story, for which he was paid $30.\n\nWith his dreams of a lucrative career in New York dashed, he was unable to convince Zelda that he would be able to support her, leading her to break off the engagement. Fitzgerald returned to his parents' house at 599 Summit Avenue, on Cathedral Hill, in St. Paul, to revise The Romantic Egotist, recast as This Side of Paradise, a semi-autobiographical account of Fitzgerald's undergraduate years at Princeton. Fitzgerald was so short of money that he took up a job repairing car roofs. His revised novel was accepted by Scribner's in the fall of 1919 and was published on March 26, 1920 and became an instant success, selling 41,075 copies in the first year. It launched Fitzgerald's career as a writer and provided a steady income suitable to Zelda's needs.  They resumed their engagement and were married on April 3, 1920 at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York.On Valentine's Day in 1921, while Fitzgerald was working to finish his second novel, The Beautiful and Damned, Zelda discovered she was pregnant. They decided to go to his home in St. Paul, Minnesota to have the baby. On October 26, 1921, she gave birth to their daughter and only child Frances Scott \"Scottie\" Fitzgerald. As she emerged from the anesthesia, he recorded Zelda saying, \"Oh, God, goofo I'm drunk. Mark Twain. Isn't she smart\u2014she has the hiccups. I hope it's beautiful and a fool\u2014a beautiful little fool.\" Fitzgerald utilized some of her rambling in his later writing; the words appear almost verbatim in Daisy Buchanan's dialogue from The Great Gatsby.\n\n\n=== New York and the Jazz Age ===\n\nAfter the birth of Scottie, Fitzgerald returned to writing The Beautiful and Damned, but in early 1922, Zelda became pregnant for a second time. Although some writers have claimed that his diaries include an entry referring to \"Zelda and her abortionist\", there is, in fact, no such entry. Zelda's thoughts on the second pregnancy are unknown, but in the first draft of The Beautiful and Damned, he wrote a scene in which the main female character Gloria believes she is pregnant and Anthony suggests she \"talk to some woman and find out what's best to be done. Most of them fix it some way.\" Anthony's suggestion was removed from the final version, a change which shifted focus from the abortion choice to Gloria's concern that a baby would ruin her figure. Chapters of the book were serialized in Metropolitan Magazine in late 1921, and in March 1922, the book was published. Scribner's prepared an initial print run of 20,000 copies, and mounted an advertising campaign. It sold well enough to warrant additional print runs reaching 50,000 copies. That year, Fitzgerald also released Tales of the Jazz Age, which was composed of 11 short stories, all but two written before 1920. This collection's title would lend itself to the eponymous time period.\n\nIn New York City, the Fitzgeralds quickly became celebrities, as much for their wild behavior as for the success of This Side of Paradise. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness. Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square. When Dorothy Parker first met them, they were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, \"They did both look as though they had just stepped out of the sun; their youth was striking. Everyone wanted to meet him.\" Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. The couple would later be seen as the epitome of the period, with Ring Lardner Jr. labelling them \"the prince and princess of their generation.\"Following Fitzgerald's adaptation of his short story \"The Vegetable\" into a play, he and Zelda moved to Great Neck, Long Island to be near Broadway. Although he hoped that this was the beginning of a lucrative career in theater, the play's November 1923 premiere was a critical and commercial disaster. In a letter, Zelda claimed that the audience were \u201cso obviously bored\u201d and that some even walked out during the second act. Fitzgerald himself wrote that \"I wanted to stop the show and say it was all a mistake but the actors struggled heroically on.\" During the second intermission, Fitzgerald and Lardner asked the lead actor, Ernest Truex, \"Are you going to stay and do the last act?\" The actor replied that he was, at which the pair of writers declared that they were leaving for the nearest bar. Fitzgerald turned to short stories to pay the debt he had incurred in developing his play. He despised his short stories, saying they were \"all trash and it nearly broke my heart.\"\n\n\n=== Europe and the Lost Generation ===\n\nIn spring 1924, Fitzgerald and his family moved to France, where he would begin writing his third novel, which would eventually become The Great Gatsby. Fitzgerald had been planning the novel since 1923, when he told his publisher Maxwell Perkins of his plans \"to write something new - something extraordinary and beautiful and simple and intricately patterned.\" Initially titled Trimalchio, an allusion to the Latin work Satyricon, the rough manuscript followed the rise of a freedman to wealth and power. During the Fitzgeralds\u2019 sojourn in Rome in late 1924, Fitzgerald would rewrite the text several times, replacing the freedman with arriviste Jay Gatsby. Fitzgerald declined an offer of $10,000 for the serial rights, fearing it would delay the book's publication, set for April 10, 1925. Upon its release, fellow writers Willa Cather, T. S. Eliot, and Edith Wharton praised Fitzgerald's latest work, but it was snubbed by most critics and audiences. The New York World ran a headline declaring \"Fitzgerald's Latest A Dud\". For the rest of his life, The Great Gatsby experienced tepid sales. For example, in 1929 Fitzgerald only received royalties of $5.10 from the American edition and just $0.34 from the English edition.  His final royalty check was for only $13.13, all of which was from Fitzgerald buying his own books. It would take many decades for the novel to gain its present acclaim and popularity.While Fitzgerald had been writing The Great Gatsby, Zelda had become infatuated with a young French aviator, Edouard S. Jozan. She spent afternoons swimming at the beach and evenings dancing at the casinos with Jozan. After six weeks, Zelda asked for a divorce. Fitzgerald at first demanded to confront Jozan, but instead dealt with Zelda's request by locking her in their house, until she abandoned her request for divorce. Jozan was not aware that she had asked for a divorce. He left the Riviera later that year, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again. Later in life he told Zelda's biographer Milford that any infidelity was imaginary: \"They both had a need of drama, they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination.\"\n\nAfter spending winter in Italy, the Fitzgeralds returned to France, where they would alternate between Paris and the French Riviera until 1926. Fitzgerald began writing his fourth novel, provisionally titled The Boy Who Killed His Mother, Our Type, and then The World\u2019s Fair. During this period, he became friends with many members of the American expatriate community in Paris, later known as the Lost Generation. Most notable among them was a relatively unknown Ernest Hemingway, whom Fitzgerald greatly admired. Fitzgerald's friendship with Hemingway was quite effusive, as many of Fitzgerald's relationships would prove to be.  Hemingway did not get on well with Zelda, however, and in addition to describing her as \"insane\" in his memoir A Moveable Feast, Hemingway claimed that Zelda \"encouraged her husband to drink so as to distract Fitzgerald from his work on his novel\", so he could work on the short stories he sold to magazines to help support their lifestyle. Like most professional authors at the time, Fitzgerald supplemented his income by writing short stories for such magazines as The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's Weekly, and Esquire, and sold his stories and novels to Hollywood studios. This \"whoring\", as Fitzgerald and Hemingway called these sales, was a sore point in the two authors' friendship. Fitzgerald claimed that he would first write his stories in an 'authentic' manner, then rewrite them to put in the \"twists that made them into salable magazine stories\".In A Moveable Feast, Hemingway claimed that Zelda taunted Fitzgerald over the size of his penis. After examining it in a public restroom, Hemingway told Fitzgerald \"You're perfectly fine,\" assuring him that it was larger than those of statues at the Louvre. One of the most serious rifts occurred when Zelda told him that their sex life had declined because he was \"a fairy\" and was likely having a homosexual affair with Hemingway. There is no evidence that either was homosexual, but Fitzgerald nonetheless decided to have sex with a prostitute to prove his heterosexuality. Zelda found condoms that he had purchased before any encounter occurred, and a bitter fight ensued, resulting in lingering jealousy. She later threw herself down a flight of marble stairs at a party because Fitzgerald, engrossed in talking to Isadora Duncan, was ignoring her. In September 1924, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never spoke of the incident and refused to discuss whether it was a suicide attempt. The episode propelled Fitzgerald to write in his notebook, \"That September 1924, I knew something had happened that could never be repaired.\" This breakdown of their relationship worsened Fitzgerald's alcoholism.\n\n\n=== Foray into Hollywood and Tender Is the Night ===\n\nIn 1926, Fitzgerald was invited by producer John W. Considine Jr. to temporarily relocate to Hollywood in order to write a flapper comedy for United Artists. He agreed, moving into a studio-owned bungalow in January 1927. He soon met and began an affair with the 17 year-old starlet Lois Moran. Jealous of the attention Fitzgerald gave Moran, Zelda burned her own clothing in a self destructive act. The starlet became a temporary muse for the author and he rewrote Rosemary Hoyt, one of the central characters in Tender is the Night\u2014who had been a male in earlier drafts\u2014to closely mirror her. The trip further exacerbated the Fitzgerald's marital difficulties, and they left Hollywood after two months.They then rented \"Ellerslie\", a mansion near Wilmington, Delaware until 1929. Fitzgerald tried to continue working on his fourth novel, but by this point it had become clear that Zelda had an extreme mental illness as her behavior grew increasingly erratic. In 1930, she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The couple travelled to Switzerland, where she was treated at a mental clinic. They returned to America in September 1931. In February 1932, she was hospitalized at the Phipps Clinic at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.During this time, Fitzgerald rented the \"La Paix\" estate in the suburb of Towson, Maryland to work on his latest novel, the story of the rise and fall of Dick Diver, a promising young psychiatrist who becomes smitten with and marries Nicole Warren, one of his patients. The book went through many versions, the first of which was to be a story of matricide.  Some critics have seen the book as a thinly veiled autobiographical novel recounting Fitzgerald's problems with his wife, the corrosive effects of wealth and a decadent lifestyle, his own egoism and self-confidence, and his continuing alcoholism. Fitzgerald was extremely protective of his \"material\" (i.e., their life together).  In 1932, she wrote and sent to Scribner's her own fictional version of their lives in Europe, Save Me the Waltz (1932). Infuriated by what he saw as theft of his source material, Fitzgerald labelled her \"plagiaristic\" and a \"third-rate writer\". He was able to make some changes prior to the novel's publication, and convinced her doctors to keep her from writing any more about their relationship. His own novel was finally published in 1934 as Tender Is the Night. The novel received mixed opinions from critics. Most were thrown off by its three-part structure, and many felt that Fitzgerald had not lived up to their expectations. Hemingway and others have argued that such overly harsh criticism stemmed from superficial readings of the material and from Depression-era America's reaction to Fitzgerald's status as a symbol of Jazz Age excess. The novel did not sell well upon publication, with only 12,000 sold in the first 3 months, but, like the earlier The Great Gatsby, the book's reputation has since risen significantly.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\n\nWith the arrival of the Great Depression, many of Fitzgerald's works were seen as elitist and materialistic. In 1933, Matthew Josephson scolded Fitzgerald: \"There are ever so many Americans, we recall, who can't be drinking champagne from morning to night, can't ever go to Princeton or Montpar-nasse or even Greenwich Village for their finishing process.\"However, Fitzgerald began to feel the effects of the Depression himself. By the mid 1930s, his popularity and fame had greatly decreased, and consequently, he had begun to suffer financially. Public demand had decreased so much for Fitzgerald's works that by 1936, his book royalties barely amounted to $80. The cost of his opulent lifestyle and Zelda's medical bills quickly caught up, placing Fitzgerald in constant financial trouble. He relied on loans from his literary agent, Harold Ober, and his publisher Perkins. When Ober decided not to continue advancing money to Fitzgerald, the author severed ties with his longtime friend and agent.Fitzgerald's alcoholism and financial difficulties, in addition to Zelda's mental illness, made for difficult years in Baltimore. He was hospitalized nine times at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and his friend H. L. Mencken noted in a 1934 letter that \"The case of F. Scott Fitzgerald has become distressing. He is boozing in a wild manner and has become a nuisance.\" In 1935, Fitzgerald wrote Perkins, admitting that alcohol was disrupting his writing, limiting his \"mental speed.\" From 1933 to 1937, Fitzgerald was hospitalized for alcoholism 8 times and arrested several times. Fitzgerald's deteriorating mental state and drinking habits were captured publicly in an article published by Michel Mok titled \"The Other Side of Paradise, Scott Fitzgerald, 40, Engulfed in Despair\", first published in the New York Post, September 25, 1936. The article is considered to have caused considerable damage to Fitzgerald's reputation and his mental state, allegedly pushing him to attempt suicide after reading it.By that year, Zelda had become extremely violent and emotionally distressed, and Fitzgerald had her placed in the Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina. Nearly bankrupt, Fitzgerald spent most of 1936 and 1937 living in various hotels near Asheville. His attempts to write and sell more short stories faltered. He later referred to this period of decline in his life as \"The Crack-Up\" in the short story. Shortly after the release of this story, Hemingway referred to Fitzgerald as \"poor Scott\" in his short story \"The Snows of Kilimanjaro\". Zelda's institutionalization further deteriorated what was left of their marriage. The last time the two saw each other was on a 1939 trip to Cuba. During this trip, Fitzgerald was assaulted when he tried to stop a cockfight and returned to the United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized.\n\n\n=== Return to Hollywood ===\n\nAlthough he reportedly found movie work degrading, Fitzgerald entered into a lucrative exclusive deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1937 that necessitated his moving to Hollywood, where he earned his highest annual income up to that point: $29,757.87. During his two years in California, Fitzgerald rented a room at the Garden of Allah bungalow complex on Sunset Boulevard. In an effort to abstain from alcohol, Fitzgerald resorted to drinking large amounts of bottled Coca-Cola.Completely estranged from Zelda, he began an affair with gossip columnist Sheilah Graham. After a heart-attack in Schwab's Drug Store, he was ordered by his doctor to avoid strenuous exertion. He moved in with Graham, who lived in Hollywood on North Hayworth Avenue, one block east of Fitzgerald's apartment on North Laurel Avenue. Fitzgerald had two flights of stairs to climb to his apartment; Graham's was on the ground floor. At one point during their affair, Fitzgerald attempted to give her one of his books, but after visiting several bookstores, he realized that they had stopped carrying his books. On occasions that Fitzgerald failed his attempt at sobriety, he would tell others, \"I'm F. Scott Fitzgerald. You've read my books. You've read \"The Great Gatsby,\" haven't you? Remember?\"\nThe projects Fitzgerald worked on included two weeks' unused dialog work on loanout to David Selznick for Gone with the Wind (1939), and, for MGM, revisions on Madame Curie (1943), for which he received no credits. His only screenplay credit is for Three Comrades (1938). He also spent time during this period working on his fifth and final novel, based on film executive Irving Thalberg. Fitzgerald often ignored scriptwriting rules, writing prose and description more fitting for a novel, annoying the studio. In 1939, MGM terminated the contract, and Fitzgerald became a freelance screenwriter. During his work on Winter Carnival (1939), Fitzgerald went on another alcoholic binge and was treated by New York psychiatrist Richard H. Hoffmann.Director Billy Wilder described Fitzgerald's foray into Hollywood as like that of \"a great sculptor who is hired to do a plumbing job.\" Edmund Wilson and Aaron Latham later suggested that Hollywood sucked Fitzgerald's creativity like a vampire. His failure in Hollywood pushed him to return to drinking, imbibing nearly 40 beers a day in 1939. Beginning that year, Fitzgerald mocked himself as a Hollywood hack through the character of Pat Hobby in a sequence of 17 short stories, later collected as \"The Pat Hobby Stories\", which garnered many positive reviews. The Pat Hobby Stories were originally published in Esquire between January 1940 and July 1941, even after his death. In his final year of life, Fitzgerald wrote his daughter: \"I wish now I'd never relaxed or looked back - but said at the end of 'The Great Gatsby': I've found my line - from now on this comes first. This is my immediate duty - without this I am nothing.\"\n\n\n=== Illness and death ===\nOn the night of December 20, 1940, Fitzgerald and Graham attended the premiere of This Thing Called Love starring Rosalind Russell and Melvyn Douglas. As the two were leaving the Pantages Theater, Fitzgerald experienced a dizzy spell and had trouble walking; upset, he said to Graham, \"They think I am drunk, don't they?\"The following day, as Fitzgerald ate a candy bar and made notes in his newly arrived Princeton Alumni Weekly, Graham saw him jump from his armchair, grab the mantelpiece, gasp, and fall to the floor. She ran to the manager of the building, Harry Culver. Upon entering the apartment to assist Fitzgerald, Culver stated, \"I'm afraid he's dead.\" Fitzgerald had died of a heart attack, aged just 44.\n\nAmong the attendees at a visitation held at a funeral home was Dorothy Parker, who reportedly cried and murmured \"the poor son-of-a-bitch\", a line from Jay Gatsby's funeral in Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby. His body was transported to Bethesda, Maryland, where his funeral was attended by only thirty people; among the attendees were his only child, Scottie Fitzgerald, and his editor, Maxwell Perkins.At the time of his death, the Roman Catholic Church denied the family's request that Fitzgerald, a non-practicing Catholic, be buried in the family plot in the Catholic Saint Mary's Cemetery in Rockville, Maryland. Fitzgerald was instead buried at Rockville Union Cemetery. When Zelda Fitzgerald died in 1948, in a fire at the Highland Mental Hospital, she was originally buried next to him at Rockville Union. In 1975, Scottie successfully petitioned to have the earlier decision revisited, and her parents' remains were moved to the family plot in Saint Mary's.Fitzgerald, an alcoholic since college, became notorious during the 1920s for his extraordinarily heavy drinking, which would undermine his health by the late 1930s. His alcoholism resulted in cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, angina, dyspnea, and syncopal spells. According to Zelda's biographer, Nancy Milford, Fitzgerald claimed that he had contracted tuberculosis, but Milford dismisses it as a pretext to cover his drinking problems; however, Fitzgerald scholar Matthew J. Bruccoli contends that Fitzgerald did in fact have recurring tuberculosis, and according to Milford, Fitzgerald biographer Arthur Mizener said that Fitzgerald suffered a mild attack of tuberculosis in 1919, and in 1929 he had \"what proved to be a tubercular hemorrhage\". In the 1930s, Fitzgerald had told Hemingway of his fear of dying from \"congestion of the lungs.\" Others have suggested that the writer's hemorrhage was caused by bleeding from esophageal varices.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Critical reevaluation ===\n\nBy the time of his death, Fitzgerald was essentially unknown to the general public. The few who were familiar saw Fitzgerald as an alcoholic, the embodiment of Jazz Age decadence. Well after his death, Scribners still had many unsold editions of The Great Gatsby from its first printing. As late as the 1940s, many of Fitzgerald's works were labelled period pieces, with critic Peter Quennell dismissing The Great Gatsby as having \"the sadness and the remote jauntiness of a Gershwin tune.\"Fitzgerald died before he could complete his fifth novel. His manuscript, which included extensive notes for the unwritten part of the novel's story, was completed by his friend, the literary critic Edmund Wilson. When Wilson published his finished version, titled The Last Tycoon, in 1941, he included The Great Gatsby within the edition, sparking new interest and discussion. The novel gained further popularity during World War II, when it was selected to be part of the Armed Services Editions, books which were printed for American troops. Through an arrangement with the Red Cross, some novels were even sent to Japanese and German POW camps. By 1945, over 123,000 copies of The Great Gatsby had been distributed among American troops. In 1960, New York Times editorialist Arthur Mizener declared that it was \"probably safe now to say that it is a classic of twentieth-century American fiction.\" Into the 21st century, millions of copies of The Great Gatsby and his other works have been sold, and The Great Gatsby is required reading in many high school and college classes.The popular resurgence of The Great Gatsby also led to greater admiration and appreciation for Fitzgerald himself. In the 1950s, Wilson, who had attended Princeton with Fitzgerald, noted that Fitzgerald had taken on \"the aspect of a martyr, a sacrificial victim, a semi-divine personage.\" In 1960, William Troy labelled Fitzgerald \"one of the few truly mythological creations in our culture.\" Adam Gopnik noted that, counter to Fitzgerald's famous claim that \"there are no second acts in American lives,\" Fitzgerald has become \"not a poignant footnote to an ill-named time but an enduring legend of the West.\" A mythos has evolved around Fitzgerald and his life. In a 2008 interview, Jay McInerney claimed that \"people believe the myth of Fitzgerald is\u2014that he was seduced by this world that he wrote about, and that he ultimately couldn\u2019t separate his life and his art.\" Fitzgerald's momentary success and early death result in many seeing him as a tragic figure.\n\n\n=== Influence ===\n\nFitzgerald's work has inspired writers ever since he was first published. The publication of The Great Gatsby prompted T. S. Eliot to write, in a letter to Fitzgerald, \"It seems to me to be the first step that American fiction has taken since Henry James.\" Don Birnam, the protagonist of Charles Jackson's The Lost Weekend, says to himself, referring to The Great Gatsby, \"There's no such thing ... as a flawless novel. But if there is, this is it.\" In letters written in the 1940s, J. D. Salinger expressed admiration of Fitzgerald's work, and his biographer Ian Hamilton wrote that Salinger even saw himself for some time as \"Fitzgerald's successor\". Richard Yates, a writer often compared to Fitzgerald, called The Great Gatsby \"the most nourishing novel [he] read ... a miracle of talent ... a triumph of technique\". It was written in an editorial in The New York Times after his death that Fitzgerald \"was better than he knew, for in fact and in the literary sense he invented a generation ... He might have interpreted them and even guided them, as in their middle years they saw a different and nobler freedom threatened with destruction.\"\n\n\n=== Adaptations and portrayals ===\n\nFitzgerald's works have been adapted into films many times. One of the earliest Fitzgerald short stories was adapted into a 1921 silent film The Off-Shore Pirate. Tender Is the Night was the subject of the eponymous 1962 film, and made into a television miniseries in 1985. The Beautiful and Damned was filmed in 1922 and 2010. The Great Gatsby has been adapted into numerous films of the same name, spanning nearly 90 years: 1926, 1949, 1974, 2000, and 2013 adaptations. In 1976, The Last Tycoon was adapted into a film starring Robert de Niro. His short story, \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" was the basis for a 2008 film.Beyond his own characters, Fitzgerald himself has been portrayed in dozens of books, plays, and films. Fitzgerald was the main inspiration for Budd Schulberg's novel The Disenchanted (1950), which followed a screenplay writer in Hollywood working with a drunk and flawed novelist. It was later adopted into a Broadway play starring Jason Robards. A musical about the lives of Fitzgerald and Zelda was composed by Frank Wildhorn titled Waiting for the Moon. Fitzgerald is of international appeal, as even the Japanese Takarazuka Revue has created a musical adaptation of Fitzgerald's life. The last years of Fitzgerald and his affair with Sheilah Graham, was the theme of the movie Beloved Infidel (1959) based on Graham's 1958 memoir by the same name. The film depicts Fitzgerald (played by Gregory Peck) during his final years and his relationship with Graham (played by Deborah Kerr). Another film, Last Call (2002) portrays the relationship between Fitzgerald (Jeremy Irons) and Frances Kroll Ring (Neve Campbell).  David Hoflin and Christina Ricci portray the Fitzgerald's in Amazon Prime's 2015 television series Z: The Beginning of Everything. Others include the TV movies Zelda (1993, with Timothy Hutton), F. Scott Fitzgerald in Hollywood (1976, with Jason Miller), and F. Scott Fitzgerald and 'The Last of the Belles' (1974, with Richard Chamberlain). Tom Hiddleston and Alison Pill appear briefly as Fitzgerald and Zelda in Woody Allen's 2011 feature film Midnight in Paris. Guy Pearce and Vanessa Kirby portray the couple in Genius (2016).\n\n\n=== Legacy ===\n\nSome 2000 pages of work that Fitzgerald had written for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer were purchased for $475,000 by the University of South Carolina in 2004. The school's Arlyn Bruccoli, a major archivist of work done by the Lost Generation, explained that the cache \"corrects this distorted view of Fitzgerald's Hollywood years, the idea that he was just staggering around drunk all the time and not earning his salary.\"In 2015, an editor of The Strand Magazine discovered and published for the first time an 8,000-word manuscript, dated July 1939, of a Fitzgerald short story titled \"Temperature\". Long thought lost, Fitzgerald's manuscript for the story was found in the rare books and manuscript archives at Princeton University, his alma mater. As described by Strand, \"Temperature\", set in Los Angeles, tells the story of the failure, illness and decline of a once successful writer and his life among Hollywood idols, while suffering lingering fevers and indulging in light-hearted romance. The protagonist is a 31-year-old self-destructive, alcoholic named Emmet Monsen, whom Fitzgerald describes in his story as \"notably photogenic, slender and darkly handsome\". It tells of his personal relationships as his health declined with various doctors, personal assistants, and a Hollywood actress who is his lover. Fitzgerald bibliographies had previously listed the story, sometimes referred to as \"The Women in the House\", as \"unpublished\", or as \"Lost \u2013 mentioned in correspondence, but no surviving transcript or manuscript\".In 2017, a rediscovered cache of Fitzgerald's short-stories was published in a collection titled I'd Die For You.An F. Scott Fitzgerald Society was established in 1992 at Hofstra University, and has since become an international association and an affiliate of the American Literature Association. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the society organized a mass online reading of This Side of Paradise to mark its centenary.\n Fitzgerald is also the namesake of the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, home of the radio broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion.Fitzgerald's childhood Summit Terrace home in St. Paul was listed as a National Historic Landmark in 1971. Fitzgerald reportedly hated the house, labelling it \"a mausoleum of American architectural monstrosities.\"\n\n\n== Selected list of works ==\n\nThis Side of Paradise (1920)\n\"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" (1921)\nThe Beautiful and Damned (1922)\nThe Diamond as Big as the Ritz (1922)\n\"Winter Dreams\" (1922)\nThe Great Gatsby (1925)\n\"Babylon Revisited\" (1931)\nTender Is the Night (1934)\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Works cited ===\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nF.

        "wiki": "A conservatory is a building or room having glass or tarpaulin roofing and walls used as a greenhouse or a sunroom.  If in a residence, it would typically be attached to the house on only one side.  Conservatories originated in the 16th century when wealthy landowners sought to cultivate citrus fruits such as lemons and oranges that began to appear on their dinner tables brought by traders from warmer regions of the Mediterranean.  Municipal conservatories became popular in the early 19th century.\n\n\n== Description ==\nMany cities, especially those in cold climates and with large European populations, have built municipal conservatories to display tropical plants and hold flower displays. This type of conservatory was popular in the early nineteenth century, and by the end of the century people were also giving them a social use (e.g., tea parties). Conservatory architecture varies from typical Victorian glasshouses to modern styles, such as geodesic domes. Many were large and impressive structures and are included in the list below.\nIn the UK the legal definition of a conservatory is a building that has at least 50% of its side wall area glazed and at least 75% of its roof glazed with translucent materials, either polycarbonate sheeting or glass. Today, the terms sunroom, solarium and conservatory are used interchangeably by the public, but in general the term conservatory and particularly English conservatory evoke the image of an ornate structure, echoing the traditions of that Victorian era of conservatory building. Modern conservatories tend also to be graced with a traditional cresting and finial, along with single, double patio or even bi-folding doors.\nThese structures have been designed and built around the world, in private gardens, parks, and botanical institutions. Smaller garden conservatories have become popular, which may be dual-function, equally devoted to horticulture and recreation, or favor the latter, as a solarium or sunroom.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPreservation of citrus and other tender plants started out as crudely as building a pergola over potted plants or beds or simply moving potted plants indoors for the cold season. Known in Italy as limonaia, these early structures employed wood panels in storerooms or open galleries to protect from the cold.\nFurther north in Europe, the preservation of orange trees became the trend with special-purpose buildings built to protect the tasty, but delicate fruit.  Orangeries, as they came to be called were typically enclosed structures built with wood, brick or stone with tall vertical windows on the south walls. Use of these rooms expanded socially and practically, being used to entertain and to host a wider variety of plants.  The term greenhouse came to describe the rooms and conservatories for tender plants. In the 18th century a Dutch scientist pioneered the use of sloping glass to bring in more light for the plants than the tall, glass side walls of orangeries.The 19th century was the golden age of conservatory building, primarily in England. English conservatories were the product of English love of gardening and new technology in glass and heating technology. Many of the magnificent public conservatories, built of iron and glass, are the result of this era.  Kew Gardens in London is an example of a large greenhouse used for growing tender and rare plants, or, less often, for birds and rare animals \u2013 sometimes with the plants and animals living together. Other examples include the Great Palm House at Kew Gardens that was built in 1844, built by Decimus Burton and the Crystal Palace, built for London's Great Exhibition of 1851 by Sir Joseph Paxton.The widespread construction of UK conservatories came to a halt with the onset of World War II. While the advent of insulated glass in the 1950s and 1960s saw the development of simple sunroom structures, it was not until the 1970s that creative architects and builders began to recreate the Victorian styling of 19th-century English conservatories in smaller domestic versions using insulated glass. In contemporary construction, a conservatory differs from an orangery in having more than 75% of its roof surface made from glass. Frame and roof materials include aluminium, PVCu and timber. A conservatory by definition must have more than 50% of its wall surface glazed. Contemporary conservatories use a number of technologies to ensure glass is as energy efficient as possible, ensuring it lets in the maximum light possible while maintaining a steady temperature throughout summer and winter. Technologies include argon-impregnated glass, easy clean coatings, heat reflective film, thermal ribbons or thermal breaks \u2013 hollow sections of glass that intercept heat. The latest glass technologies involve self-tinting glass that darkens as heat builds up during a summer's day and then lightens as the surface temperature of the glass cools later in the day.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== List of prominent conservatories ==\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nBallarat Botanical Gardens\nBicentennial Conservatory at Adelaide's Botanic Gardens\nFitzroy Gardens, Melbourne\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nRoyal Greenhouses of Laeken\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nMuttart Conservatory (Edmonton, Alberta)\nBloedel Floral Conservatory (Vancouver, B.C.)\nAllan Gardens  (Toronto, Ontario)\nCentennial Park Conservatory (Toronto, Ontario)\nAssiniboine Park Conservatory (Winnipeg, Manitoba)\n\n\n=== China ===\nBeijing Botanical Garden (Beijing)\nShanghai Botanical Garden (Shanghai)\nSouth China Botanical Garden (Qingyang, Guangzhou)\n\n\n=== Denmark ===\nCopenhagen Botanical Gardens\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nBotanical Gardens and Botanical Museum, Berlin\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\n\n==== England ====\nKew Gardens (southwest London)\nChatsworth House (Derbyshire)\nEden Project (Cornwall)\nSyon House (west London)\nBarbican Conservatory (central London)\nAnthaeum, Hove: built in 1830 with the world's largest dome, it collapsed on its opening day in 1833.\n\n\n==== Northern Ireland ====\nBelfast Botanic Gardens\n\n\n==== Scotland ====\nRoyal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh\nKibble Palace\nThe Tollcross Winter Gardens, Glasgow\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\nPearson Conservatory, Port Elizabeth\nThe Botanical Society Conservatory, Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden, Cape Town\n\n\n=== United States ===\nAmazon Spheres (Seattle, Washington)\nAnna Scripps Whitcomb Conservatory (Detroit, Michigan)\nBiosphere 2 (Oracle, Arizona)\nBirmingham Botanical Gardens (Birmingham, Alabama)\nBolz Conservatory (Madison, Wisconsin)\nBuffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens (Buffalo, New York)\nCecil B.

        "wiki": "The Harriet Island Pavilion, currently known as the Clarence W. Wigington Pavilion, is a park pavilion on Harriet Island just across the Mississippi River from downtown Saint Paul, Minnesota.  It was designed by Clarence W. Wigington, the nation's first black municipal architect, and renamed for Wigington after a 2000 restoration. Harriet island was named for Harriet Bishop, a Baptist school teacher from Vermont. She arrived in Saint Paul in 1847, was involved in the temperance movement, and opened the first school in the frontier city, teaching children of diverse ethnic, racial, and religious backgrounds.The park at Harriet Island was built by Dr. Justus Ohage, St. Paul's health officer, who donated the land to the city in 1900.  His idea for the park was to build a place for healthy living in the center of the city.  The park originally had a public bathhouse and beach, along with amenities like playgrounds, picnic grounds, handball and tennis courts, and a bandstand.  The park was initially very popular, but pollution from the Mississippi River forced the bathhouse to close in 1919.  The city made several attempts to revitalize the park, but none of the attempts was particularly successful until the Works Progress Administration built the pavilion in 1941-1942.  The architecture combines Moderne design with classical influences.The Kasota limestone used in the construction was salvaged from the former St. Paul City Hall-Ramsey County Courthouse, which was built in 1889 and demolished in 1933.\n\n\n== References ==",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary is a city park in the Mississippi River corridor in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Just east of the city's downtown district, the sanctuary includes towering limestone and sandstone bluffs that date back more than 450 million years, spring-fed wetlands, abundant bird life, and dramatic views of the downtown Saint Paul skyline and Mississippi River. The park was opened to the public on May 21, 2005, and was named after its early supporter U.S. Representative Bruce Vento.The sanctuary has a rich ecological and human history. Once a floodplain where Phalen Creek and Trout Brook flowed together into the Mississippi River, the land was used and valued by Native people for thousands of years, and was home to Wakan Tipi (Spirit House), a sacred Dakota site also known as Carver's Cave, after explorer and writer Jonathan Carver. When the land that included today's Saint Paul was ceded to England after the French and Indian War, Carver was dispatched by England to explore the new colonial possession. He traveled up the Mississippi River, and encountered the Dakota on the bluffs in Saint Paul and Wakan Tipi on November 14, 1766. His discovery of the cave and the Dakota led him to explore the spiritual site, describing in detail, \u201cThe rock at the entrance of the cave is of lightish gray colour and very soft like the grit of a grindstone. I found many strange heiroglyphycks cut in the stone some of which was very ancient and grown over with moss. On the stone I marked the arms of the King of England.\u201d Carver's recorded explorations later became a book, Travels through the Interior Parts of North America (1778), and he gave the landmark his own name. The book's popularity made Wakan Tipi an attraction for early settlers, but the cave was lost after falling limestone and debris covered its entrance.In 1837, the Dakota ceded their lands east of the Mississippi River (35 million acres) after the early American expansion of the 1830s. Fourteen years later, the Mdewakanton Dakota ceded their lands west of the river for reservations up to the Minnesota River. After the Dakota were forced to leave, European immigrants took over the land and cultivated it, leading to industrial expansions. The North Star Brewery was built into the bluff in 1853 and later became Jacob Schmidt's first brewery.  In the 1880s the land was claimed for industrial use, resulting in the expansion of railroads and the destruction of the Wakan Tipi petroglyphs.\nAbandoned in the 1970s, the 27 acres (11 ha) of land were purchased through a broad partnership, and became a Saint Paul park in 2005. An additional 1.85 acres (0.75 ha) of adjacent industrial land were purchased and added to the park in 2008.  The sanctuary's floodplain forests, oak woodlands, prairies and other native ecosystems are being carefully restored and the park has gained state and national recognition for its combination of ecological and cultural resources \u2014 and for the community involvement in its transformation.\nOwned and operated by the City of Saint Paul, the sanctuary lies within the National Park Service's Mississippi River and Recreation Area.  The Lower Phalen Creek Project, an active community-led partnership, assists with ongoing restoration, volunteer activities and interpretation in coordination with Historic Saint Paul. The Trust for Public Land led acquisition efforts and interns from the Community Design Center of Minnesota's East Side Youth Conservation Corps work to restore the site's ecology and act as student naturalists. Neighborhood organizations, including the Dayton's Bluff Community Council and Friends of Swede Hollow, are closely involved in the sanctuary and the adjacent Swede Hollow Park.\nPlanned efforts include a direct pedestrian/bicycle trail connection to the Mississippi River and redeveloping the land adjacent to the sanctuary for an interpretive center and other park-related use.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBruce Vento Regional Trail\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMississippi River and Recreation Area\nLower Phalen Creek Project\nSaint Paul Department of Parks and Recreation Bruce Vento Nature Sanctuary Information\nFriends of Swede Hollow\nHistoric Saint Paul\nCommunity Design Center of Minnesota\nTrust for Public Land\nDayton's Bluff Community Council\nCapitol River Council",

        "wiki": "Mill City Museum is a Minnesota Historical Society museum in Minneapolis. It opened in 2003 built in the ruins of the Washburn \"A\" Mill next to Mill Ruins Park on the banks of the Mississippi River. The museum focuses on the founding and growth of Minneapolis, especially flour milling and the other industries that used hydropower from Saint Anthony Falls.\nThe mill complex, dating from the 1870s, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is part of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District and within the National Park Service's Mississippi National River and Recreation Area.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nThe museum features exhibits about the history of Minneapolis, flour milling machinery, a water lab and a baking lab. The centerpiece of the exhibit is the multistory Flour Tower, where visitors sit in the cab of a freight elevator and are taken to different floors of the building, each designed to look like a floor in a working flour mill. Voices of people who worked in the Washburn A Mill are heard throughout the show. Visitors exit on the 8th floor, where extant equipment is interpreted by staff, and are then led to the ninth-floor observation deck to view St. Anthony Falls.\nThe Gold Medal Flour sign still shines at night atop the adjoining grain elevator. Across the river, the former competitor Pillsbury A-Mill is topped with a sign reading \"Pillsbury's Best Flour.\"\n\n\n=== Local artists ===\nThe work of local artists is featured throughout the building. Pieces by JoAnn Verburg, Tom Maakestad, Kim Lawler, Kathleen Richert, Paul Wrench and Becky Schurmann include murals, an art glass collage, a 15-foot (4.6 m) Bisquick box, and sculpture.\n\n\n== Mill City Live ==\nMill City Museum began an outdoor concert series named \"Mill City Live\" in the summer of 2004. The concerts are held in the museum's Ruin courtyard and feature Twin Cities bands of various genres. \"Mill City Live\" was originally held on the first and third Thursdays of June, July, August, and September, but in 2009 and 2010 concerts were held every Thursday in July and August. As of 2016, the concerts are held every Wednesday night in August.\n\n\n== Washburn A Mill ==\n\nThe first Washburn A Mill, built by Cadwallader C. Washburn in 1874, was declared the largest flour mill in the world upon its completion, and contributed to the development of Minneapolis. On May 2, 1878, a spark ignited airborne flour dust within the mill, creating an explosion that demolished the Washburn A and killed 18 workers instantly. The ensuing fire resulted in the deaths of four more people, destroyed five other mills, and reduced Minneapolis's milling capacity by one third. Known as the Great Mill Disaster, the explosion made national news and served as a focal point that led to reforms in the milling industry. In order to prevent the buildup of combustible flour dust, ventilation systems and other precautionary devices were installed in mills throughout the country.\nBy 1880 a new Washburn A Mill, designed by Austrian engineer William de la Barre, opened as the largest flour mill in the world, a designation it retained until the Pillsbury A Mill opened across the river in 1881. At the peak of the Washburn A Mill's production, it could grind over 100 boxcars of wheat into almost 2,000,000 pounds of flour per day.  An ad from the 1870s advertised, \"Forty-one Runs of Stone.  Capacity, 1,200 Barrels per Day.  This is the largest and most complete Mill in the United States, and has not its equal in quantity and quality of machinery for making high and uniform grades of Family Flour in this country.\"  Advertising hyperbole aside, the mill, along with the Pillsbury A Mill and other flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls, contributed greatly to Minneapolis's development.  The mill was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1983 for its technological innovations and its importance in the history of General Mills.Washburn later teamed up with John Crosby to form the Washburn-Crosby Company, which later became General Mills.After World War I, flour production in Minneapolis began to decline as flour milling technology no longer depended on water power. Other cities, such as Buffalo, New York, became more prominent in the milling industry. Later on in the mill's lifetime, General Mills started putting more emphasis on producing cereals and baking mixes and shifted away from flour milling. The mill was shut down in 1965, along with eight other of the oldest mills operated by General Mills.\nIn 1991 a fire nearly destroyed the old mill, but during the late 1990s, the city of Minneapolis, through the Minneapolis Community Development Agency, worked to stabilize the mill ruins. After the city had cleared the rubble and reinforced the mill's damaged walls, the Minnesota Historical Society announced plans to construct a milling museum and education center within the ruins. Construction on the museum began in March 2001. Designed by Tom Meyer, principal for the architectural firm Meyer, Scherer & Rockcastle, the museum is a new building built with the ruin walls of the 1880 Washburn A Mill. Efforts were made to retain as much of the historic fabric of the building as was possible. Many features of the Washburn A Mill were left intact, including turbine pits, railroad tracks, a train shed and two engine houses.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWashburn A Mill Explosion in MNopedia, the Minnesota Encyclopedia\nMill City Museum Homepage\nMill City History Portal",

          "Because of time constraints and cold weather, we didn't spend as much time here as I would have liked. It is definitely an interesting area and a great place for photos if you're into that. Would like to come back and spend more time here on a warmer day.",
          "Nice walk. The hardest part is finding parking. Once, you have parking then it is great. There is so many different things to see. Old ruins buildings, bridges, and water. There are places to see off the path as well. Make sure you do not over do it so you can not get back",
          "Not much there, just some old ruins of some old grain mills. It is on the Mississippi River bike trail, though, definitely worth a ride.",
          "I visited here in June and after a full day of meetings spent a pleasant hour walking along the Mississippi River (I didn't know there were waterfalls!) right in the heart of Minneapolis. I had a pleasant (urban) walk, then got a bite to eat before returning to my hotel",
          "This is a wonderful riverside path for strollers, cyclists, and hikers. I saw many young families and single people out to get their exercise in this historic and scenic park. Enjoy the view of St. Anthony Falls, the Gold Medal mill ruins (and the Mill Museum), and the Stone",

          "Minneapolis' economic origins are due to milling. It was just a few years ago that I discovered the mill ruins. You can enjoy them too, during a walk across the Stone Arch Bridge. Really, this is may be the very best view of Minneapolis from the Mississippi.",
          "This whole park area is a very nice place to visit. It is within a couple of miles walk from my hotel and it was worth a visit. The history of the Mill Ruins together with the St. Anthony Falls, Stone Arch Bridge is interesting. On a very nice day like when I visited, it is very",

          "Really not a ton to see here, at least not when covered with snow. When looking at the lay-out from the maps at the Mill Museum it it more interesting. You can tell some history and where everything was. Otherwise, it just looks like ruins.",
          "I came to Minneapolis on a business trip and had spare time before my flight out. I always love seeing landmarks around my country and this was perfect! Even covered in a foot of snow, encased by ice, it's inspiring to see. These mills had to operate in these conditions, same",

          "Worth the little detour. Don't miss the explanatory signage. On the way down, look up at the (\"corner\")stone plaque on the Stone Arch Bridge. A step back in time! Then, walk down toward the river and back up the hill to Gold Medal Park.",
          "I loved this place. Quite amazing that it's been preserved. The ruins sit on the river and give way to a nice walk, with some climbing. It's not a hard walk and only requires moderate fitness. If you don't have problems with a flight or two of stairs, you should be fine.",

        "wiki": "A carousel (American English: from French carrousel and Italian carosello), roundabout (British English), or merry-go-round, is a type of amusement ride consisting of a rotating circular platform with seats for riders. The \"seats\" are traditionally in the form of rows of wooden horses or other animals mounted on posts, many of which are moved up and down by gears to simulate galloping, to the accompaniment of looped circus music. This leads to one of the alternative American names, the galloper (however see \u2018direction of rotation\u2019 below). Other popular names are jumper, horseabout, and flying horses.Carousels are commonly populated with horses, each horse weighing roughly 100 lbs (45 kg), but may include a variety of mounts, for example pigs, zebras, tigers, or mythological creatures such as dragons or unicorns. Sometimes, chair-like or bench-like seats are used, and occasionally mounts can be shaped like aeroplanes or cars.\nThe \"roundabouts\" or \"merry-go-rounds\" installed in playgrounds are usually somewhat different devices: simple, child-powered rotating platforms with bars or handles to which children can cling while riding.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early carousels ===\n\nThe modern carousel emerged from early jousting traditions in Europe and the Middle East. Knights would gallop in a circle while tossing balls from one to another; an activity that required great skill and horsemanship. This game was introduced to Europe at the time of the Crusades from earlier Byzantine and Arab traditions. The word carousel originated from the Italian garosello  and Spanish carosella (\"little battle\", used by crusaders to describe a combat preparation exercise and game played by Turkish and Arabian horsemen in the 12th century). This early device was essentially a cavalry training mechanism; it prepared and strengthened the riders for actual combat as they wielded their swords at the mock enemies.\nBy the 17th century, the balls had been dispensed with, and instead the riders had to spear small rings that were hanging from poles overhead and rip them off. Cavalry spectacles that replaced medieval jousting, such as the ring-tilt, were popular in Italy and France. The game began to be played by commoners, and carousels soon sprung up at fairgrounds across Europe. At the Place du Carrousel in Paris, an early make believe carousel was set up with wooden horses for the children.By the early 18th century carousels were being built and operated at various fairs and gatherings in central Europe and England. Animals and mechanisms would be crafted during the winter months and the family and workers would go touring in their wagon train through the region, operating their large menagerie carousel at various venues. Makers included Heyn in Germany and Bayol in France. These early carousels had no platforms; the animals would hang from chains and fly out from the centrifugal force of the spinning mechanism. They were often powered by animals walking in a circle or people pulling a rope or cranking.\nBy 1803 John Joseph Merlin had a carousel in his Mechanical Museum in London, where gentry and nobility liked to gather on winter evenings. The horses \"floated free over a pole\". It was connected to a \"big musical instrument that played a fully orchestrated concerto\" and from the first note the carousel would start turning while each individual horse would make a galloping movement with a visitor riding on its back. Merlin did not patent his inventions and engineers were allowed to come to create their own models of his creations.\n\n\n=== Direction of rotation ===\n\nViewed from above, in the United Kingdom, merry-go-rounds, called \u2018gallopers\u2019 by the showmen community when populated by model horses, usually turn clockwise (from the outside, animals face to the left), while in North America and Mainland Europe, carousels typically go counterclockwise (animals face to the right).\n\n\n=== Modern carousels ===\nBy the mid-19th century the platform carousel was developed; the animals and chariots were fixed to a circular floor that would suspend from a centre pole and rotate around. These carousels were called dobbies and were operated manually by the operator or by ponies.\nIn mid-19th century England, the carousel became a popular fixture at fairs. The first steam-powered mechanical roundabout, invented by Thomas Bradshaw, appeared at the Aylsham Fair in about 1861. It was described by a Halifax Courier journalist as \"a roundabout of huge proportions, driven by a steam engine which whirled around with such impetuousity, that the wonder is the daring riders are not shot off like cannon- ball, and driven half into the middle of next month.\"\n\nSoon afterwards, English engineer Frederick Savage began to branch out of agricultural machinery production into the construction of fairground machines, swiftly becoming the chief innovator in the field. Savage's fairground machinery was exported all over the world. By 1870, he was manufacturing carousels with Velocipedes (an early type of bicycle) and he soon began experimenting with other possibilities, including a roundabout with boats that would pitch and roll on cranks with a circular motion, a ride he called 'Sea-on-Land'.Savage applied a similar innovation to the more traditional mount of the horse; he installed gears and offset cranks on the platform carousels, thus giving the animals their well-known up-and-down motion as they travelled around the center pole \u2013 the galloping horse. The platform served as a position guide for the bottom of the pole and as a place for people to walk or other stationary animals or chariots to be placed. He called this ride the 'Platform Gallopers' . He also developed the 'platform-slide' which allowed the mounts to swing out concentrically as the carousel built up speed. Fairground organs (band organs) were often present (if not built in) when these machines operated. Eventually electric motors were installed and electric lights added, giving the carousel its classic look.\n\nThese mechanical innovations came at a crucial time, when increased prosperity meant that more people had time for leisure and spare money to spend on entertainment. It was in this historical context that the modern fairground ride was born, with Savage supplying this new market demand. In his 1902 Catalogue for Roundabouts he claimed to have \"... patented and placed upon the market all the principal novelties that have delighted the many thousands of pleasure seekers at home and abroad.\"In the United States, the carousel industry was developed by immigrants, notably Gustav Dentzel of Germany and Charles W.F. Dare from England, from the late 19th century. Several centers and styles for the construction of carousels emerged in the United States: Coney Island style \u2013 characterized by elaborate, and sometimes faux-jeweled, saddles \u2013 with Charles I. D. Looff; Philadelphia style \u2013 known for more realistically painted saddles \u2013 with Dentzel and the Philadelphia Toboggan Company; and Country Fair style \u2013 often with no saddles at all \u2013 with Allan Herschell and Edward Spillman of western New York, and Charles W. Parker of Kansas. The golden age of the carousel in America was the early 20th century, with large machines and elaborate animals, chariots, and decorations being built.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Antique and notable carousels ==\nThe National Carousel Association maintains a list of Historic Carousel Award winners, primarily focused on carousels in Canada and America.\n\n\n=== Pre-1869 ===\n\n\n=== 1870\u20131879 ===\n\n\n=== 1880\u20131889 ===\n\n\n=== 1890\u20131899 ===\n\n\n=== 1900\u20131909 ===\n\nCentral Park Carousel, New York, NY circa 1908, by Stein and Goldstein.  Originally located at Coney Island at a trolley depot.

It was bought by the dealerships owner Harvey Harper in 1991, after purchase this 1947 Allan Herschell Carousel was shipped to Oakland by train and drive to Eureka in a semi-truck. It took a year to assemble on site. It was refurbished and repainted in 2013 which caused the ride to be closed for a month. It is open daily free of charge to the public from 12\u20134 except on holidays and when inclement weather doesn't allow for riders.\n\n\n=== Unique and record breaking ===\nThe carousel at Phantasialand in Germany is one of the biggest in the world, made by Preston & Barbieri one historical amusement ride factory in Italy.\nThe world's only two-row stationary carousel built from an original Dentzel blueprint left in existence, the Highland Park Dentzel Carousel and Shelter Building, is located in Highland Park in Meridian, Mississippi.\nIn May 2005, William Henry Dentzel III, built the world's first solar-powered carousel. The carousel operates during Solfest at the Solar Living Institute in Hopland, California.\nThere is only one carousel in the world that rides in a waving motion \u2013 \"Over the Jumps: The Arkansas Carousel\" in Little Rock, Arkansas. It is also the only remaining wooden track carousel built by the Herschell & Spillman Company, and one of only four track carousels still in existence.\nThe carousel at Conneaut Lake Park in Conneaut Lake, Pennsylvania is the last T.M. Harton Carousel that is still in operation and its Artizan band organ is one of two known of the same model in the world.\nIn 2007, SeaWorld Orlando opened Sea Carousel, Florida's first aquatic carousel.\nIn 2012, Buttonwood Park Zoo opened an Americana carousel by Chance Rides.\nIn 2013, Palm Beach International Equestrian Center opened a Bertazzon Venetian Carousel as part of the Winter Equestrian Festival (the first carousel to be used in events besides South Florida Fair and the first Palm Beach County carousel built by Bertazzon)\nBinghamton, New York is considered the \"Carousel Capital of the World\" for the six original carousels in the Triple Cities area, donated by George F. Johnson, owner of the Endicott-Johnson Company early in the 20th century. These carousels, manufactured by the Allen Hershell Company in the \"country fair\" style, were donated with the express stipulation that they would never charge admission for anyone to ride them. Apparently when Mr. Johnson was a child he was frequently too poor to ride the local carousel and he vowed this would never happen to another child in the area. The carousel at the Ross park zoo in Binghamton, NY does charge admission, in a way, as it requires the child to drop one piece of litter found in the park into a trash barrel in order to ride. This is all written on a plaque at the entrance to the carousel.{Greater Binghamton New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, visitbinghamton.org, March 2014}\nThe two double-decker Columbia Carousels built by Chance Rides and located at Six Flags Great America and California's Great America are the two tallest carousels in the world.\nThe Merry-Go-Round at Bear Mountain State Park features hand-painted scenes of the Park and 42 hand-carved seats of native animals including black bear, wild turkey, deer, raccoon, skunk, Canada goose, fox, swan, bobcat, rabbit, and more.\nOn Canada Day 2016, a new attraction was opened in Downtown Markham, Ontario. The Pride of Canada Carousel was commissioned by Christopher Bratty, current president of the real estate and development firm The Remington Group. The carousel was produced and originally envisioned by Shelley M. Shier of Broadway Bound Fine Arts and Entertainment for The Remington Group. The carousel sits inside a glass pavillon designed by Sheldon Levitt from Quardrangle Architects.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Stone Arch Bridge is a former railroad bridge crossing the Mississippi River at Saint Anthony Falls in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota.  It is the only arched bridge made of stone on the entire Mississippi River. It is the second oldest bridge on the river next to Eads Bridge.  The bridge was built to connect the railway system to the new Union Depot, which at that time was planned to be built between Hennepin Avenue and Nicollet Avenue.  The bridge was completed in 1883, costing $650,000 at the time ($17.8 million today). 117 Portland Avenue is the general address of the historic complex.\nLocated between the 3rd Avenue Bridge and the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge, the Stone Arch Bridge was built in 1883 by railroad tycoon James J. Hill for his Great Northern Railway, and accessed the former passenger station located about a mile to the west, on the west bank of the river. \nFor a time, the bridge was dubbed \"Hill's Folly\" until the value of Hill's new bridge as a passenger rail link became evident.The structure is now used as a pedestrian and bicycle bridge.  It is a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 as a part of the Saint Anthony Falls Historic District, (District #71000438).\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1880, Minneapolis was a bustling city with major commerce mostly located on the west bank of the Mississippi River, while smaller, up-and-coming businesses were on the east. With the merging of the Village of St. Anthony on the east side, Minneapolis continuously grew in population, and the Hennepin Avenue suspension bridge served as the sole thoroughfare for commuters and pedestrians.  At that time, the Hennepin Avenue bridge was overused and in desperate need of upkeep.  The city's network of railroads, which was crucial for urbanization, was also located on the east side of the river.  With the rapid increase in commercialization, Minneapolis businessmen sought a plan to accommodate the heavy flow of traffic, and immediately considered the railroad mogul James J. Hill for the task.  The idea was to build a railroad depot, similar to the St. Paul Union Depot, along the intersections of Hennepin Avenue and Nicollet Avenue in downtown Minneapolis, which would also connect to the Manitoba Road tracks, eventually developing into the Great Northern Railway.The initial planning was conducted during a meeting held near the end of 1881. The project would include building a terminal in downtown Minneapolis and connecting the rails to the Manitoba Railway, the execution for which was accomplished by the Minneapolis Union Railway company, a team that was built for the sole purpose of overseeing the project.  The stockholders met for the first time immediately the following year and Col. Charles C. Smith was selected as the head engineer.\nThe bridge has been altered somewhat from its original appearance.  When the Upper Lock and Dam were built at Saint Anthony Falls, two of the arches were replaced with a moveable truss so barges could pass through the lock.  Later, in 1965, flood waters undermined three of the piers and caused the bridge to sag fourteen inches.  The bridge was repaired by strengthening the piers and reinforcing underneath two of the arches.\nWhen it was in rail service, the bridge carried trains of many railroads to and from the Minneapolis Great Northern Depot, including the Great Northern Railway's Empire Builder. The bridge ceased to be used as a railroad bridge in 1978, and after a period of disuse, was repaired and adapted in the early 1990s to its present use. The bike and walking trails across the bridge are integrated into the city's park and trail system, and form part of the St Anthony Falls Heritage Trail, which includes interpretive plaques describing the history of the area.  The most recent renovations\u2014including indirect lighting\u2014were completed in late 2005. The lighting was paid for by private donations.\nDuring the summer months, the Stone Arch Bridge is a focus of numerous festivals in the area of St. Anthony Main and Historic Main Street. The Stone Arch Festival of the Arts occurs Father's Day weekend and features many local artists. Fireworks displays on the Fourth of July and during the Minneapolis Aquatennial in late July also bring crowds; fireworks are launched from nearby Hennepin Island. The bridge offers views of the Minneapolis skyline, Pillsbury \"A\" Mill, the Mill City Museum, and many other places in the district, and is near both the restaurants of Main St SE and the Guthrie Theater.\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\nThe Minnesota Historical Society and the Great Northern Railway provided the following important historical timeline:\n1881 - James J. Hill was formally appointed on the Stone Arch Bridge project 1882 - The initial stockholders meeting was held and Col. Charles C. Smith was assigned as the construction's head engineer\n1883 - After 22 months of intensive work, the Stone Arch Bridge was completed 1885 - The Union Depot at the heart of Minneapolis was completed and substantially increased the passenger volume\n1907-1911 - Renovations were done to improve the bridge's drainage system and strengthen its structural support in order to transport heavier loads\n1925 - Another renovation conducted to increase the width to allow bigger trains that would house more passengers1961- 1963 - The lock and dam was built at St. Anthony falls which required arch number 13 and 14 to be replaced with a 200-foot Warren truss and allow barges to pass 1965 - The bridge underwent renovation when the Mississippi River flooded, causing the seventh pier to sink about 14 inches\n1971 - The bridge became part of the National Register of Historic Places 1978 - The last passenger train crossed the Stone Arch Bridge 1989 - The bridge was bought by the Hennepin County Regional Railroad Authority 1992 - The ownership was transferred to Minnesota Department of Transportation 1994 - The bridge was converted into a biking/walking path by the Minneapolis Park Board \n\n\n== Design and construction ==\n\nThe Stone Arch Bridge, commissioned by James J Hill and designed by Charles C Smith, was built between 1882 and 1883. Hill originally intended to build an iron bridge spanning the Mississippi at Nicollet Island, but Smith discovered that pursuing that design would be detrimental to St Anthony Falls\u2019 eroding sandstone. Smith's design was pioneering and the signature arches were designed to account for the falls and the surrounding topography. The stone used to make the bridge was locally sourced, including granite from Sauk Rapids for the piers and magnesium limestone from Mankato and Iowa for the upper portion.In the 130 years of its existence the bridge has undergone a number of upgrades and repairs. In 1925 the width of the bridge was increased to allow for larger railcars. Then in 1994 the bridge was converted to a pedestrian walkway.\n\n\n== Heritage trail plaque ==\nA plaque near the bridge explains that the bridge was built for the Manitoba Line (St. Paul, Minneapolis and Manitoba Railway), which would be used to bring wheat from the Red River valley and Canada to the Minneapolis mills. It remains as a monument to James J. Hill, his vision, and is a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of crossings of the Upper Mississippi River\nList of shared-use paths in Minneapolis\n\n\n== References ==\n\nOlsen, Byron D.

        "wiki": "John Fitzgerald Kennedy (May 29, 1917 \u2013 November 22, 1963), often referred to by his initials JFK and Jack, was an American politician who served as the 35th president of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963. Kennedy served at the height of the Cold War, and the majority of his work as president concerned relations with the Soviet Union and Cuba. A Democrat, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate prior to becoming president.\nKennedy was born into a wealthy, political family in Brookline, Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard University in 1940, before joining the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater and earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his service. After a brief stint in journalism, Kennedy represented a working-class Boston district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, Kennedy published his book, Profiles in Courage, which won a Pulitzer Prize. In the 1960 presidential election, he narrowly defeated Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president.\nKennedy's administration included high tensions with communist states in the Cold War. As a result, he increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam. In April 1961, he authorized an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Kennedy authorized the Cuban Project in November 1961. He rejected Operation Northwoods (plans for false flag attacks to gain approval for a war against Cuba) in March 1962. However, his administration continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962. The following October, U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet missile bases had been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of tensions, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, nearly resulted in the breakout of a global thermonuclear conflict. The Strategic Hamlet Program began in Vietnam during his presidency. Domestically, Kennedy presided over the establishment of the Peace Corps and the continuation of the Apollo space program. He also supported the civil rights movement, but was only somewhat successful in passing his New Frontier domestic policies.\nOn November 22, 1963, he was assassinated in Dallas. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson assumed the presidency upon Kennedy's death. Marxist and former U.S. Marine Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the state crime, but he was shot and killed by Jack Ruby two days later. The FBI and the Warren Commission both concluded Oswald had acted alone in the assassination, but various groups contested the Warren Report and believed that Kennedy was the victim of a conspiracy. After Kennedy's death, Congress enacted many of his proposals, including the Civil Rights Act and the Revenue Act of 1964. Kennedy ranks highly in polls of U.S. presidents with historians and the general public. His personal life has also been the focus of considerable sustained interest following public revelations in the 1970s of his chronic health ailments and extramarital affairs.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Fitzgerald Kennedy was born outside Boston in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917, at 83 Beals Street, to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., a businessman and politician, and Rose Kennedy (n\u00e9e Fitzgerald), a philanthropist and socialite. His paternal grandfather, P. J. Kennedy, served as a Massachusetts state legislator. Kennedy's maternal grandfather and namesake, John F. \"Honey Fitz\" Fitzgerald, served as a U.S. Congressman and was elected to two terms as Mayor of Boston. All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants. Kennedy had an elder brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings: Rosemary, Kathleen (\"Kick\"), Eunice, Patricia, Robert (\"Bobby\"), Jean, and Edward (\"Ted\").\nKennedy lived in Brookline for the first ten years of his life and attended the local St. Aidan's Church, where he was baptized on June 19, 1917. He was educated through the 4th grade at the Edward Devotion School, the Noble and Greenough Lower School, and the Dexter School; all located in the Boston area. JFK's earliest memories involved accompanying his grandfather Fitzgerald on walking tours of historic sites in Boston and discussions at the family dinner table about politics, sparking his interest in history and public service. Joseph Kennedy's business had kept him away from the family for long stretches of time, and his ventures were concentrated on Wall Street and Hollywood. In September 1927, the family moved from Boston by \"private railway car\" to the Riverdale neighborhood of New York City. Several years later, John Kennedy's brother Robert told Look magazine that his father had left Boston because of signs that read: \"No Irish Need Apply.\" The family spent summers and early autumns at their home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, a village on Cape Cod, where they enjoyed swimming, sailing, and touch football. Christmas and Easter holidays were spent at their winter retreat in Palm Beach, Florida. Young John attended the Riverdale Country School\u2212a private school for boys\u2212from 5th to 7th grade, and was a member of Boy Scout Troop 2 in Bronxville, New York. In September 1930, Kennedy, then 13 years old, attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, for 8th grade. In April 1931, he had an appendectomy, after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home.\n\nIn September 1931, Kennedy started attending Choate, a prestigious boarding school in Wallingford, Connecticut, for 9th through 12th grade. His older brother Joe Jr. had already been at Choate for two years and was a football player and leading student. He spent his first years at Choate in his older brother's shadow and compensated with rebellious behavior that attracted a coterie. They carried out their most notorious stunt by exploding a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker. In the ensuing chapel assembly, the strict headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain \"muckers\" who would \"spit in our sea\". The defiant Kennedy took the cue and named his group \"The Muckers Club\", which included roommate and lifelong friend Kirk LeMoyne \"Lem\" Billings.During his years at Choate, Kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated with his emergency hospitalization in 1934 at Yale New Haven Hospital, where doctors suspected leukemia. In June 1934, he was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; the ultimate diagnosis there was colitis. Kennedy graduated from Choate in June of the following year, finishing 64th in a class of 112 students. He had been the business manager of the school yearbook and was voted the \"most likely to succeed\".In September 1935, Kennedy made his first trip abroad when he traveled to London with his parents and his sister Kathleen. He intended to study under Harold Laski at the London School of Economics (LSE), as his older brother had done. Ill-health forced his return to the United States in October of that year, when he enrolled late and attended Princeton University but had to leave after two months due to a gastrointestinal illness. He was then hospitalized for observation at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He convalesced further at the family winter home in Palm Beach, then spent the spring of 1936 working as a ranch hand on the 40,000-acre (16,000-hectare) Jay Six cattle ranch outside Benson, Arizona. It is reported that ranchman Jack Speiden worked both brothers \"very hard\".In September 1936, Kennedy enrolled at Harvard College, and his application essay stated: \"The reasons that I have for wishing to go to Harvard are several. I feel that Harvard can give me a better background and a better liberal education than any other university. I have always wanted to go there, as I have felt that it is not just another college, but is a university with something definite to offer. Then too, I would like to go to the same college as my father. To be a 'Harvard man' is an enviable distinction, and one that I sincerely hope I shall attain.\" He produced that year's annual \"Freshman Smoker\", called by a reviewer \"an elaborate entertainment, which included in its cast outstanding personalities of the radio, screen and sports world\".He tried out for the football, golf, and swimming teams and earned a spot on the varsity swimming team. Kennedy also sailed in the Star class and won the 1936 Nantucket Sound Star Championship. In July 1937, Kennedy sailed to France\u2014taking his convertible\u2014and spent ten weeks driving through Europe with Billings. In June 1938, Kennedy sailed overseas with his father and older brother to work at the American embassy in London, where his father was President Franklin D. Roosevelt's U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James's.In 1939, Kennedy toured Europe, the Soviet Union, the Balkans, and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis. He then went to Czechoslovakia and Germany before returning to London on September 1, 1939, the day that Germany invaded Poland to mark the beginning of World War II. Two days later, the family was in the House of Commons for speeches endorsing the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Germany. Kennedy was sent as his father's representative to help with arrangements for American survivors of the SS Athenia before flying back to the U.S. from Foynes, Ireland, on his first transatlantic flight.\nWhen Kennedy was an upperclassman at Harvard, he began to take his studies more seriously and developed an interest in political philosophy. He made the dean's list in his junior year. In 1940 Kennedy completed his thesis, \"Appeasement in Munich\", about British negotiations during the Munich Agreement. The thesis eventually became a bestseller under the title Why England Slept. In addition to addressing Britain's unwillingness to strengthen its military in the lead-up to World War II, the book also called for an Anglo-American alliance against the rising totalitarian powers. Kennedy became increasingly supportive of U.S. intervention in World War II, and his father's isolationist beliefs resulted in the latter's dismissal as ambassador to the United Kingdom. This created a split between the Kennedy and Roosevelt families.In 1940, Kennedy graduated cum laude from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts in government, concentrating on international affairs. That fall, he enrolled at the Stanford Graduate School of Business and audited classes there. In early 1941, Kennedy left and helped his father write a memoir of his time as an American ambassador. He then traveled throughout South America; his itinerary included Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.\n\n\n== U.S. Navy Reserve (1941\u20131945) ==\n\nIn 1940, Kennedy attempted to enter the army's Officer Candidate School. Despite months of training, he was medically disqualified due to his chronic lower back problems. On September 24, 1941, Kennedy, with the help of then director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and former naval attach\u00e9 to Joseph Kennedy Alan Kirk, joined the United States Naval Reserve. He was commissioned an ensign on October 26, 1941, and joined the staff of the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn January 1942, Kennedy was assigned to the ONI field office at Headquarters, Sixth Naval District, in Charleston, South Carolina. He attended the Naval Reserve Officer Training School at Northwestern University in Chicago from July 27 to September 27  and then voluntarily entered the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island. On October 10, he was promoted to lieutenant junior grade. In early November, Kennedy was still mourning the death of his close, childhood friend, Marine Corps Second Lieutenant George Houk Mead Jr., who had been killed in action at Guadalcanal that August and awarded the Navy Cross for his bravery. Accompanied by a female acquaintance from a wealthy Newport family, the couple had stopped in Middletown, Rhode Island at the cemetery where the decorated, naval spy, Commander Hugo W. Koehler, USN, had been buried the previous year. Ambling around the plots near the tiny St. Columba's chapel, Kennedy paused over Koehler's white granite cross grave marker and pondered his own mortality, hoping out loud that when his time came, he would not have to die without religion. \"But these things can't be faked,\" he added. \"There's no bluffing.\" Two decades later, Kennedy and Koehler's stepson, U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell had become good friends and political allies, although they had been acquaintances since the mid-1930s during their \"salad days\" on the same Newport debutante party \"circuit\" and when Pell had dated Kathleen (\"Kick\") Kennedy. Kennedy completed his training on December 2 and was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron FOUR.His first command was PT-101 from December 7, 1942, until February 23, 1943: It was a patrol torpedo (PT) boat used for training while Kennedy was an instructor at Melville. He then led three Huckins PT boats\u2014PT-98, PT-99, and PT-101, which were being relocated from MTBRON 4 in Melville, Rhode Island, back to Jacksonville, Florida, and the new MTBRON 14 (formed February 17, 1943). During the trip south, he was hospitalized briefly in Jacksonville after diving into the cold water to unfoul a propeller. Thereafter, Kennedy was assigned duty in Panama and later in the Pacific theater, where he eventually commanded two more PT boats.\n\n\n=== Commanding PT-109 ===\n\nIn April 1943, Kennedy was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron TWO, and on April 24 he took command of PT-109, which was based at the time on Tulagi Island in the Solomons. On the night of August 1\u20132, in support of the New Georgia campaign, PT-109 was on its 31st mission with fourteen other PTs ordered to block or repel four Japanese destroyers and floatplanes carrying food, supplies, and 900 Japanese soldiers to the Vila Plantation garrison on the southern tip of the Solomon's Kolombangara Island. Intelligence had been sent to Kennedy's Commander Thomas G. Warfield expecting the arrival of the large Japanese naval force that would pass on the evening of August 1. Of the 24 torpedoes fired that night by eight of the American PT's, not one hit the Japanese convoy. On that dark and moonless night, Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer heading north on its return from the base of Kolombangara around 2:00 a.m., and attempted to turn to attack, when PT-109 was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyer Amagiri\uff08captain:Kohei Hanami\uff09, killing two PT-109 crew members.Kennedy gathered around the wreckage his surviving ten crew members to vote on whether to \"fight or surrender\". Kennedy stated: \"There's nothing in the book about a situation like this. A lot of you men have families and some of you have children. What do you want to do? I have nothing to lose.\" Shunning surrender, around 2:00 p.m. on August 2, the men swam towards Plum Pudding island 3.5 miles (5.6 km) southwest of the remains of PT-109. Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth. Kennedy made an additional two-mile swim the night of August 2, 1943, to Ferguson Passage to attempt to hail a passing American PT boat to expedite his crew's rescue and attempted to make the trip on a subsequent night, in a damaged canoe found on Naru Island where he had swum with Ensign George Ross to look for food.On August 4, 1943, he and Lenny Thom assisted his injured and hungry crew on a demanding swim 3.75 miles (6.04 km) southeast to Olasana Island, which was visible to the crew from their desolate home on Plum Pudding Island. They swam against a strong current, and once again Kennedy towed the badly burned motor machinist \"Pappy\" MacMahon by his life vest. The somewhat larger Olasana Island had ripe coconut trees, but still no fresh water. On the following day, August 5, Kennedy and Ensign George Ross made the one hour swim to Naru Island, an additional distance of about .5 miles (0.80 km) southwest, in search of help and food. Kennedy and Ross found a small canoe, packages of crackers, candy and a fifty-gallon drum of drinkable water left by the Japanese, which Kennedy paddled another half mile back to Olasana in the acquired canoe to provide his hungry crew. Lieutenant \"Bud\" Liebenow, a friend and former tentmate of Kennedy's, rescued Kennedy and his crew on Olasana Island on August 8, 1943 aboard his boat, PT-157, with the help of coast watcher Lieutenant Reginald Evans and several native coast watchers, particularly Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana.\n\n\n=== Commanding PT-59 ===\nKennedy took only a month to recover and returned to duty, commanding the PT-59, first removing the torpedo tubes and depth charges and refitting her in one month into a heavily armed gunboat mounting two automatic 40mm guns and ten .50 caliber Browning machine guns. The plan was to attach one gunboat to each PT boat section to add gun range and power against barges and shore batteries which the 59 encountered on several occasions in mid-October through mid-November. On October 8, 1943, Kennedy was promoted to full lieutenant. On November 2, Kennedy's PT-59 took part with two other PTs in the successful rescue of 40\u201350 marines. The 59 acted as a shield from shore fire and protected them as they escaped on two rescue landing craft at the base of the Warrior River at Choiseul Island, taking ten marines aboard and delivering them to safety. Under doctor's orders, Kennedy was relieved of his command of PT-59 on November 18, and sent to the hospital on Tulagi. From there he returned to the United States in early January 1944. After receiving treatment for his back injury, he was released from active duty in late 1944.Kennedy was hospitalized at the Chelsea Naval Hospital in Chelsea, Massachusetts from May to December 1944. On June 12, he was presented the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his heroic actions on August 1\u20132, 1943, and the Purple Heart Medal for his back injury while on PT-109. Beginning in January 1945, Kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury at Castle Hot Springs, a resort and temporary military hospital in Arizona. After the war, Kennedy felt that the medal he had received for heroism was not a combat award and asked that he be reconsidered for the Silver Star Medal for which he had been recommended initially. Kennedy's father also requested that his son receive the Silver Star, which is awarded for gallantry in action.\nOn August 12, 1944, Kennedy's older brother, Joe Jr., a navy pilot, was killed while volunteering for a special and hazardous air mission. His explosive-laden plane blew up when the plane's bombs detonated prematurely while the aircraft was flying over the English Channel.On March 1, 1945, Kennedy retired from the Navy Reserve on physical disability and was honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant. When later asked how he became a war hero, Kennedy joked: \"It was easy. They cut my PT boat in half.\"In 1950, the Department of the Navy offered Kennedy a Bronze Star Medal in recognition of his meritorious service, which he declined. Kennedy's two original medals are currently on display at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.\n\n\n=== Military awards ===\nIn addition to the various campaign medals received for his war service, Kennedy was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his conduct during and after the loss of PT-109, as well as the Purple Heart for being wounded.\n\n\n==== Navy and Marine Corps Medal citation ====\nFor extremely heroic conduct as Commanding Officer of Motor Torpedo Boat 109 following the collision and sinking of that vessel in the Pacific War area on August 1\u20132, 1943. Unmindful of personal danger, Lieutenant (then Lieutenant, Junior Grade) Kennedy unhesitatingly braved the difficulties and hazards of darkness to direct rescue operations, swimming many hours to secure aid and food after he had succeeded in getting his crew ashore. His outstanding courage, endurance and leadership contributed to the saving of several lives and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\n\n== Journalism ==\nIn April 1945, Kennedy's father, who was a friend of William Randolph Hearst, arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for Hearst Newspapers; the assignment kept Kennedy's name in the public eye and \"expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career\". He worked as a correspondent that May, covering the Potsdam Conference and other events.\n\n\n== Congressional career (1947\u20131960) ==\nJFK's elder brother Joe had been the family's political standard-bearer and had been tapped by their father to seek the Presidency. Joe's death during the war in 1944 changed that course and the assignment fell to JFK as the second eldest of the Kennedy siblings.\n\n\n=== House of Representatives (1947\u20131953) ===\nAt the urging of Kennedy's father, U.S. Representative James Michael Curley vacated his seat in the strongly Democratic 11th congressional district of Massachusetts to become mayor of Boston in 1946. Kennedy established his residency at an apartment building on 122 Bowdoin Street across from the Massachusetts State House. With his father financing and running his campaign under the slogan \"THE NEW GENERATION OFFERS A LEADER\", Kennedy won the Democratic primary with 42 percent of the vote, defeating ten other candidates. His father joked after the campaign, \"With the money I spent, I could have elected my chauffeur.\" Campaigning around Boston, Kennedy called for better housing for veterans, better health care for all, and support for organized labor's campaign for reasonable work hours, a healthy workplace, and the right to organize, bargain, and strike. In addition, he campaigned for peace through the United Nations and strong opposition to the Soviet Union. Though Republicans took control of the House in the 1946 elections, Kennedy defeated his Republican opponent in the general election, taking 73 percent of the vote. Along with Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, Kennedy was one of several World War II veterans elected to Congress that year.He served in the House for six years, joining the influential Education and Labor Committee and the Veterans' Affairs Committee. He concentrated his attention on international affairs, supporting the Truman Doctrine as the appropriate response to the emerging Cold War. He also supported public housing and opposed the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, which restricted the power of labor unions. Though not as vocal an anti-communist as McCarthy, Kennedy supported the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which required Communists to register with the government, and he deplored the \"loss of China\".Having served as a Boy Scout during his childhood, Kennedy was active in the Boston Council from 1946 to 1955: as District Vice Chairman, member of the Executive Board, Vice-President, as well as a National Council Representative. Almost every weekend that Congress was in session, Kennedy would fly back to Massachusetts to give speeches to veteran, fraternal, and civic groups, while maintaining an index card file on individuals who might be helpful for a future campaign for state-wide office. JFK set a goal of speaking in every city and town in Massachusetts prior to 1952.\n\n\n=== Senate (1953\u20131960) ===\n\nAs early as 1949, Kennedy began preparing to run for the Senate in 1952 against Republican three-term incumbent Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. with the campaign slogan \"KENNEDY WILL DO MORE FOR MASSACHUSETTS\". Joseph Kennedy again financed his son's candidacy, while John Kennedy's younger brother Robert F. Kennedy emerged as an important member of the campaign as manager. The campaign hosted a series of \"teas\" (sponsored by Kennedy's mother and sisters) at hotels and parlors across Massachusetts to reach out to women voters. In the presidential election, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower carried Massachusetts by a margin of 208,000 votes, but Kennedy defeated Lodge by 70,000 votes for the Senate seat. The following year, he married Jacqueline Bouvier.\n\nKennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years. Often absent from the Senate, he was at times critically ill and received Catholic last rites. During his convalescence in 1956, he published Profiles in Courage, a book about U.S. senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957. Rumors that this work was co-written by his close adviser and speechwriter, Ted Sorensen, were confirmed in Sorensen's 2008 autobiography.At the start of his first term, Kennedy focused on Massachusetts-specific issues by sponsoring bills to help the fishing, textile manufacturing, and watchmaking industries. In 1954, Senator Kennedy voted in favor of the Saint Lawrence Seaway which would connect the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean, despite opposition from Massachusetts politicians who argued that the project would cripple New England's shipping industry, including the Port of Boston. Three years later, Kennedy chaired a special committee to select the five greatest U.S. Senators in history so their portraits could decorate the Senate Reception Room. That same year, Kennedy joined the Senate Labor Rackets Committee with his brother Robert (who was chief counsel) to investigate crime infiltration of labor unions. In 1958, Kennedy introduced a bill (S. 3974) which became the first major labor relations bill to pass either house since the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. The bill dealt largely with the control of union abuses exposed by the McClellan committee but did not incorporate tough Taft-Hartley amendments requested by President Eisenhower. It survived Senate floor attempts to include Taft-Hartley amendments and gained passage but was rejected by the House.At the 1956 Democratic National Convention, Kennedy gave the nominating speech for the party's presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson II. Stevenson let the convention select the Vice Presidential nominee. Kennedy finished second in the balloting, losing to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee but receiving national exposure as a result.One of the matters demanding Kennedy's attention in the Senate was President Eisenhower's bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Kennedy cast a procedural vote against it, considered by some as an appeasement of Southern Democratic opponents of the bill. Kennedy did vote for Title III of the act, which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin, but Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure. Kennedy also voted for Title IV, termed the \"Jury Trial Amendment\". Many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act. A final compromise bill, which Kennedy supported, was passed in September 1957. He proposed July 2, 1957 that the U.S. support Algeria's effort to gain independence from France. The following year, Kennedy authored A Nation of Immigrants (later published in 1964), which analyzed the importance of immigration in the country's history as well as proposals to re-evaluate immigration law.\n\nIn 1958, Kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the Senate, defeating Republican opponent, Boston lawyer Vincent J. Celeste, by a margin of 874,608 votes, the largest margin in the history of Massachusetts politics. It was during his re-election campaign that Kennedy's press secretary at the time, Robert E. Thompson, put together a film entitled The U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy Story, which exhibited a day in the life of the Senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner workings of his office to solve Massachusetts-related issues. It was the most comprehensive film produced about Kennedy up to that time. In the aftermath of his re-election, Kennedy began preparing to run for president by traveling throughout the U.S. with the aim of building his candidacy for 1960.When it came to conservation, Kennedy, a Massachusetts Audubon Society supporter, wanted to make sure that the shorelines of Cape Cod remained unsullied by future industrialization. On September 3, 1959, Kennedy cosponsored the Cape Cod National Seashore bill with his Republican colleague Senator Leverett Saltonstall.Kennedy's father was a strong supporter and friend of Senator Joseph McCarthy. Additionally, Bobby Kennedy worked for McCarthy's subcommittee, and McCarthy dated Kennedy's sister Patricia. Kennedy told historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., \"Hell, half my voters [particularly Catholics] in Massachusetts look on McCarthy as a hero.\" In 1954, the Senate voted to censure McCarthy, and Kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure. However, it was not delivered because Kennedy was hospitalized at the time. The speech put Kennedy in the apparent position of participating by \"pairing\" his vote against that of another senator and opposing the censure. Although Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged his support among members of the liberal community, including Eleanor Roosevelt, in the 1956 and 1960 elections.\n\n\n== 1960 presidential election ==\n\nOn December 17, 1959, a letter from Kennedy's staff that was to be sent to \"active and influential Democrats\" was leaked stating that he would announce his presidential campaign on January 2, 1960. On January 2, 1960, Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. Though some questioned Kennedy's age and experience, his charisma and eloquence earned him numerous supporters. Many Americans held anti-Catholic attitudes, but Kennedy's vocal support of the separation of church and state helped defuse the situation. His religion also helped him win a devoted following among many Catholic voters. Kennedy faced several potential challengers for the Democratic nomination, including Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson, Adlai Stevenson II, and Senator Hubert Humphrey.Kennedy's presidential campaign was a family affair, funded by his father and with his younger brother Robert, acting as his campaign manager. John preferred Ivy League policy advisors, but unlike his father he enjoyed the give and take of Massachusetts politics and built a largely Irish team of campaigners, headed by Larry O'Brien and Kenneth O'Donnell. Kennedy traveled extensively to build his support among Democratic elites and voters. At the time, party officials controlled most of the delegates, but several states also held primaries, and Kennedy sought to win several primaries to boost his chances of winning the nomination. In his first major test, Kennedy won the Wisconsin primary, effectively ending Humphrey's hopes of winning the presidency. Nonetheless, Kennedy and Humphrey faced each other in a competitive West Virginia primary in which Kennedy could not benefit from a Catholic bloc, as he had in Wisconsin. Kennedy won the West Virginia primary, impressing many in the party, but at the start of the 1960 Democratic National Convention, it was unclear as to whether he would win the nomination.When Kennedy entered the convention, he had the most delegates, but not enough to ensure that he would win the nomination. Stevenson\u2014the 1952 and 1956 presidential nominee\u2014remained very popular in the party, while Johnson also hoped to win the nomination with the support from party leaders. Kennedy's candidacy also faced opposition from former president Harry S. Truman, who was concerned about Kennedy's lack of experience. Kennedy knew that a second ballot could give the nomination to Johnson or someone else, and his well-organized campaign was able to earn the support of just enough delegates to win the presidential nomination on the first ballot.Kennedy ignored the opposition of his brother, who wanted him to choose labor leader Walter Reuther, and other liberal supporters when he chose Johnson as his vice presidential nominee. He believed that the Texas Senator could help him win support from the South. The choice infuriated many in labor. AFL-CIO President George Meany called Johnson \"the arch foe of labor,\" while Illinois AFL-CIO President Reuben Soderstrom asserted Kennedy had \"made chumps out of leaders of the American labor movement.\" In accepting the presidential nomination, Kennedy gave his well-known \"New Frontier\" speech, saying, \"For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won\u2014and we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier. ... But the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises\u2014it is a set of challenges. It sums up not what I intend to offer the American people, but what I intend to ask of them.\"At the start of the fall general election campaign, Republican nominee and incumbent vice president Richard Nixon held a six-point lead in the polls. Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy's Roman Catholicism, the Cuban Revolution, and whether the space and missile programs of the Soviet Union had surpassed those of the U.S. To address fears that his being Catholic would impact his decision-making, he famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960: \"I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters\u2014and the Church does not speak for me.\" Kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Catholic, and once stated that \"[n]o one asked me my religion [serving the Navy] in the South Pacific\".\n\nBetween September and October, Kennedy squared off against Nixon in the first televised presidential debates in U.S. history. During these programs, Nixon had an injured leg, \"five o'clock shadow\", and was perspiring, making him look tense and uncomfortable. Conversely, Kennedy wore makeup and appeared relaxed, which helped the large television audience to view him as the winner. On average radio listeners thought that Nixon had won or that the debates were a draw. The debates are now considered a milestone in American political history\u2014the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics.Kennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first debate, and he pulled slightly ahead of Nixon in most polls. On Election Day, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, by most accounts, Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win). Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma. Kennedy became the youngest person (43) ever elected to the presidency, though Theodore Roosevelt was a year younger at 42 when he automatically assumed the office after the assassination of William McKinley in 1901.\n\n\n== Presidency (1961\u20131963) ==\n\nJohn F. Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on January 20, 1961. In his inaugural address, he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens, famously saying, \"Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.\" He asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the \"common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself\". He added:\n\n\"All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin.\" In closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism: \"Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.\"\nThe address reflected Kennedy's confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs. The contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration.\n\nKennedy brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former-General Eisenhower, and he wasted no time in scrapping Eisenhower's methods. Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. \"We can learn our jobs together\", he stated.Much to the chagrin of his economic advisors, who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the House Rules Committee in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda. The president focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings. Deputy National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and Kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, \"What do you want me to do about that today?\"Kennedy approved Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's controversial decision to award the contract for the F-111 TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental) fighter-bomber to General Dynamics (the choice of the civilian Defense department) over Boeing (the choice of the military). At the request of Senator Henry Jackson, Senator John McClellan held 46 days of mostly closed-door hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations investigating the TFX contract from February to November 1963.During the summer of 1962, Kennedy had a secret taping system set up in the White House, most likely to aid his future memoir. It recorded many conversations with Kennedy and his Cabinet members, including those in relation to the \"Cuban Missile Crisis\".\n\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n\nPresident Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the Cold War. In 1961 he anxiously anticipated a summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. He started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early-1961. The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. His mistake helped raise tensions going into the Vienna summit of June 1961.On the way to the summit, Kennedy stopped in Paris to meet French President Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style. The French president feared the United States' presumed influence in Europe. Nevertheless, de Gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family. Kennedy picked up on this in his speech in Paris, saying that he would be remembered as \"the man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy to Paris\".On June 4, 1961, the president met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence, but thought him weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin. He made it clear that any treaty interfering with U.S. access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.Shortly after the president returned home, the U.S.S.R. announced its plan to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Depressed and angry, Kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.\n\nIn the weeks immediately following the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector, reacting to statements from the U.S.S.R. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where Dean Acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies. In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25 billion (equivalent to $27.81 billion in 2019) to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S. The speech received an 85% approval rating.A month later, both the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Berliners into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city, which were quickly upgraded to the Berlin Wall. Kennedy's initial reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from West to East Berlin continued. This course was altered when West Berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the United States. Kennedy sent Vice President Johnson, along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through West Germany, including Soviet-armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the U.S. to West Berlin.Kennedy gave a speech at Saint Anselm College on May 5, 1960, regarding America's conduct in the emerging Cold War. The address detailed how the American foreign policy should be conducted towards African nations, noting a hint of support for modern African nationalism by saying, \"For we, too, founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule.\"\n\n\n==== Cuba and the Bay of Pigs Invasion ====\n\nThe Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba. Led by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), with help from the U.S. military, the plan was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles led by CIA paramilitary officers. The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban people, hoping to remove Castro from power. Kennedy approved the final invasion plan on April 4, 1961.\nThe Bay of Pigs Invasion began on April 17, 1961. Fifteen hundred U.S.-trained Cubans, dubbed Brigade 2506, landed on the island. No U.S. air support was provided. CIA director Allen Dulles later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action that was needed for success once the troops were on the ground.By April 19, 1961, the Cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles, and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. Twenty months later, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $53 million worth of food and medicine. The incident made Castro feel wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another invasion would take place.Biographer Richard Reeves said that Kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. When it proved unsuccessful, he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad. He took responsibility for the failure, saying, \"We got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it. But maybe we'll learn something from it.\" He appointed Robert Kennedy to help lead a committee to examine the causes of the failure.In late-1961, the White House formed the Special Group (Augmented), headed by Robert Kennedy and including Edward Lansdale, Secretary Robert McNamara, and others. The group's objective\u2014to overthrow Castro via espionage, sabotage, and other covert tactics\u2014was never pursued.\n\n\n==== Cuban Missile Crisis ====\n\nOn October 14, 1962, CIA U-2 spy planes took photographs of the Soviets' construction of intermediate-range ballistic missile sites in Cuba. The photos were shown to Kennedy on October 16; a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat.Kennedy faced a dilemma: if the U.S. attacked the sites, it might lead to nuclear war with the U.S.S.R., but if the U.S. did nothing, it would be faced with the increased threat from close-range nuclear weapons. The U.S. would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere. On a personal level, Kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to Khrushchev, especially after the Vienna summit.More than a third of U.S. National Security Council (NSC) members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites, but for some of them this conjured up an image of \"Pearl Harbor in reverse\". There was also some concern from the international community (asked in confidence), that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that Eisenhower had placed PGM-19 Jupiter missiles in Italy and Turkey in 1958. It also could not be assured that the assault would be 100% effective. In concurrence with a majority-vote of the NSC, Kennedy decided on a naval quarantine. On October 22, he dispatched a message to Khrushchev and announced the decision on TV.The U.S. Navy would stop and inspect all Soviet ships arriving off Cuba, beginning October 24. The Organization of American States gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles. The president exchanged two sets of letters with Khrushchev, to no avail. United Nations (UN) Secretary General U Thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a cooling-off period. Khrushchev agreed, but Kennedy did not.One Soviet-flagged ship was stopped and boarded. On October 28, Khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites, subject to UN inspections. The U.S. publicly promised never to invade Cuba and privately agreed to remove its Jupiter missiles from Italy and Turkey, which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with UGM-27 Polaris missiles.This crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after. It is considered that \"the humanity\" of both Khrushchev and Kennedy prevailed. The crisis improved the image of American willpower and the president's credibility. Kennedy's approval rating increased from 66% to 77% immediately thereafter.\n\n\n==== Latin America and communism ====\n\nBelieving that \"those who make peaceful revolution impossible, will make violent revolution inevitable,\" Kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in Latin America by establishing the Alliance for Progress, which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region. He worked closely with Puerto Rican Governor Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn for the development of the Alliance of Progress, and began working towards Puerto Rico's autonomy.\nThe Eisenhower administration, through the CIA, had begun formulating plans to assassinate Castro in Cuba and Rafael Trujillo in the Dominican Republic. When President Kennedy took office, he privately instructed the CIA that any plan must include plausible deniability by the U.S. His public position was in opposition. In June 1961, the Dominican Republic's leader was assassinated; in the days following, Undersecretary of State Chester Bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation. Robert Kennedy, who saw an opportunity for the U.S., called Bowles \"a gutless bastard\" to his face.\n\n\n==== Peace Corps ====\nIn one of his first presidential acts, Kennedy asked Congress to create the Peace Corps. His brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, was its first director. Through this program, Americans volunteered to help developing nations in fields like education, farming, health care, and construction. The organization grew to 5,000 members by March 1963 and 10,000 the year after. Since 1961, over 200,000 Americans have joined the Peace Corps, representing 139 different countries.\n\n\n==== Southeast Asia ====\n\nAs a U.S. Senator in 1956, Kennedy publicly advocated for greater U.S. involvement in Vietnam. When briefing Kennedy, Eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in Southeast Asia required priority; Eisenhower considered Laos to be \"the cork in the bottle\" regarding the regional threat. In March 1961, Kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a \"free\" Laos to a \"neutral\" Laos, indicating privately that Vietnam, and not Laos, should be deemed America's tripwire for communism's spread in the area. In May, he dispatched Lyndon Johnson to meet with South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem. Johnson assured Diem more aid to mold a fighting force that could resist the communists. Kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with Diem to defeat of communism in South Vietnam.During his presidency, Kennedy continued policies that provided political, economic, and military support to the governments of South Korea and South Vietnam.\nWe have one-million Americans today serving outside the United-States. There's no other country in history that's carried this kind of a burden. Other countries have had forces serving outside their own country, but for conquest. We have two divisions in South-Korea, not to control South-Korea, but to defend it. We have a lot of Americans in South Vietnam. Well, no other country in the world has ever done that since the beginning of the world; Greece, Rome, Napoleon, and all the rest, always had conquest. We have a million men outside, and they try to defend these countries.\nIn late 1961, the Viet Cong began assuming a predominant presence, initially seizing the provincial capital of Phuoc Vinh. Kennedy increased the number of military advisers and special forces in the area, from 11,000 in 1962 to 16,000 by late 1963, but he was reluctant to order a full-scale deployment of troops. A year and three months later on March 8, 1965, his successor, President Lyndon Johnson, committed the first combat troops to Vietnam and greatly escalated U.S. involvement, with forces reaching 184,000 that year and 536,000 in 1968.In late 1961, President Kennedy sent Roger Hilsman, then director of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research, to assess the situation in Vietnam. There, Hilsman met Sir Robert Grainger Ker Thompson, head of the British Advisory Mission to South Vietnam, and the Strategic Hamlet Program was formed. It was approved by Kennedy and South Vietnam President Ngo Dinh Diem. It was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural South Vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from Communist insurgents. It was hoped that these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. By November 1963, the program waned and officially ended in 1964.In early 1962, Kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the National Security Action Memorandum \u2013 \"Subversive Insurgency (War of Liberation)\". \"Operation Ranch Hand\", a large-scale aerial defoliation effort, began on the roadsides of South Vietnam. Depending on which assessment Kennedy accepted (Department of Defense or State), there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded U.S. involvement.\n\nIn April 1963, Kennedy assessed the situation in Vietnam, saying, \"We don't have a prayer of staying in Vietnam. Those people hate us. They are going to throw our asses out of there at any point. But I can't give up that territory to the communists and get the American people to re-elect me.\"On August 21, just as the new U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. arrived, Diem and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu ordered South Vietnam forces, funded and trained by the CIA, to quell Buddhist demonstrations. The crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup d'\u00e9tat to remove Diem with (or perhaps by) his brother, Nhu. Lodge was instructed to try getting Diem and Nhu to step down and leave the country. Diem would not listen to Lodge. Cable 243 (DEPTEL 243) followed, dated August 24, declaring that Washington would no longer tolerate Nhu's actions, and Lodge was ordered to pressure Diem to remove Nhu. Lodge concluded that the only option was to get the South Vietnamese generals to overthrow Diem and Nhu. At week's end, orders were sent to Saigon and throughout Washington to \"destroy all coup cables\". At the same time, the first formal anti-Vietnam war sentiment was expressed by U.S. clergy from the Ministers' Vietnam Committee.A White House meeting in September was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals; the president was given updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the Departments of Defense (General Victor Krulak) and State (Joseph Mendenhall). Krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won, while Mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any U.S. influence. Kennedy reacted, asking, \"Did you two gentlemen visit the same country?\" The president was unaware that both men were at such odds that they had not spoken to each other on the return flight.In October 1963, the president appointed Defense Secretary McNamara and General Maxwell D. Taylor to a Vietnamese mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy. The objective of the McNamara Taylor mission \"emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from U.S. representatives in Vietnam\". In meetings with McNamara, Taylor, and Lodge, Diem again refused to agree to governing measures, helping to dispel McNamara's previous optimism about Diem. Taylor and McNamara were enlightened by Vietnam's vice president, Nguyen Ngoc Tho (choice of many to succeed Diem), who in detailed terms obliterated Taylor's information that the military was succeeding in the countryside. At Kennedy's insistence, the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals: 1,000 by year's end and complete withdrawal in 1965, something the NSC considered to be a \"strategic fantasy\".In late October, intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the Diem government was afoot. The source, Vietnamese General Duong Van Minh (also known as \"Big Minh\"), wanted to know the U.S. position. Kennedy instructed Lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup, excluding assassination. On November 1, 1963, South Vietnamese generals, led by \"Big Minh\", overthrew the Diem government, arresting and then killing Diem and Nhu. Kennedy was shocked by the deaths.News of the coup led to renewed confidence initially\u2014both in America and in South Vietnam\u2014that the war might be won. McGeorge Bundy drafted a National Security Action Memo to present to Kennedy upon his return from Dallas. It reiterated the resolve to fight communism in Vietnam, with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into Laos and Cambodia. Before leaving for Dallas, Kennedy told Michael Forrestal that \"after the first of the year ... [he wanted] an in depth study of every possible option, including how to get out of there ... to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top\". When asked what he thought the president meant, Forrestal said, \"It was devil's advocate stuff.\"\n\nHistorians disagree on whether the Vietnam War would have escalated if Kennedy had not been assassinated and had won re-election in 1964. Fueling the debate were statements made by Secretary of Defense McNamara in the film \"The Fog of War\" that Kennedy was strongly considering pulling the United States out of Vietnam after the 1964 election. The film also contains a tape recording of Lyndon Johnson stating that Kennedy was planning to withdraw, a position in which Johnson disagreed. Kennedy had signed National Security Action Memorandum (NSAM) 263, dated October 11, which ordered the withdrawal of 1,000 military personnel by year's end, and the bulk of them out by 1965. Such an action would have been a policy reversal, but Kennedy was publicly moving in a less hawkish direction since his speech on world peace at American University on June 10, 1963.At the time of Kennedy's death, no final policy decision was made to Vietnam. In 2008 Theodore Sorensen wrote, \"I would like to believe that Kennedy would have found a way to withdraw all American instructors and advisors [from Vietnam]. But ... I do not believe he knew in his last weeks what he was going to do.\" Sorensen added that, in his opinion, Vietnam \"was the only foreign policy problem handed off by JFK to his successor in no better, and possibly worse, shape than it was when he inherited it.\" U.S. involvement in the region escalated until his successor Lyndon Johnson directly deployed regular U.S. military forces for fighting the Vietnam War. After Kennedy's assassination, President Johnson signed NSAM 273 on November 26, 1963. It reversed Kennedy's decision to withdraw 1,000 troops, and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the South Vietnamese.\n\n\n==== American University speech ====\nOn June 10, 1963, Kennedy, at the high point of his rhetorical powers, delivered the commencement address at American University in Washington, D.C. Also known as \"A Strategy of Peace\", not only did the President outline a plan to curb nuclear arms, but he also \"laid out a hopeful, yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the U.S. and Soviet Union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race.\" The President wished:\n\nto discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived\u2014yet it is the most important topic on earth: world peace ... I speak of peace because of the new face of war ... in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the Second World War ... an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn ... I speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary rational end of rational men ... world peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor\u2014it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance ... our problems are man-made\u2014therefore they can be solved by man. And man can be as big as he wants.\nThe president also made two announcements: 1.) that the Soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, and 2.) that the U.S. had postponed planned atmospheric tests.\n\n\n==== West Berlin speech ====\n\nIn 1963, Germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to Soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of West German Chancellor Adenauer. At the same time, French President Charles de Gaulle was trying to build a Franco-West German counterweight to the American and Soviet spheres of influence. To Kennedy's eyes, this Franco-German cooperation seemed directed against NATO's influence in Europe.On June 26, President Kennedy gave a public speech in West Berlin. He reiterated the American commitment to Germany and criticized communism, and was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience. Kennedy used the construction of the Berlin Wall as an example of the failures of communism: \"Freedom has many difficulties, and democracy is not perfect. But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in, to prevent them from leaving us.\" The speech is known for its famous phrase \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" (\"I am a citizen of Berlin\"). A million people were on the street for the speech. Kennedy remarked to Ted Sorensen afterwards: \"We'll never have another day like this one, as long as we live.\"\n\n\n==== Israel ====\nIn 1960, Kennedy stated, \"Israel will endure and flourish. It is the child of hope and the home of the brave. It can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success. It carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom.\"As president, Kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with Israel, and he is credited as the founder of the US-Israeli military alliance, which would be continued under subsequent presidents. Kennedy ended the arms embargo that the Eisenhower and Truman administrations had enforced on Israel. Describing the protection of Israel as a moral and national commitment, he was the first to introduce the concept of a \"special relationship\" (as he described it to Golda Meir) between the US and Israel.\n\nKennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to Israel in 1962 and, beginning in 1963, was the first US president to allow the sale to Israel of advanced US weaponry (the MIM-23 Hawk) as well as to provide diplomatic support for Israeli policies, which were opposed by Arab neighbors; those policies included Israel's water project on the Jordan River.As a result of this newly created security alliance, Kennedy also encountered tensions with the Israeli government over the production of nuclear materials in Dimona, which he believed could instigate a nuclear arms-race in the Middle East. After the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the Israeli government, David Ben-Gurion stated in a speech to the Israeli Knesset on December 21, 1960, that the purpose of the nuclear plant at Beersheba was for \"research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna\". When Ben-Gurion met with Kennedy in New York, he claimed that Dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes \"for the time being\".In 1963 the Kennedy administration was engaged in a now declassified diplomatic standoff with the Israel. In a May 1963 letter to Ben-Gurion, Kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated that American support to Israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the Israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming, Ben-Gurion repeated previous reassurances that Dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes. The Israeli government resisted American pressure to open its nuclear facilities to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections. In 1962 the US and Israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime. A science attach\u00e9 at the embassy in Tel Aviv concluded that parts of the Dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead American scientists when they visited.According to Seymour Hersh, the Israelis set up false control rooms to show the Americans. Israeli lobbyist Abe Feinberg stated: \"It was part of my job to tip them off that Kennedy was insisting on [an inspection].\" Hersh contends that the inspections were conducted in such a way that it \"guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash, as the president and his senior advisors had to understand: the American inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance, and with the full acquiescence of Israel.\" Marc Trachtenberg argued that \"[a]lthough [he was] well aware of what the Israelis were doing, Kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of Israeli compliance with America's non-proliferation policy.\" The American who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find \"ways to not reach the point of taking action against Israel's nuclear weapons program\".Rodger Davies, the director of the State Department's Office of Near Eastern Affairs, concluded in March 1965 that Israel was developing nuclear weapons. He reported that Israel's target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968\u20131969. On May 1, 1968, Undersecretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach told President Johnson that Dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year. The State Department argued that if Israel wanted arms, it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program. Dimona was never placed under IAEA safeguards. Attempts to write Israeli adherence to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) into contracts for the supply of U.S. weapons continued throughout 1968.\n\n\n==== Iraq ====\n\nRelations between the United States and Iraq became strained following the overthrow of the Iraqi monarchy on July 14, 1958, which resulted in the declaration of a republican government led by Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim. On June 25, 1961, Qasim mobilized troops along the border between Iraq and Kuwait, declaring the latter nation \"an indivisible part of Iraq\" and causing a short-lived \"Kuwait Crisis\". The United Kingdom\u2014which had just granted Kuwait independence on June 19, and whose economy was dependent on Kuwaiti oil\u2014responded on July 1 by dispatching 5,000 troops to the country to deter an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, Kennedy dispatched a U.S. Navy task force to Bahrain, and the UK, at the urging of the Kennedy administration, brought the dispute to United Nations Security Council, where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The situation was resolved in October, when the British troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4,000-strong Arab League force, which acted as a barrier against the Iraqi threat.In December 1961, Qasim's government passed Public Law 80, which restricted the partially American-controlled Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC)'s concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced, effectively expropriating 99.5% of the IPC concession. U.S. officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent Soviet veto of an Egyptian-sponsored UN resolution requesting the admittance of Kuwait as UN member state, which they believed were connected. Senior National Security Council adviser Robert Komer worried that if the IPC ceased production in response, Qasim might \"grab Kuwait\" (thus achieving a \"stranglehold\" on Middle Eastern oil production) or \"throw himself into Russian arms\". Komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against Qasim could be imminent, and had the potential to \"get Iraq back on [a] more neutral keel\".In April 1962, the State Department issued new guidelines on Iraq that were intended to increase American influence there. Meanwhile, Kennedy instructed the CIA\u2014under the direction of Archibald Bulloch Roosevelt Jr.\u2014to begin making preparations for a military coup against Qasim.The anti-imperialist and anti-communist Iraqi Ba'ath Party overthrew and executed Qasim in a violent coup on February 8, 1963. While there have been persistent rumors that the CIA orchestrated the coup, declassified documents and the testimony of former CIA officers indicate that there was no direct American involvement, although the CIA was actively seeking a suitable replacement for Qasim within the Iraqi military and had been informed of an earlier Ba'athist coup plot. The Kennedy administration was pleased with the outcome and ultimately approved a $55-million arms deal for Iraq.\n\n\n==== Ireland ====\n\nDuring his four-day visit to his ancestral home of Ireland in June 1963, Kennedy accepted a grant of armorial bearings from the Chief Herald of Ireland and received honorary degrees from the National University of Ireland and Trinity College, Dublin. He visited the cottage at Dunganstown, near New Ross, County Wexford, where his ancestors had lived before emigrating to America.Kennedy also was the first foreign leader to address the Houses of the Oireachtas (the Irish parliament). On December 22, 2006, the Irish Department of Justice released declassified police documents indicating that security was heightened as Kennedy was the subject of three death threats during this visit.\n\n\n==== Nuclear Test Ban Treaty ====\n\nTroubled by the long-term dangers of radioactive contamination and nuclear weapons proliferation, Kennedy and Khrushchev agreed to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty, originally conceived in Adlai Stevenson's 1956 presidential campaign. In their Vienna summit meeting in June 1961, Khrushchev and Kennedy both reached an informal understanding against nuclear testing, but the Soviet Union began testing nuclear weapons that September. In response, the United States conducted tests five days later. Shortly afterwards, new U.S. satellites began delivering images which made it clear that the Soviets were substantially behind the U.S. in the arms race. Nevertheless, the greater nuclear strength of the U.S. was of little value as long as the U.S.S.R. perceived itself to be at parity.In July 1963, Kennedy sent W. Averell Harriman to Moscow to negotiate a treaty with the Soviets. The introductory sessions included Khrushchev, who later delegated Soviet representation to Andrei Gromyko. It quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented, due largely to the reluctance of the Soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance.Ultimately, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were the initial signatories to a limited treaty, which prohibited atomic testing on the ground, in the atmosphere, or underwater, but not underground. The U.S. Senate ratified this and Kennedy signed it into law in October 1963. France was quick to declare that it was free to continue developing and testing its nuclear defenses.\n\n\n=== Domestic policy ===\n\nKennedy called his domestic program the \"New Frontier\". It ambitiously promised federal funding for education, medical care for the elderly, economic aid to rural regions, and government intervention to halt the recession. He also promised an end to racial discrimination, although his agenda, which included the endorsement of the Voter Education Project (VEP) in 1962, produced little progress in areas such as Mississippi, where the \"VEP concluded that discrimination was so entrenched\".In his 1963 State of the Union address, he proposed substantial tax reform and a reduction in income tax rates from the current range of 20\u201390% to a range of 14\u201365% as well as a reduction in the corporate tax rates from 52 to 47%. Kennedy added that the top rate should be set at 70% if certain deductions were not eliminated for high-income earners. Congress did not act until 1964, a year after his death, when the top individual rate was lowered to 70%, and the top corporate rate was set at 48%.To the Economic Club of New York, he spoke in 1963 of \"... the paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high and revenues too low; and the soundest way to raise revenue in the long term is to lower rates now.\" Congress passed few of Kennedy's major programs during his lifetime, but did vote them through in 1964 and 1965 under his successor Johnson.\n\n\n==== Economy ====\n\nKennedy ended a period of tight fiscal policies, loosening monetary policy to keep interest rates down and to encourage growth of the economy. He presided over the first government budget to top the $100 billion mark, in 1962, and his first budget in 1961 resulted in the nation's first non-war, non-recession deficit. The economy, which had been through two recessions in three years and was in one when Kennedy took office, accelerated notably throughout his administration. Despite low inflation and interest rates, the GDP had grown by an average of only 2.2% per annum during the Eisenhower administration (scarcely more than population growth at the time), and it had declined by 1% during Eisenhower's last twelve months in office.The economy turned around and prospered during Kennedy's years as president. The GDP expanded by an average of 5.5% from early-1961 to late-1963, while inflation remained steady at around 1% and unemployment eased. Industrial production rose by 15% and motor vehicle sales increased by 40%. This rate of growth in GDP and industry continued until 1969, and has yet to be repeated for such a sustained period of time.Attorney General Robert Kennedy took the position that steel executives had illegally colluded to fix prices. He stated, \"We're going for broke. [...] their expense accounts, where they've been and what they've been doing. [...] the FBI is to interview them all. [...] we can't lose this.\" The administration's actions influenced U.S. Steel to rescind the price increase. The Wall Street Journal wrote that the administration had acted \"by naked power, by threats, [and] by agents of the state security police\". Yale law professor Charles Reich opined in The New Republic that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict U.S. Steel for collusion so quickly. An editorial in The New York Times praised Kennedy's actions and said that the steel industry's price increase \"imperil[ed] the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation\". Nevertheless, the administration's Bureau of Budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the GDP as well as a net budget surplus. The stock market, which had steadily declined since Kennedy's election in 1960, dropped 10% shortly after the administration's action on the steel industry took place.\n\n\n==== Federal and military death penalty ====\nDuring his administration, Kennedy oversaw the last federal execution prior to Furman v. Georgia, a 1972 case that led to a moratorium on federal executions. Victor Feguer was sentenced to death by an Iowa federal court and was executed on March 15, 1963. Kennedy commuted a death sentence imposed by a military court on seaman Jimmie Henderson on February 12, 1962, changing the penalty to life in prison.On March 22, 1962, Kennedy signed into law HR5143 (PL87-423), which abolished the mandatory death penalty for first degree murder suspects in the District of Columbia, the only remaining jurisdiction in the United States with such a penalty. The death penalty has not been applied in the District of Columbia since 1957 and has now been abolished.\n\n\n==== Civil Rights Movement ====\n\nThe turbulent end of state-sanctioned racial discrimination was one of the most pressing domestic issues of the 1960s. Jim Crow segregation was the established law in the Deep South. The U.S. Supreme Court had ruled in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education that racial segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Many schools, especially those in southern states, did not obey the Supreme Court's decision. The Court also prohibited segregation at other public facilities (such as buses, restaurants, theaters, courtrooms, bathrooms, and beaches) but it continued nonetheless.Kennedy verbally supported racial integration and civil rights; during his 1960 presidential campaign, he telephoned Coretta Scott King, wife of the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr., who had been jailed while trying to integrate a department store lunch counter. Robert Kennedy called Georgia governor Ernest Vandiver and obtained King's release from prison, which drew additional black support to his brother's candidacy. Upon taking office in 1961, Kennedy postponed promised civil rights legislation he made while campaigning in 1960, recognizing that conservative Southern Democrats controlled congressional legislation. Historian Carl M. Brauer concluded that passing any civil rights legislation in 1961 would have been futile. During his first year in office, Kennedy appointed many blacks to office including his May appointment of civil rights attorney Thurgood Marshall to the federal bench. In his first State of the Union Address in January 1961, President Kennedy said, \"The denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow Americans on account of race\u2014at the ballot box and elsewhere\u2014disturbs the national conscience, and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage.\" Kennedy believed the grassroots movement for civil rights would anger many Southern whites and make it more difficult to pass civil rights laws in Congress, including anti-poverty legislation, and he distanced himself from it.Kennedy was concerned with other issues in the early part of his administration, such as the Cold War, Bay of Pigs fiasco, and the situation in Southeast Asia. As articulated by his brother Robert, the administration's early priority was to \"keep the president out of this civil rights mess\". Civil rights movement participants, mainly those on the front line in the South, viewed Kennedy as lukewarm,  especially concerning the Freedom Riders, who organized an integrated public transportation effort in the south, and who were repeatedly met with white mob violence, including by law enforcement officers, both federal and state. Kennedy assigned federal marshals to protect the Freedom Riders rather than using federal troops or uncooperative FBI agents. Robert Kennedy, speaking for the president, urged the Freedom Riders to \"get off the buses and leave the matter to peaceful settlement in the courts\". Kennedy feared sending federal troops would stir up \"hated memories of Reconstruction\" after the Civil War among conservative Southern whites.On March 6, 1961, Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, which required government contractors to \"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin\". It established the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity. Displeased with Kennedy's pace addressing the issue of segregation, Martin Luther King Jr. and his associates produced a document in 1962 calling on the president to follow in the footsteps of Abraham Lincoln and use an Executive Order to deliver a blow for Civil Rights as a kind of Second Emancipation Proclamation. Kennedy did not execute the order.In September 1962, James Meredith enrolled at the University of Mississippi but was prevented from entering. In response to that, Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent 127 U.S. Marshals and 316 U.S. Border Patrol and 97 Federal correctional officers who were deputized as marshals. The Ole Miss riot of 1962 left two civilians dead and 300 people injured, prompting President Kennedy to send in 3,000 troops to quell the riot. Meredith did finally enroll for class, and Kennedy regretted not sending in troops earlier. Kennedy began doubting as to whether the \"evils of Reconstruction\" of the 1860s and 1870s he had been taught or believed in were true. The instigating subculture during the Ole Miss riot, and many other racially ignited events, was the Ku Klux Klan. On November 20, 1962, Kennedy signed Executive Order 11063, which prohibited racial discrimination in federally supported housing or \"related facilities\".Both the President and the Attorney General were concerned about King's ties to suspected Communists Jack O'Dell and Stanley Levison. After the President and his civil rights expert Harris Wofford pressed King to ask both men to resign from the SCLC, King agreed to ask only O'Dell to resign from the organization and allowed Levison, whom he regarded as a trusted advisor, to remain.In early 1963, Kennedy related to Martin Luther King Jr. his thoughts on the prospects for civil rights legislation: \"If we get into a long fight over this in Congress, it will bottleneck everything else, and we will still get no bill.\" Civil rights clashes were on the rise that year. His brother Robert and Ted Sorensen pressed Kennedy to take more initiative on the legislative front.\n\nOn June 11, 1963, President Kennedy intervened when Alabama Governor George Wallace blocked the doorway to the University of Alabama to stop two African American students, Vivian Malone and James Hood, from attending. Wallace moved aside only after being confronted by Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and the Alabama U.S. National Guard, which had just been federalized by order of the president. That evening Kennedy gave his famous Report to the American People on Civil Rights on national television and radio, launching his initiative for civil rights legislation\u2014to provide equal access to public schools and other facilities, and greater protection of voting rights.His proposals became part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The day ended with the murder of a NAACP leader, Medgar Evers, in front of his home in Mississippi. As the president had predicted, the day after his TV speech, and in reaction to it, House Majority leader Carl Albert called to advise him that his two-year signature effort in Congress to combat poverty in Appalachia (Area Redevelopment Administration) had been defeated, primarily by the votes of Southern Democrats and Republicans. When Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. complimented Kennedy on his remarks, Kennedy bitterly replied, \"Yes, and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the House.\" He then added, \"But of course, I had to give that speech, and I'm glad that I did.\" On June 16, The New York Times published an editorial which argued that while the president had initially \"moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment\" in regards to civil rights he \"now demonstrate[d] a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life\".Earlier, Kennedy had signed the executive order creating the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women on December 14, 1961. Former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt led the commission. The Commission statistics revealed that women were also experiencing discrimination; its final report, documenting legal and cultural barriers, was issued in October 1963. Further, on June 10, 1963, Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which amended the Fair Labor Standards Act and abolished wage disparity based on sex.\n\nOver a hundred thousand, predominantly African Americans gathered in Washington for the civil rights March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963. Kennedy feared the March would have a negative effect on the prospects for the civil rights bills in Congress, and declined an invitation to speak. He turned over some of the details of the government's involvement to the Dept. of Justice, which channelled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the six sponsors of the March, including the N.A.A.C.P. and Martin Luther King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).To ensure a peaceful demonstration, the organizers and the president personally edited speeches which were inflammatory and agreed the March would be held on a Wednesday and would be over at 4:00 pm. Thousands of troops were placed on standby. Kennedy watched King's speech on TV and was very impressed. The March was considered a \"triumph of managed protest\", and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred. Afterwards, the March leaders accepted an invitation to the White House to meet with Kennedy and photos were taken. Kennedy felt that the March was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill.Nevertheless, the struggle was far from over. Three weeks later on Sunday, September 15, a bomb exploded at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham; by the end of the day, four African American children had died in the explosion, and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath. Due to this resurgent violence, the civil rights legislation underwent some drastic amendments that critically endangered any prospects for passage of the bill, to the outrage of the president. Kennedy called the congressional leaders to the White House and by the following day the original bill, without the additions, had enough votes to get it out of the House committee. Gaining Republican support, Senator Everett Dirksen promised the legislation would be brought to a vote preventing a Senate filibuster. The legislation was enacted by Kennedy's successor President Lyndon B. Johnson, prompted by Kennedy's memory, after his assassination in November, enforcing voting rights, public accommodations, employment, education, and the administration of justice.\n\n\n==== Civil liberties ====\nIn February 1962, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who was suspicious of civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker, presented the Kennedy Administration with allegations that some of King's close confidants and advisers were communists. Concerned by these allegations, the FBI deployed agents to monitor King in the following months. Robert Kennedy and the president also both warned King to discontinue the suspect associations. After the associations continued, Robert Kennedy issued a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, King's civil rights organization, in October 1963.Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones \"on a trial basis, for a month or so\", Hoover extended the clearance so his men were \"unshackled\" to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy. The wiretapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968.\n\n\n==== Immigration ====\nDuring the 1960 campaign, Kennedy proposed an overhaul of American immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin. He saw this proposal as an extension of his planned civil rights agenda as president. These reforms later became law through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, which dramatically shifted the source of immigration from Northern and Western European countries towards immigration from Latin America and Asia. The policy change also shifted the emphasis in the selection of immigrants in favor of family reunification. The late-president's brother, Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts helped steer the legislation through the Senate.\n\n\n==== Native American relations ====\n\nConstruction of the Kinzua Dam flooded 10,000 acres (4,000 hectares) of Seneca nation land that they had occupied under the Treaty of 1794, and forced 600 Seneca to relocate to Salamanca, New York. Kennedy was asked by the American Civil Liberties Union to intervene and to halt the project, but he declined, citing a critical need for flood control. He expressed concern about the plight of the Seneca, and directed government agencies to assist in obtaining more land, damages, and assistance to help mitigate their displacement.\n\n\n==== Space policy ====\n\nThe Apollo program was conceived early in 1960, during the Eisenhower administration, as a follow-up to Project Mercury, to be used as a shuttle to an Earth-orbital space station, flights around the Moon, or landing on it. While NASA went ahead with planning for Apollo, funding for the program was far from certain, given Eisenhower's ambivalent attitude to manned spaceflight. As senator, Kennedy had been opposed to the space program and wanted to terminate it.In constructing his presidential administration, Kennedy elected to retain Eisenhower's last science advisor Jerome Wiesner as head of the President's Science Advisory Committee. Wiesner was strongly opposed to manned space exploration, having issued a report highly critical of Project Mercury. Kennedy was turned down by seventeen candidates for NASA administrator before the post was accepted by James E. Webb, an experienced Washington insider who served President Truman as budget director and undersecretary of state. Webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of Congress, the President, and the American people. Kennedy also persuaded Congress to amend the National Aeronautics and Space Act to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the National Aeronautics and Space Council to the Vice President,\n both because of the knowledge of the space program Johnson gained in the Senate working for the creation of NASA, and to help keep the politically savvy Johnson occupied.\n\nIn Kennedy's January 1961 State of the Union address, he had suggested international cooperation in space. Khrushchev declined, as the Soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities. Early in his presidency, Kennedy was poised to dismantle the manned space program but postponed any decision out of deference to Johnson, who had been a strong supporter of the space program in the Senate. Kennedy's advisors speculated that a Moon flight would be prohibitively expensive, and he was considering plans to dismantle the Apollo program due to its cost.However, this quickly changed on April 12, 1961, when Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to fly in space, reinforcing American fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the Soviet Union. Kennedy now became eager for the U.S. to take the lead in the Space Race, for reasons of national security and prestige. On April 20, he sent a memo to Johnson, asking him to look into the status of America's space program, and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up. After consulting with Wernher von Braun, Johnson responded approximately one week later, concluding that \"we are neither making maximum effort nor achieving results necessary if this country is to reach a position of leadership\". His memo concluded that a manned Moon landing was far enough in the future that it was likely the United States would achieve it first. Kennedy's advisor Ted Sorensen advised him to support the Moon landing, and on May 25, Kennedy announced the goal in a speech titled \"Special Message to the Congress on Urgent National Needs\":\n\n... I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. Full text \n\nAfter Congress authorized the funding, Webb began reorganizing NASA, increasing its staffing level, and building two new centers: a Launch Operations Center for the large Moon rocket northwest of Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and a Manned Spacecraft Center on land donated through Rice University in Houston. Kennedy took the latter occasion as an opportunity to deliver another speech at Rice to promote the space effort on September 12, 1962, in which he said:\n\n No nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for space. ... We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Full text \nOn November 21, 1962, in a cabinet meeting with NASA administrator Webb and other officials, Kennedy explained that the Moon shot was important for reasons of international prestige, and that the expense was justified. Johnson assured him that lessons learned from the space program had military value as well. Costs for the Apollo program were expected to reach $40 billion (equivalent to $338.09 billion in 2019).In a September 1963 speech before the United Nations, Kennedy urged cooperation between the Soviets and Americans in space, specifically recommending that Apollo be switched to \"a joint expedition to the Moon\". Khrushchev again declined, and the Soviets did not commit to a manned Moon mission until 1964. On July 20, 1969, almost six years after Kennedy's death, Apollo 11 landed the first manned spacecraft on the Moon.\n\n\n=== Administration, Cabinet, and judicial appointments ===\n\n\n==== Judicial appointments ====\n\n\n===== Supreme Court =====\n\nKennedy appointed the following Justices to the Supreme Court of the United States:\n\nByron White \u2013 1962\nArthur Goldberg \u2013 1962\n\n\n===== Other courts =====\n\nIn addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Kennedy appointed 21 judges to the United States Courts of Appeals, and 102 judges to the United States district courts.\n\n\n== Assassination ==\n\nPresident Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas at 12:30 pm Central Standard Time on Friday, November 22, 1963. He was in Texas on a political trip to smooth over frictions in the Democratic Party between liberals Ralph Yarborough and Don Yarborough (no relation) and conservative John Connally. Traveling in a presidential motorcade through downtown Dallas, he was shot once in the back, the bullet exiting via his throat, and once in the head.Kennedy was taken to Parkland Hospital for emergency medical treatment, where he was pronounced dead 30 minutes later. He was 46 years old and had been in office for 1,036 days. Lee Harvey Oswald, an order filler at the Texas School Book Depository from which the shots were fired, was arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit and was subsequently charged with Kennedy's assassination. He denied shooting anyone, claiming he was a patsy, and was shot by Jack Ruby on November 24, before he could be prosecuted. Ruby was arrested and convicted for the murder of Oswald. Ruby successfully appealed his conviction and death sentence but became ill and died of cancer on January 3, 1967, while the date for his new trial was being set.\nPresident Johnson quickly issued an executive order to create the Warren Commission\u2014chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2014to investigate the assassination. The commission concluded that Oswald acted alone in killing Kennedy and that Oswald was not part of any conspiracy. The results of this investigation are disputed by many. The assassination proved to be a pivotal moment in U.S. history because of its impact on the nation, and the ensuing political repercussions. A 2004 Fox News poll found that 66% of Americans thought there had been a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy, while 74% thought that there had been a cover-up. A Gallup Poll in November 2013 showed 61% believed in a conspiracy, and only 30% thought that Oswald did it alone. In 1979 the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that it believed \"that Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy. The committee was unable to identify the other gunmen or the extent of the conspiracy.\" In 2002 historian Carl M. Brauer concluded that the public's \"fascination with the assassination may indicate a psychological denial of Kennedy's death, a mass wish ... to undo it\".\n\n\n=== Funeral ===\n\nA Requiem Mass was celebrated for Kennedy at the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle on November 25, 1963. Afterwards, Kennedy was interred in a small plot, 20 by 30 ft., in Arlington National Cemetery. Over a period of three years (1964\u20131966), an estimated 16 million people visited his grave. On March 14, 1967, Kennedy's remains were disinterred and moved only a few feet away to a permanent burial plot and memorial. It was from this memorial that the graves of both Robert and Ted Kennedy were modeled.\nThe honor guard at Kennedy's graveside was the 37th Cadet Class of the Irish Army. Kennedy was greatly impressed by the Irish Cadets on his last official visit to Ireland, so much so that Jacqueline Kennedy requested the Irish Army to be the honor guard at her husband's funeral.Jacqueline and their two deceased minor children were later interred in the same plot. Kennedy's brother Robert was buried nearby in June 1968. In August 2009, Ted was also buried near his two brothers. John F. Kennedy's grave is lit with an \"Eternal Flame\". Kennedy and William Howard Taft are the only two U.S. presidents buried at Arlington. According to the JFK Library, \"I Have a Rendezvous with Death\", by Alan Seeger \"was one of John F. Kennedy's favorite poems and he often asked his wife to recite it\".\n\n\n== Personal life, family, and reputation ==\n\nThe Kennedy family is one of the most established political families in the United States, having produced a president, three senators, three ambassadors, and multiple other representatives and politicians, both at the federal and state level. While a Congressman, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week trip to India, Japan, Vietnam, and Israel in 1951, at which point he became close with his then 25-year-old brother Bobby, as well as his 27-year-old sister Pat. Because they were several years apart in age, the brothers had previously seen little of each other. This 25,000-mile (40,000 km) trip was the first extended time they had spent together and resulted in their becoming best friends. Bobby would eventually play a major role in his brother's career, serving as his brother's Attorney General and presidential advisor. Bobby would later run for president in 1968 before his assassination, while another Kennedy brother, Ted, ran for president in 1980.\nKennedy came in third (behind Martin Luther King Jr. and Mother Teresa) in Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century. Kennedy was a life member of the National Rifle Association.\n\n\n=== Wife and children ===\nKennedy met his future wife, Jacqueline Lee \"Jackie\" Bouvier (1929\u20131994), when he was a congressman. Charles L. Bartlett, a journalist, introduced the pair at a dinner party. They were married a year after he was elected senator, on September 12, 1953. After suffering a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956 (their daughter Arabella), their daughter Caroline was born in 1957 and is the only surviving member of JFK's immediate family. John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr., nicknamed \"John-John\" by the press as a child, was born in late November 1960, 17 days after his father was elected. John Jr., a graduate of Brown University, died in 1999 when the small plane he was piloting crashed en route to Martha's Vineyard. In 1963, months before JFK's assassination, Jackie gave birth to a son, Patrick. However, he died after 2 days due to complications from birth.\n\n\n=== Popular image ===\nKennedy and his wife were younger in comparison to the presidents and first ladies who preceded them, and both were popular in the media culture in ways more common to pop singers and movie stars than politicians, influencing fashion trends and becoming the subjects of numerous photo spreads in popular magazines. Although Eisenhower had allowed presidential press conferences to be filmed for television, Kennedy was the first president to ask for them to be broadcast live and made good use of the medium. In 1961 the Radio-Television News Directors Association presented Kennedy with its highest honor, the Paul White Award, in recognition of his open relationship with the media.Mrs. Kennedy brought new art and furniture to the White House, and directed its restoration. They invited a range of artists, writers and intellectuals to rounds of White House dinners, raising the profile of the arts in America. On the White House lawn, the Kennedys established a swimming pool and tree house, while Caroline attended a preschool along with 10 other children inside the home.\nThe president was closely tied to popular culture, emphasized by songs such as \"Twisting at the White House\". Vaughn Meader's First Family comedy album, which parodied the president, the first lady, their family, and the administration, sold about four million copies. On May 19, 1962, Marilyn Monroe sang \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" at a large party in Madison Square Garden, celebrating Kennedy's upcoming forty-fifth birthday.\n\n\n=== \"Camelot Era\" ===\nThe term \"Camelot\" came to be used retrospectively as iconic of the Kennedy administration, and the charisma of Kennedy and his family. The term was first publicly used by his wife in a post-assassination Life magazine interview with Theodore H. White, in which she revealed his affection for the contemporary Broadway musical of the same name, particularly the closing lines of the title song:\nDon't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief, shining moment that was known as Camelot.\nThere'll be great presidents again ... but there will never be another Camelot.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nDespite a privileged youth, Kennedy was plagued by a series of childhood diseases including whooping cough, chicken pox, measles, and ear infections. These ailments compelled JFK to spend a considerable amount of time in bed (or at least indoors) convalescing. Three months prior to his third birthday, in 1920, Kennedy came down with scarlet fever, a highly contagious and life-threatening disease, and was admitted to Boston City Hospital.In 2002, Robert Dallek wrote an extensive history of Kennedy's health. Dallek was able to consult a collection of Kennedy-associated papers from the years 1955\u20131963, including X-rays and prescription records from the files of White House physician Dr. Janet Travell. According to Travell's records, during his presidential years Kennedy suffered from high fevers; stomach, colon, and prostate issues; abscesses; high cholesterol; and adrenal problems. Travell kept a \"Medicine Administration Record,\" cataloguing Kennedy's medications: \"injected and ingested corticosteroids for his adrenal insufficiency; procaine shots and ultrasound treatments and hot packs for his back; Lomotil, Metamucil, paregoric, phenobarbital, testosterone, and trasentine to control his diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and weight loss; penicillin and other antibiotics for his urinary-tract infections and an abscess; and Tuinal to help him sleep.\"Years after Kennedy's death, it was revealed that in September 1947, while Kennedy was 30 and in his first term in Congress, he was diagnosed by Sir Daniel Davis at The London Clinic with Addison's disease, a rare endocrine disorder. Davis estimated that Kennedy would not live for another year, while Kennedy himself hoped he could live for an additional ten. In 1966, Dr. Travell revealed that Kennedy also had hypothyroidism. The presence of two endocrine diseases raises the possibility that Kennedy had autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 2 (APS 2).Kennedy also suffered from chronic and severe back pain, for which he had surgery and was written up in the American Medical Association's Archives of Surgery. Kennedy's condition may have had diplomatic repercussions, as he appears to have been taking a combination of drugs to treat severe back pain during the 1961 Vienna Summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. The combination included hormones, animal organ cells, steroids, vitamins, enzymes, and amphetamines, and possible potential side effects included hyperactivity, hypertension, impaired judgment, nervousness, and mood swings. Kennedy at one time was regularly seen by no fewer than three doctors, one of whom, Max Jacobson, was unknown to the other two, as his mode of treatment was controversial and used for the most severe bouts of back pain.Into late 1961, disagreements existed among Kennedy's doctors concerning his proper balance of medication and exercise. The president preferred the former, because he was short on time and desired immediate relief. During that time, the president's physician, George Burkley, did set up some gym equipment in the White House basement, where Kennedy did stretching exercises for his back three times a week. Details of these and other medical problems were not publicly disclosed during Kennedy's lifetime. The President's primary White House physician, George Burkley, realized that treatments by Jacobson and Travell, including the excessive use of steroids and amphetamines, were medically inappropriate, and took effective action to remove the president from their care. Dr. Nassir Ghaemi, a physician who reviewed Kennedy's medical records in his presidential archives, has opined that Kennedy's leadership (e.g. the 1962 Cuban Missile crisis and other events during 1963) improved greatly once the treatments of Jacobson had been discontinued and been replaced by a medically appropriate regimen under Burkley. Ghaemi concluded there was a \"correlation; it is not causation; but it may not be coincidence either\".\n\n\n=== Personal tragedies ===\n\nKennedy and his family have experienced a number of personal tragedies. His older brother Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. was killed in action in 1944 at age 29, when his plane exploded over the English Channel during a first attack execution of Operation Aphrodite during World War II. Kennedy's younger sister Rose Marie \"Rosemary\" Kennedy was born in 1918 with intellectual disabilities and underwent a prefrontal lobotomy at age 23, leaving her incapacitated for the rest of her life, until her death in 2005. His younger sister Kathleen Agnes \"Kick\" Kennedy died in a plane crash en route to France in 1948. His wife Jacqueline Kennedy suffered a miscarriage in 1955 and a stillbirth in 1956: a daughter informally named Arabella. A son, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, died two days after birth in August 1963.\n\n\n=== Affairs, extramarital relationships and friendships ===\n\nKennedy was single in the 1940s when he had affairs with Danish journalist Inga Arvad and actress Gene Tierney. Before and after he assumed the presidency, Kennedy reportedly had affairs with a number of women, including Marilyn Monroe, Gunilla von Post, Judith Campbell, Mary Pinchot Meyer, Marlene Dietrich, Mimi Alford, and his wife's press secretary, Pamela Turnure.The extent of Kennedy's relationship with Monroe is not fully known, although it has been reported that they spent a weekend together in March 1962 while he was staying at Bing Crosby's house. Furthermore, people at the White House switchboard noted that Monroe had called Kennedy during 1962. J. Edgar Hoover, the FBI director, received reports about Kennedy's indiscretions.Kennedy inspired affection and loyalty from the members of his team and his supporters. According to Reeves, this included \"the logistics of Kennedy's liaisons ... [which] required secrecy and devotion rare in the annals of the energetic service demanded by successful politicians.\" Kennedy believed that his friendly relationship with members of the press would help protect him from public revelations about his sex life.Lem Billings was a close and long-time friend of Kennedy and the Kennedy family. Billings had his own room in which to stay at several of John F. Kennedy's residences. Though there has never been any proof of homosexual activity between them, Kennedy would often, and even when married, share a bedroom with his lifelong friend.\n\n\n== Historical evaluations and legacy ==\n\nThe US Special Forces had a special bond with Kennedy. \"It was President Kennedy who was responsible for the rebuilding of the Special Forces and giving us back our Green Beret,\" said Forrest Lindley, a writer for the US military newspaper Stars and Stripes who served with Special Forces in Vietnam. This bond was shown at Kennedy's funeral. At the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Kennedy's death, General Michael D. Healy, the last commander of Special Forces in Vietnam, spoke at Arlington Cemetery. Later, a wreath in the form of the Green Beret would be placed on the grave, continuing a tradition that began the day of his funeral when a sergeant in charge of a detail of Special Forces men guarding the grave placed his beret on the coffin. Kennedy was the first of six presidents to have served in the U.S. Navy, and one of the enduring legacies of his administration was the creation in 1961 of another special forces command, the Navy SEALs, which Kennedy enthusiastically supported.Kennedy's civil rights proposals led to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. President Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's successor, took up the mantle and pushed the landmark Civil Rights Act through a bitterly divided Congress by invoking the slain president's memory. President Johnson then signed the Act into law on July 2, 1964. This civil rights law ended what was known as the \"Solid South\" and certain provisions were modeled after the Civil Rights Act of 1875, signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant.Kennedy's continuation of Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower's policies of giving economic and military aid to South Vietnam left the door open for President Johnson's escalation of the conflict. At the time of Kennedy's death, no final policy decision had been made as to Vietnam, leading historians, cabinet members, and writers to continue to disagree on whether the Vietnam conflict would have escalated to the point it did had he survived. His agreement to the NSAM 263 action of withdrawing 1,000 troops by the end of 1963, and his earlier 1963 speech at American University, suggest that he was ready to end the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War contributed greatly to a decade of national difficulties, amid violent disappointment on the political landscape.\nMany of Kennedy's speeches (especially his inaugural address) are considered iconic; and despite his relatively short term in office, and the lack of major legislative changes coming to fruition during his term, Americans regularly vote him as one of the best presidents, in the same league as Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Some excerpts of Kennedy's inaugural address are engraved on a plaque at his grave at Arlington. In 2018 The Times published an audio recreation of the \"watchmen on the walls of world freedom\" speech he was scheduled to deliver at the Dallas Trade Mart on November 22, 1963.In 1961, he was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, considered the most prestigious award for American Catholics. He was posthumously awarded the Pacem in Terris Award (Latin: Peace on Earth). It was named after a 1963 encyclical letter by Pope John XXIII that calls upon all people of goodwill to secure peace among all nations. Kennedy also posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963. As of 2019, he has been the only Catholic U.S. president.Throughout the English-speaking world, the given name Kennedy has sometimes been used in honor of President Kennedy, as well his brother Robert.\n\n\n=== Effect of assassination ===\nTelevision was the primary source that kept people informed of the events that surrounded Kennedy's assassination. In fact, television started to come of age before the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy helped inaugurate network television's first half-hour nightly evening newscast according to an interview with CBS Evening News anchor Walter Cronkite.Newspapers were kept as souvenirs rather than sources of updated information. In this sense his assassination was the first major TV news event of its kind. TV coverage united the nation, interpreting what went on, and creating memories of this space in time. All three major U.S. television networks suspended their regular schedules and switched to all-news coverage from November 22 through November 26, 1963, being on the air for 70 hours, making it the longest uninterrupted news event on American TV until 9/11.The assassination had an effect on many people, not only in the United States but around the world. Many vividly remember where they were when they first learned the news that Kennedy was assassinated, as with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, before it and the September 11 attacks after it. UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson II said of the assassination: \"All of us. ... . will bear the grief of his death until the day of ours.\" Many people have also spoken of the shocking news, compounded by the pall of uncertainty about the identity of the assassin(s), the possible instigators, and the causes of the killing, as an end to innocence, and in retrospect it has been coalesced with other changes of the tumultuous decade of the 1960s, especially the Vietnam War.\nUltimately, the death of President Kennedy, and the ensuing confusion surrounding the facts of his assassination, are of political and historical importance insofar as they marked a turning point and decline in the faith of the American people in the political establishment\u2014a point made by commentators from Gore Vidal to Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and implied by Oliver Stone in several of his films, such as his landmark 1991 JFK.\n\n\n=== Memorials and eponyms ===\n\nA small sample of the extensive list at the main article (link above) includes:\n\nJohn F.

        "wiki": "Interstate 94 (I-94) in the U.S. state of Minnesota runs 259 miles (417 km) east\u2013west through the central portion of the state. The highway connects the cities of Moorhead, Fergus Falls, Alexandria, St. Cloud, Minneapolis, and Saint Paul.\n\n\n== Route description ==\n\nI-94 enters the state from North Dakota at the city of Moorhead and heads southeast after serving Moorhead.\nTraveling southeast from Moorhead, there are several places where the elevation of I-94 rises slightly; these are \"beaches\" that formed as the glacial lake rose or fell. Finally, at Rothsay, I-94 climbs the last beach line and enters terrain more typical for Minnesota. From Rothsay to the Twin Cities, the terrain of I-94 is rolling with frequent lakes visible from the highway.\nI-94 traverses by Fergus Falls, Alexandria, and Sauk Centre on its way to St. Cloud. The \"original main street\" in Sauk Centre near I-94 commemorates the Sinclair Lewis novel that skewered this town.\nMonticello is roughly the midpoint exurb for both St. Cloud and Minneapolis. Between exits 201 (Albertville) and 194 (Monticello) sits the Minnesota Road Research Facility.\nUpon arrival to the Twin Cities, I-94 first approaches Minneapolis from the north, then the highway turns east after passing through the Lowry Hill Tunnel and heads to Saint Paul while traveling east. \nThe road crosses the Mississippi River in Minneapolis between the Prospect Park and Seward neighborhoods. The highway joins Minneapolis and St. Paul together where it meets Minnesota State Highway 280 (MN 280). In Saint Paul, the routing of I-94 is set through the historic Rondo neighborhood, which prior to the highway's construction was the largest African-American community in Saint Paul.Upon leaving Saint Paul, the route travels through suburban Washington County and exits the state into Wisconsin between Lakeland, Minnesota, and Hudson, Wisconsin, while crossing the St. Croix River.\nLegally, the Minnesota section of I-94 is defined as unmarked Legislative Route 392 in the Minnesota Statutes \u00a7 161.12(4). I-94 is not marked with this legislative number along the actual highway.\n\n\n== History ==\nI-94 in Minnesota was authorized as part of the original Interstate network in 1956. It was mostly constructed in the 1960s.\nI-94 follows the original route of old U.S. Highway 52 (US 52) from Moorhead to St. Cloud, then I-94 stays south of the Mississippi River along the former route of old MN 152 between St. Cloud and the Twin Cities. I-94 then passes through both downtowns and exits toward Wisconsin along the former route of old US 12.\nThe first section of I-94 in Minnesota constructed was between Moorhead and Albany in the early 1960s, as an extension of the existing highway in North Dakota.The section of I-94 between Minneapolis and Saint Paul was completed in 1968. In the Twin Cities, the construction of the highway was politically charged. The highway was built primarily through many working-class and black neighborhoods. In Saint Paul, the routing of I-94 displaced the historic Rondo neighborhood, which prior to the highway construction was the largest African-American community in Saint Paul.The section of I-94 between Maple Grove and Brooklyn Center was completed in 1969.The section of I-94 between Saint Augusta and Maple Grove was completed in 1973.The section of I-94 between Albany and Saint Augusta was completed in 1977.The section of I-94 from Brooklyn Center through north Minneapolis was completed in 1984. Like Rondo in the 1960s, this segment was through a primarily African-American and working-class neighborhood.The last section of I-94 in Minnesota constructed was the 10 miles (16 km) between its junction with I-494/I-694 at Woodbury and the Wisconsin state line at Lakeland. This was completed in 1985.In 2004, a major traffic bottleneck was relieved when a third lane was constructed between Brooklyn Boulevard at Brooklyn Center and Hemlock Lane at Maple Grove. This is located immediately east of the I-494/I-694/I-94 interchange in Maple Grove, also known locally as the Fish Lake Interchange.From September 2007 to October 2008, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) added a temporary extra lane to I-94 between northbound I-35W and MN 280 in the Twin Cities to help relieve traffic congestion caused by the collapse of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge. As a result, this portion of I-94 was not up to Interstate Highway standards during this time period.\n\n\n== Exit list ==\n\n\n== Auxiliary routes ==\nI-394, direct link between Minneapolis and western suburbs\nI-494, southern/western portion of beltway loop\nI-694, northern/eastern portion of beltway loop\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSteve Riner Details of Routes 76 to 100.

        "wiki": "Mill City Museum is a Minnesota Historical Society museum in Minneapolis. It opened in 2003 built in the ruins of the Washburn \"A\" Mill next to Mill Ruins Park on the banks of the Mississippi River. The museum focuses on the founding and growth of Minneapolis, especially flour milling and the other industries that used hydropower from Saint Anthony Falls.\nThe mill complex, dating from the 1870s, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is part of the St. Anthony Falls Historic District and within the National Park Service's Mississippi National River and Recreation Area.\n\n\n== Exhibits ==\nThe museum features exhibits about the history of Minneapolis, flour milling machinery, a water lab and a baking lab. The centerpiece of the exhibit is the multistory Flour Tower, where visitors sit in the cab of a freight elevator and are taken to different floors of the building, each designed to look like a floor in a working flour mill. Voices of people who worked in the Washburn A Mill are heard throughout the show. Visitors exit on the 8th floor, where extant equipment is interpreted by staff, and are then led to the ninth-floor observation deck to view St. Anthony Falls.\nThe Gold Medal Flour sign still shines at night atop the adjoining grain elevator. Across the river, the former competitor Pillsbury A-Mill is topped with a sign reading \"Pillsbury's Best Flour.\"\n\n\n=== Local artists ===\nThe work of local artists is featured throughout the building. Pieces by JoAnn Verburg, Tom Maakestad, Kim Lawler, Kathleen Richert, Paul Wrench and Becky Schurmann include murals, an art glass collage, a 15-foot (4.6 m) Bisquick box, and sculpture.\n\n\n== Mill City Live ==\nMill City Museum began an outdoor concert series named \"Mill City Live\" in the summer of 2004. The concerts are held in the museum's Ruin courtyard and feature Twin Cities bands of various genres. \"Mill City Live\" was originally held on the first and third Thursdays of June, July, August, and September, but in 2009 and 2010 concerts were held every Thursday in July and August. As of 2016, the concerts are held every Wednesday night in August.\n\n\n== Washburn A Mill ==\n\nThe first Washburn A Mill, built by Cadwallader C. Washburn in 1874, was declared the largest flour mill in the world upon its completion, and contributed to the development of Minneapolis. On May 2, 1878, a spark ignited airborne flour dust within the mill, creating an explosion that demolished the Washburn A and killed 18 workers instantly. The ensuing fire resulted in the deaths of four more people, destroyed five other mills, and reduced Minneapolis's milling capacity by one third. Known as the Great Mill Disaster, the explosion made national news and served as a focal point that led to reforms in the milling industry. In order to prevent the buildup of combustible flour dust, ventilation systems and other precautionary devices were installed in mills throughout the country.\nBy 1880 a new Washburn A Mill, designed by Austrian engineer William de la Barre, opened as the largest flour mill in the world, a designation it retained until the Pillsbury A Mill opened across the river in 1881. At the peak of the Washburn A Mill's production, it could grind over 100 boxcars of wheat into almost 2,000,000 pounds of flour per day.  An ad from the 1870s advertised, \"Forty-one Runs of Stone.  Capacity, 1,200 Barrels per Day.  This is the largest and most complete Mill in the United States, and has not its equal in quantity and quality of machinery for making high and uniform grades of Family Flour in this country.\"  Advertising hyperbole aside, the mill, along with the Pillsbury A Mill and other flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls, contributed greatly to Minneapolis's development.  The mill was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1983 for its technological innovations and its importance in the history of General Mills.Washburn later teamed up with John Crosby to form the Washburn-Crosby Company, which later became General Mills.After World War I, flour production in Minneapolis began to decline as flour milling technology no longer depended on water power. Other cities, such as Buffalo, New York, became more prominent in the milling industry. Later on in the mill's lifetime, General Mills started putting more emphasis on producing cereals and baking mixes and shifted away from flour milling. The mill was shut down in 1965, along with eight other of the oldest mills operated by General Mills.\nIn 1991 a fire nearly destroyed the old mill, but during the late 1990s, the city of Minneapolis, through the Minneapolis Community Development Agency, worked to stabilize the mill ruins. After the city had cleared the rubble and reinforced the mill's damaged walls, the Minnesota Historical Society announced plans to construct a milling museum and education center within the ruins. Construction on the museum began in March 2001. Designed by Tom Meyer, principal for the architectural firm Meyer, Scherer & Rockcastle, the museum is a new building built with the ruin walls of the 1880 Washburn A Mill. Efforts were made to retain as much of the historic fabric of the building as was possible. Many features of the Washburn A Mill were left intact, including turbine pits, railroad tracks, a train shed and two engine houses.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWashburn A Mill Explosion in MNopedia, the Minnesota Encyclopedia\nMill City Museum Homepage\nMill City History Portal",

          "We enjoyed our 2 hour visit here. The best part was the \"Minneapolis in 17 minutes\" video. The elevator ride and history of the mill was interesting, but the audio was difficult for me to understand. (I am a hearing aid wearer.) Every employee was very helpful and pleasant",

          "Okay. I had time to kill and thought this would be a good way to do it. Flour mills? Not really anything that interested me. It was a really pleasant surprise for a number of reasons: 1. It really educates you on how important the milling industry was for Minneapolis. 2. A lot",
          "The public bus drops off 2 1/2 blocks away from this phenomenal museum. Loved the Minneapolis in a Flash movie as well as the moving elevator show. I was amazed by the SIZE of the machines and the dangerous conditions these people worked under. Well worth the time!",
          "The Mill City Museum is a good place to start when touring Minneapolis for the first time. Start with the orientation film that gives a broad overview of city history. Then take the elevator tour up to the observation deck floor. I don't think about the grain mill business too",

          "We were not aware of the deep flour milling history of Minneapolis until we visited this area. The museum is good, but the actual flour milling process needs to be explained in greater detail. A trip to the 9th floor is well worth the time if nothing else for the view it",

          "The visit starts with an elevator ride that recounts the story of the mill. I thought that the voiceover was somewhat difficult to understand. The view from the top floor makes the ticket worth it! The museum offers small food samples (not very many) and some water games that",

          "The main highlight of this visit was the ride up the grain elevator. The ride up the 8 stories takes about 15 minutes with stops on different floors. Each stop has a short presentation on part of the history of the mill. The view from the top is nice. Back down at the bottom,",
          "This place is okay. All the reviews were raving about it, so we felt like we couldn't miss it. Well, we could have and we would have been just fine. It's $12 for adults; however, there is a $2 of senior, student, and veteran discount. It's informative and a very nice and clean",

          "Friends told me I had to visit this museum when in Minneapolis. I'm glad I listened. The old factory building has been really interestingly adapted to a museum that helps explain why Minneapolis is the city that it is. The exhibit is interesting and interactive. The grain",

          "We really liked the Museum which gave us a good idea on how the flour Mills were used in earlier days. Our guide was very helpful and had answers to all our questions. You have a beautiful view over St. Anthony Falls and the other mills which used to be located there.",
          "It's a great place to visit if you're looking for some Minneapolis history. A lot of information about all the companies in the food and grain industry we grew up with in the sixties ,seventies and eighties. Great history on Mills and definitely do the tour.",
          "Very interesting museum. Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to enjoy all the exhibits. The Elevator ride was cool and the explosion demonstration. Friendly staff of the MHS",

          "I am from Minnesota which influences why I found this museum interesting. the view from the Museum is part of the experience. Interesting stories and displays throughout. The childrens interactive room was big hit!",
          "This is such an amazing history spot. You can see how the twin cities came to be. The old flour mills that use to feed the world helped Minnesota be known the world over. Old artifacts and interesting exhibits. Highly recommend the elevator tour. It gives you the feel of how",
          "Even my husband who grudgingly went enjoyed the visit. Displays were set up for all ages. Staff were friendly. Not sure why we couldn't have a water bottle? View was very nice. Glad to see such an important part of history. Grabbed a quick bite at cafe, than continued the",

          "Who knew a flour mill history tour could be entertaining?! Elevator tour and the river view were both great. Nice way to get the history on how Minneapolis was developed. We were there about 1.5 hours. Well worth the money.",
          "This museum takes a topic that seems kind of boring on the face of it and turns it into a fun learning experience. The elevator ride that tells the story of the flour mill industry in Minneapolis is interesting and fun. Be sure to ask to see the demonstration of the mill",
          "A thorough & entertaining presentation about Minneapolis origins. A fun animated AV presentation in an adapted freight elevator & hands on stuff for kits to do. Milling was a BIG deal in Minneapolis as this museum clearly shows. We take most of our out of town visitors here &",
          "I was so surprised at how much fun our family had visiting this museum dedicated to our history as a flour mill mecca. We learned more fascinating tidbits than I thought possible, given the topic, but it turns out there's an interesting story to just about anything if someone",
          "The museum is trying really hard to present an historic view of a flour mill. The tour was interesting. The movie was not so much about the flour mill as about Minneapolis.",
          "This is a pretty interesting museum in an old flour mill that burned in the 1990s. You spend about 30 minutes and the tour consists of an elevator ride that details what it was like to work in the mill and then you go to the 8th floor to see what is left of the original mill.",
          "Very neat exhibit in the heart of Minneapolis. The views are outstanding. Hard to believe how big milling once was there.",
          "During a weekend trip to Minneapolis, we decided to go to the Mill City Museum. Prior to visiting, I did not know that flour was such a big industry in Minneapolis. The museum tour is done in an old Flour Mill that was partially destroyed from a fire in the early 90s. Before",
          "Very interesting history of Minny and the Mississippi, St Anthony Falls. Great views. Fun interactive features about how flour was \u201cmade\u201d and how consumer use and tastes have changed. View from the \u201cFlour Tower\u201d",
          "I have visited many historical sites all across the United States. This was unquestionably one of the very best for an \"all around\" experience. The price of $12 is dirt cheap and I didn't expect much. Lots of other places charge double or triple and you just get to look at a",
          "The ruins are beautiful, if it is possible to consider a crumbling, burnt building beautiful. We took some time to pose for pictures before we took the tour. To buy tour tickets, you need to go up to the second floor, but the tour starts on the first floor. We watched a flour",
          "I have been here a few times and each time I learn a little more about how flour is made. Take the tour - it take you through different sections of the mill. The movie is GREAT!!! There is a place to eat inside the building. Parking is on the street. This is a fun trip for",

          "We visited this museum on 8/24/17. After we paid our admission charge, we asked about lockers for our travel bag and the ticket agent directed us to lockers around the corner from his post. We paid a quarter and locked up our Sportsac travel bag, two jackets, and two",

          "Very interesting museum located on the Mississippi river. Take a ride in the \"Flour Tower\" and hear stories about the mill in its hay day. I loved hearing and seeing the retro commercials as well as the displays of vintage product container and the history of Poppin Fresh.",
          "This was a nice, but very limited scope, museum. The Flour Tower (you ride up and down in an elevator to learn more about the mill, and then end up on an observation deck) was unique and interesting. I don't know if I would make a special trip to the museum, but I was in the",
          "This was a wonderful look at a big part of food history. There are many hands on opportunites for kids to feel the power of water. Yes they can get their hands wet. But it is done so that adults can stop or pass by the kids activities. The flour tower is a nice look into all the",
          "I haven't been this impressed with a museum for a very long time! This is a great place for all ages with hands on activities for kids. They not only give you a very informative history of the flour/milling industry but also of the city and it's growth. A very interesting",
          "Had a good time. Flour tower was the best part. Pretty narrow topic to spend a huge amount of time on",
          "Lots of hands on learning for kids up to about 10. The elevator ride is interesting and a great way to give an overview of what the mills were like years ago without being boring. The test kitchen usually has something tasty. Lastly, the outdoor area provides interesting details",
          "One of our favorite locations of the Historical Society! The ground floor museum features many hands on opportunities, cool exhibits for all ages, history theater and docents. The elevator theater is well done but can scare young our sensitive children as it features dark and",
          "Nice exhibits and facility. Staff was super helpful. Make sure to watch the Minneapolis in 19 minutes and do the Flour Tower tour. Reasonable entry fee.",
          "We have attended a few outdoor concerts in the ruins. They have a great set up - with a nice stage, wine/beer service and comfortable seating (folding chairs). Some seating even has tables you can sit around.",
          "The old Gold Medal Flour factory is the site of the Mill City Museum, and it offers a wonderfully educational insight into all aspects of making flour, baking, and even the explosion and fire which led to closure of the factory. In summer, there's a farmer's market just outside",
          "Fun place to take family, interactive history tour, gives you a real idea for what the factory was like during the flour mill era",
          "A unique place that you cannot find in any other city. Learnt things I never would have even known about.",
          "This was a fascinating history museum that specifically talked about the flour industry. The tour was great, the exhibits informative and the building was just amazing. It was built from the ruins of the old Gold Medal Plant. Just incredible and a must see if your in town.",
          "LOVE this museum! I have been three times, and each time I seem to learn something new about the history of Minneapolis. Kids loved it, grandparents loved it, the whole family enjoyed it!",
          "Let me begin by saying and I am not a history buff, nor do I play one on TV, however, I enjoyed the Mill City Museum! There is a lot of cool history here and I am glad I didn't miss out on. One suggestion: my group was visiting in the afternoon on a weekday. I'm sure that",
          "Directly across the street from the Guthrie Theater. Be sure to stop in this museum that was salvaged from ruins of a flour mill. Take the tour on the elevator, featuring stories from former mill workers.",
          "This museum tour is conducted very differently than others I have been on. Most of the tour is conducted riding in a freight elevator as the history of the flour mill is told and scenes are depicted at each stop. It was very well done and would definitely take out-of-town",
          "What an interesting way to share your city's history! This museum not only tells the story of the mills, but does it in a very entertaining, hands-on way. My grandson loves trains so seeing the train shed & a real train was important! Who knew there would be a train set",
          "Glad I wasn't around when the mill exploded, but the museum and now ruins are interesting. Some of the ruins are now high end apartments while this part is a museum telling a history of the mill. A nice destination as the much smaller than downstream Mississippi River flows",
          "Maybe I missed something, but the reviews are great - I just wasn't that excited about it. The staff is very nice, I have to say. The tour doesn't take that long. You can look out over the dam - not that entertaining. It is interesting to hear the history of the city and the",

          "We stopped in here based on TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed! My fiance thought it was going to be a boring museum, but she was pleasantly surprised. While they have a lot of activities geared towards children they have plenty for adults to look at as well.",
          "You don't really think that a flour mill that exploded would be a very interesting museum but it is. Really the museum is about the death of the milling industry in Minneapolis. It's actually really fascinating how Minneapolis was built on this industry and has since recovered",
          "Really interesting and well presented museum. The history of milling in Minneapolis is also the history of the town and its social history. Even as a visitor from the UK you will be familiar with lots of the historic brands. You're going to need a couple of hours.",
          "This was a pleasant way to spend about 2 hours in Minneapolis. We learned all about making flour, marketing flour and grain products in the US and worldwide, and the industrial history of Minneapolis. Good for adults and children.",
          "The museum is small but very much worth a visit if you're interested in Minneapolis history or in big industry - it's a very compact but well put together exhibit about the rise and fall of flour milling in the city. What a great use of its former factory space! Also very",

          "This was such an interesting and engaging museum! The only thing that would have made it better would be having more of an idea about the flow of traffic or direction as to where the onlookers should go. There were fresh cookies made every \u2026",

          "Nice view of the Stone Arch Bridge and a cool elevator ride/tour that does a pretty good job of recreating the experience of working in the mill. Is it the best museum I've ever been to? Definitely not. Is it more interesting than a \"flour museum\" sounds? Definitely.",
          "Must do when you\u2019re in town. Lived here most my life and found out just today people moved here because of a waterfall whattttt!? Do the flower tower, dust show, baking show and so on. Beautiful view.",
          "Most people we asked didn't recommend the museum, but I highly suggest visiting it when in Minneapolis. It offers insights into the history of Minneapolis\u2014from the impact of mills on the local economy but also on how it incentivized \u2026",

The subject matter may not sound like the most exciting thing in the world, but there's a lot of interesting information in there, and it really connects with the history of the city.

          "Amazing place!! Highly recommended historical site to see, check out and explore. It was really educational and fun!!",

          "Nice museum about the founding of Minnesota's flour Mills, build inside the ruins of one of the largest flour Mills in the US. Expect to spend at least 2 hours, to see and read everything. There is a charge for parking, so if the weather is nice, I recommend walking the rest of the Mill District while you are there. Beautiful scenery.",
          "Nice for kids. Not much for adults.\nThe museum is thin. Big on atmosphere, but not much in the way of explanation. The elevator ride is a blend of diorama and narrative from former employees. The Minneapolis in 19 minutes movie was cute and feel good. If you don't already have background, you won't get it here.",
          "Nice little museum. I agree with what others have said, the 19 minute video on the history of Minneapolis and the flour tower elevator ride are by far the best part. The rest of the museum is interesting, but there's only so much you learn \u2026",
          "We have been here a few times. We see and learn something new each time we go. There are multiple interactive displays that provide insights into the milling process, the river, and the history of the Twin Cities. The views of the river and \u2026",
          "Fun place to go learn a bit and have a little fun for an hour",
          "The elevator ride and observation deck are worth the price paid. The water tables are fun for the kids when there\u2019s a volunteer there to explain them. An hour is about how long it that\u2019s to take in the whole museum.",

          "I loved the old train car inside the building.",
          "A surprisingly fun experience. The museum is fairly small but we'll set up, with activities in the back. I would definitely recommend the inclusive ticket so you get to learn about the mill and see the top floor, from which you get great \u2026",
          "Cannot recommend this enough, very well done, the elevator tour is very engrossing and interestinf, and the film was a perfect crash course on the history of the city. Great views as well",
          "Worth thre price of admission for the view alone! They have an elevator ride that goes among the different floors that would have been in the mill, accompanied by voice over stories. At the end, they let you out 9 stories up and give you an \u2026",
          "We visited the farmers' market in the alley next to the museum, rather than the museum itself. Bought my grown daughter the red dress shown on the left. Bought lunch from the various venders, one selling Nepalese specialties. Would come back again",

          "Even though it's a museum about flour, I had an absolutely great time and would greatly recommend this place to anybody. I'm not usually impressed with staff at any venue or establishment, but the staff here were amazing, knowledgeable, and seemed to greatly care about the museum and it's visitors.",

The beautiful new industrial glass building peaking out from the dilapidated original exterior of the mill was just beautiful. \n\nI really enjoyed our tour. The freight elevator idea is so unique! The outside overlook offered a great view ",
          "My expectations were low, because after all this is a museum about flour, but I was blown away by how the staff had taken a fairly boring topic and made it so much more. The elevator ride to the top incorporated technology well, the view \u2026",

      "name": "Swede Hollow Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Swede Hollow was a neighborhood of St. Paul, Minnesota. It was one of a large group of neighborhoods collectively known as the East Side, lying just to the east of the near-downtown Railroad Island neighborhood, and at the northwestern base of Dayton's Bluff. It was capped in the north by the sprawling Hamm's Brewery (with its imposing Hamm family mansion), and in the south by the historic Seventh Street Improvement Arches. Although one of the oldest settlements in the city, it was also arguably the poorest as each wave of immigrants settled in the valley. Swedes, Poles, Italians and Mexicans all at one point called the valley home. A similar community just downstream called Connemara Patch also existed for Irish immigrants.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area was originally a small, steep, wooded ravine cut through by Phalen Creek. The first settler, Edward Phelan, moved there in 1841. Phelan fled Minnesota in 1850 after perjury charges arose but not before leaving a mark that would change what was once Mill Creek to Phalen. Among the earliest inhabitants to settle permanently in the isolated spot were Swedish immigrants. First arriving in the 1850s, they gave their new home the name \"Svenska Dalen\" (lit. [the] Swedish Valley), a designation that remained (in English translation) long after they moved on, to be replaced by a wave of Italian immigrants in the early 20th century. At the time of the neighborhood's demise in the mid-fifties, it had attracted some Mexican families as well.\n\nAlthough remembered with a certain nostalgia today, the former area was a true slum. People and industries occupying the surrounding \"upper\" neighborhoods used the Hollow as a makeshift dump, which the inhabitants down below routinely scavenged for clothing, metals, building supplies, and even shoe repair needs. Several gristmills operated on the creek by the 1850s. Railroad tracks were built along the creek in 1865 because the creek bed provided an easier grade up from the Mississippi River than bluffs elsewhere.Unusually for a neighborhood in the heart of a mid-20th-century major American city (especially given the Twin Cities' challenging climate), Swede Hollow was never electrified, and plumbing was extremely primitive. The residences were constructed almost entirely out of recovered and scrapped building materials and serviced by a single dirt road. Toilets consisted of outhouses constructed directly over Phalen Creek. The original inhabitants got their water from springs and used Phelan Creek as their sewer, leading to sanitation problems.\n\n\n== Destruction ==\nSo squalid were the conditions of the Hollow, in fact, that in 1956 the city declared the entire neighborhood a health hazard. The last remaining families were forcibly evicted, and the entire housing stock was burnt to the ground on December 11 of the same year. At one time (1905) as many as 1,000 people called the tiny little glade their home, although there were far fewer (14 families in all) remaining at the time of the December 11, 1956 clearing.\n\n\n== Today ==\n\nSoon after the destruction, the area became a dumping ground and gathering place for the homeless. In the 1970s the valley was cleaned up, and it was designated a nature center in 1976. A 1917 report remarked, \"Phalen Creek and the banks of this stream are ideal for park purposes, while in their present state they constitute a menace to the health of the residents and to the community at large.\" The area remains uninhabited to this day. The original woodland state has returned (although some of the building foundations still remain), the creek has been partially restored, and the entire valley has been made part of Swede Hollow Park, a city park. The trail running along the west edge of Swede Hollow is the Bruce Vento Regional Trail, paved on the former right-of-way of the Northern Pacific Railway's Skally Line that ran from St. Paul to Duluth.The award-winning album Minnesota: A History of the Land, released by musician Peter Ostroushko in 2005, included a piece called \"Swede Hollow Lament\". In 2012 composer Ann Millikan premiered an opera about Swede Hollow.In Sweden, the history of 19th-century migration to Minnesota was popularized by Vilhelm Moberg's four-novel series The Emigrants (1949\u20131959), which describes rural, hard-working, successful settlers in the 1850s. Former ABBA members Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson adapted these books into the 1995 musical Kristina fr\u00e5n Duvem\u00e5la. The poorer, urban, less successful emigrants of the 1890s received less attention until described in Ola Larsmo's 2016 novel Swede Hollow, which has also been adapted into a play.\n\n\n== Connemara Patch ==\n\nJust south and downstream of Swede Hollow was a lesser-known Irish neighborhood called Connemara Patch. It was so named after the original home of its Irish settlers, who arrived in the United States under the sponsorship of Archbishop John Ireland, who settled them on prairie claims near Graceville, Minnesota. When the original rural colonization plan was aborted by the long, blizzard-wracked winter of 1880 (a season so harsh it was immortalized in the Laura Ingalls Wilder book The Long Winter), the desperate immigrants were resettled along lower Phalen Creek in the area between East Seventh and East Fourth streets as a stopgap measure\u2014one that ultimately became permanent. The legendary Irish-language storyteller \u00c9amon a B\u00farc spent several years in the district before a railroad accident took his leg, leading him to return to his village in County Galway, Ireland.Like Swede Hollow, Connemara Patch was eventually cleared of its inhabitants. The neighborhood's remnants were completely destroyed by urban renewal in the 1950s. Interstate 94 currently occupies a substantial portion of the old enclave. The rest of the site is largely vacant, except for a few dilapidated industrial structures.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSwede Hollow Park at Placeography\nFrom Swede Hollow to Arlington Hills\nSwede Hollow Continues Immigrant Tradition with a Focus on Water\nFriends of Swede HollowMinnesota Historical Society\n\nSwede Hollow photos\nSwede Hollow artwork\nI Remember St. Paul's Swede Hollow\nSwede Hollow in MNopedia, the Minnesota EncyclopediaVideos\n\nSwede Hollow opera\nSwede Hollow historyConnemara Patch at the MHS \n\nPainting of Connemara Patch\nBishop Ireland's Connemara Experiment",

        "wiki": "Spoonbridge and Cherry is a sculptural fountain designed by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. It was funded by a $500,000 donation from art collector Frederick R. Weisman and is permanently located in the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. The piece was completed and installed in 1988 for the Sculpture Garden's opening and consists of a large cherry resting atop a large spoon partially straddling a small pond.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the mid-1980s, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, commissioned a piece of work from married couple Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen, whose first artistic collaboration came in 1976. The work, which had its $500,000 budget donated by art collector Frederick R. Weisman, was to be placed in the new outdoor Minneapolis Sculpture Garden across Vineland Place from the Walker on land owned by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board.An early concept for the sculpture was a Viking ship with a dragon figurehead set in a circular reflecting pool; a 1986 article in the Star Tribune describes this vision as having been \"quickly abandoned\". The iconography of the spoon had been present in Oldenburg's work for a number of years since he acquired a piece of kitsch depicting a spoon atop a mass of chocolate in 1962. The cherry was contributed by van Bruggen who found inspiration in the formality of the sculpture garden's design, in the Palace of Versailles, and in the dining etiquette of Louis XIV of France's court. Walker curator Siri Engberg said in 2013 that the bowl of the spoon was associated with \"the prow of a Viking ship, a duck rising out of the water, various flora and fauna, [and] ice skating\" for Oldenburg and van Bruggen. Martin Friedman, director of the Walker, said of the work that the artists did not intend to craft a \"sculptural symbol of Minneapolis\" but that he believed Spoonbridge and Cherry would \"be a landmark and [would] give a lot of people pleasure\".The piece was fabricated between 1987 and 1988 at two shipyards, one in Boothbay, Maine, and the other in Bristol, Rhode Island, and finished in New Haven, Connecticut, at sculpture fabricator Lippincott, Inc. It was placed in the northern portion of the Sculpture Garden by two cranes on May 9, 1988. The Sculpture Garden held opening ceremonies September 9\u201311 of that year, with an official dedication on September 10 featuring a band of spoon players.Spoonbridge and Cherry was entirely repainted in 1995. In 2012, the word \"Kony\" was spraypainted onto the sculpture's spoon, possibly as part of Invisible Children's Cover the Night campaign, requiring the sculpture to be scrubbed and repaired which Walker staff were able to complete within 48 hours.\n\n\n== Design ==\nSpoonbridge and Cherry measures 30 by 52 by 13 feet (9 m \u00d7 15.7 m \u00d7 4.1 m) and straddles a small pond built in the shape of a linden tree seed, evoking the lindens in the surrounding park. The pond's shores were lined with irises and reeds. The sculpture is built from stainless steel and aluminum and coated with polyurethane enamel. The cherry portion of the piece weighs 1,199 pounds (544 kg) while the spoon portion weighs 5,800 pounds (2,630 kg).The sculpture emits filtered water from both the tip and the base of the cherry's stem, the latter intended to keep the cherry gleaming in the light.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe editors of Phaidon Press wrote favorably of the sculpture's placement in a park frequented by families, writing that the \"surprise of finding a oversized fruit spooned up in a park, together with its curved forms and the bright colour, creates a sensuous joy that makes the work immediately accessible to a wide audience, including children.\"Writing in the Star Tribune a year after the Sculpture Garden's opening, Chris Waddington found the linden seed pond critical to enjoying Spoonbridge, writing that in winter months when the pond was frozen and snowed over, the sculpture \"can seem like a soulless mock-up, a quirky idea that lost its charm somewhere between the artist's hand and the factory where it was built; but with spring comes the fountain's spray, the pool's play of liquid reflections on steel and an animate charge that recalls the poetry of the artists' original sketches.\"Within a decade of the Sculpture Garden's opening, the Star Tribune reported that Spoonbridge was \"something of an icon for the Walker\". In 2001, Eric Dregni wrote that the sculpture had \"become the unofficial symbol of Minneapolis\" and in 2008, City Pages described it as \"one of the Twin Cities' most iconic images.\" The Walker reported receiving more requests for images of Spoonbridge and Cherry than any other work in its collections.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpoonbridge and Cherry at the Walker Art Center",

          "This is a fairly modest sculpture garden with a few high tickets pieces that make it worthwhile visiting. The garden is laid out opposite the Walker Art Centre, which means it's a good double header for those wanting their art fix for the day. The garden's centrepiece is the",

          "If Minneapolis is your destination, the sculpture garden is a must. Walk at your own pace, and see great sculpture and relax.",
          "This is a remarkable place and probably deserves five stars. The only reason I read it three stars is that they remove some of the best elements that the garden had grown into. They had planted massive trees years ago they had become very established and created very private",

          "The spoon and cherry is a really cool sculpture. There are a couple of other nice ones but the majority are unmemorable. I'd skip this if I were doing over again.",

          "This is one of the must see places when visiting the wonderful city of Minneapolis. You may not think so, but allow yourself a good hour or even more to be able to walk around the grounds and see all the great sculptures. The number one most popular is the spoon and cherry.",
          "This was a unique place that we had to visit. The big spoon with cherry is an iconic piece that is a great picture memory spot. It was a nice little park with many different metal pieces of art work. The only cost for us was to park our car.",
          "It's a medium sized sculpture park. If you're in the area, definitely stop to see that famous cherry spoon. Lots of great photo opportunities. Another excuse to take a scooter ride!",
          "Definitely a must see in Minneapolis. Perfect for a quick touristy photo or long leisurely walks through the garden. Best part, its free!",
          "Although it is basically a sculpture garden across from the Walker Museum, it is a lovely shaded huge area with plenty of benches and short walking areas to stroll through, You will see pictures of the symbol of the huge cherry on a spoon all around Minneapolis but this is the",
          "I had definitely been to the Sculpture Garden before. It had been years, and we took some East Coast guests who wanted to see the iconic cherry and spoon sculpture. I was amazed at how amazing it still is! I was really impressed with the newer sculptures. They had a large",
          "This place was so much cooler than we expected! Based on the reviews, we thought there were a few sculptures and it would take maybe 30 minutes max. We ended up spending 2 hours wandering through the gardens and checking out the many sculptures and installations. It was a",
          "I didn\u2019t realize it was going to be all modern Art. But given that it is adjacent to a modern art museum, that makes sense. I especially liked that they were growing wildflowers in part of the park.",
          "It is truly amazing what the city's park department managed to put together. A variety of high quality works by many recognized artists. A must see.",
          "The iconic spoon and cherry is the drawing card, but there are lots of other sculptures in the park. I was there late in the summer, so the wildflowers were tall and had lots of bees and butterflies present.",
          "Had to check out the Minneapolis sculpture garden to see the famous spoon and cherry. We parked in the $4 parking lot and enjoyed strolling through the walkways to see some interesting sculptures. The native landscape and wildflowers only added to the beauty of the art and the",
          "If you are in the city, this is worth the visit! I loved how different each sculpture was. There was something for everyone!",
          "We didn't have enough time to see everything, even though it was a return visit. Spoonbridge was our priority, but there are many interesting pieces of art throughout the gardens. We only had about 30 minutes to explore and easily could have spent twice that if we weren't rushed.",
          "While the giant cherry is featured in most promo photos, the giant blue chicken might well be the star of this sculpture garden. A 30 minute easy stroll lets one see all of the statues even with stops.",
          "We visited way early in the morning, not many people there. A nice path to guide you through a bunch of okay sculptures. The centerpiece is the Spoonbridge and cherry. Oh, and there was ducks.",
          "I've visited Minneapolis many times but have not had a chance to visit the sculpture garden. I'm so glad that I was able to include this wonderful exploration of art in the midst of nature in all her glory as well. The art from some world renowned artists including Henry Moore",
          "While visiting Minneapolis for business, I found this wonderful peaceful spot in the middle of the crazy traffic. I enjoyed touring the sculptures the day I arrived and then returned for a run around the park the next day. Lots of people around but everyone was happy and",
          "Beautiful garden in Minneapolis, spoon and a cherry is my personal favorite! Nice greenery and surroundings!",

          "This was such a great place to experience the city and see great sculptures. It was crowded when we arrived but there was still ample parking in the free lot. We enjoyed walking around the garden and taking photos. The blue cock has a \"twin\" at the Washington DC Smithsonian,",

          "We visited primarily to see the famous spoon and cherry sculpture but enjoyed many of the other installations too. Although there are a number of sculptures that my husband classes as 'arty farty', there are also quite a few that will appeal to those that, like my husband, are",
          "It's a nice peaceful and quite place to visit. The Spoon bridge and cherry sculpture is beautiful. The garden has modern art and pretty wildflowers along the paths. You can spend an hour or two just walking and looking at the art. The day we went was just a nice and sunny day",
          "The sculpture garden is open all day and free. The highlight is the Spoonbridge and Cherry sculpture at the center of the garden, with chairs around it to sit and relax watching the kids climb on the spoon and the ducks enjoying the water flowing from the Cherry. There are also",

          "What a beautiful place. Everything about it. The gardens, the amazing art, the Minneapolis skyline. So many people -families, couples... hanging out. What a scene. If you haven\u2019t been go! We hadn\u2019t stopped here for 10 years and were very glad we did.",
          "My wife & I both loved the sculpture garden. We thought that all of the artwork was really interesting and unique. Our favorite ws the spoon and cherry. The groungs we well laid out and really easy to get to.",

          "The MN sculpture garden was a good visit. It was fun seeing all the different sculpture around the park. It would recommend going early in the morning or in the spring because it was hot when we went in June other then that it was a fun visit.",
          "A very family friendly place. Lots of space to run and play between the sculptures. A beautiful of the city also.",
          "Avoid the heat and go at night - much better than in the middle of the hot day. We spent a long time people watching and enjoying the sculptures. Needs more chairs and people need to be aware that others want to sit, do not use the chairs for your purse while you take photos.",
          "Very well done. Worth visiting. We went there on a very hot and humid day. They are constantly trying to make it better and better. It was a delight to see a great place to visit in the middle of the town.",
          "I took my nieces on a short trip to Mall of America and my only request was that we eat at Hell's Kitchen and see the Spoonbridge and Cherry sculpture. We enjoyed the mile walk after lunch, through the park, to the Sculpture Garden. The fact that it didn't cost to see what we",

          "The Sculpture garden is adjacent to the Walker Museum and is just a beautiful collection of sculptures by well known artists. Most are very contemporary, but there is a Moore. The gardens are for the most part casual and prairie in style. The is a large tree filled with wind",
          "Take the opportunity to appreciate the Arts that exist in the cities. We took time between sports tournament games to expose kids to other things that don't include a ball. We spent about an hour and a half walking and observing the different sculptures. I think the boys liked",
          "After dinner nearby, we went for a walk over the freeway and stumbled upon the Sculpture Garden. So happy that we did. From above it was great to see all the installations. Beautiful grounds and art. A nice, peaceful walk.",
          "While this is an iconic site in the Twin Cities, I felt it was overrated. The sculptures are nice and if the weather is nice, it\u2019s a fine way to spend the day. But the signs don\u2019t have enough information on the art in my opinion.",
          "This 19-acre Sculpture Garden sits aside downtown Minneapolis, with world famous pieces to walk around and photograph. We've not seen anything to compare. You must see it!",
          "The sculpture garden is not to be missed. There is an eclectic range of sculptures, the blue chicken makes one laugh. Some of the art you can actually get on and move with the sculpture. The grounds are beautiful and there are plenty of places to sit down and just admire the",

          "Lovely place to take a walk. We wanted to see the cherry and spoon, which is quirky and fun, and there were a few other pieces we also really liked. Look for the empty coat, we really liked it.",
          "It all depends on why you go, as a place to walk and talk with friends I guess it's not bad. I'm just one of those people who want my art in a different form, not two pieces of metal or a giant spoon. The only one that amused me was \"snowman from the back\" the only piece where",
          "The Sculpture Garden is free. The nearby parking lot was $4 when we were there. It's an interesting park to stroll through, get great pictures and enjoy the Minneapolis skyline behind you. It's worth the stop if you're visiting the area.",
          "We took a tour of the sculpture garden that is offered by the Walker Museum--it is worth it because you really see more and get to know more about the sculptures. We also had lunch at the Walker cafe, which was superb.",
          "The day we went was a lovely day for a stroll outside. This garden had all sorts of sculptures to look at. Perfectly located to where we were staying and walking distance to a really great ice cream parlor.",

          "We stopped by here quickly during a trip on our way to somewhere else. We spent about an hour, but could have easily spent more. Lots of families and groups out enjoying the setting and the summer weather. If I lived in Minneapolis, this is certain a space I would take the",
          "This garden is a great place to relax and view some art...and get lots of sun. Not many trees or shade, so be wary of that. Great photo ops all around! Definitely adds some character to the city.",

          "Beautiful place. They have moved some things and added a lot of new ones so it was nice to come back. The new items (except for the dark blue rooster) are near the Walker Art Gallery. Enjoyed it very much.",
          "My tour guides, made sure I definitely saw the sculptures. Missed getting a picture of the cherry but was able to capture the Blue Rooster. They also took me through many areas of the city, as well as a ride through St. Paul.",
          "I went with a friend on a beautiful day and enjoyed walking threw the sculpture Garden. I highly recommend going",
          "My 6 yo daughter and I decided to kill some time and check it out. It was really neat to see the artwork displayed in such a way. We took a little walk through the Walker art center too. We were lucky enough to get free music for pride weekend too :)",
          "Neat spot to stop and take some pictures. Nice view of the downtown skyline and when the wind is blowing, the tree with all the chimes will sing you a great song.",
          "We stopped here because the reviews were so favorable and so glad we did. There are many sculptures, all so different. There were descriptions for each which were interesting to read. The cherry on the spoon was a highlight! There is also an art gallery with a lovely restaurant.",
          "Wanted to really like this park. However apart from the siting of the spoon and cherry I felt that the other sculptures were let down by the lack of decent landscape setting to set off the art and provide photographic opportunities. More miss than hit.",
          "Really wanted to enjoy this park. Unfortunately, the weather was rain and cold. We did get out and go to the spoon and cherry. It is really cool! Seen from the road or the park this piece of art is a standout piece. The wind was blowing really hard and there was a tree with",
          "I live nearby and understand that infrastructure issues with the site necessitated a redesign. I also get the desire to create a prairie with native grasses. However, 2 years after the opening it is a sorry sight. The absence of trees or bushes means nothing buffers the noise",
          "This a free outdoor art attraction. It show cases various pieces of art. Lovely to walk around on a nice day.",
          "Great walk to check out some sculptures and see the awesome skyline of Minneapolis. Doesn't take long to walk through the park, but definitely worth a visit!",

          "We brought 3 little boys to this park. It was a lot of fun. You have to see the iconic Spoonbridge and Cherry and Blue Hahn/Cock. The boys had fun going around to the different art and trying to guess the name. Great place to be on a beautiful day.",
          "The park is really well set out with nice shade and facilities. The art is a matter of taste but they are well done and make sense... well not to sure about the blue roster! But if you are in the area then it\u2019s well worth the visit",
          "You're in Minneapolis, why wouldn't you stop here to see these iconic things. We stopped here to kill an hour until we could check in to our AirBnB. Spoonbridge and Cherry and Blue Hen were the most interesting. Other things were fun to see to. Parking nearby.",
          "What a beautiful place to visit. The grounds were beautiful, just loved all the sculptures there! The day was beautiful, everyone there was so happy too. Parking was super easy and convenient. So glad we stopped and checked it out!!!! This is a must do!",

          "My family went to check out the sculpture garden and it did not disappoint! To be honest I was a little nervous to take my young kids to see the art for fear they\u2019d break something-or the rules! My kids loved running from sculpture to sculpture! The artist stories are cool to",
          "Great outdoors art museum - if in Minneapolis, wit's worth you while to visit, as one of the items on your \"bucket list\". We visited it at least couple of times.",

          "This park has nice and huge sculptures. I confess I was expecting the cherry to be more red but it is a nice place to visit. The blue of the chicken sculpture is absolutely gorgeous.",
          "This is a unique attraction in Minneapolis, and a good way to spend a little bit of time on a summer afternoon. The grounds are well kept, so are great for walking around. The sculptures are relatively unique. This is a good family option, as there were a lot of families here",
          "Lots of great sculptures to view and photograph. Good walking path and great place to get your steps in. Was chilly day in April while attending the Final Four, but very worth the stop. Parking on street is limited, but lot available nearby for few bucks.",

          "On our way to the airport with a whole lot of time to kill, we happened across the sculpture garden. With luggage in tow, we did a quick walk around because 1. It was free. 2. It was very unique. 3. It was something to kill an hour or so. I dog's the walk just fine with a",

          "Well maintained and very nice to walk around. The sculputres are all neat, when we went in 2018 there was constuction happening, it is a bit off the beaten path from downtown but worth the visit!",
          "We enjoyed the sculpture garden. I can see how it would be really nice in the summer, we still enjoyed it in the winter. The spoon and cherry was super cool and we also like the big blue rooster. The main sidewalks were cleared and easy to walk on but to get close wear boots.",

          "I am not crazy about sculpture. A group I belong to offered a docent tour, so I went along hoping to enjoy it. I do love the cherry. I did not like the blue rooster. It was interesting to learn about some of the sculptures, but I'm not in a hurry to go back.",
          "I had not been here before. The recent changes opening the garden to more viewing really show off the place and makes you want to visit. The sculptures are great. The cherry on the spoon is the icon, but others are great as well. Encourage everyone to see it.",
          "I'm not very into art but was with a group of people who wanted to see this so I went along. It's November so all of the plants are dead and the trees are bare so it looked very flat and barren during our visit. I could see in some areas that there had been lots of flowers",

          "On a nice day it's a lovely outdoor spot to visit. Just be prepared for a large space to walk. The sculptures are widely spaced.",
          "I visited the sculpture park after a business meeting to relax. The layout of the park is great and well maintained. We both enjoyed all of the sculptures.",
          "We were here on a beautiful day and really enjoyed our selves. There are many pieces to look at on your walk around the park. Also lot's of places to set and relax in the grass. There is a good restroom right there also. Well worth the stop.",
          "This was my second visit to this beautiful area of the Twin Cities. It is a delightful area to spend time in exploring....in addition to the sculptures, there are native grasses and the iconic Spoonbridge and Cherry Sculpture is something that shouldn't be missed.",
          "I went on a tour with a docent who provided a lot of information about the sculptures, but even without a guide, the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is a wonderful place to walk and view modern art. Make sure to go when the walking weather is good since this is an open-air outdoor",
          "\u201cDragged\u201d my husband to the park that I had read about online. We were visiting the area for a football game. We both enjoyed the park. I really liked the descriptions online about the sculptures. Also the restrooms were open and clean.",
          "Unique and special park located in the city. Lots of great sculptures laid out around a paved walking path. Makes for some great photos! Our favorite was the swing and spoon and cherry",
          "This was my first choice destination to visit in Minneapolis, and it didn't disappoint. I loved walking around the sculpture garden (for free) and enjoying the art. I've seen Spoonbridge in many pictures, but I never realized that it was a fountain! Lots of other great art too.",
          "Has a multitude of outdoor sculptures, most are bronze. I spent 30 minutes in the park which was plenty.",
          "We weren't sure what to do after dinner - this was a real nice place to enjoy coffee and a cupcake! It was a little dark, but, a nice stroll for a couple - no crowds. Iconic Minneapolis site, and a few gems in the interactive sculpture elements. Great view of spoon and cherry",
          "I had time to kill before my flight home and pulled up trip advisor to find a good place to visit. I was so impressed with this garden. It has a beautiful layout and dozens of very impressive pieces including a 1966 Calder mobile! I would return here in a heartbeat and send",
          "Visited the area for the first time being from out of town. Nicely spread out park. The mist coming off the giant spoon was a nice break from the heat.",
          "Incredible sculpture. Whenever I have friends in from out-of-town, we go to the sculpture garden. It's also a nice place to go alone, sit , reflect, think about what you're seeing. I take my grandkids. They absolutely love it.",
          "Free, easy to find parking nearby, and a beautiful scenic spot in downtown Minneapolis. In the summer, there are endless events held at the Garden from outdoor Zumba to Yoga to Fitbit Local events. Most events hosted in the Garden are free to attendees as well.",
          "It was a nice experience and destination for an out-of-state visitor. But since I am from Michigan, and have visited the absolutely beautiful Meijer Gardens and Sculpture park in Grand Rapids, it was a bit underwhelming in comparison. But still a worthy visit!",
          "A visit to Minneapolis would not be complete without stopping at the Sculpture Garden to see the iconic giant spoon with the cherry. It is free, the art is very interesting and varied, and it is a great way to spend an hour or so to enjoy some time outside. The day we were",
          "It\u2019s a nice way to kill an hour or so if the weather is nice. Sculptures are unique. Grounds are beautiful.",
          "As part of our visit to Walker Art Center we strolled along the sculpture gardens and had a great time! Keep in mind that this is a weather permitting spot to visit so if it is too hot or rainy you might want to make other plans",
          "The artwork is absolutely worth the trip for couples or family it is a beautiful sight to see while visiting Minneapolis. Besides the sculpture garden being free it is over a vast amount of land and offers some active walking around and phenomenal photo opportunities for",
          "I visited the Sculpture garden after touring the adjacent museum. It was a nice small park in the downtown area, but not really more than that. It had some sculptures and nice benches but I certainly don't recommend going out of your way to go specifically to see the garden.",
          "The morning is a wonderful time to visit. Such great pieces in this collection! Represents minneapolis's love for art!",
          "I saw a lot of the negative posts on this garden but to me it was definitely worth visiting. My favorite was the tree with the chimes.",
          "What's not to love about the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden!?Iconic sculptures such as \"LOVE,\" \"Hahn/Cock,\" and the spoonbridge and cherry connect us to the Minneapolis Art. Everything I thought it would be! I found this park on instagram when looking up places for my trip. I",
          "Nice and relaxing walk around the varied sculptures in this garden a few minutes from the downtown. Adults will love walking around and kids playing and feeding the ducks of the pond.",
          "Very interesting art in a park setting. The most popular item is the cherry on a large spoon fountain, in the middle of a pond. Unfortunately, I don't care for contemporary art, so I was not impressed with the museum, but we ate at the restaurant in the museum, and the food",
          "Gorgeous art, paths and prairie ecosystem restoration too. Fun for everyone. The teens liked the photo opportunities and the grownups enjoyed the varied art.",
          "Well worth some time when you are in Minneapolis. Great pieces on grounds that are very well kept. Go see.",
          "This is a great park to take a break and enjoy the sculptures. This is the best thing I enjoyed from Minneapolis and recommend you visit. You can come for as little as 15 mins till and hour or so. There is also a museum nearby, and another park frequented by locals.",
          "Good time! It started out easy parking, inside the city that's a huge plus. Much of the artwork is very modern, which I enjoyed immensely. Wonderful areas to sit under the trees, that was a bonus because I love to people watch. The fun capper to the afternoon... ice cream man",
          "This sculpture garden was on our must-see list after seeing it on the television show, \"Aerial America\". It did not disappoint. The garden covers 19 acres, and is home to more than 40 large scale sculptures. Don't miss the sails, the \"Spider\", the blue rooster, the horse, and",
          "As part of a Sunday Funday walking adventure we slid into the Sculpture Garden after the Walker. There is some awesome works of art here and it is laid out to be adaptable for future pieces. I am glad we walked through this section of town.",
          "Went here on recommendations from a dear friend that lives here. Great outdoor space with some impressive art pieces. Great for both children and adults and lots of parking. Loved it here!",
          "Our families met at the sculpture garden for a nice walk and viewing. Young grandson loved the areas to run and the wide spaces. Lots of newer sculptures",
          "This park is right across the street from the Walker Art Gallery. It has about 12-14 sculptures. Very interesting walk. You can't spend much time there but there are some really interesting sculptures (especially the BLUE HEN and the Spoon and Cherry).",
          "Right next to the Walker Art Museum is a fun sculpture garden which for an urban park feels like being anywhere but in a city, (that is until you look up and see the city buildings beyond the mature row of trees which border the garden. There are a variety of fascinating",
          "Walk there through Loring Greenway and experience urban park in its summer splendour. Sculptures are amazing and fun. Fave is the running hare but spoon and cherry and big blue rooster are obviously amazing. Go there!",
          "Great outdoor massive sculptures. Paved walkways to get you close to the art. City landscape in background. Unnusual, interesting art.",
          "I was so pleased that we all enjoyed walking around and looking at the sculptures together. We started inside and that helped because the art inside was so different, and difficult to relate to. The sculptures were fun and funny. We got a Bird scooter to share, the ice cream",
          "Great way to spend an hour or two. We enjoyed walking around the well maintained Sculpture Garden. Lots of families were there and lots of area to have a picnic. Parking is close by. Well worth the time.",
          "Tracking alone is sometimes tricky but I felt completely safe here! Tons of families around so you had a wait a minute for your photo oops. Admission free but there is a charge for parking.",
          "We rode our bikes here. As long as we walked our bikes around it was fine. It was do nice walking around and looking at all the sculptures. There was a field trip here and lots of families. It was so nice seeing them enjoy the art.",
          "The iconic cherry is back after being refurbished. In fact, the whole garden has a beauty make-over it is great. New sculptures. A fabulous view of DT Minneapolis. Play mini-golf on the top of the Walker while you are at it. Worth it all around.",
          "Mu daughter wanted her senior pictures in an urban area as she loves the city - what better place than the sculpture garden?? It was a beautiful day - a little on the hot side, but the misters were going from the cherry in the spoon. We got great pics on the wall of the garden,",
          "This is a great spot for an evening walk. It provides a nice view of downtown along with beautiful sculptures. A few bars and restaurants are walk-able from here. These include Esker Grove, which has a nice bar and Lurcat Cafe which has both a nice bar and one of the best",
          "If the weather is nice, this can be a nice way to be outside, take a stroll and look at some artwork. It is free other than parking.",
          "Pretty, formal urban park but well connected to other green areas. Very popular in the summer. Has metered parking.",
          "Park was reinnovated in 2017, looks great, still has Cherry and spoon for grp photos and iconic Minneapolis skyline as backdrop. Also other interesting sculptures too.",
          "Not sure what some reviewers were expecting to find here- The Thinker ? that\u2019s in Paris . The David ? that\u2019s in Florence This is a contemporary space showing appropriate art- albeit expensive art If you do not dig the art - then go for the space which is terrific And there is",
          "Visited one morning while in Minneapolis for a few days. Very enjoyable. Only reason I don\u2019t give it five stars is the gardens are simply grass lawns could use some shrubbery/flowers. We planned on going to the adjacent walker art Gallery that made the error of going on a Monday",
          "Read the reviews so I took some out of town guests to visit. We all thought the only great sculpture was the spoon. Open field with about 12 sculptures. We thought we must be missing part of the garden, but no that was it. Teenagers were bored as were the adults.",
          "Walked from downtown to the sculpture park. A little disappointed but still glad we ventured over. A blue cock and found the cherry.",
          "This place is another terrific park to enjoy. The sculptures go on and on... For free!!! Parking right nextdoor for $4.00 per day.",
          "My partner and I visited the sculpture garden on our recent trip to Minneapolis. It was a fun way to spend an hour or so: \u2022We walked to Minneapolis Sculpture Garden from Downtown Minneapolis. We took Nicolett Avenue to the Loring Greenway and then passed through Loring",
          "The Sculpture Garden is a beautiful place to take a peaceful walk surrounded by over forty outdoor sculptures. From the nice to the crazy, a variety of art is found in the Sculpture Garden. The center piece is \"Spoonbridge and Cherry\" by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. I",
          "Spent a couple of hours here on a beautiful Monday afternoon. Lots of fun sculptures. Among our favorites, a horse which looked like wood but was melt along, a big blue rooster, a spoonful of cherry and Love. The beautiful word, love. Lots of restoration going on to return part",
          "I saw the sculpture garden in passing and decided to pull over. It was extremely interesting, however I am not an artist nor am I overly artistic in terms of abstract sculptures. I can appreciate the level of effort however most of this goes over my head but if its your thing, I",
          "The Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is a very cool outdoor modern art installation with many different pieces. We've been to a few outdoor art installations and I think the Minneapolis one beats the Storm King Art Center in upstate NY and Olymlic Sculpture Park in Seattle.",
          "This is considered a must see in Minneapolis, but I think it's overrated. The spoon and cherry are what is always shown and, along with a giant rooster, is a main attraction. The other sculptures are just average. Some are odd, abstract art. If pressed for time, I would choose",
          "The city calls this the crown jewel of their parks system. So come walk around this amazing space & see why. You don\u2019t have to be an art lover to enjoy. Don\u2019t miss. It\u2019s free, easily accessible & open all year round.",
          "We had a wonderful time wandering around the Sculpture Garden on a muggy August afternoon. The majesty and variety of the pieces impressed us very much. The Oldenburg Spoonbridge with Cherry is a whimsical centerpiece, but no more memorable than many other masterpieces. As an",
          "If you're looking for something to do outdoors that's low impact and free, take a stroll through the Sculpture Garden. The artwork is delightful and there is enough space that you aren't competing with others to read about the artists and their work. I thoroughly enjoyed taking",
          "We only visited the sculpture garden and not the nearby museum but my kids loved it and we all enjoyed having some space to roam after a lot of hours traveling. Many of the sculptures were ones that they could just look at but several were more hands on that they could touch or",
          "Great way to spend the afternoon. Many sculptures throughout the park to browse and enjoy. Take a lunch and make a day of it.",
          "We were visiting friends who took us here to see the wonderful sculptures. It was a very relaxing place and we especially loved the spoon and cherry. All of the sculptures were unique and the tree with the wind chimes was a surprise. So nice that a place like this is free so",
          "It's a small park with very interesting sculptures. Some sculptures are interactive. Nice to sit and enjoy the view. It's right next to the highway so that view isn't the best.",
          "This is a fantastic exhibit of very large art works. Several piece here are found in many books magazines and pictures. And it is FREE. WOW We took 3 boys (11,12, & 14). They enjoyed the whole experience Now can say they saw spoon/cherry and blue roster. Icons . Several of the",
          "I really enjoyed the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. It was relaxing just walking around and enjoying the sculptures. It is also free which makes it even better. My most favorite part was the tree with alot of windchimes in it. Relaxing.",
          "One of the iconic places of Minneapolis, it worths a visit! Beautiful, with so many activities during the summertime ,and...did I mentioned that is beautiful?!? Oh yes, it is!! Lol",
          "Loved the museum and sculpture garden. Many fun art pieces. Enjoyed a free Thursday evening admission to the museum. Great place for everyone!!",
          "Very nice place. Great people, friendly and active. Great experience. We took a lot of pictures of the various sculptures. Super.",
          "I really enjoy sculpture and am glad I got to experience the Sculpture Garden. We were there on a Wednesday morning. It was not busy at all when we got there, and then three summer camp/day camp groups showed up toward the end of our visit. The art is lovely, and my entire",
          "This is a quick walk around a park. If you get a chance see it during the day and night. It will give you 2 different views and is less crowded during the evening. The park is very near the Basilica which is a must see!",
          "Maybe I just have no culture, but I don't really understand much of it. You can look online for more information about the sculptures, but I would have loved the stories to be next to the forms of art. The windchime tree was interesting- recommend it for anyone who hates their",
          "The outdoor sculpture park is great, but I have to admit that I was expecting more of the art installations to be as good as the cherry spoon.",
          "This is fun to stroll through if you have the chance. Neat sculptures and the grounds are very pretty. There were lots of people and more than one group of folks taking wedding pics, but we were also there on a busy Saturday afternoon. It was an unusually hot summer day and I",
          "We really liked the park & parking was not a issue. We went as a family & really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere & appreciated the out art",
          "For me it was just something to look at. I can understand if you enjoy taking picture, you can have some fun with your camera, but thats it.",
          "Nice walk through Loring Green walkway to get to the sculpture garden. It was fun to see. It was a hot day and the kids loved running through the sprinkler to cool down. Fun to see some of the sculptures, but we were too hot to see them all.",
          "This is a beautiful park and a pleasure to walk through on a pretty day. The sculptures are so imaginative, fun and bigger than life. The array of color and form holds your interest as you meander from one section to the next. The pathways are level and easy to maneuver.",
          "***This review is for the sculpture garden only, not the museum. Other reviews I've read have jumbled the two. I love art. I studied art throughout college. I appreciate everything from Neoclassicism to Impressionism, even a lot of modernism, not so much contemporary art. That",
          "We went to the sculpture garden on a beautiful summer day! Very pretty grounds with many interesting sculptures to look at. Loved how some of them had a story about the art and the artist. The grounds have a lot of very nice flowers and was really well maintained and a pretty",
          "Nice place to enjoy a late afternoon/evening walk. There were many people enjoying the gardens. Also a few joggers utilizing the grounds. They are building a walkway bridge connecting the city to the sculpture gardens. Great place to stop and enjoy the artwork.",
          "Some of the art is just out there, but there are some really cool pieces to view. Loring Park, across the street, is a favorite as well.",
          "Fun, for all ages. And open anytime of day. This is a nice break after a lot of indoor activities. It\u2019s a great spot for kids to run off some energy or for a nice walk at any age.",
          "You can pay $4 to park or $5 to park in the covered parking lot, you basically just walk around a park and see about 10 different sculptures",
          "The sculpture garden is affiliated with an art museum ( which does charge admission), however the outdoor sculpture garden was free. It\u2019s a nice walk though the area and the sculptures are fun, unique, and provide great photo opportunities. Doesn\u2019t take long and we\u2019ll worth",
          "The kids and I enjoyed going through the park and viewing the sculptures. The grounds and walkways are well kept and easy to navigate. For photographers, you have to take pictures from certain angles because of all of the construction in Minneapolis right now. My older kids",
          "This was a relaxing summer afternoon walk on our first day in Minneapolis. We had never seen a sculpture garden before and enjoyed doing something different. The kids got a kick out of the cherry and spoon as well as the giant blue rooster. The activity was free and kept my",
          "My husband and I spent about 45 minutes walking around and checking out the sculptures. Everything is well maintained, and the descriptions for each sculpture are interesting. I wouldn't have wanted to spend a lot more time (it was hot!) there, but it was a fun activity!",
          "Sculpture garden was great to walk around. Kids enjoyed seeing the cherry on the spoon in real life as they have seen it many times in media.",
          "This trip was my husband and I and our two girls ages 10 and 13 years old. I would say half of the art was good really good and the other half was like\"ok\".... The cherry on a spoon sprays I mist which feels really good since it was warm out ! It does have a parking lot that you",
          "Wasn't really that amped-up to go see a spoon and a cherry, but I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Don't expect anything mind-blowing here, but this is a peaceful walk and a good way to spend part of an afternoon.",
          "We visited the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden about 1-2 hours before sunset on July 2. The highlight is most definitely the cherry sculpture, but all the others are interesting and I enjoyed reading about them and their artists. I learned that St. Laurence is the patron saint of",
          "Mainly a few large installations. I think most people go there for the spoon with cherry fountain. There are some other interesting pieces, but it can all be taken in fairly quickly.",
          "This was such a wonderful experience!!! After a day of rain, the sun came out and made this destination a great Sunday evening stroll!!! Loved the sculptures and explanations. When visiting, one MUST read the benches - makes one think, laugh, then think some more!",
          "The reopening of the park in 2017 was marred by the controversy over the sculpture \u201cscaffold\u201d an interactive piece meant to be climbed on by children. It was hard to imagine how the Walker could have commissioned a replica of the scaffolding on which 38 Dakota were executed",
          "Although parking cost is a bit steep, this was a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours outside. There are a lot of side exhibits, but the main route allows you to see everything. Not a lot of shade, though, if it's in the upper 90s",
          "There's a good variety of things to enjoy here. Some of the artwork is whimsical (like the famous spoon and cherry), while others are more abstract and thought-provoking. Take lots of photos \u2014 it's fun to look for unique angles for pictures.",
          "Loved the modern art in this park! Find free street parking, even if you go up a street to the area around the Walker center. The park doesn't take long to go through and paying $5 to park is silly. Definitely check out this park for good photo opportunities when in Minneapolis!",
          "We stopped here for some photos by the sculptures and visited the museum as it was the first Saturday of the month and it was free entry.The sculptures are nice to see,some better than others.The museum itself is nice but the art was good and bad.Just depends what your taste of",
          "I chose this location to take some maternity shots for my website and all the photos turned out great! There are tons of fun sculptures to see but I'm really sad they removed the hedge arches that can still be found in google search photos.",
          "The spoon and cherry are the iconic symbol of the garden but the infamous blue chicken could probably be seen from space. This rooster is one color, a hideous blue. It is not the best sculpture garden I have ever seen but it doe have some color and it a nice area to walk.",
          "Located just outside the downtown area. We enjoyed a couple of hours looking at all of the art. Everything from the rooster to a spoon and cherry - even a love piece similar to the one in Philly.",
          "Walking through Loring Park to the Basilica of St. Mary we discovered the Sculpture Garden and decided to visit. The location is nice and getting there will probably be easier once the walkway across the highway is finished. There seemed to be a lot of grounds under maintenance,",
          "Held the interest of everyone in our group. We had people from ages 13-55 years old. Great spring summer day trip. Clean, friendly, and handicap assessable.",
          "The cherry on the spoon is iconic. The rest? Kind of strange. It is a nice well kept park. It\u2019s art, so it is truely at the eye of the beholder",
          "The plants are in the process of growing so lots of areas where you have to keep off the grass...but the sculptures themselves are really fun to walk around and look at. Great photo opportunities everywhere",
          "The cherry in the spoon has become an iconic symbol of Minneapolis. The sculpture garden is a great place to visit on a nice day. Go for a half hour stroll and some tranquility, or spend half a day reading about the sculptures and appreciating the art.",
          "This sculpture garden in the heart of Minneapolis has a mixture of the profound, the amusing, and the head-scratching. Fortunately the balance is more towards the first two categories, with the two most iconic pieces in the park falling squarely into the \"amusing\"",
          "This sculpture garden is currently being overhauled. There are still many of the old favorites, with new installations as well. It won't be finished until next year.",
          "Don't miss this stop when you're in Minneapolis! Such an incredible experience. Thanks to those who had the foresight to establish this incredible park/garden/art exhibit.",
          "They keep updating this garden, which makes it a great place to visit time and time again -- and, all year long. Part of living in a place that has four seasons is visiting different landmarks in all four seasons. This place is a breath of fresh air in the spring and summer,",
          "Loved this sculpture garden. Doing an actual tour with a guide gave us a much more appreciation of the garden.",
          "So lucky to be able to walk over to the sculpture garden anytime. The redone space is much friendlier and seems to be more popular. I can't wait to do a free dance exercise class in the garden July 5. Sorry I missed the first one. Doesn't hurt that Fisker Grove, the restaurant",
          "Enjoy walking on the paths. Lots of room for strollers. The sculptures are fun for kids to look at at.",

          "I always love going to the Sculpture Garden to see both the new and old sculptures! The iconic Spoonbridge with Cherry and the new Hahn/Cock are both fun to visit and view. I enjoy strolling around the paths (which are always clean, by the way) and chatting with tourists and",
          "The sculpture garden is a quiet area close to downtown Minneapolis and across from the Walker which we usually combine with in a visit. The extensive renovation has removed some of the most interesting outdoor exhibits and we look forward to future acquisitions.",
          "Easy stroll through lovely park grounds . The sculptures were nice to look at although would benefit from more explanation Park was beautiful even with nearby construction. Plus it\u2019s free",
          "Few world class art museums boast a glorious sculpture garden and an annual rock show! So cool...tons of fun as usual!",
          "Beautiful outdoor area of the City. Make sure you park in the nearby Walker parking garage. No charge to view sculptures, close to downtown, with beautiful skyline views.",
          "Super fun to walk here from downtown hotels to take some great pictures. We had fun walking here and looking at the art.",
          "I really don\u2019t get abstract art, but it was something to do in Minneapolis. Maybe budget one hour for this.",
          "Some of the reviews are a little harsh. Taken for what it is, it is a great place to just walk around and see a few sculptures. Yeah, maybe they are not connected to each other and maybe they don't seem to make sense, but I didn't find that necessary to enjoy the nice walk",
          "We had some extra time, so we decided to check out the sculpture garden. It was on Sunday, so parking was easy (only $1) in the museum garage. You don't need a lot of time. There are several sculptures that make no sense and several that really are not art. This was",
          "I love the sculptures. The Spoonbridge and Cherry is a must. My problem is the confusing parking garage. I was charged double for parking. The staff were not helpful.",
          "The garden is a very large square (with a parking lot) on which you can see the sculptures. It is a quick tour. From there, it is also possible to go see the squirrels on the park across the street and go to the St. Mary Basilica. Good tour for pictures.",
          "Experimental art is titillating and interesting, but in the end the sculpture garden is ugly. Definitely not an improvement to the landscape.",
          "Really neat, very unique park. We walked down from Sisyphus Brewery and had a great time checking out all of the artwork.",
          "Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is a must see when in the city, there is ample parking space and readily accessible by public transportation. There are other points of interest surrounding the area. You\u2019ll enjoy walking around and exploring what\u2019s in the area.",
          "Good diversion while kids at soccer practice at the field across the lot. Fun public art and easy walk ways to stroll in relatively confined urban space. Art museum across the street is a great place to end with a cocktail or lemonade on a hot day.",
          "What a great place to let the kids experience some great sculptures and the great weather. Our kids really enjoyed the gardener and exploring.",
          "love this place. my kids love to run around the place and it is a great place to take good pictures.",
          "Loved my walk through this city park in downtown Minneapolis. It\u2019s a peaceful park with various sculptures in grassy spaces and along sidewalks. It\u2019s Home to the Spoonbridge & Cherry, the Love cube, and a giant blue rooster, among many other modern works. It\u2019s also a great place",
          "Takes about 45 minutes to stroll around and look at all the sculptures. Had a picknic in the garden in lovely weather and had an excellent day there.",
          "Unfortunately the footbridge is currently out of action so access is only via crossing the busy road. The garden is beautifully kept. The sculptures are beautiful. Really enjoyed my visit.",
          "Do not miss if in the area and have a nice outdoor weather day to enjoy here. We enjoyed it more than we thought we would, and spent more time as they have nice sitting areas all around to sit and relax. Free and we found free parking on the street facing the back entrance.",
          "Nice little sculpture park. Was able to walk around and see the many works of art. You will have to pay to park and the parking lot we were in needs lots of work. Pot holes everywhere.",
          "I drive by the sculpture garden almost every day, but only think to visit when company comes to town. Spoonbridge and Cherry is an iconic landmark and it's fun to see Hahn/Cock (a giant blue rooster) having initially seen it in Trafalgar Square a few years ago. It's a lovely",
          "Unfortunately it started raining just add I arrived d do I cut my visit short. It is still ok in the rain but I was not prepared for rain. Just walk around at your leisure and see what catches your fancy.",
          "My parents are not the best on the knees. However, they did not want to miss one peice of art in the park. There was so many cool pieces to see.",
          "Wonderful creative smaller park close to downtown. Well worth seeing. Very doable in a short time, great for families with kids.",
          "Enjoyed the hour we spent here. Interesting artists (and art) and grounds. Open after hours, meaning after the Walker closes. Parking is $5 or you might find street parking.",
          "Park with great artwork and a nice place to rest while watching baseball on the adjacent ground. Street parking is best and they even have a paid parking lot with a flat rate of $4 for the whole day.",
          "This outdoor sculptures garden, with the famous of a huge cherry on a even bigger spoon, very interesting to look at different displays and walking around the garden.",
          "What a wonderful park to spend some time with family and friends. You can't go wrong with a visit to this park - it the best price in town - ALL FREE. Plan on at least a one hour visit or longer if you love artwork. Walk around, get some exercise, enjoy the unique sculptures",
          "I'm not much of an art person, but I enjoyed walking around the park for an hour or so. Like most art exhibits, I wouldn't recommend it for kids as there isn't really a lot for kids to do in the gardens. They do have a nice picnic area for lunch. Parking costs $5, so a bit much",
          "This park is nice for a quick stop to stretch your legs. You must pay to park in the parking lot. We were there during off season. Cute to walk around to see the various structures, but I can't imagine doing it in the summer. There is no shade in a vast majority of the park.",
          "This park seemed barren. I know it was almost May, but grass seemed green else where. It did not seem inviting.",
          "Even sloshing through the melting snow did not deter us from traipsing around the giant, wonderful sculptures. A Calder mobile was one of my favorites, along with a big blue rooster that is making its rounds across the world. After a refreshing stroll, cross the street to see",
          "Amazing park that is a must do when in town. The weather needs to cooperate in order to fully enjoy the garden. The Blue Rooster was my favorite. Really worth it!!",
          "The Big, Blue Rooster is fascinating! There were some new sculptures but it didn't take to long to walk around and see everything. It was something to do and enjoy as part of Minneapolis. If you have an hour or two to spare take a stroll!!",
          "We came here on s beautiful Saturday morning. Not too crowded and and the sculptures were awesome. Great for selfies! Only downfall, no public restrooms near.",
          "The sculpture garden has some nice pieces and the Museum (Walker Art Center) next door is well worth visiting as well.",
          "The Minneapolis sculpture garden is a attraction you should not miss! This great space is situated right on the edge of the city on Minneapolis. The walker is right next to the garden as well. There is a variety of works by numerous well known artists. The newly designed garden",
          "Beyond the Cherry & Spoon is a the Blue Chicken, a spectacle in itself. It's a beautiful walk particularly on warm day/ Stop at the Walker for a show or cocktail or both.",
          "It\u2019s a fun place to stop! As locals, we like to take visitors here to see the cherry! The recent renovations are nice and my favorite is the tree with windchimes!!",
          "You will have to pay a little for parking, but it's worth it. We spent about an hour walking and reading about the sculptures. Most were interactive, meaning you could walk into them or on them.",
          "What a treasure of beautiful, interesting and fun artwork. We had such an enjoyable experience checking out all of the interesting pieces and taking pictures.",
          "I've been here a couple of times and it was nice. But I can see from the highway, they've got the new sculptures up. I like visiting during spring and summer so I get to see the out door plants as well.",
          "So fun to see so many significant works by world renowned artists, Calder, De Suervo, Fritsch, Kcho, Cragg, Serra, Kelly to name a few. The large installation by Mark Manders was our favorite, not sure why. Easy to spend an hour hour without realizing how much significant",
          "Looks like some new sculptures since my last visit. Glad they kept the iconic cherry and spoon. The museum next door is wonderful too.",
          "This is a fun and unique sight to see, but not a place I would particularly recommend or want to visit again.",
          "Making a day downtown during the summer always includes some time at the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. Easy on the street parking, or in the ramp at the Walker Arts Center affords us easy access. There's even mini-golf which helps keep the kids engaged.",
          "This provides for some unique things to look at and walk around. Each item has its own story picture opportunity.",
          "These sculpture garden was located right outside of the Walker Museum. It was a bit cold but very iconic and fun sculptures. Great for taking pictures. You only need 20 minutes to really hit all the sculptures.",
          "A great park to walk around and some great art to have a look at. The kids could not resist climbing on it though. Also wrap up warm as it was blowing hard throughout. There was an underground parking lot and some on toad parking. Then further around a pay and display",
          "My friend and I had to take a picture with the iconic \"Spoon and Cherry\" sculpture. It\"s a quiet park in the middle of the city.",
          "Anytime is a good time for visiting... we had lots of fun.. interesting stories to read... absolutely worth it \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Such a neat place to visit. We are from Wisconsin and we go to Mall of America every year. We never miss visiting this park. It's a symbol of Minneapolis",
          "Cheery & Spoon park, Big purple color Roster are center of attraction at this park. You can spend quality time.",
          "I feel like this park is a must see, because of the Spoonbridge and Cherry centerpiece and the view behind it, bit other than that it wasn\u2019t much more to see. Do combine with the Walker Art Centre across the street to make your visit worthwhile.",
          "I visited the Sculpture Garden before the remodeling. It was not curated in the most intuitive way. However, it is one the Twin Cities' landmarks and worth the visit. If you happen to be in Des Moine, the Pappajohn Sculpture Park is amazing. I love their Jaume Plensa's Nomade.",
          "Stumbled upon this while driving around. Fun place to take photos and explore. Parking was easy and there are other things to walk to from here- museum, food.",
          "We went to this park in February, where temps were in the single digit. Most sculptures where covered with snow, but what we saw I was not very impressed. The LOVE sculpture is In Philadelphia and various other city, so to me not original.. The cherry and spoon what was the only",
          "Great place to bring kids, elementary or middle school aged. We like to hand out in downtown Minneapolis and make it a point to walk from Nicolette ave to the garden. It\u2019s s bit of a hike but not strenuous. It\u2019s actually a lovely walk. The park itself is really unique. We aren\u2019t",
          "Whether you're a tourist or long time resident of Minneapolis, this is a must see. The sculpture garden is free and a good place to go for a walk, stop by during lunch, or a picnic. Just across 94 from Loring Park and Basilica of St Mary, it's a good area to visit!",
          "The gardens are interesting but not spectacular. There is miniature golf, which is more interesting. Otherwise not worth the visit!",
          "Did you know that the Sculpture Garden across from the Walker Art Center is open all year round? In fact, all of the parks in Minneapolis are open 12 months a year. If you haven't thought to go during the winter, it is worth your time as long as you bundle up with a warm fleece",
          "This is a great spot to spend a quite summer morning or afternoon. All redone the place is amazing and great views of the cities",
          "Great place for couples or families. Get some fresh air and see beauty. Highly recommend. Plan to walk. Pick a day with great weather conditions. Take you phone to snap pictures.",
          "Fun and exciting place to visit. The sculptures are amazing and the people who visit are cheerful and fun to mingle with. The park puts everyone in a wonderful mood. The new sculptures and upgrades are worth the visit. The fact that it\u2019s free is a real plus.",
          "Recently renovated, the Sculpture Garden is one of the main attractions to visit while in Minneapolis. The famous Spoon Cherry bridge is the most known. Beautiful view of downtown Minneapolis at night",
          "The new upgrades to one of the city's treasures is worth a visit. There is a wonderful variety of traditional and modern sculptures from local and international artists. It is hard to miss the iconic cherry on a spoon but the new blue rooster is a favorite. While you are",
          "Fun sculpture garden with paths and some shade. Interesting to look at. Some make noise. Has the famous MNPLS landmark \u201cSpoon with Cherry\u201d. Fountain. Park is across the bridge over the highway. Snack bar. Mini golf.",
          "This is a great sculpture garden that is free to the public. The parking lot is a bit pricey but still worth it. It has the iconic Spoon and Cherry that Minneapolis is known for. I highly recommend!",
          "Perfect stop on a warm January day! Sculptures were a beautiful mix of different styles - very fun experience!",
          "At least once a year, we head to the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. They had some work done and the update and additions are wonderful. No ruining the surprise - go for yourself and enjoy! You will make it a yearly tradition!",
          "Everything is large and you must visit the Sculpture Garden whilst in Minneapolis. It's nice in the summer when the days are long and hot and just as magical in the winter when everything is covered in snow.",
          "I visited the sculpture garden in January with sub-zero temperatures. From the sections I saw, it seemed really neat and creative (this is coming from a non-artsy person.) My only regret is that the weather prohibited us from seeing the whole thing (really I can only blame",
          "On our first trip to Minneapolis, we took a stroll through this super cool park in -2 degree weather, and it was worth it. I am not particularly interested in art, but I was impressed with the creative sculptures. No matter if you're into art or not, at least take a quick walk",
          "We went to this park because it's very beautiful, it's impossible to have a long time because the cold. We made a nice pictures and we visited the Museum in front of the park.",
          "This is a landmark and it is part of an wonderful sculpture park (small enough to be manageable) and an indoor plant area with a great fish sculpture. It is also next to the Walker modern art museum which had a great restaurant. Finally it has easy access to freeways.",
          "I love going to the sculpture garden when I am in Minneapolis! It is so easy to get to and park. They have some fun, whimsical & beautiful sculptures to see. Who doesn't want to take a photo with the iconic cherry & spoon sculpture while visiting Minnesota! This is good for all",
          "I arrived at my hotel way before check-in and this famous cherry spoon thing was only a mile away so I took a walk over there. I enjoyed the walk from the Loews, spent about an hour marveling at the sculptures, then went through the art museum. I definitely recommend checking it",
          "Great cultures, great space. Open all year. If you like cold weather, visit it in the winter, it has a whole different atmosphere with snow and clear blue skys (but dress appropriately and visit at a time the Walker Art Center is open to warm-up in) . Still has the iconic Spoon",
          "Don't miss the sculpture garden. So many iconic pieces that define the Minneapolis art scene. You should visit at least once.",
          "Nice park to walk around in. We park in the walker art center lot since it's only 5 bucks. If it's not busy with screaming kids it's a great way to spend a peaceful morning or afternoon.",
          "We've been here several times, with and without kids. It is a completely pleasant experience, a walk in the parking with art. One warning, don't go on a really hot sunny day as there is not a lot of shade in some areas. Parking across the street.",
          "This is located at a central place. There are several interesting statues, such as the spoon and the apple, which is probably the best known one but there are others also beautiful and interesting, everything in a great garden.",
          "There have been extensive changes to the sculpture garden. While I hope that others like it, we were very disappointed particularly when compared to what the gardens used to be like.",
          "Minneapolis is a cool city, but the sculpture garden really does nothing for me. If you want to go to a tourist trap to get a picture with the cherry in the spoon, have at it, because this place is for you.",
          "I loved the variety of sculptures scattered throughout the garden, in sight of downtown Minneapolis. If you like miniature golf, this is the place for it - 18 holes made by artists.",
          "This is an unusual and pleasant attraction for anyone young, old, active or sedentary. There is a lot to see and it\u2019s handicap accessible or cycle down and walk your bike thru the park. Kids can run to their hearts content while the adults observe and contemplate the art. A fun",
          "I was actually just riding around and we saw all of these huge beautiful sculptures in a park like setting. It was awesome and the kids will love it.",
          "Who isn\u2019t impressed by a giant cherry on a spoon? I appreciate the openness of the area and being able to let small children run, teenagers roam and couples stroll all in the same place.",
          "While some have complained about the removal of a number of trees, most, including our family, find it masterful. The new garden is more wide-open and welcoming. One can still sit and enjoy, and have a feeling of calm. The art and the activities make this a great place for",
          "This place is definitely interesting. If you are artistic, it's definitely worth going to. If you are not, it's still fun to see, although you probably won't spend more than an hour there.",
          "The recent upgrades have resulted in a beautiful space that feels more like an outdoor gallery. Lots of information on the sculptures which deepens viewer appreciation. Sculptures are well positioned to take advantage of parts of the city as a backdrop.",
          "I've been a fan of the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden at the Walker Art Museum for many years. However, since the renovation of the garden with additions to the pieces on display, the garden is significantly improved. Lines of site are more conducive to taking in the immensity of",
          "They have a very interesting mini golf in the park which we had to pay for but it was worth the fun as it's quite different than your normal mini golf parks. Very nice walk around the sculpture garden as well.",
          "From the new sculpture garden amenities to the miniature golf course to a wide open expanse and spaces the sculpture garden is a true treasure attached to Parade Stadium and the Walker! Even if you\u2019re not the art aficionado make sure you take the time to spend a half an hour",
          "Free, fun and stimulating\u2014what\u2019s not to love? The approach is visually quite stimulating. There are several dozen unrelated gigantic installations throughout this outdoor space adjacent to the Walker Center. The area felt like 4-5 footballs. If you desire to observe each",
          "This is an interesting and relaxing place. It is good to go here for a stroll on a nice day, wether you are solo, a couple, or a family with young children.",
          "Just a short walk from our hotel, and close to the city itself, this location offered great photo opportunities. The main site was the spoon bridge, but it is worth spending time looking at the many other attractions in this peaceful park area. We went early in the morning, and",
          "We stopped by the sculpture garden after a long day of sightseeing. It was nice to walk among the sculptures. There are bathrooms available and benches for resting. I don't recommend the miniature golf course. It's too expensive and too long. It's also in poor condition. Still",
          "Go on a nice day, it is a great way to kill an hour. Free. Lots of photo opportunities. 20-30 art installations.",
          "Sculpture gardens can be amazing, but this one is a failure. The collection is great with the big names...Calder, LeWitt, Nevelson, but the work is too close together to give any one piece the space and attention it deserves. You see others behind each piece like they're at a",
          "The sculpture garden connect to Loring Park. Lot to do and see here. Nice family outing. Beautiful place for a relaxing walk and meditation.",
          "This area of Minneapolis is fascinating to walk or drive by on any type of day... whether it's winter, spring, summer or fall . . . I have driven past the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden shortly after living in the Minneapolis area five years after returning.",
          "I have loved the Sculpture Garden from its inception. But the recent rennovations broke my heart. What was once a charming collection of semi private, evergreen tree-bordered Secret Garden \"rooms\" filled with benches, lawns, and fanciful sculptures, is now an open flat field",
          "this is a wonderful modern sculpture garden that is free to the public. Some of the work is more interesting than others. But it is all worthwhile. You will not feel as if you have wasted your time. Summer is the best time to visit as the kiosk is open.",
          "I\u2019ve visited Minneapolis a couple of times over the past few months, and each time the garden was being renovated. I headed back this time and my patience was rewarded with remarkable sculptures that I got to experience with the perfect backdrop of...light snow! This sculpture",
          "A must visit location if you\u2019re in Minneapolis for work but can still use some of the early evening to take a walk or a run. The sculptures have names and the history behind them.",
          "I have been here several times over the past 30 years of visiting Minneapolis. It never fails to capture my interest. It was fun to see some old favorites and the new redo of the garden. I loved the blue chicken!",
          "I have lived in Minnesota my whole life and never visited this place until today (at 23). I finally got to see the spoon with the cherry and it was as awesome as I expected it would be. Lots of other great sculptures, unfortunately the Walker Art Center was closed as it was a",
          "I visited on a day the neighboring Walker Art Center had free admission. So wonderful to see so many families enjoying such a special outdoor space.",
          "This is so clever and beautifully designed. The cherry on spoon is exceptionally clever and worth the free visit",
          "I like art, but this is a little out there for my taste. I prefer more traditional art, but if you like eclectic or modern art, this might be the place for you. It is definitely an interesting place, there are a couple dozen or so outdoor sculptures, some of them are very",
          "We had a beautiful sunny day and made the most of it by walking to the Sculpture Garden. I found it nice and peaceful. An interesting place to check out on a nice day.",
          "Went after the game. Got street parking fairly easy. Easy area to walk around in and view the scuptures. There was a guided tour and we sat in on one exhibit to hear the guide. This made a difference and is recommended. Lots of photo ops given the diversity of the subject",
          "We visited in the afternoon, it was very warm, making the gardens a popular place! Very nice place with diverse pieces. I only wish I would have thought to bring lunch so that we could take it in longer.",
          "Easy tour, interesting art, great way to spend an hour or more outside. Fun for the whole family. Bring a picnic.",
          "What a fun place to take pictures of. It would be beautiful in some of the spots for Wedding photos.",
          "If you are in Minneapolis and have an hour to spare, the sculpture garden is a unique place. Make sure you read the quotes on the benches in the middle of the park, they are so much fun! There are about 25 of them carved into blocks of granite. If the weather is good it is a",
          "We went on a warm fall Friday and it was pretty crowded with families. The art was....modern! Overall a pretty chill place, and there are some trails down the block past the sports field that are relaxing.",
          "This is well worth the walk through! There is so much to see! Take a walk over the highway on the bridge (which is actually a work of art). The cherry spoon sculpture is definitely amazing to see as well. We visited in fall and the colours really added to the art.",
          "I don't get it. The \"new\" sculpture garden was a disappointment. The weather was hot and beautiful so walking around was good but there wasn't much to see. The glass palm enclosure is gone and that was one of my favorite things. So many wonderful pieces gone. Why do this?",
          "With the addition of the Blue Rooster, the sculpture garden is a nice place to go on a sunny weekend, just to meander around with the people.",
          "The best thing about the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is that it's free. I know it's me. I just don't get \"modern\" art. We walked through the park and occasionally stifled a grin. Sometimes an outright laugh. I'll admit I enjoyed the giant Blue Rooster. But was it supposed to",
          "I really enjoyed the Sculpture Garden. Some of the art is excellent. It's a very nice area of the city. Go see it if you like art or even if you just like the outdoors!",
          "On our last day we walked to the Sculpture Garden during our stay downtown. To get to the Sculpture Garden we walked through Loring Park, which had some beautiful elements to it, but needs a little upkeep. The garden had various pieces of art around the campus. The park is right",

          "The sculpture has been closed for 3 years. It is finally open again and attracts lots of attention. Some of the beloved sculptures are gone, some new appeared. Nevertheless it's while worth a visit. Come and explore it by yourself. It is free and a good place to be outside in",
          "This summer (2017) the sculpture garden was redesigned so you need to go if you: A. Haven't ever been or B. You haven't been this year. It's free, they have done an awesome job, there is a mini golf course, and the cherry on the spoon is there! If that's not enough to make you",
          "A real destination spot, and we live close enough to walk the dogs through, which is always fun. Love that it connects by pedestrian bridge to Loring Park, a huge block of park land (MPLS's version of Central Park), and that then links to Nicollet Mall. Only reason it's not",
          "If you're in Minneapolis for any amount of time, this is a great place to spend a few hours enjoying the outdoors and art. Take a picnic, go for the walk, enjoy mini golf and food stands- take the whole family or enjoy an inexpensive date!",

        "wiki": "Rockefeller Center is a large complex consisting of 19 commercial buildings covering 22 acres (89,000 m2) between 48th Street and 51st Street in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The 14 original Art Deco buildings, commissioned by the Rockefeller family, span the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, split by a large sunken square and a private street called Rockefeller Plaza. Later additions include 75 Rockefeller Plaza across 51st Street at the north end of Rockefeller Plaza, and four International Style buildings located on the west side of Sixth Avenue.\nIn 1928, the site's then-owner, Columbia University, leased the land to John D. Rockefeller Jr., who was the main person behind the complex's construction. Originally envisioned as the site for a new Metropolitan Opera building, the current Rockefeller Center came about after the Met could not afford to move to the proposed new building. Various plans were discussed before the current one was approved in 1932. Construction of Rockefeller Center started in 1931, and the first buildings opened in 1933. The core of the complex was completed by 1939.\nThe original center has several sections. Radio City, along Sixth Avenue and centered on 30 Rockefeller Plaza, includes Radio City Music Hall and was built for RCA's radio-related enterprises such as NBC. The International Complex along Fifth Avenue was built to house foreign-based tenants. The remainder of the original complex originally hosted printed media as well as Eastern Air Lines. While 600 Fifth Avenue is located at the southeast corner of the complex, it was built by private interests in the 1950s and was only acquired by the center in 1963.\nDescribed as one of the greatest projects of the Great Depression era, Rockefeller Center was declared a New York City landmark in 1985 and a National Historic Landmark in 1987. It is noted for the large quantities of art present in almost all of its Art Deco buildings, its expansive underground concourse, and its ice-skating rink. The complex is also famous for its annual lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Context ===\nThe first private owner of the site was physician David Hosack, who purchased twenty acres of rural land from New York City in 1801 for $5,000 and opened the country's first botanical garden, the Elgin Botanic Garden, on the site. The gardens operated until 1811, and by 1823, ended up in the ownership of Columbia University. Columbia moved its main campus north to Morningside Heights by the turn of the century.\n\nIn 1926, the Metropolitan Opera started looking for locations to build a new opera house to replace the existing building at 39th Street and Broadway. By 1928, Benjamin Wistar Morris and designer Joseph Urban were hired to come up with blueprints for the house.  However, the new building was too expensive for the Met to fund by itself, and John D. Rockefeller Jr. eventually gave his support to the project (John D. Rockefeller Sr., his father, was not involved). Rockefeller hired Todd, Robertson and Todd as design consultants to determine its viability. John R. Todd then put forth a plan for the Met. Columbia leased the plot to Rockefeller for 87 years at a cost of $3 million per year. The initial cost of acquiring the space, razing some of the existing buildings, and constructing new buildings was estimated at $250 million. The lease initially excluded a strip along Sixth Avenue on the west side of the plot, as well as another property on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th streets.Rockefeller hosted a \"symposium\" of architectural firms to solicit plans for the complex, but it did not yield any meaningful plans. He ultimately hired Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray; Hood, Godley & Fouilhoux; and Reinhard & Hofmeister, to design the buildings. They worked under the umbrella of \"Associated Architects\" so none of the buildings could be attributed to any specific firm. The principal builder and \"managing agent\" for the massive project was John R. Todd, one of the co-founders of Todd, Robertson and Todd. The principal architect and leader of the Associated Architects was Raymond Hood, a student of the Art Deco architectural movement. The other architects included Harvey Wiley Corbett and Wallace Harrison. L. Andrew Reinhard and Henry Hofmeister had been hired by John Todd as the \"rental architects\", who designed the floor plans for the complex.\n\nThe Metropolitan Square Corporation (the precursor to Rockefeller Center Inc.) was formed in December 1928 to oversee construction. However, the Metropolitan Opera wanted to hold out for a more favorable lease because it worried about the site's profitability. After the stock market crash of 1929, the Metropolitan Opera could not afford to move anymore, and on December 6, 1929, the plans for the new opera house were abandoned completely. In order to make a profit on the site as quickly as possible, Rockefeller devised new plans within a month so that the site could become profitable. The developers entered into talks with Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and its subsidiaries, National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), to build a mass media entertainment complex on the site. By May, RCA and its affiliates had made an agreement with Rockefeller Center managers to lease space and develop part of the complex.Todd released a new plan \"G-3\" in January 1930. Two months later, an \"H plan\" was released with facilities for \"television, music, radio, talking pictures and plays\", as well as four theaters. Under Rockefeller's plan, the demolition of the site's existing structures would start in the fall, and the complex would be complete by 1933. Another plan was announced in March 1931, but the proposal received mostly negative feedback from the public. An oval-shaped building with rooftop gardens, included in the original plan, was later replaced with four small retail buildings and a 41-story tower, comprising the current International Complex. The updated plan also included rooftop gardens and a recessed central plaza. The International Complex was eventually occupied by British, French, and Italian tenants, leading to its current name. The design of the complex was affected greatly by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required setbacks to all high street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings in order to increase sunlight for city streets.During early planning, the development was often referred to as \"Radio City\", \"Rockefeller City\", or \"Metropolitan Square\" (after the Metropolitan Square Corporation). Ivy Lee, the Rockefeller family's publicity adviser, suggested changing the name to \"Rockefeller Center\". John Rockefeller Jr. initially did not want the Rockefeller family name associated with the commercial project, but was persuaded on the grounds that the name would attract far more tenants. The name was formally changed in December 1931. Over time, the appellation of \"Radio City\" devolved from describing the entire complex to just the complex's western section, and by 1937, only the Radio City Music Hall contained the \"Radio City\" name.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nFor the project, 228 buildings on the site were razed and some 4,000 tenants relocated. Demolition of the properties began in 1930. All of the buildings' leases had been bought by August 1931, though there were some tenants on the western and southeastern edges of the plot who refused to leave their property, and Rockefeller Center was built around these buildings. Excavation of the Sixth Avenue side of the complex began in July 1931, and construction on the first buildings\u2014the Music Hall and Center Theatre\u2014began in September and November, respectively. The plans for the complex notably included Indiana Limestone on the facades of the fourteen planned buildings, and the builders ordered 14,000,000 cubic feet (400,000 m3) of limestone in December 1931, the largest such order at the time.\n\nThe RKO Building was the first structure to be completed, in September 1932, followed by the Music Hall in December 1932 and the British Empire Building in April 1933. The RCA Building's opening was delayed from May 1 to mid-May because of a controversy over Man at the Crossroads, a painting in the building's lobby, which was later covered up and removed.  A new street through the complex, Rockefeller Plaza, was constructed in stages between 1933 and 1937. The complex's famed Christmas tree in the center of the plaza was erected for the first time in December 1933, and the complex's Prometheus statue was constructed in May 1934. By July 1934, the complex had leased 80% of the available space in the six buildings that were already opened.Work on two more internationally themed retail buildings and a larger, 38-story, 512-foot (156 m) \"International Building\", started in September 1934. One of the two small buildings was already rented to Italian interests. The final small building would have been rented by Germany, but Rockefeller ruled this out in 1934 after noticing National Socialist extremism from the country's government. The empty office site was downsized and became the \"International Building North\", rented by various international tenants. In April 1935, developers opened the International Building and its wings.The underground pedestrian mall and ramp system between 48th and 51st streets was finished in early May. In 1936, an ice skating rink replaced the unprofitable retail space on the lower plaza, below ground level.The 36-story Time & Life Building, named for anchor tenant Time Inc., was completed in November 1936, replacing an empty plot on the southern block that had been used for vehicle parking. Eleven buildings had been completed by 1937 at a total cost of over $100 million. A building for Associated Press on the northern block's empty lot, which had been reserved for the Metropolitan Opera house, was topped out by June 1938 and occupied by December of that year. The presence of Associated Press and Time Inc. expanded Rockefeller Center's scope from strictly a radio-communications complex to a hub of both radio and print media. The Guild, a newsreel theater, opened in 1938 along the curve of the truck ramp below the Associated Press Building. After Nelson Rockefeller became president of Rockefeller Center in 1938, he fired John Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. The Rockefeller family started occupying the 56th floor of the RCA Building, though the offices would later expand to the 54th and 55th floors as well.A proposed 16-story building in the center of the southernmost block was offered to the Dutch government in 1938. The Dutch government did not enter the agreement because of World War II, though it did move into temporary offices in the International Building. Instead, Eastern Air Lines signed a lease for the 16-story building in June 1940. Excavation started in October 1938, and the building was topped out by April 1939. At the same time, Rockefeller Center Inc. wanted to develop the western half of the southern plot, which was partially occupied by the Center Theatre. The United States Rubber Company agreed to occupy the plot. and excavation of the U.S. Rubber Company Building site commenced in May 1939.  John Rockefeller installed the building's ceremonial final rivet on November 1, 1939, marking the completion of the original complex. However, although the final rivet had been driven, the Eastern Air Lines Building was not completed until October 1940.\n\nThe construction of the project employed between 40,000 and 60,000 people. The complex was the largest private building project ever undertaken in contemporary times. Architectural historian Carol Herselle Krinsky describes the center as \"the only large private permanent construction project planned and executed between the start of the Depression and the end of the Second World War\". According to writer Daniel Okrent, Rockefeller Center was so extensive that it was said that \"you could do anything you wanted except sleep (no hotels), pray (no churches), or not pay rent to\" John Rockefeller Jr. By fall 1939, the complex had 26,000 tenants and 125,000 daily visitors. That year, 1.3 million people went on a guided tour of Rockefeller Center or visited the RCA Building's observation deck, while 6 million people visited the underground shopping mall, and 7 million saw a performance at Rockefeller Center.\n\n\n=== World War II era ===\nEven before the U.S. officially entered World War II in 1941, Rockefeller Center was affected by the war. The Dutch government had been slated to take up one-fifth of the space at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, but could not do so because of World War II. Seven of the complex's eight travel agencies had to move elsewhere because of the war, and William Rhodes Davis, a tenant who shipped oil to Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, was denied a lease renewal in 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Rockefeller Center Inc. terminated all lease agreements with German, Italian, and Japanese tenants because their respective countries comprised the Axis powers, whom the United States were fighting against. Art on Palazzo d'Italia was taken down because they were seen as being fascist, and the Rainbow Room was closed to the public from 1943 to 1950. Instructions for blackouts and sandbags for extinguishing fires were placed throughout the complex. During the war, the RCA Building's Room 3603 became the primary location of the U.S. operations of British Intelligence's British Security Co-ordination, organized by William Stephenson. It also served as the office of Allen Dulles, who would later head the Central Intelligence Agency.Rockefeller Center only became profitable after the last building in the original complex was completed. The complex had incurred $26 million in debt by 1935, which had increased to $39 million by 1940. However, the complex was already 87% rented by 1940, and by the next year, Rockefeller Center was nearly fully rented, making a profit for the first time in its history. By 1944, the complex's existing rentable area totaled 5,290,000 square feet (491,000 m2), with 99.7% of the space being leased. Because the complex was almost completely rented, Rockefeller Center's managers kept waiting lists of potential tenants, and as a result of the waiting lists, the complex's office space became more desirable to these tenants. Two years later, there were 400 companies who wanted to rent space in Rockefeller Center, and the complex's managers determined that they would need to add 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of space in order to house all the prospective tenants. Rockefeller Center was also popular among visitors: for instance, the lines to enter one of the Music Hall's five daily shows stretched from Sixth Avenue and 50th Street to Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street, a distance of four blocks.In light of the abundance of possible renters, John Rockefeller Jr. transferred his ownership of the complex to his sons. The father collected the $57.5 million loan that Rockefeller Center Inc. owed him, then distributed it to his sons in the form of a tax break. Rockefeller Center eventually became the family's \"single largest repository\" of wealth. In 1950, Rockefeller Center Inc. paid the last installment of the $65 million mortgage owed to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Three years later, the complex was making $5 million per year in profit, excluding the tax breaks.\n\n\n=== Post-World War II expansion ===\n\nRockefeller Center Inc. had started working on plans to expand the complex during World War II, even though the outbreak of the war had stopped almost all civilian construction projects. In 1943, the complex's managers bought land and buildings on three street corners near the complex. Rockefeller Center unveiled plans for expansion to the southwest and north in 1944.Esso (now Exxon) was one of the tenants who wanted to expand, and the company signaled that it would build its own office tower if Rockefeller Center's managers did not construct a building for them. They were given land at the north end of Rockefeller Plaza. In February 1947, the under-construction Esso Building, at the north end of the existing property, became part of Rockefeller Center after ownership of the building was transferred from the Haswin Corporation to Rockefeller Center, Inc. The building was topped out the next month. Hugh Robertson stepped down as manager the next year, and he was replaced by Gustav Eyssell.Some tenants, such as the Sinclair Oil Corporation, indicated that they wanted to leave the complex after their leases expired in 1962\u20131963 because the original complex's buildings did not have air conditioning, while newer office buildings did. As Columbia University still owned the land underneath the complex, they were tasked with installing air conditioning in the buildings. The new building would add emphasis to any north-south views of the center, since the existing complex's building only formed west-east axes. Another problem befell Rockefeller Center's key tenants, NBC and RCA, who were approached by other developers with the promise of more leasable space, a commodity that was scarce in the fully leased complex. These problems were pushed aside temporarily by the onset of the Korean War in 1950. By 1951, Columbia had acquiesced to reimbursing Rockefeller Center, Inc., for AC installation, while NBC and RCA were given permission to use the Center Theatre for extra broadcasting space.In 1949, in the face of a shrinking congregation, the St. Nicholas Church leased the church building to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, who then leased three contiguous plots from Rockefeller Center for a proposed 28-story building. The congregation was dispersed to other churches, and the old church building at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street was subsequently demolished. Construction commenced on 600 Fifth Avenue in 1950, and the tower was completed by 1952. The building was named after the Sinclair Oil Company, who leased eight floors. As a result of Sinclair's relocation to 600 Fifth Avenue, as well as Esso's relocation to 75 Rockefeller Plaza, NBC and RCA could expand into the space that Sinclair and Esso formerly occupied in the original complex, and they moved out of the Center Theatre shortly after the Sinclair Oil Company moved into its own tower. In summer 1953, Columbia bought all of the land along Sixth Avenue that had been owned by the Underel Corporation, at a cost of $5.5 million. Rockefeller Center leased the land back to Columbia until 1973 for $200,000 a year. This allowed Columbia to install air conditioning, passing the costs on to the remaining tenants in return for lease extensions.The small Center Theatre was deemed redundant to the Radio City Music Hall, and in its final years, had been used as an NBC and RCA broadcasting space. After NBC and RCA expanded into the floor area formerly occupied by Sinclair, the U.S. Rubber Company indicated that it wanted to expand its office building into the space that was taken up by the underused theater. In October 1953, it was announced that the theater would be demolished. It was demolished in 1954.Time-Life also wanted to expand, as its existing space in 1 Rockefeller Plaza was also becoming insufficient. In August 1953, Rockefeller Center, Inc., bought a tract of land on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st streets. In 1956, two years after the demolition of the Center Theatre, officials announced the construction of a new tower, the Time-Life Building, on that plot. The 500-foot (150 m), $7 million building would include connections to the existing passageway system and to Roxy's Theater directly to its west. Time Inc. and Rockefeller Center formed a joint venture, Rock-Time Inc., which would share the tower's rent income between Time Inc. and Rockefeller Center. Construction on the Time-Life Building's steelwork started in April 1958, and the structure topped out in November of that year. The building officially opened in December 1959.Around 1960, Rockefeller Center, Uris Buildings Corporation, and Webb and Knapp formed another joint venture, Rock-Uris Corp. Originally, the venture wanted to construct a hotel to the west of 75 Rockefeller Center, but ultimately, a glass-and-concrete 43-story office building was built on the site. In 1961, the building was named after Sperry Corporation, who leased eight floors in the future building. The hotel, New York Hilton at Rockefeller Center, was built two blocks north in 1963.600 Fifth Avenue was sold to Rockefeller Center's managers in 1963, thus officially becoming part of Rockefeller Center. The same year, officials from Esso (later renamed Exxon) proposed a new building for the complex because the company had outgrown the space in the buildings it already occupied. Rockefeller Center's managers hired the architectural firm Harrison & Abramovitz to design three new towers on the west side of Sixth Avenue, with one tower on each block between 47th and 50th streets. The Exxon Building, at 1251 Avenue of the Americas between 49th and 50th streets, was formally announced in August 1967. Three months later, officials also announced plans for a tower housing McGraw-Hill, located one block south at 1221 Avenue of the Americas. Plans for a tower anchored by Celanese, to be located at 1211 Avenue of the Americas between 47th and 48th streets, would not be revealed until 1970. The Exxon Building opened in 1971, followed by the McGraw-Hill Building in 1973 and the Celanese Building in 1974. By the time all three of the new buildings were opened, Rockefeller Center contained 7% of Manhattan's 250,000,000 square feet (23,000,000 m2) of leasable office space.\n\n\n=== Late 20th and early 21st centuries ===\n\n600 Fifth Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza received renovations in the early 1970s. Unlike in the rest of the complex, where different components were renovated one at a time to avoid disturbing tenants, the two structures were renovated all at once because their space was largely vacant. Rockefeller Center Inc. renewed their lease on the complex in 1973.Through the 1960s, the Music Hall was successful regardless of the status of the city's economic, business, or entertainment sectors as a whole.  However, by the early 1970s, the proliferation of closed-captioned foreign movies had reduced attendance at the Music Hall. The first round of staff and performer firings began in 1972. By January 1978, the Music Hall was in debt, and the hall's annual attendance had declined to 1.5 million visitors, down from 5 million in 1968. Officials stated that it could not remain open after April. A grassroots campaign formed the Showpeople's Committee to Save Radio City Music Hall, and after several weeks of lobbying, the interior was made a city landmark in March, followed by a National Register of Historic Places listing in May. The hall was set to close on April 12, but five days before the planned closing date, the Empire State Development Corporation voted to create a nonprofit subsidiary to lease the Music Hall.A New York Times report in 1982 stated that Rockefeller Center had been popular among tenants from its inception, being almost fully rented for much of the first half-century of its existence. The major exception was in the 1970s, when it was only 85% rented. However, Rockefeller Center was not popular as an entertainment complex, having been used for mainly commercial purposes through its history. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission extended the Music Hall's landmark status to the exteriors of all of the original complex's buildings in 1985. In its approval of the complex's status, the commission wrote, \"Rockefeller Center ranks among the grandest architectural projects ever undertaken in the United States\". The buildings became a National Historic Landmark two years later. The United States Department of the Interior wrote in its report that the center was \"one of the most successful urban planning projects in the history of American architecture\".Columbia University was not making enough money from Rockefeller Center leases by the 1970s, since a series of negotiations with Rockefeller Center Inc. (now Rockefeller Group) had effectively reduced the annual lease payment to $11 million. The university's funds had dwindled so much that by 1972, their expenses were paid for by their endowment fund. In 1983, Columbia University started looking to sell the land beneath Rockefeller Center. Two years later, Columbia agreed to sell the land to the Rockefeller Group for $400 million. The Rockefeller Group immediately set out to modernize many aspects of the complex. The Rainbow Room was closed for a $20 million restoration and expansion that brought the restaurant's floor area to 4,500 square feet (420 m2), and it reopened in December 1987. The RCA Building's observation deck was subsequently closed because the Rainbow Room's expansion eliminated the only passageway to the observatory's elevator bank. In mid-1988, the RCA Building was renamed the GE Building.Mitsubishi Estate, a real estate company of the Mitsubishi Group, purchased the Rockefeller Group in 1989. Seven years later, in July 1996, the entire complex was purchased by a consortium of owners that included Goldman Sachs (which had 50 percent ownership), Gianni Agnelli, Stavros Niarchos, and David Rockefeller, who organized the consortium. Before the sale was even completed, the consortium sold 1,600,000 square feet (150,000 m2) of space in 30 Rockefeller Plaza to NBC, who had rented that space in the tower since the beginning. Tishman Speyer, led by Jerry Speyer, a close friend of David Rockefeller, and the Lester Crown family of Chicago, bought the original 14 buildings and land in 2000 for $1.85 billion. Owing to the decline of the newsreel theater industry, the Guild was shuttered in late 1999 after Tishman Speyer decided not to renew its lease. Tishman Speyer also decided to renovate the complex's retail spaces and underground concourse.The Rainbow Room closed in 2009 in preparation for an extensive renovation that started in 2011. The restaurant reopened in October 2014. The Rockefeller family moved out of their offices in the GE Building in 2014 due to rising rents. They re-settled in less expensive offices on 49th Street, near their old headquarters. The next year, in July 2015, the GE Building was renamed after Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\nThe current complex is a combination of two building complexes and a standalone building: the original 14 Art Deco office buildings from the 1930s, one building across 51st Street built in 1947, and a set of four International-style towers built along the west side of Avenue of the Americas during the 1960s and 1970s. The center spans 22 acres (8.9 ha) in total, with some 17,000,000 square feet (1,600,000 m2) in office space.\n\n\n=== Landmarked buildings ===\nThe landmarked buildings comprise 12 acres (49,000 m2) in Midtown, bounded by Fifth and Sixth avenues between 48th and 51st streets. Built as a cohesive unit, the buildings have been owned by Tishman Speyer since 2000. The buildings are spread along six blocks, with three blocks facing each avenue. These six blocks are the size of three standard blocks. One of the landmark buildings' defining features is the Indiana limestone facade possessed by all 14 structures, as specified in the original plans. All of the structures were designed by Associated Architects, with Raymond Hood as the principal architect, and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n\n==== Radio City ====\n\nThe east side of Sixth Avenue, officially known as Avenue of the Americas, contains most of the buildings that were built specifically for the proposed radio complex. These buildings, which comprise \"Radio City\", are 1230 Avenue of the Americas, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Radio City Music Hall and 1270 Avenue of the Americas. The idea for an integrated media complex somewhere came in 1920, when Owen D. Young, the chairman of RCA parent General Electric, suggested that RCA combine its then-disparate offices into one location.\n\nThe western half of the southernmost block of the complex along Sixth Avenue, between 48th and 49th streets, contains the former U.S. Rubber Company Building (now Simon & Schuster Building) at 1230 Avenue of the Americas. The last structure in the original complex to be built, it was topped out in November 1939. The 23-story building contains two 7-story wings on its north and south sides. It was renamed after Uniroyal in 1967, and again after Simon & Schuster in 1976. 1230 Avenue of the Americas was expanded to the east in 1954 after the Center Theatre adjacent to it was demolished. The 19-story annex, designed by Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz, had a glass facade on the lowest two stories\u2014reflecting the design of the former American Airlines Building across Sixth Avenue\u2014and a limestone facade above the second story. It is aligned with the axis of 10 Rockefeller Plaza on the eastern side of the block, and its northern and southern elevations contain five setbacks. The exterior also houses an abstract bas-relief created by Naum Gabo.The Center Theatre, at 1236 Sixth Avenue, was the only structure in the original Rockefeller Center to be demolished. Originally the \"Roxy Theatre\", it was renamed after William Fox sued Roxy Rothafel over the naming rights to the nearby Roxy Theatre, which Rothafel had originally managed. The 3,700-seat Center Theatre had a short massing (general shape) in place due to height restrictions at the time, which prohibited construction above theater auditoriums. The theater's stage was enlarged for musicals in 1936, and four years later, 380 seats were removed in order to make way for an ice rink for skating spectaculars. It showed film, musicals, ice-skating competitions, and television through its 21-year existence. Due to its duplication of the larger Radio City Music Hall's activities, it was deemed uneconomical almost from its opening, and was considered redundant by the 1950s. In 1954, it was replaced by the expansion of 1230 Avenue of the Americas.The block immediately to the north, on Sixth Avenue between 49th and 50th streets, is occupied by 30 Rockefeller Plaza and its western annex at 1250 Sixth Avenue. The 70-floor, 872-foot-tall (266 m) building anchors the entire complex, and is located on the eastern side of the block. Opened in 1933 as the RCA Building, the building has been renamed multiple times, first to the GE Building in 1988, after General Electric bought RCA, and then to the Comcast Building in 2014 after Comcast's purchase of NBC. 30 Rockefeller Plaza was built as a single structure occupying the entire block between Sixth Avenue and Rockefeller Plaza, and its design was influenced by John Todd's desire for the building to use its air rights to their maximum potential. It has three main segments: the 66-story tower rising from the eastern part of the base with the famous Rainbow Room restaurant on the 65th floor, and, formerly, the Rockefeller family office; a windowless segment in the middle of the base that houses NBC Studios; and a shorter 16-story tower on the western part of the base at 1250 Avenue of the Americas. As an icon of the complex, 30 Rockefeller Plaza's architecture influenced the design of the rest of the complex, with its limestone facade and Gothic-inspired four-leafed spandrels.\n\nRadio City Music Hall at 1260 Avenue of the Americas, occupying the southwestern portion of the block between 50th and 51st streets. The only remaining theater in the complex, it was similar in style to the Center Theatre, but at a larger scale. Construction started in December 1931, and the hall opened in December 1932. The 121-foot-high (37 m) Music Hall seats 6,000 people, and since opening has seen over 300 million visitors. Located in a niche adjacent to the neighboring 1270 Avenue of the Americas, the Music Hall is housed under the building's seventh-floor setback.The other building on the block between 50th and 51st streets is 1270 Avenue of the Americas, a 31-story structure with a setback on the sixth floor. Originally the RKO Building, it was built over the Music Hall and shares many of the same exterior architectural details. Construction of the building started in 1931, and the building was complete by September 1932. Henry Hofmeister designed the building, as well as several other office buildings in the city that were built over theaters. The building's entrance design, blending in with that of the other buildings in the Radio City section, is marked by three sculptural bas-reliefs created by Robert Garrison for each of the building's three bays, signifying muses of Contemporary Thought, Morning, and Evening. In 1990, Robert Kushner created three bronze sculptures of winged spirits for the lobby. The RKO Building served as headquarters for its namesake company's movie production in the 1930s, and was renamed for the American Metal Climax Company (AMAX), its new owners, in the early 1960s.\n\n\n==== International complex ====\n\nThe International Complex is located entirely along Fifth Avenue, with the tall International Building overshadowing four smaller country-themed buildings with retail outlets. Three of the buildings\u2014the tall tower and the two southern retail buildings\u2014were planned after the cancellation of the incongruously designed oval retail building in 1931, while the two retail buildings to the north were added later. The low rectangular structures that replaced the oval building were seen as a more suitable design for the avenue. The current international theme was decided on due to a lack of American tenants willing to rent there; eventually, the buildings were occupied by British, French, and Italian interests, although the Italian interests ultimately were the only foreign tenants who rented for the long term.All four retail buildings have identical limestone facades, roof gardens, and ground-floor storefronts, but differ in the artworks with which they were decorated. Contemporary advertisements for shopping on Fifth Avenue touted the complex's proximity to Saks Fifth Avenue and St. Patrick's Cathedral. When viewed from Fifth Avenue, the buildings provide a foreground for the taller 30 Rockefeller Plaza building behind them. The Channel Gardens separate the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise.\n\nThe southernmost of the four retail buildings is La Maison Francaise (literally \"the French House\") at 610 Fifth Avenue, which opened in October 1933. It is a six-story standalone building with a limestone facade with a sixth-story setback, as well as a partial \u200b1 1\u20442-story penthouse on the west half of the seventh story and a garden on the east side of the seventh-story roof. Immediately across the Channel Gardens to the north of La Maison Francaise is its twin, the British Empire Building at 620 Fifth Avenue, which opened in April 1933. It is also a standalone building, with exactly the same massing as La Maison Francaise, down to the setback, rooftop garden, and half-penthouse.The 512-foot (156 m) International Building has the address 630 Fifth Avenue to its east, or 45 Rockefeller Plaza to its west. The tower stands at 41 stories high, including mechanical floors. One of two skyscrapers that opened in Manhattan in 1935, it was noted for its short 136-day duration of construction, as well as the construction quality, overall design, and materials used. The building, located in the middle of the block between Rockefeller Plaza and Fifth Avenue, contains a central plaza on its east, facing the Fifth Avenue entrance, which contains the famous statue of Atlas. The Palazzo d'Italia and International Building North serve as six-story retail wings of the International Building. The Palazzo d'Italia is located at 626 Fifth Avenue, on the south side of the plaza, while International Building North is located at 636 Fifth Avenue, north of the plaza.\n\n\n==== Other buildings ====\n\nThe 36-story tower at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, on the east side of the plaza between 48th and 49th streets, is the original Time & Life Building that was opened in April 1937. Time Inc. itself did not move into the building for another year after its completion. In 1960, the building was renamed for General Dynamics after Time Inc. had moved into 1271 Avenue of the Americas, the new Time-Life Building located three blocks away. The tower was renamed for its street address after General Dynamics moved to St. Louis in 1971.10 Rockefeller Plaza is located opposite 1 Rockefeller, on the west side of the plaza. Its planning name was the Holland House, but the Dutch government did not sign on, so the building became the Eastern Air Lines Building instead. 10 Rockefeller was built as a 16-story slab, basically a miniature version of 1 Rockefeller. 10 Rockefeller's six-story parking garage was the first in Rockefeller Center. Notable modern tenants include the Today Show studios, and since 2005, the Nintendo New York store.50 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly the Associated Press Building, is located on the west side of Rockefeller Plaza between 50th and 51st streets. It was constructed in the spring of 1938. The only building in the Center built to the outer limits of its lot line, the 15-story building took its shape from Associated Press's need for a single, undivided, loft-like newsroom as large as the lot could accommodate\u2014namely, a 200-by-187-foot (61 by 57 m) blocky structure with no setbacks.600 Fifth Avenue is located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 48th Street and was built after the other buildings in the main complex, opening in 1952. The 28-story tower was once also known as the Sinclair Oil Building and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company Building. Its L-shaped footprint surrounds another building at the corner of 49th Street and Fifth Avenue, such that it fronts 200 feet (61 m) on 48th Street, 100 feet (30 m) on Fifth Avenue, but only 63 feet (19 m) midblock on 49th Street. Carson and Lundin designed 600 Fifth Avenue, along with 666 Fifth Avenue three blocks north, to complement the Rockefeller complex between the two towers. 600 Fifth Avenue contains a limestone facade, consistent with that of the original complex, as well as a seventh-story setback on its Fifth Avenue side and rooftop gardens on its setbacks. The building contains a main lobby at 48th Street, a service entrance to the same street, and a connection to 1 Rockefeller Plaza at its west end. Unlike other buildings in the complex, 600 Fifth Avenue's  ground level only contained one public entrance to maximize the ground-floor retail space, which was originally leased by Swiss interests and Pan Am Airlines.\n\n\n=== Later buildings ===\n\nThe buildings subsequently added are separately owned by multiple owners. The first subsequent building to be built was 75 Rockefeller Plaza, at 51st Street on the north end of the complex, was built in 1947. The building contains a low base that is level with the rooftops of the low-rise buildings on 51st and 52nd Street, as well as a tall slab rising from the base, aligned in a north-south direction.  It was originally built privately, but ownership was transferred to Rockefeller Center in February 1947. The 33-story, 400-foot (120 m) building was originally called the Esso Building. It was the headquarters of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (later Exxon) until the early 1970s. The Esso Building was later renamed after Time Warner. It is now owned by Mohamed Al Fayed and managed by RXR Realty.The other four buildings were built as part of a single project on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 47th and 51st streets. Erected from 1958 through 1974, they were all built by the same firm, Harrison, Abramovitz & Harris. The $300 million project was part of a drive to get large companies such as Celanese Corporation, McGraw-Hill, Exxon, and Time Inc. to invest in the center. The new project added a combined 6,100,000 square feet (570,000 m2) of space to the existing center when it was completed, and was attractive to potential tenants because of this. The following buildings are part of the newer Sixth Avenue expansion:\n1211 Avenue of the Americas, the former Celanese Building, is located between 47th and 48th streets. The 592-foot-tall (180 m) tower opened in 1974. Now the News Corp Building, it is owned by an affiliate of Beacon Capital Partners, and leasing is managed by Cushman & Wakefield.\n1221 Avenue of the Americas, the former McGraw-Hill Building, is located between 48th and 49th streets. The 674-foot-tall (205 m) building opened in 1973 and is owned by the Rockefeller Group.\n1251 Avenue of the Americas, the former Exxon Building, is located between 49th and 50th streets. This 750-foot-tall (230 m) building was built from 1967 to 1971. Exxon's corporate headquarters moved into the structure in 1972, with co-ownership with Rockefeller Center's managers, and held an ownership stake there until 1986, when Mitsui & Company purchased the building. Exxon moved its headquarters to Texas in 1989, vacating all of the space in 1251 Avenue of the Americas.\n1271 Avenue of the Americas, the former Time & Life Building, is located between 50th and 51st streets. The 587-foot-tall (179 m) building was completed in 1958 Construction on the Time-Life's Building's steelwork started in April 1958, and is owned by the Rockefeller Group.\n\n\n== Other architectural elements ==\n\n\n=== Lower Plaza ===\n\nAt the front of 30 Rock is the Lower Plaza, located in the very center of the complex and below ground level. The center plaza was part of the plans for the canceled Metropolitan Opera House. Although the opera house was canceled in 1929, the plaza was retained in subsequent plans. Originally, the plaza would have been located at ground level with a promenade called Channel Gardens, which led westward from Fifth Avenue to the plaza. In the March 1931 revision to the complex's blueprint, the center plaza was enhanced and sunken. The sunken plaza was originally supposed to be oval-shaped, but the plaza was later changed to a rectangular shape. The sunken rectangular plaza, planted with shrubs, provided a sense of privacy and enclosure when it was originally built.The plaza's main entrance is through the Channel Gardens, a 60-foot-wide (18 m), 200-foot-long (61 m) planted pedestrian esplanade running westward from Fifth Avenue between the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise.  The steeply sloping promenade was originally furnished with six narrow pools in the center of the space, each surrounded by hedges. The pools are topped with fountain heads designed by Rene Chambellan, each representing a different attribute: leadership, will, thought, imagination, energy, and alertness. Chambellan also designed the fountains' drain covers with various bronze depictions of sea creatures such as turtles and crabs. During the winter, the Channel Gardens' fountains were shut off and decorated with Valerie Clarebout's sculptures of angels. The twelve sculptures, each measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) tall, have been placed in the gardens every winter since 1954. At the western end of the promenade is a plaque commemorating the original Elgin Gardens, as well as a bronze monumental plaque to John D. Rockefeller Jr (see below). From there, a flight of the steps descends toward the rink, then splits into two different stairs heading both north and south.The western end of the plaza contains Paul Manship's 1933 masterwork, Prometheus (see also \u00a7 Prometheus).  The statue stands in a 60-by-16-foot (18.3 by 4.9 m) fountain basin in front of a grey rectangular wall. The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree is placed above the statue from November to January every year; it is usually put in place and lit the week after Thanksgiving, and taken down the week after New Year's Day. The first tree was erected in 1934, and as successive trees received more lavish decorations, the tradition gradually became known worldwide.\n\nMuch of the plaza's outdoor section is occupied by an ice rink. Installed in 1936, it replaced unprofitable retail space that had been constructed as part of the original center. Originally intended as a \"temporary\" measure, the rink became an immediate tourist attraction upon opening, becoming one of the world's most famous skating rinks in later years. In 1939, a permanent 120-by-60-foot (37 by 18 m) rink was installed, which necessitated the replacement of the center staircase from Channel Gardens. Its popularity inspired the construction of a skating rink in the former Center Theatre, and for a short time, there were also proposals to convert the lower plaza's ice rink to a roller skating rink during the springtime.The northern, southern, and eastern sides of the plaza are surrounded by a walkway that is several steps below street level, with staircases at either western end as well as at the plaza's Channel Gardens entrance. Some 200 flagpoles surround the plaza's perimeter at ground level, installed at regular intervals along the walkway and Rockefeller Plaza.  The poles were installed in 1942 and were originally intended to be temporary. The flags later became permanent installations, fitting in with the nearby International Complex. The poles originally displayed the flags of the United Nations' member countries, although in later years they also carried flags of the U.S. states and territories, or decorative and seasonal motifs. Originally, there were 26 flags for each of the members of the United Nations, but as more countries became UN members, additional rows of poles were added on the north and south sides of the plaza. During national and state holidays, every pole carries the flag of the United States. The flags' ropes are secured with locks to prevent people from tampering with the flags.In July 1962, two years after John Rockefeller Jr.'s death, the center's management placed a plaque at the plaza, containing a list of ten principles in which he believed. The creed was first expressed in 1941. Rockefeller's beliefs include \"the supreme worth of the individual and in his right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" (the first principle) and \"truth and justice are fundamental to an enduring social order\" (the sixth principle).The architect I. M. Pei praised Rockefeller Center's lower plaza as being \"perhaps the most successful open space in the United States, perhaps in the world\", due to its success in drawing visitors. The plaza has also inspired similar developments around the world.\n\n\n=== Rockefeller Plaza ===\n\nRockefeller Plaza is a pedestrian street running through the complex, parallel to Fifth and Sixth avenues. This street was also part of the original plans for the Metropolitan Opera, and Benjamin Morris originally intended for the road to stretch from 42nd to 59th streets. Only the 720-foot (220 m) section between 48th and 51st streets was built, and the road was open in its entirety by 1937. The road was given the name \"Rockefeller Plaza\" in 1933, despite the potential confusion with the Lower Plaza, because it was believed that the \"Plaza\" in the road's name would emphasize its \"spatial unity\" with the Lower Plaza and Channel Gardens. The original intention of the street's construction was to enhance the shopping district of Fifth Avenue, to its east, but this never happened, and Rockefeller Plaza now primarily serves as a pedestrian passage that connects all of Rockefeller Center's separate components.As with most numbered crosstown streets in Manhattan, Rockefeller Plaza is 30 feet (9.1 m) wide with curbs on either side of an asphalt surface. However, the sidewalks are much wider than on typical streets. In addition, Rockefeller Plaza is supported by a multi-level steel skeleton underneath, which houses the underground mall, storage rooms, and the complex's shipping and loading center. As such, it contains a 14.5 inches (37 cm) layer of waterproofing. The surface of Rockefeller Plaza outside Radio City Music Hall, between 50th and 51st Street, contains small bronze circles for theatergoers to stand on while waiting to enter the hall. Until the 1980s, the plaza contained plaques that affirmed Columbia University's ownership of Rockefeller Center, but these were removed with the 1985 sale of the complex to the Rockefeller Group. Since Rockefeller Plaza is technically a purely private property to which the public is welcome, the plaza is closed for part of one day every year.\n\n\n=== Rooftop gardens ===\n\nThe gardens atop Rockefeller Center's roofs were designed by Ralph Hancock and Raymond Hood. They came about because both Hood and Todd believed that rooftop gardens would enhance the complex's beauty; in particular, Hood compared the presence of rooftop gardens to the plants around a house. Originally, the gardens were supposed to be all interconnected via bridges between the roofs of each building. However, after Hood's death in 1935, the garden plan fell apart, as most of the complex's final buildings were built without provisions for gardens. The Associated Press Building's 15th-story roof, as well as the isolated location of the International Building and the high cost of these gardens, made this system infeasible. Ultimately, gardens were installed on 10 Rockefeller Plaza; 30 Rockefeller Plaza; the four International-themed retail buildings; the Center Theatre; and Radio City Music Hall. The gardens started running a $45,000-per-year deficit by 1937 due to various expenses as well as a lack of interest among tourists.The largest and most grand of the gardens was the 0.75-acre (0.30 ha) \"Garden of the Nations\" (alternatively \"Gardens of the Nations\"), which was installed on the eleventh-floor roof of 30 Rockefeller Plaza and opened in April 1935. The construction effort involved 3,000 short tons (2,700 long tons) of soil; 100 short tons (89 long tons) of rock from as far as England; 100,000 bricks; 2,000 trees and shrubs; 4,000 small plants; and 20,000 bulbs for flowers. They were originally composed of thirteen nation-specific gardens whose layouts were inspired by the gardens in the respective countries they represented. Each of the nation-themed gardens were separated by barriers. There was an \"International Garden\", a rock garden, in the center of the thirteen nation-themed gardens, which featured a meandering stream and 2,000 plant varieties. The Garden of the Nations also contained a children's garden, a modern-style garden, and a shrub-and-vegetable patch. Upon opening, the Garden of the Nations attracted many visitors because of its collection of exotic flora, and it became the most popular garden in Rockefeller Center. In its heyday, the Center charged admission fees for the Garden of the Nations. However, all of the nation-themed gardens were eventually removed, and the rock garden was left to dry up, supplanted by flower beds that were no longer open to the public.The International complex's gardens fared better. Hancock developed the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise's gardens, while A.M. van den Hoek designed the gardens atop the other two buildings. The British and French gardens both contain a lawn and pool surrounded by hedges, while the other two gardens atop the International Building's wings include ivy lawns surrounded by hedges. The Italian garden also contained a cobblestone walkway and two plaques from the Roman Forum, while International Building North's garden has a paved walkway with steps. The roof gardens of the International Building's wings were restored in 1986 for $48,000 each, followed by the gardens on the British and French buildings, which were restored the next year.\n\n\n=== Underground concourse ===\n\nA series of shop- and restaurant-filled pedestrian passages stretch underground from 47th to 51st streets between Fifth and Seventh avenues. The pedestrian tunnel system was part of the updated 1931 plan for the center, and formal proposals for the system were submitted in 1933. It was supposed to comprise a system that stretched over 0.75 miles (1.21 km), all air-conditioned and lined with shops. Meanwhile, the pair of four-lane roadways was supposed to be located underneath the pedestrian mall, with delivery ramps leading to a 320-by-180-foot (98 by 55 m) central loading area 34 feet (10 m) below ground. Later plans also included a people mover.Ultimately, the people mover was not built, but the 25-space mall opened in May 1935. The complex's owner Tishman Speyer renovated the concourse in 1999 in an effort to make the underground retail space more noticeable and attract more upscale tenants. The original bronze ornaments and lighting were replaced, air-conditioning was installed, two passageways were demolished, and both ground-level and underground retail spaces were refurbished as part of the renovation.The concourse is the uppermost level of the complex's four basement levels, as well as the only basement level open to the public. The lower three levels are home to storage rooms and the complex's shipping center, the latter of which is accessed by a delivery ramp at 50th Street. Access is via lobby stairways in the six landmark buildings, through restaurants surrounding the concourse-level skating rink, and via elevators to the north and south of the rink. There is also a connection to the New York City Subway's 47th\u201350th Streets\u2013Rockefeller Center station, serving the B, \u200bD, \u200bF, <F>, and \u200bM trains. As of 2018, the largest retailer in the concourse is Banana Republic.\n\n\n=== Pre-existing buildings ===\nTwo small buildings abut the north and south corners of the 30 Rockefeller Plaza annex. These buildings exist as a result of two tenants who refused to sell their rights to Rockefeller during construction. The grocer John F. Maxwell would only sell his property at Sixth Avenue and 50th Street if he received $1 million in return. However, Rockefeller's assistant Charles O. Heydt mistakenly said that Maxwell would never sell, and Maxwell himself said that he had never been approached by the Rockefellers. Consequently, Rockefeller Center did not purchase Maxwell's property until 1970. Maxwell's demand paled to that of Daniel Hurley and Patrick Daly, owners of a speakeasy who, since 1892, had leased a property at 49th Street. They would sell for $250 million, roughly the cost of the entire complex. They initially gained a lease extension until 1942, but ended up leasing their property until 1975, and was built around Maxwell's and Hurley and Daly's properties.On the southeast corner of the complex, on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th streets, there were also two pre-existing buildings. Robert Walton Goelet owned a lot at 2\u20136 West 49th Street and wished to develop it; the lot was developed as 608 Fifth Avenue, which was completed in 1932. The St. Nicholas Church, located on 48th Street behind Goelet's land, also refused to sell the property despite an offer of up to $7 million for the property. The church was razed in 1949 to make way for 600 Fifth Avenue.\n\n\n== Art ==\n\nIn November 1931, John Todd suggested the creation of a program for placing distinctive artworks within each of the buildings. Hartley Burr Alexander, a noted mythology and symbology professor, was tasked with planning the complex's arts installations. Alexander submitted his plan for the site's artwork in December 1932. As part of the proposal, the complex would have a variety of sculptures, statues, murals, friezes, decorative fountains, and mosaics. In an expansion of Hood's setback-garden plan, Alexander's proposal also included rooftop gardens atop all the buildings, which would create a \"Babylonian garden\" when viewed from above.At first, Alexander suggested \"Homo Fabor, Man the Builder\" as the complex's overarching theme, representing satisfaction with one's occupation rather than with the wage. However, that theme was not particularly well received by the architects, so Alexander proposed another theme, the \"New Frontiers\"; this theme dealt with social and scientific innovations and represented the challenges that humanity faced \"after the conquest of the physical world\". In theory, this was considered a fitting theme, but Alexander had been so specific about the details of the necessary artworks that it limited the creative license for any artists who would be commissioned for such works, so he was fired. It took several tries to agree on the current theme, \"The March of Civilization\", at which point some of the art had already been commissioned, including those which Alexander had proposed.The art that currently exists within Rockefeller Center was inspired by Professor Alexander's arts program. Sculptor Lee Lawrie contributed the largest number of individual pieces \u2013 twelve, including the Atlas statue facing Fifth Avenue and the conspicuous friezes of Wisdom above the main entrance to 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Edward Trumbull coordinated the colors of the works located inside the buildings, and L\u00e9on-Victor Solon did the same job for the exterior pieces. Isamu Noguchi's gleaming stainless steel bas-relief, News, over the main entrance to 50 Rockefeller Plaza (the Associated Press Building) was, at the time of commissioning, the largest metal bas-relief in the world. The complex's other sculptors included Rene Chambellan, Leo Friedlander, Robert Garrison, Alfred Janniot, Carl Paul Jennewein, Gaston Lachaise, Leo Lentelli, Paul Manship, Giacomo Manz\u00f9, Hildreth Meiere, and Attilio Piccirilli. Other artists included Carl Milles, Margaret Bourke-White, and Dean Cornwell. Radio City Music Hall architect Donald Deskey commissioned many Depression-era artists to design works for the interior of the hall, including Stuart Davis's 1932 mural Men Without Women, named after the short story collection by Ernest Hemingway that had been published the same year. One of the center's more controversial works was Man at the Crossroads, created by Diego Rivera, which was originally commissioned for 30 Rockefeller Plaza's lobby but was demolished before it could be completed.\n\n\n=== Statues ===\n\n\n==== Atlas ====\nCommissioned in 1936 and executed by Lee Lawrie and Rene Chambellan, the Atlas statue is located in the International Building's courtyard. It faces eastward toward St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. The statue depicts Atlas the titan, with exaggerated muscles, supporting the celestial vault on his shoulders.\n\n\n==== Prometheus ====\nPaul Manship's highly recognizable bronze gilded Prometheus statue, commissioned in 1934, is located at the western end of the sunken plaza. It stands 18 feet (5.5 m) high and weighs 8 short tons (7.1 long tons). The statue depicts the Greek legend of the Titan Prometheus recumbent, bringing fire to mankind. The statue is flanked by two smaller gilded representations of Youth and Maiden, which were relocated to Palazzo d'Italia from 1939 to 1984 because Manship thought the representations did not fit visually. The model for Prometheus was Leonardo (Leon) Nole, and the inscription, a paraphrase from Aeschylus, on the granite wall behind, reads: \"Prometheus, teacher in every art, brought the fire that hath proved to mortals a means to mighty ends.\"\n\n\n=== Man at the Crossroads ===\n\nIn 1932, the Mexican socialist artist Diego Rivera (whose sponsor was the Museum of Modern Art and whose patron at the time was Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, the wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.), was commissioned by their son Nelson to create a color fresco for the 1,071-square-foot (99 m2) wall in the lobby of the then-RCA Building. This came after Nelson had been unable to secure the commissioning of either Matisse or Picasso. Previously Rivera had painted a controversial fresco in Detroit titled Detroit Industry, commissioned by Abby and John's friend, Edsel Ford, who later became a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art.As expected, his Man at the Crossroads became controversial, as it contained Moscow May Day scenes and a clear portrait of Lenin, which had not been apparent in initial sketches.  After Nelson issued a written warning to Rivera to replace the offending figure with an anonymous face, Rivera refused (after offering to counterbalance Lenin with a portrait of Lincoln). As per Nelson's orders, Rivera was paid for his commission and the mural was papered over. Nine months later, after all attempts to save the fresco were explored\u2014including relocating it to Abby's Museum of Modern Art\u2014it was destroyed as a last option. (Rivera would later partially recreate the work as Man, Controller of the Universe, using photographs taken by an assistant, Lucienne Bloch.) Rivera's fresco in the Center was replaced with a larger mural by the Catalan artist Josep Maria Sert, titled American Progress, depicting a vast allegorical scene of men constructing modern America. Containing figures of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, it wraps around the west wall of 30 Rockefeller Plaza's Grand Lobby.\n\n\n== Critical review ==\n\nIn its earliest years, Rockefeller Center received largely negative and pessimistic reviews from architectural critics. The most cynical opinion came from architectural scholar Lewis Mumford, who so hated the \"weakly conceived, reckless, romantic chaos\" of the March 1931 plans for Rockefeller Center that he reportedly went into exile in upstate New York. He blamed John Rockefeller Jr. for the complex's \"inability to consider a new type of problem in any form except the skyscraper stereotype\". Mumford's view of the complex was only marginally less negative when he revisited the issue in December 1933: he said that it could be \"large, exciting, [and] romantic\" at night, but that \"a mountain or ash heap of the same size would do the trick almost as well, if the lights were cleverly arranged\". Ralph Adams Cram, who adhered to a more classical architectural style, also had a pessimistic view of the plans unveiled in March 1931. He called the plan for Rockefeller Center \"an apotheosis of megalomania, a defiant egotism\" arising from an ostentatious display of wealth, and said that \"the sooner we accomplish the destiny it so perfectly foreshadows, the sooner we shall be able to clear the ground and begin again\". Douglas Haskell, who formerly edited Architectural Forum magazine, wrote that Rockefeller Center's ambiance was \"gray, unreal, baleful\".The urban planner Le Corbusier had a more optimistic view of the complex, expressing that Rockefeller Center was \"rational, logically conceived, biologically normal, [and] harmonious\". He wrote that although Rockefeller Center would inevitably be disorganized in its earliest years, it would eventually adhere to a certain \"order\", and he also praised the complex for being a paragon of \"noble\" and \"efficient\" construction. The writer Frederick Lewis Allen took a more moderate viewpoint, saying that negative critics had \"hoped for too much\" precisely because Rockefeller Center had been planned during an economically prosperous time, but was constructed during the Depression. Even though Allen thought that the art was mediocre and the opportunities for a less lively complex were wasted, he stated that Rockefeller Center had an aura of \"festivity\" around it, unlike most other office buildings in America. Sigfried Giedion wrote in his book Space, Time and Architecture that Rockefeller Center's design was akin to a \"civic center\" whose design represented the 1930s version of the future. Henry Luce, the founder of Time Inc., said in 1941 that Rockefeller Center represented \"the true world of tomorrow\", as opposed to the 1939 New York World's Fair, whose \"World of Tomorrow\" representations \"are today junk piles under the winter snow\". Novelist Gertrude Stein said in 1935, \"The view of Rockefeller Center from Fifth Avenue is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.\"By the 1940s, most critics had positive views of Rockefeller Center. Even Mumford praised the complex, lamenting in 1947 that the new headquarters of the United Nations on First Avenue had no \"human scale\" or \"transition from the intimate to the monumental\", whereas Rockefeller Center's buildings \"produce an aesthetic effect out of all proportion to their size\". Haskell wrote in 1966 that Rockefeller Center's designers \"seemed to have regarded urban life as an enhanceable romance\". In 1969, the art historian Vincent Scully wrote, \"Rockefeller Center is one of the few surviving public spaces that look as if they were designed and used by people who knew what stable wealth was and were not ashamed to enjoy it.\" The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation commissioned a report in 1974 entitled \"Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center: A Historic-Critical Estimate of Their Significance\", in which they concluded that Rockefeller Center, along with Central Park and Grand Central Terminal, were the only three developments that could slow down Manhattan's \"remorseless process of expansion and decay\". In 1976, New York Times architectural critic Paul Goldberger wrote, \"What makes Rockefeller Center work is that it is at once a formal Beaux\u2010Arts\u2010influenced complex of dignified towers and a lively, utterly contemporary amalgam of shops, plazas and street life. It is as natural a home for a 1970's street festival as for a 1930's movie about cafe society: few designs can join such disparate worlds so comfortably.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nEarly skyscrapers\nArchitecture of New York City\nList of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan above 59th to 110th Streets\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Rockefeller Group\nThe Rink at Rockefeller Center",

        "wiki": "Downtown Saint Paul is an official neighborhood in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. Its boundaries are the Mississippi River to the south, University Avenue to the north, US 52 to the east, and Kellogg Avenue to the west. It is bounded by the Dayton's Bluff, Summit-University, West Seventh, Frogtown, West Side, and Payne-Phalen neighborhoods. The West Side neighborhood is on the other side of the river, and can be accessed via the Robert Street Bridge or the Wabasha Street Bridge. Interstate 35E and Interstate 94 run through the north side of the neighborhood, providing a separation between the Minnesota State Capitol and other state government buildings with the rest of downtown.  \n\n\n== Government ==\nThe Minnesota State Capitol is located on the northern fringe of the downtown neighborhood. Work began on the current capitol in 1896, and construction was completed in 1905. The early 1950s saw the development of the expansive mall that currently surrounds the capitol. This development required the demolition of many homes, apartments, churches, and businesses, and paved the way for the construction of four government agency buildings surrounding the mall: Veteran Services Building, the Transportation Building, the Centennial Office Building, and the National Guard Armory. Saint Paul City Hall and Ramsey County Courthouse is also located downtown.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nA number of corporations and institutions are located in downtown Saint Paul. Since 1933, Ecolab has maintained its headquarters in downtown. In 1989 Twin Cities PBS relocated to its current location in downtown In 1997 the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System moved its headquartered in the Wells Fargo Place. Minnesota Public Radio purchased its current downtown headquarters in 2001 from the Public Housing Agency of St. Paul. In 2005 Gander Mountain relocated to downtown. Securian Financial Group is located in the Securian Center and is the largest private employer in downtown with 2,600 employees. Travelers Insurance maintains a large presence downtown, employing 2,000 people. In 2009 supercomputer manufacturer Cray Inc. relocated to become the anchor tenant of the Cray Plaza in downtown.\n\n\n== Lowertown ==\n\nThe Lowertown Historic District is a historic district on the east-side of Downtown Saint Paul. This 16-block warehouse and wholesaling district comprises 37 contributing properties built 1870s\u20131920. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 for the significance of its river and rail connections, economic impact, architecture, and urban planning. In recent years Lowertown has been undergoing changes from a bohemian, artist-community into a gentrified neighborhood filled with coffee shops, restaurants, bars, breweries, and market-rate apartments.Lowertown is the home of the Saint Paul Union Depot, a historic railroad station that is still in use as a transportation hub for Amtrak, Greyhound Lines and the Metro Green Line.\n\n\n== Parks ==\nDowntown has three city parks, two of which predate Minnesota statehood. The land for both Mears Park and Rice Park was donated to the city of Saint Paul in 1849. Both parks have gone through numerous renovations and host several festivals throughout the year. Rice Park most notably hosts the Saint Paul Winter Carnival which is the oldest winter carnival in the country, having operated since 1886. Since 1999, Mears Park has hosted the Twin Cities Jazz Festival.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Saint Paul Public Library system operates the Central Library, which has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1975. James J. Hill Reference Library is located within the Central Library. The Landmark Center is located on the north side of Rice Park.\n\n\n=== Theater & performing arts ===\nPalace Theatre\nOrdway Center for the Performing Arts\nRoy Wilkins Auditorium\nFitzgerald Theater\nSaint Paul Chamber Orchestra\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMinnesota Children's Museum\nMinnesota Museum of American Art\nMinnesota History Center\nScience Museum of Minnesota\n\n\n== Sports ==\nIn September 2000 the Xcel Energy Center opened in downtown to serve as the home for the  Minnesota Wild. Apart from hosting the Wild, the Xcel Energy Center has hosted the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, the NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship, the Minnesota State High School League Boys\u2019 Hockey Tournament, the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx, and the now defunct National Lacrosse League team Minnesota Swarm.\n\nLocated in the Lowertown District of downtown, CHS Field opened in May 2015 at a cost of $63 million. CHS field servs as home field for the Saint Paul Saints of the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball and despite not having an affiliation with a Major League Baseball team, an average of 8,438 fans visited CHS Field to watch the Saints, which was the seventh-highest average attendance across minor league baseball.The Saints' move from Midway Stadium to CHS Field marks the return of baseball to downtown since the St. Paul Saints of the American Association played their games at The Pillbox from 1903-1909. The Pillbox, or Downtown Stadium, was located on the current site of the Metro Green Line Robert Street station between 12th and 13th Streets.In January 2018 TRIA Rink opened on the top floor of the former Macy's building since renamed Treasure Island Center. TRIA Rink is the practice facility for the Minnesota Wild and the home arena for the Minnesota Whitecaps of the National Women's Hockey League and Hamline University's hockey program.\nSince 2011, downtown has played host for the Red Bull Crashed Ice event. Crashed Ice is a winter extreme sporting event featuring ice cross downhill (or downhill ice cross) which involves downhill skating in an urban environment, on a track which includes steep turns and high vertical drops. The event coincides with the Saint Paul Winter Carnival and draws crowds of more than 100,000.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe neighborhood is served by five stops along the METRO Green Line light rail system.\n\nCapitol/Rice Street\nRobert Street station\n10th Street station\nCentral station\nUnion Depot station\n\n\n=== Skyway ===\nSimilar to its twin city, Minneapolis, Downtown Saint Paul has a skyway system consisting of 40 bridges that link most of the buildings along Kellogg Boulevard with the midcentury office core. The skyway is open seven days a week from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m., however businesses in the skyway are generally closed at 6 p.m. and on the weekends. Prominent buildings connected to the skyway include:\n\nCray Plaza\nHamm Building\nFirst National Bank Building\nMinnesota Building\nWells Fargo Place\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary ===\nSaint Paul Preparatory School\nCreative Arts Senior High School\nSaint Paul Conservatory for the Performing Artists\n\n\n=== Higher Education ===\nCollege of St. Scholastica - Satellite location\nMcNally Smith College of Music * McNally Smith College of Music has closed.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Padelford Riverboat Company, established in 1969, is the sole provider of river boat cruises within the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area in the Twin Cities of the U.S. State of Minnesota. Padelford boats cruise on the Mississippi River and celebrate the history of the region.\nThe Padelford Riverboat Company is based at Harriet Island in downtown St. Paul. The company was founded in 1969 by William Bowell - a World War II decorated veteran - at a time when the Mississippi River was neglected and underused.  The activities of Bowell and Padelford helped build relationships between the people and the river, and spurred positive changes on the riverfront.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounder William Bowell grew up close to the river, helping his father's small business on Harriet Island. He served in World War II, then enrolled at Macalester College after the war. His lifelong dream was to pilot a boat on the Mississippi River. He was a curator for the Minnesota Historical Society and later a businessman, but returned to the river in 1969 to start the Padelford Riverboat business. His lifelong collection of books about the river, along with historic photographs, books, blueprints, original documents, and other reference materials are stored in the Captain William D. Bowell, Jr. River Library, housed in the National Mississippi River Museum & Aquarium in Dubuque, Iowa.After initially purchasing the paddle steamer Jonathan Padelford, Bowell continued to expand the boat inventory. He also expanded the original boat itself - cutting it in half and adding a 20-foot section at midship. The eventual fleet included three coast-guard rated boats and 5 vessels total.\nIn 2006, the three co-owners sold one of their boats, the Harriet Bishop, to buy a new overnight cruiser to replace the Viking Explorer, which had been sold in 1998. But before they could get their hands on one, the economy slipped into recession and that extra cash ended up providing the necessary resources for the company to remain in operation.\n\n\n== Operations ==\nThe company was founded by Captain William Bowell, who retired in 2002, passing leadership of the company to his family members Bill Bowell Jr, Beth Myers, Shelley Kosmo, Steve Bowell, and Jim Kosmo; and General Manager Gus Gaspardo.The Padelford operated out of Harriet Island originally, and continues to this day. For a period from 1988 until 2004, they also operated from Boom Island in Minneapolis. Their Minneapolis operations were within a contract with the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, and ended when the two parties were unable to come to terms for a new contract.Starting in 1996, Padelford partnered with the National Park Service, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, the Science Museum of Minnesota, the St. Paul chapter of the National Audubon Society, Hamline University's Center for Global Environmental Education, and other government agencies and nonprofit organizations to create a temporary floating classroom/field trip series. This field trip series on a Padelford riverboat includes curriculums involving environmental studies, ecology, aquatic life and watershed stewardship as well as cultural studies and regional history.The Padelford company partnered with the University of Minnesota to bring back their flagship vessel, the Minnesota Centennial Showboat, containing a 210-seat theater. The Showboat Players - theater students of the University - performed melodramas and olios in that venue.  Originally operated by the University itself, the refurbished vessel arrived back at Harriet Island on April 17, 2002. The University decided to end the partnership due to declining interest in melodramas. Its final show - also featured during its first season - was Under the Gaslight in 2016.In 2004, the Padelford participated in the 2004 Grand Excursion, celebrating the 150-yr anniversary of the original grand excursion in 1854. As part of that event, the company provided public and private cruises from Diamond Bluff, Wisconsin for one week. The Padelford participated in other steamboat revival events throughout the region.The company was a founding member of the Passenger Vehicle Association and has been an active member in the association.\n\n\n== Mississippi riverfront resurgence ==\nIn the early part of the century, industrialization and farming activities caused the Mississippi to become very polluted. Not only was the MNRRA region named and identified, but regular recreational activity of all kinds increased starting in that period.When Bowell launched the Padelford, there were no cruise lines operating in that stretch of the River - the closest was in Iowa. The locks and dams had recently been built and the river was used mainly for industrial shipping. Bowell went against that grain and provided access to the river on a recreational basis, including also a dose of regional history in each excursion. Through to the current day, the company remains involved in a wide variety of activities focused on the River.\n\n\n== Vessels ==\nThe Jonathan Padelford is a nearly-authentic Mark Twain-era sternwheeler riverboat that was built in 1969 at Dubuque Boat and Boiler Co., Dubuque, IA. The boat replicates the paddle wheel mechanism, but operates on diesel fuel instead of the original steam technology. Two years after completion the Padelford was taken to a shipyard in Lemont, IL where it was cut in two and a 20-foot section was added at midship. The lengthening increased capacity and made the overall length 125 feet with a 24-foot beam. Capacity: 313. The name Jonathan Padelford is that of the founder's 10th great-maternal grandfather and territorial pioneer who came to Minnesota in 1856.In 1988 the 300-passenger sidewheeler Anson Northrup was added. Built in 1988 in Jennings, LA the Northrup started in service with public excursions on Father\u2019s Day, June 19, 1988. Length - 92 feet.\nIn 1990 a car/truck ferry vessel named the Brandon Paul from Tiptonville, Kentucky was acquired, renamed the Betsey Northrup and converted to a two deck, 300-passenger party barge. The main deck was enclosed while the second deck was left open but was covered for maximum sightseeing. Length - 108 feet.\nViking Explorer - formerly the Arkansas Explorer - Length - 110 feet; built in 1980; Capacity - 34 passengers. Mini cruise ship with 24 staterooms, provided cruises that ranged as far as Florida. Viking Explorer was sold in 1992.\nHarriet Bishop - Length - 98 Feet; Built 1987, Utica, Indiana; Capacity - Harbor Cruises: 350, Riverboat Race, Themed Harbor and Parade of Tall Stacks Cruises: 300, Lunch and Dinner Cruises: 264.\nCaptain Frank M. Whiting - Showboat built in 2002 by John Nichols of Mississippi Marine for the University of Minnesota and Padelford. Owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by Padelford as the replacement of the original Minnesota Centennial Showboat until 2016. Capacity - 499.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMinnesota Centennial Showboat\nSteamboats of the Mississippi\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDeck, Bob (November 24, 2013). \"St. Paul's Big River Journey\".

          "We took a Friday afternoon trip in late August. The trip was relaxing, comfortable and informative. There was a bar with beverages and food available to purchase. We will definitely try some of the other trips they offer when the leaves are changing this fall.",
          "It was a nice riverboat ride. The tour guide info was hard to hear as the volume was low with too many people talking over the sound.",
          "Took friends for an evening dinner cruise: could not be happier. Great meal, super courteous staff, wonderful way to relax and enjoy. The company is very good to work with and they are also family friendly. It's also helpful that they offer good vegetarian option with advance",
          "Joined great friends for their wedding on the riverboat cruise. Beautiful! Staff were friendly and helpful and really made the day special! The scenic views were awesome. Definitely must do!",
          "Joined the noon sailing and as it was a cold wet day we sat inside. Gradually several other groups came and we all had drinks and were happily waiting to leave. At 12.15 over 60 children entered and we sailed, The noise was deafening and ALL the adults who had been happy to sit",
          "Got a couple hours ? You by yourself, or bring your family, plenty of space and an extremely peaceful ride ... Gorgeous view the entire trip ! Recommended to all.",
          "Not a real historic paddle boat - but a trip up river to Harriet Island and with interesting wildlife including a few sightings of bald eagles. Very tranquil in the bustle of the twin cities",
          "The cruise was nice but don't go for the food. I attended a taco/margarita cruise and, when it was time to eat, they ran out of salsa and sour cream. The service was also poor- I had asked for a fork (I wanted to do a taco salad) and the worker seemed annoyed (needless to say-",
          "I'm glad I purchased my tickets on Groupon and therefore got a nicely discounted rate for 6 people. We did the 2:30 in the afternoon tour. Basically you either sit in the air-conditioned Lounge or on the upper deck along the sides, front, or back. This was an actual paddle boat.",
          "Had a relaxing time on the boat. Even my teenager liked it. Will try it again sometime. Maybe an evening cruise. Tips: If you buy tickets online you have to still exchange for a ticket at ticket booth. Boarding is 30 min before launch so get in line early for a good spot. Back",
          "We just took visiting family from Canada on a Saturday evening dinner cruise and it was delightful. We planned this as a highlight of the weekend family visit and our guests enjoyed it greatly and it was fun for us. The staff are professional, it was a lovely evening, the group",
          "We had hoped from the description we would have seen some of the points of interest on the river in the city. However our noon tour was spent downriver which was interesting for a short time but became simply boring (trees and shoreline) and a few reasonably interesting taped",
          "We went when they had a cheaper rate. If it wasn\u2019t for that it wouldn\u2019t have been worth it. The boat goes along the Mississippi River for an hour and a half and has a tape to listen to over the speakers. They have a restroom or the boat as well as a concession stand. I found the",

          "Strongly recommend taking this tour. Not only is it enjoyable, you learn a lot too! The Captain and his crew were very nice. The boat was very clean. I had my 15 year old son with us and he loved it.",
          "Most of the food had a good taste except the chips were stale. There was not enough food for everyone on the cruise. It definitely was not enough for a dinner portion. The beer served was about 3 ounces. Even though the scenery was nice, the food and beer was not worth the money",
          "Boat ride was beautiful, but food was mediocre and there was not enough food for all of the passengers. There wasn't nearly enough bacon. And if you don't like beer, drinks are pricey. Also, it is not an actual paddleboat. It is a barge pushed by a diesel tug. But the biggest",
          "While the scenery is nice, the food is subpar, by far. They ran out of food before everyone was able to get a plate. The food was mushy (chicken wings), soggy (tortilla chips), and the fondue is just nacho cheese that might have been mixed with beer. I wouldn't say the boat is",
          "We had a nice evening with extended family, boat was fairly empty and weather was perfect! Even if rain, though, covered boat would've still been very enjoyable! We all enjoyed the taco and chips/salsa bar, margaritas were great but line at bar was very slow especially",
          "We enjoyed an event hosted by the Padelford Packet Boat Co. It was Murder on the Mississippi, and very entertaining. The boat is comfortable, but be aware that narrow passages (stairwells) and uneven surfaces might discourage some footwear. We were able to buy drinks and watch",
          "We receive gift certificate for boat cruise for Christmas. They have many different types of cruises on the Mississippi River in St. Paul, MN. This is located at Harriet Island which in itself is a very popular park. We took a dinner cruise on a Tues. night. The crew was",

          "This was such a touristy thing to do but I wanted to see the fall colors. We were fortunate to have a beautiful sunny day. The boat was in good condition and the scenery was gorgeous. The food choices on board were awful and I could have done without the fake Narration. However",
          "Our Wednesday evening tour with a group of about 25 was fantastic. Although the boat wasn't super fancy, the laid-back crew made the trip. From the dinner servers to the captain, the relaxing atmosphere on a full moon night was memorable.",
          "I love the MIssissippi and what better way to wind down the summer than to go on a Beer and Bacon sunset cruise. What fun, sitting on the top deck as we lazily cruised up the river to watch the sunset. The theme of this cruise was Beer and Bacon. Fresh bacon bits Chex mix and",
          "Myself with several friends get together once a month and in August we decided to go on the Jonathan Paddleford. I have been on it previously, but not for years, so I was looking forward to it. We had so much fun during the ride. There is seating in a closed area on the first",
          "This boat tour is interesting and relaxing. If you sit near a speaker you can hear a lot of history, If you're not interested in history and are only along for the ride sit back and enjoy. If you want to munch on popcorn (or other snacks) and a pop or drink of your choice you",
          "We did this tour as part of a large group. It was great. We rode the Mississippi on a riverboat and had two guys playing banjo. We were served a lunch with a buffet on both decks. The food was very good. The crew was excellent. We went through lock #1 which was very cool. We",
          "First the boat holds 500 people according to their website. There is a place for everyone to sit but it just seemed crowded. There is an upstairs that is covered outside and a downstairs that is indoors but the windows open. Kids were running around a screaming. There are",
          "We were invited to a wedding that was held on the Padleford River Boat. This was a really neat event. Unfortunately it did rain during the ceremony, but the space is covered so we didn't get wet. It was really neat to have the wedding taking place while we were cruising",
          "We took the 12pm sightseeing cruise. There is not that much to see on this part of the river, but the cruise narration (recorded) was informative and full of historical tidbits. The cruise was 90 minutes, which was almost too long for my ten year old.",
          "July 2017 - After visiting the Capitol Building at St. Paul, Minnesota, we made our way to the Padelford Mississippi River Boat Rides on Harriet Island. It was quite a walk of about 30 minutes across one o the bridges just a few blocks up from the old train depot but we made it",
          "On Monday nights, Paddleford reduces its prices to $8 per person for the 6 PM tour. It is a great way to spend a summer evening. The ride lasts about and hour and a half, and you go upriver a few miles and then turn back. The scenery is nice and you have the chance to see",
          "It was okay. Nothing special. Most of the scenery was the river and trees. Chairs on the top deck were plastic and not comfortable. There were padded seats downstairs in an enclosed area, but very old and could use some updating to make it more enjoyable.",
          "First of all, the directions to get here were confusing (we got lost). Basically, it's in west Harriet Island Park. When you get to their stated address on Dr Justus Ohage road, just look for a big lot with lots of cars. Don't head away from the river. They tell you to turn",
          "The day we went out was very hot day.All seats were taken. So we stood outside whole time. I wished there were better seats and nice air conditioning room up there. It was so uncomfortably hot outside even there was room with air conditioning, it wasn't comfortable.",
          "We accept the invitation of Brian and Donna Maki from Elk River to go to this wonderful ride .Even the boat dont use Padle , the memories of Cartoons and Movies about the Mississipi river come the present....its a well conducted ride , a very clear day . Fuimos con mi Hermano",
          "We went on Memorial Day and they were offering free rides to veterans and their families. Every Monday, they have a reduced fare for everyone if you buy your tickets on their website. It's a nice ride down the upper Mississippi which is really different from what you see in",
          "We bought the family pass and have gone three times this summer. Lovely, easy, relaxing ride along the Mississippi River. Clean and comfortable. Food available. Reasonable prices. Beautiful views. Interesting people.",
          "We had some time to pass on a hot Saturday afternoon. Whenever I'm in a new city, I always take a narrated cruise on the river/Harbour or lake. Since most cities started because of their geography, especially to water, a river cruise is an excellent way to keep cool and learn",
          "My hubby & I got to experience Padelford Riverboats yesterday (5/6/17) while riding on the Harriet Northrop for my friends wedding. The boat was wonderful. It was very clean & in nice condition. The crew was FANTASTIC! The food was delicious. The ride was gloriously",
          "Extremely oversold. Expect to find no place to sit and to have a hard time seeing anything over the crowds lining the deck.",
          "This was a nice riverboat ride. The acoustics were good and the narration was interesting. Just an average riverboat ride.",
          "We celebrated our 5th wedding anniversary on one of their cruises. The one we took served ribs. The bbq chicken was good but the ribs were underwhelming. The entertainment was nice and the service was great.",
          "Our family took the afternoon cruise on the Mississippi River recently provided by 'Padleford Riverboats.' We were able to sit at the railings in a little group and enjoy the ride. A commentator provided nuggets of history along the way. The breezes made the ride very",
          "My husband and I enjoyed the Monday Madness riverboat ride. We saw several eagles and it was a perfect day to spend time on the river. The hot dog deal would have been great had the hot dogs been hot! A lukewarm hot dog is not my favorite and the soda was disgusting.",
          "Not the best dinner cruise I have ever been on. Music was too loud, they were all about selling alcohol, but I wasn't ever even offered a glass of ice water with my meal. Food was so-so. It wouldn't take much to up their game and make this really nice!",
          "An inexpensive outing with the kids. Tie in with lunch at Cassettas and a stroll through the Union Depot for the perfect outing!",
          "My husband and I took the Sunset Cruise at $49 each. The ride was very smooth and enjoyable. There was a large, raucous party on board but I can't fault the operators. There were 3 people working the bar area, 1 had to be brand new. Alcohol was $6.50 a drink. We took our drinks",
          "Ahoy! The riverboats are wonderful! There are a few different boats, probably depends on the size of the passenger list which boat they take out for each trip. The Monday sight-seeing deal is quite fantastic! $8 is a great price! There are snacks on board like hot dogs, pop",
          "We did the sightseeing tour. The Monday Madness ticket was only $8 each, this made it definitely worth the value and elevated it from a 3 to a 4 rating. We were under the impression that the cruise would pass by some of the downtown area but it heads straight up the river. As we",
          "My wife and I spent a relaxing 2 hours on the afternoon cruise as part of a road trip around the Mid-West States. Pleasant company and a bar on board were a bonus. Views only average but it's always a nice experience to take a couple of hours and chill out. Having cruised on the",
          "I have taken the Paddleford Sightseeing Cruise,,which lasts about 90 minutes,several times already this summer, and enjoyed it each time. I bought a season pass for four, and have used it to,spend time with family and friends. We have learned where the eagles nest is located and",
          "We had perfect weather! The tour was nice and not overly narrated. Passengers were allowed to enjoy it he ride and views. It was quite affordable as well.",
          "We we able to get tickets on the Thursday evening Margarita and Taco cruise. Purchased tickets on line. Arrived early, boarded early, it was a wonderful weather evening so chose to sit upstairs under the awning in utilitarian but comfortable plastic chairs, there are also",

          "Went for a murder mystery boat ride. It was awesome. Staff were super friendly. Boat was clean. It was a wonderful experience!",
          "Boat ride was beautiful, but food was mediocre and there was not enough food for all of the passengers.  There wasn't nearly enough bacon.  And if you don't like beer, drinks are pricey. Also, it is not an actual paddleboat.  It is a barge \u2026",
          "I'd give 0 stars if I could!\n1. Be prepared to wait at least 15-20 minutes to get a drink, the entire time. The \"bartenders\" look like high school students who have no idea how to bartend. \n2. The food was served 20 minutes late & you \u2026",
          "Took my 73-y.o. mother who's visiting from out of town on the Chef's Club (Ireland) cruise. Excellent food; superb customer service; friendly, courteous, and professional crew. Easy and accessible parking even with the Irish Festival going \u2026",
          "Relaxing for the most part. There are snacks and beverages (including a bar) available for purchase. The Mark Twain-is voice the belts out over the loud speaker is at times annoying. But the scenery is beautiful.",
          "No room to sit.  Not enough chairs.  Many could not find a seat and had to stand the 1 1/2 hours.  Few sat on the floor,  but could not see any of the sites. Their were elderly with canes standing and other's did not offer their seats.  Not worth they money.",
          "Margarita Tour was awesome.. not crowded. Very good mixed 2 for 1 Margaritas iced or frozen.",
          "Tour of the Mississippi River was great! Loved the history lesson and the snacks as well.",
          "Had such a great time on the Margarita Cruise! It was a fun way to celebrate a family member's birthday. The staff was great - helpful and friendly. I will absolutely recommend the cruise to friends (including you...the person reading this review)!",
          "They really need to do some cleaning and updating to their boats",
          "Had fantastic time on the Mississippi River! Highly recommended ",
          "Great opportunity to ride up and down the river. Only wish they would point our historical sights along the way!",
          "Relaxing tour, though you sit on plastic stackable chairs, the boat was full of people and many passengers were seated in a second type of row behind people on either side, making the experience far less intimate.",
          "This is a fun family friendly boat ride. My grandkids loved it so much we will be back again this summer",
          "While the scenery is nice, the food is subpar, by far. They ran out of food before everyone was able to get a plate. The food was mushy (chicken wings), soggy (tortilla chips), and the fondue is just nacho cheese that might have been mixed \u2026",
          "Great experience for father's day.",
          "Great experience for all ages.\n\nLearning about the history of St Paul, the Mississippi and seeing the wild life made for the perfect day off school activity.",
          "Can't beat 2 for 1 margaritas or beers",
          "Beautiful cruise on the Mississippi!",
          "Had a GREAT time with family and friends on the Padelford on a rainy Saturday in July. In spite of the rain - the seats were clean and dry which the staff helped with. We really enjoyed the running commentary on all the sites as we road along the river. We even got to see a wonderful bald eagle!",
          "Had a fun time with 93x's Rock the River and Wicked Garden Band !!",
          "It\u2019s ok. Boat feels old but staff is great! Couldn\u2019t hear the tour unfortunately because sound system so low.",
          "Nice tour, we took our parents and they loved the relaxing and historical information about the river.",
          "I am giving this a 3 because I can't give it a 2 and a half.  So my wife and I had 17 members of our family come in from PA over the August 11th weekend. I purchased some groupon tickets for the river cruise. The lady on the padleford side \u2026",
          "I get a summer pass every year.  Very relaxing ride down river",
          "What a blast! Margaritas and taco bar!!",
          "Perfect system!",
          "Once a year we rent out two boats and I have a blast...",

          "Had a blast, they very accommodating",
          "Great prices for an hour+l lesure boat ride.  Narrated by local Don Shelby which is informative and intermittent without being overbearing. It is an excellent way to spend the afternoon with your family.",
          "Would  have been a nice relaxing tour,but there were so many kids from summer schools screaming  and running all over. It made it hard to enjoy . Don't think I'd go again,unless they had one for adults only.",
          "Great river experience",
          "Very fun and relaxing",
          "Had a great time during the 4 hour cruise. Great scenery, good food and friendly staff made it a memorable event. ",
          "my friend and I traveled to the Padelfordl company expecting  a great and peaceful ride down the river but was greeted with about one hundred kids ranging from ages 5 to maybe 10  they were noisey loud and definitely did not want to be \u2026",
          "History, nature and relaxation of being on the water wrapped up in an enjoyable excursion.",
          "Love the paddlefird boat rides . Staff is very helpful and friendly .",
          "Great way to see the cities.",
          "I went on the Oktoberfest cruise with my family and we thought it was excellent value for the money. There was no way they were making money off the beer drinks, as buying 4 local microbrews for $11 is pretty much unheard of (it was 2 for \u2026",

          "pretty fun... just buy food ahead of time",
          "IS IT POSSIBLE TO RUN OUT OF FOOD? YES! call it a boat cruise.  They ran out of most of the food and still had half the passengers to get through the line.  The worker said the first group of people took too much food.  Whatever.",
          "Very fun time",
          "Great experience and fun.",

          "I cannot recommend them highly enough! My husband and I hosted our wedding reception with them. Their staff was extemely helpful, laid-back, and polite. They were clear and upfront about their very fair prices, and didn't try to gouge us \u2026",
          "We enjoyed a Lunch and Lock Cruise last weekend to celebrate our 8th anniversary.  The crew was lovely, the food was better than expected, and the boat was old but well loved.  The whole experience would have been perfect if it weren't for \u2026",

        "wiki": "Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul is a major metropolitan area built around the Mississippi, Minnesota and St. Croix rivers in east central Minnesota. The area is commonly known as the Twin Cities after its two largest cities, Minneapolis, the most populous city in the state, and its neighbor to the east Saint Paul, the state capital. It is an example of twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity. Minnesotans living outside of Minneapolis and Saint Paul often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) simply as \"the Cities.\"\nThere are several different definitions of the region. Many refer to the Twin Cities as the seven-county region which is governed under the Metropolitan Council regional governmental agency and planning organization. The Office of Management and Budget officially designates 16 counties as the \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul\u2013Bloomington MN\u2013WI Metropolitan Statistical Area\", the 16th largest in the United States. The entire region known as the \"Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul MN\u2013WI Combined Statistical Area\", has a population of 4,014,593, the 16th largest, according to 2018 Census estimates.\nDespite the 'Twin' moniker, the cities are independent municipalities with defined borders. Minneapolis sits mostly on the west side of the Mississippi, and is somewhat more modern with a relatively young Downtown and trendy Uptown. Saint Paul, which sits mostly on the east side of the river, has been likened to an East Coast city, with quaint neighborhoods and a vast collection of well-preserved late-Victorian architecture. The distinct urban cultures of the cities led an observer to note that \"St. Paul is the last city of the East; Minneapolis the first city of the West.\"Minneapolis was influenced by its early Scandinavian and Lutheran heritage, while Saint Paul was influenced by its early French, Irish and German Catholic roots.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first European settlement in the region was near what is now known as the town of Stillwater, Minnesota. The city is approximately 20 miles (30 km) from downtown Saint Paul and lies on the western bank of the St. Croix River, which forms the border of central Minnesota and Wisconsin. Another settlement that began fueling early interest in the area was the outpost at Fort Snelling, which was constructed from 1820 to 1825 at the confluence of the Minnesota River and the Mississippi River.Fort Snelling held jurisdiction over the land south of Saint Anthony Falls, thus a town known as Saint Anthony grew just north of the river. For several years, the only European resident to live on the south bank of the river was Colonel John H. Stevens, who operated a ferry service across the river. As soon as the land area controlled by Fort Snelling was reduced, new settlers began flocking across to the new village of Minneapolis. The town grew quickly, and Minneapolis and Saint Anthony eventually merged. On the eastern side of the Mississippi, a few villages such as Pig's Eye and Lambert's Landing developed and would soon grow to become Saint Paul.\n\nNatural geography played a role in the settlement and development of the two cities. The Mississippi River Valley in this area is defined by a series of stone bluffs that line both sides of the river. Saint Paul grew up around Lambert's Landing, the last place to unload boats coming upriver at an easily accessible point, some seven miles (11 km) downstream from Saint Anthony Falls, the geographic feature that, due to the value of its immense water power for industry, defined the location of Minneapolis and its prominence as the Mill City. The falls can be seen today from the Mill City Museum, housed in the former Washburn \"A\" Mill, which was among the world's largest mills in its time.\nThe oldest farms in the state are located in Washington County, the easternmost county on the Minnesota side of the metropolitan area. Joseph Haskell was Minnesota's first farmer, harvesting the first crops in the state in 1840 on what is now part of Afton Township on Trading Post Trail.\n\nThe Grand Excursion, a trip into the Upper Midwest sponsored by the Rock Island Railroad, brought more than a thousand curious travelers into the area by rail and steamboat in 1854. The next year, in 1855, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published The Song of Hiawatha, an epic poem based on the Ojibwe legends of Hiawatha. A number of natural area landmarks were included in the story, such as Lake Minnetonka and Minnehaha Falls. Tourists inspired by the coverage of the Grand Excursion in eastern newspapers and those who read Longfellow's story flocked to the area in the following decades.\nAt one time, the region also had numerous passenger rail services, including both interurban streetcar systems and interstate rail. Due to the width of the river at points further south, the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area was briefly one of the few places where the Mississippi could be crossed by railroad. A great amount of commercial rail traffic also ran through the area, often carrying grain to be processed at mills in Minneapolis or delivering other goods to Saint Paul to be transported along the Mississippi. Saint Paul had long been at the head of navigation on the river, prior to a new lock and dam facility being added upriver in Minneapolis.\nPassenger travel hit its peak in 1888 with nearly eight million traversing to and from the Saint Paul Union Depot. This amounted to approximately 150 trains daily. Before long, other rail crossings were built farther south and travel through the region began to decline. In an effort by the rail companies to combat the rise of the automobile, some of the earliest streamliners ran from Chicago to Minneapolis/Saint Paul and eventually served distant points in the Pacific Northwest. Today, the only vestige of this interstate service comes by Amtrak's Seattle/Portland to Chicago Empire Builder route, running once daily in each direction. It is named after James J. Hill, a railroad tycoon who settled on Summit Avenue in Saint Paul at what is now known as the James J. Hill House.\nLike many Northern cities that grew up with the Industrial Revolution, Minneapolis and St. Paul experienced shifts in their economic base as heavy industry declined, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Along with the economic decline of the 60s and 70s came population decline in the central city areas, white flight to suburbs, and, in the summer of 1967, race riots on Minneapolis's North Side. By the 1980s and 1990s, however, Minneapolis and Saint Paul were frequently cited as former Rust Belt cities that had made successful transitions to service, high-technology, finance, and information economies.In May and June 2020, the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area became a focus of international attention as a MPD officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes. The killing sparked local, nationwide and international protests against racism and police brutality, bringing considerable spotlight on the MPD. Bob Kroll, head of the MPD union, characterized Floyd as a \"violent criminal\" and called the protests a \"terrorist movement\". In June 2020, Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender announced that the city should dismantle its police department and replace it with a \"transformative new model of public safety.\"\n\n\n=== Rivalry ===\nMinneapolis and Saint Paul have competed since they were founded, resulting in some duplication of effort. After Saint Paul completed its elaborate Cathedral in 1915, Minneapolis quickly followed up with the equally ornate Basilica of St. Mary in 1926. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the rivalry became so intense that an architect practicing in one city was often refused business in the other. The 1890 United States Census even led to the two cities arresting and/or kidnapping each other's census takers, in an attempt to keep either city from outgrowing the other.The rivalry could occasionally erupt into inter-city violence, as happened at a 1923 game between the Minneapolis Millers and the St. Paul Saints, both baseball teams of the American Association. In the 1950s, both cities competed for a major league baseball franchise (which resulted in two rival stadiums being built), and there was a brief period in the mid-1960s where the two cities could not agree on a common calendar for daylight saving time, resulting in a period of a few weeks where people in Minneapolis were one hour \"behind\" anyone living or traveling in Saint Paul.The cities' mutual antagonism was largely healed by the end of the 1960s, aided by the simultaneous arrival in 1961 of the Minnesota Twins of the American League and the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, both of which identified themselves with the state as a whole (the former explicitly named for both Twin Cities) and not with either of the major cities (unlike the earlier Minneapolis Lakers). Since 1961, it has been common practice for any major sports team based in the Twin Cities to be named for Minnesota as a whole. In terms of development, the two cities remain distinct in their progress, with Minneapolis absorbing new and avant-garde architecture while Saint Paul continues to carefully integrate new buildings into the context of classical and Victorian styles.\n\n\n== Geography and geology ==\n\nAlong with much of Minnesota, the Twin Cities area was shaped by water and ice over the course of millions of years. The land of the area sits on top of thick layers of sandstone and limestone laid down as seas encroached upon and receded from the region. Erosion caused natural caves to develop, which were expanded into mines when white settlers came to the area. In the time of Prohibition, at least one speakeasy was built into these hidden spaces\u2014eventually refurbished as the Wabasha Street Caves in Saint Paul.\nLakes across the area were formed and altered by the movement of glaciers. This left many bodies of water in the region, and unusual shapes may appear. For example, Lake Minnetonka out toward the western side of the Twin Cities consists of a complex arrangement of channels and large bays. Elevations in the metropolitan area range from 1,376 feet (419 m) above sea level in the northwest metro to 666 feet (203 m) at the edge of the Mississippi River in the southeast.\n\nBecause it is comparatively easy to dig through limestone and there are many natural and man-made open spaces, it has often been proposed that the area should examine the idea of building subways for public transportation. In theory, it could be less expensive in the Twin Cities than in many other places, but the cost would still be much greater than surface projects.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nOwing to its northerly latitude and inland location, the Twin Cities experience the coldest climate of any major metropolitan area in the United States. However, due to its southern location in the state and aided further by the urban heat island, the Twin Cities is one of the warmest locations in Minnesota. The average annual temperature at the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport is 45.4 \u00b0F (7.4 \u00b0C); 3.5 \u00b0F (1.9 \u00b0C) colder than Winona, Minnesota, and 8.8 \u00b0F (4.9 \u00b0C) warmer than Roseau, Minnesota. Monthly average daily high temperatures range from 21.9 \u00b0F (\u22125.6 \u00b0C) in January to 83.3 \u00b0F (28.5 \u00b0C) in July; the average daily minimum temperatures for the two months are 4.3 \u00b0F (\u221215.4 \u00b0C) and 63.0 \u00b0F (17.2 \u00b0C) respectively.\n\nMinimum temperatures of 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) or lower are seen on an average of 29.7 days per year, and 76.2 days do not have a maximum temperature exceeding the freezing point. Temperatures above 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) occur an average of 15 times per year. High temperatures above 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C) have been common in recent years; the last occurrence was on July 6, 2012. The lowest temperature ever reported at the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport was \u221234 \u00b0F (\u221237 \u00b0C) on January 22, 1936; the highest, 108 \u00b0F (42 \u00b0C), was reported on July 14 of the same year. Early settlement records at Fort Snelling show temperatures as low as \u221242 \u00b0F (\u221241 \u00b0C). Recent records include \u221240 \u00b0F (\u221240 \u00b0C) at Vadnais Lake on February 2, 1996 (National Climatic Data Center)\nPrecipitation averages 29.41 inches (74.7 cm) per year, and is most plentiful in June (4.34 inches (11.0 cm)) and February (0.79 inches (2.0 cm)) the least so. The greatest one-day rainfall amount was 9.15 inches (23.2 cm), reported on July 23, 1987. The city's record for lowest annual precipitation was set in 1910, when 11.54 inches (29.3 cm) fell throughout the year; coincidentally, the opposite record was set the following year, which observed a total 40.15 inches (1,020 mm). At an average of 56.3 inches (1,430 mm) per year, snowfall is generally abundant.The Twin Cities area takes the brunt of many types of extreme weather, including high-speed straight-line winds, tornadoes, flash floods, drought, heat, bitter cold, and blizzards. The costliest weather disaster in Twin Cities history was a derecho event on May 15, 1998. Hail and Wind damage exceeded $950 million, much of it in the Twin Cities. Other memorable Twin Cities weather-related events include the tornado outbreak on May 6, 1965, the Armistice Day Blizzard on November 11, 1940, and the Halloween Blizzard of 1991. In 2019, Minnesota experienced its coldest temperatures since 1996, when a polar vortex dropped temperatures as low as \u221256 \u00b0F (\u221249 \u00b0C) in Cotton, MN with windchills lower than \u221260 \u00b0F (\u221251 \u00b0C) in much of the state. These temperatures are colder than those found on the surface of Mars. (See: Department of Natural Resources - Cold Outbreak: January 27-31, 2019)\nA normal growing season in the metro extends from late April or early May through the month of October. The USDA places the area in the 4a plant hardiness zone.\n\n\n== Communities ==\n\n\n=== MSA ===\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, or Twin Cities, includes 16 counties, of which 14 are in Minnesota and two in Wisconsin. The Minnesota portion accounts for almost two-thirds of Minnesota's population.\nNote: Counties that are bolded are under jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Council. Counties that are italicized were added to the metropolitan area when the Office of Management and Budget revised its delineations of metropolitan statistical areas in 2013.\n\n\n==== Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul\u2013Bloomington MN\u2013WI Metropolitan Statistical Area ====\n\n\n=== CSA ===\nThe Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, MN\u2013WI Combined Statistical Area is made up of 20 counties in Minnesota and two counties in Wisconsin. The statistical area includes two metropolitan areas and four micropolitan areas. As of the 2010 Census, the CSA had a population of 3,682,928 (though a July 1, 2012 estimate placed the population at 3,691,918).  In 2013, Owatonna, MN Micropolitan Statistical Area was added. The CSA definition encompasses 12,130 sq mi (31,400 km2) of area.\n\n\n==== Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, MN\u2013WI Combined Statistical Area ====\nNote: Owatonna MSA was not part of CSA in 2010.\n\n\n=== Cities and suburbs ===\nThere are approximately 218 incorporated municipalities within the Twin Cities metropolitan region. This includes census-designated places along with villages in Wisconsin, but excludes unincorporated towns in Wisconsin, known as civil townships in other states.\nEstimates are as of 2018 for cities with 25,000 or more inhabitants and 2020 for cities with 50,000 or more inhabitants.Principal cities (2018 / 2020 estimates)\nMinneapolis (437,069)\nSaint Paul (311,895)Places with 50,000 to 99,999 inhabitants\n\nPlaces with 25,000 to 49,999 inhabitants\n\nPlaces with 10,000 to 24,999 inhabitants\n\nPlaces with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants \n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Fine and performing arts ===\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area fine art museums include the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Walker Art Center, the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum, Minnesota Museum of American Art and The Museum of Russian Art. The Minnesota Orchestra and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra are full-time professional musical ensembles. The Guthrie Theater moved into a new building in 2006 overlooking the Mississippi River. The Minnesota Fringe Festival is an annual celebration of theatre, dance, improvisation, puppetry, kids' shows, visual art, and musicals.The Twin Cities is also the home of Minnesota Public Radio (MPR), the second largest public radio station in the country. It hosts both a classical station and a contemporary station, The Current, which plays music from regional and other contemporary artists. The MPR program A Prairie Home Companion, hosted by Minnesota native Garrison Keillor aired live for many years from the Fitzgerald Theater in Saint Paul. The show ended its run in 2016, with its successor Live from Here also airing from the same venue. This radio program was the basis of the 2006 film of the same name, A Prairie Home Companion.\nThe Current and the Walker Art Center also host an annual music festival Rock the Garden, which features nationally recognized and local artists. The festival has been annually presented since 2008 and has featured artists such as Lizzo, Hippo Campus, Chance the Rapper, Bon Iver, The Flaming Lips, Wilco and Sonic Youth.The Basilica of Saint Mary in the city of Minneapolis also hosts the annual Basilica Block Party, another annual music festival which brings in nationally recognized artists such as Weezer, Andy Grammer, Deathcab for Cutie and Panic! at the Disco. The festival is used as a fundraiser for the restoration of the basilica. The event draws approximately 25,000 people to the downtown area.\nAside from the music festivals that take place in the region, the Twin Cities area is also home to a number of venues where artists come to perform. Minneapolis is home to the famous First Avenue. First Avenue is known for being the starting venue for many famous artists and bands that have come from the area including Prince, The Replacements, Atmosphere, Manny Phesto and others. It became one of the most recognizable venues in Minnesota following the release of the Prince movie Purple Rain, in which the venue is featured.\n\n\n=== Outdoors ===\n\nThere are numerous lakes in the region, and cities in the area have some very extensive park systems for recreation. Organized recreation includes the Great River Energy bicycle festival, the Twin Cities Marathon, and the U.S. pond hockey championships. Some studies have shown that area residents take advantage of this, and are among the most physically fit in the country, though others have disputed that. Nonetheless, medicine is a major industry in the region and the southeasterly city of Rochester, as the University of Minnesota has joined other colleges and hospitals in doing significant research, and major medical device manufacturers started in the region (the most prominent is Medtronic). Technical innovators have brought important advances in computing, including the Cray line of supercomputers.\nIt is common for residents of the Twin Cities area to own or share cabins and other properties along lakes and forested areas in the central and northern regions of the state, and weekend trips \"up North\" happen through the warmer months. Ice fishing is also a major pastime in the winter, although each year some overambitious fishermen find themselves in dangerous situations when they venture out onto the ice too early or too late. Hunting, snowmobiling, ATV riding and numerous other outdoor activities are also popular. This connectedness with the outdoors also brings a strong sense of environmentalism to many Minnesotans.\nIn 2011 and 2012, the American College of Sports Medicine named Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul the healthiest metropolitan area in America.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nThe Twin Cities is one of thirteen American metropolitan areas to have teams in all four major professional sports \u2014 Baseball (MLB), Football (NFL), Basketball (NBA) and Ice Hockey (NHL). Including Major League Soccer (MLS), it is one of eleven metro areas to have five major sports. To avoid favoring either of the Twin Cities, most teams based in the area use only the word Minnesota in their name, rather than Minneapolis or Saint Paul.\nMinneapolis was the site of two Super Bowls \u2013 Super Bowl XXVI in 1992 and Super Bowl LII in 2018. It was the farthest north that a Super Bowl has ever been played. Minnesota has played in four Super Bowls - IV in 1970, VIII in 1974, IX in 1975 and XI in 1977.\nThe World Series has been played in the Twin Cities three times \u2013 1965, 1987 and 1991 \u2013 as well as three Major League Baseball All-Star Games \u2013 1965, 1985 and 2014. All-Star games in the National Hockey League were hosted in 1972 and 2004, the National Basketball Association in 1994 and the Women's National Basketball Association in 2018.\nThe Stanley Cup Finals have been played in the Twin Cities twice \u2013 1981 and 1991 \u2013 as well as the NHL Stadium Series played host to a game in 2016.\nThe Final Four Men's National College Athletics Association (NCAA) basketball tournament has been hosted by Minneapolis four times \u2013 1951, 1992, 2001 and 2019 \u2013 and Women's one time \u2013 1995. The women's tournament will return to Minneapolis in 2022.\n\nMajor golf tournaments hosted in the Twin Cities include: US Open \u2013 1916, 1930, 1970, 1991; US Women's Open \u2013 1966, 1977, 2008; PGA Championship \u2013 1932, 1954, 2002, 2009; Women's PGA Championship - 2019; Walker Cup \u2013 1957; Solheim Cup \u2013 2002 and the Ryder Cup \u2013 2016. The Ryder Cup is scheduled to return in 2028.\nThe 1998 World Figure Skating Championships was held at Target Center in Minneapolis.\nThe 2017, 2018 and 2019 X Games were held in Minneapolis.  The 2020 X Games was cancelled on April 25 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nThe Twin Cities host three nationally competing Roller Derby leagues: The Minnesota Roller Derby of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association Division 1, the North Star Roller Derby of WFTDA Division 2, and Minnesota Men's Roller Derby, a league of the Men's Roller Derby Association. MNRD and NSRD possess four home teams each: the Dagger Dolls, Garda Belts, Rockits, and Atomic Bombshells of MNRD and the Banger Sisters, Delta Delta Di, Kilmores, and Violent Femmes of NSRD, as well as two traveling teams each. MMRD possesses three home teams: The Gentlemen's Club, Destruction Workers, and Thunderjacks, and two traveling teams.\nThe annual Twin Cities Marathon is held in the fall with a course running through Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Minneapolis was the birthplace of Rollerblade and is a center for inline skating, as well as home to the most golfers per capita of any city in the U.S. Additionally, water skiing got its start on Lake Pepin, a lake southeast of the metropolitan area, located in the Mississippi River about 50 miles (80 km) downstream from Saint Paul.Some other sports teams gained their names from being in Minnesota before relocating. The Los Angeles Lakers get their name from once being based in Minneapolis, the City of Lakes. The Dallas Stars also derived their present name from their tenure as a Minnesota team, the Minnesota North Stars.\n\n\n==== Professional sports teams in Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul ====\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\n\n==== Print ====\nThe Twin Cities have two major daily newspapers: the Star Tribune and the Saint Paul Pioneer Press. Additionally, the Minnesota Daily serves the University of Minnesota's Twin Cities campus and surrounding neighborhoods. There is one general-interest neighborhood weekly newspaper still in the cities: The East Side Review, devoted to the 90,000 residents in the eastern third of Saint Paul. Other weekly papers are devoted to specific audiences/demographics including City Pages.\n\n\n==== Television ====\n\nThe region is currently ranked as the 15th largest television market according to Nielson Media Research. Three duopolies exist in the Twin Cities: Twin Cities PBS operates both KTCA and KTCI, Hubbard Broadcasting (built by Stanley E. Hubbard) owns both ABC affiliate KSTP-TV and independent station KSTC-TV, and Fox Television Stations operates both Fox owned-and-operated station KMSP-TV and MyNetworkTV O&O WFTC. Diversified from radio, KSTP-TV became the first television channel to air in the region with a show reaching 3,000 television sets in 1948, and the 17th station to broadcast in the U.S.\n\nThe only station with its main studios in Minneapolis is CBS O&O WCCO, while Saint Paul is host to KSTP/KSTC, KTCA/KTCI, and CW affiliate WUCW. NBC affiliate KARE has a sprawling broadcasting complex in west suburban Golden Valley. KMSP is located in southwest suburban Eden Prairie. Other stations are located in the suburbs. For much of the last two decades, WCCO and KARE have shared in having the most popular evening newscasts of the area channels. On the other end, KSTP has struggled to maintain ratings on its news programs. KMSP has had a 9 o'clock newscast since at least the early 1990s when it was an independent channel.\nCommunities in the region have their own Public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable television channels. One channel, the Metro Cable Network, is available on channel 6 on cable systems across the seven-county region.\nSeveral television programs originating in the Twin Cities have been aired nationally on terrestrial and cable TV networks. KTCA created the science program Newton's Apple and distributes a children's program today. A few unusual comedic shows also originated in the area. In the 1980s, KTMA (predecessor to WUCW) created a number of low-budget shows, including cult classic Mystery Science Theater 3000. The short-lived Let's Bowl started on KARE, and PBS series Mental Engineering originated on the Saint Paul cable access network.\n\n\n==== Radio ====\nThe radio market in the Twin Cities is ranked 15th by Nielsen in 2018, similar to its TV market size. In November 2018, the top five morning radio shows in the area were all FM stations: KSTP, KXFN, KQQL, KDWB, and KXXR. Three of the top five morning radio stations are owned by iHeartRadio. Most radio stations broadcast on air, and can be heard as well over the internet, as live streams from the web site of each radio station.\n\nKSTP, a television station, also has radio stations, with pop music format on FM and ESPN Radio on AM. KSTP-AM and FM are owned by Hubbard Broadcasting. In 1985, Hubbard \u2013 valued at $400 million \u2013 was one of the larger corporate media companies in the United States; in 2005, valued at US$1.2 billion, Hubbard is a fairly small major-market media operation.The Twin Cities have a mix of commercial and non-commercial radio stations. The city's market is dominated by iHeartRadio which operates seven stations. Two small, independent stations are award winners \u2014 KUOM operated by the University of Minnesota and KFAI public access radio in Cedar Riverside.Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) airs on KNOW 91.1 FM, KSJN 91.5 FM and KCMP 89.3 FM, with separate programs on each station. It is a major player in the state and across the country, first known across the U.S. for the variety show A Prairie Home Companion, which ceased production in 2016. Doing business under the name American Public Media, the company is the second largest producer of National Public Radio content, behind National Public Radio (of which MPR is an affiliate). KCMP is also known as The Current.\n\n\n==== Independent media ====\nThe Twin Cities is also home to many independent media organizations, including The UpTake, MinnPost and Twin Cities Daily Planet.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n\n=== Place of birth ===\nApproximately 93.2% of the metropolitan area's population was native to the United States. Approximately 92.6% were born in the U.S. while 0.6% were born in Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, or born abroad to American parents. The rest of the population (6.8%) were foreign-born.\nThe highest percentages of immigrants came from Asia (38.2%), Latin America (25.4%), and Africa (20.1%); smaller percentages of newcomers came from Europe (13.1%), other parts of North America (3.0%), and Oceania (0.2%).With regards to ethnicity, the metropolitan area is predominantly white, with every county having at least 70% of its population coming from that background. However, the area is gradually becoming more diverse over time.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nMinneapolis\u2013Saint Paul is also a major center for religion in the state, especially Christianity. The state headquarters of five major Christian churches are found here: the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, the Episcopal Diocese of Minnesota, the Presbyterian Synod of Lakes and Prairies, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The Presbyterian and LDS churches both have missions in Saint Paul, Minneapolis, and Bloomington as well as the Orthodox Church in America.\nThe headquarters of the former American Lutheran Church (ALC), Evangelical Lutheran Church, Lutheran Free Church and the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church were located in Minneapolis; the headquarters of Augsburg Fortress publishing house still is. The Minneapolis Area Synod and the Saint Paul Area Synod are the first and third largest synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), respectively.\nThe Evangelical Free Church of America has its headquarters in Bloomington, and the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations is headquartered in Plymouth, along with its seminary and a Bible School.\nThe Twin Cities are home to several synagogues serving the Jewish population, which is concentrated in the western Minneapolis suburbs of Golden Valley, St. Louis Park, Plymouth and Minnetonka. There is also a Hindu temple located in the Twin Cities suburb of Maple Grove. A recent influx of immigrants from Laos and Northern Africa has brought many more religions to the area. There are several Islamic Masjids in the area. There is a temple for the religion of Eckankar in the suburb of Chanhassen known as the Temple of Eck. In addition, many Hmong and Tibetan Buddhist peoples live in Saint Paul; a Hmong Buddhist temple opened in suburban Roseville in 1995. The LDS St. Paul Minnesota Temple opened in Oakdale, a suburb east of Saint Paul, in 2000. There are several very strong Unitarian Universalist communities such as the First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis, as well as several Pagan and Buddhist groups. The cities of Saint Paul and Minneapolis have been called Paganistan due to the large numbers of Pagans living there. There are an estimated 20,000 Pagans living in the Twin Cities area.Minneapolis is where the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association started and was its home for more than fifty years.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe 2008 Republican National Convention was held at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul. Minneapolis and Saint Paul submitted combined bids to host the 2008 Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention. Minneapolis hosted the 1892 Republican National Convention.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area is home to 21 Fortune 1000 headquarters \u2013 2019 rankings\n\nA number of private companies are also headquartered in the Twin Cities area, including Cargill, the country's largest private company, Carlson, Radisson Hotel Group, Mortenson, Holiday Stationstores, and Andersen. Foreign companies with U.S. headquarters in the Twin Cities include Aimia, Allianz, Canadian Pacific, Coloplast, Medtronic, Pearson VUE, Pentair and RBC.\nThe Twin Cities's economy is the 13th largest in the U.S. and ranks second in the Midwest. The Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area also ranks as the second largest medical device manufacture center in North America and the fourth-biggest U.S. banking center, based on total assets of banks headquartered in the metro area, ranking behind New York, San Francisco, and Charlotte, N.C. metropolitan areas.The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis covers the 9th District of the Federal Reserve System, which is made up of Minnesota, Montana, North and South Dakota, northwestern Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Its geographical territory is the third largest of the 12 Federal Reserve banks.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\n\n==== Libraries with # of branches ====\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Buildings and structures ===\n\nThe four tallest buildings in the area are located in downtown Minneapolis. Today there is some contention over exactly which building is the tallest\u2014most Minnesotans would immediately think of the IDS Center if queried on the point, although most sources seem to agree that Capella Tower is slightly taller. But in early 2005, it was found that the IDS Center is taller by a 16-foot (5 m) washroom garage on top, which brings its total height to 792 feet (241 m). Capella Tower and the Wells Fargo Center only differ in height by a foot or two, a rather negligible amount.\nBuildings have gone up and been torn down rapidly across the region. Some city blocks have been demolished six or seven times since the mid-19th century, and will undoubtedly reach an eighth or ninth cycle in short order. No single architectural style dominates the region. Instead, the cities have a mish-mash of different designs, although structures from a few eras stand out. There were once a great many stone buildings constructed in the Richardsonian Romanesque style (or at least Romanesque-inspired variants). Minneapolis City Hall is one prominent example of this, though buildings of all types\u2014including personal residences such as the James J. Hill House\u2014were similarly designed. A few decades later, Art Deco brought several structures that survive today, including St. Paul City Hall, the Foshay Tower, and the Minneapolis Post Office. The style of buildings in the two cities varies greatly. In Minneapolis, the trend has been buildings with sleek lines and modern glass facades while Saint Paul tends to follow a more traditional style of buildings so as to better accompany its older structures.\n\nSaint Paul and Minneapolis in particular went through some massive urban renewal projects in the post-World War II era, so a vast number of buildings are now lost to history. Some of the larger and harder to demolish structures have survived. In fact, the area might be signified more by bridges than buildings. A series of reinforced concrete arch spans crossing the Mississippi River were built in the 1920s and 1930s. They still carry daily traffic, but remain pleasing to the eye despite their age (a number have undergone major repair work, but retain the original design). Several of the bridges are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. They include the 10th Avenue Bridge, Intercity Bridge (Ford Parkway), Robert Street Bridge, and the longest, the 4,119 ft (1,255 m) Mendota Bridge next to Fort Snelling. The area is also noted for having the first known permanent crossing of the Mississippi. That structure is long gone, but a series of Hennepin Avenue Bridges have been built since then at the site. Both downtowns have extensive networks of enclosed pedestrian bridges known as skyways.\n\nSeveral prominent buildings in Minneapolis have helped modernize the city. These include the Walker Art Center, Central Public Library, Weisman Art Museum and the Guthrie Theater. Opening in April 2005, the new Walker Art Center, nearly double in size, includes increased indoor and outdoor facilities. The Walker is recognized internationally as a singular model of a multidisciplinary arts organization and as a national leader for its innovative approaches to audience engagement. The Guthrie received a large amount of media coverage for its opening in June 2006. The design is the work of architect Jean Nouvel and is a 285,000 square feet (26,500 m2) facility that houses three theaters: the theater's signature thrust stage, seating 1,100; a 700-seat proscenium stage; and a black-box studio with flexible seating. In 2002, the National Trust for Historic Preservation put the old Guthrie building on its list of the most endangered historic properties in the United States in response to plans announced by the Walker Art Center to expand on the land occupied by the theater. However, the original Guthrie building was torn down in 2006. These building projects have rejuvenated the downtown area.\n\n\n=== Healthcare ===\n\n\n==== Hospitals with # beds ====\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Roads and highways ====\n\nIn the 20th century, the Twin Cities area expanded outward significantly. Automobiles made it possible for suburbs to grow greatly. The area now has a number of freeways to transport people by car. The area incorporates a large number of traffic cameras and ramp meters to monitor and manage traffic congestion. There is some use of HOV (high-occupancy vehicle) express lanes, which is becoming much more common. In order to use an express lane, a driver must have a MnPASS transponder or have at least one passenger. MnPASS rates are determined by the amount of traffic on the road and/or the time of day. During non-peak times, the MnPASS express lanes, with the exception of those on Interstate 394 (I-394) between Minnesota Highway 100 (MN 100) and I-94, are open to all traffic.\nI-94 comes into the area from the east and heads northwest from Minneapolis. Two spur routes form the I-494/I-694 loop, and I-394 continues west when I-94 turns north. Additionally, I-35 splits in Burnsville in the southern part of the Twin Cities region, bringing I-35E into Saint Paul and I-35W into Minneapolis. They join together again to the north in Columbus, (just south of Forest Lake) and continue to the highway's terminus in Duluth. This is one of only two examples of an Interstate Highway splitting into branches and then rejoining into one again; the other split occurs in Dallas-Fort Worth, where I-35 also splits into east and west branches.\nOn August 1, 2007, a large portion of the I-35W Mississippi River bridge near University Avenue in the city of Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River around 6:05pm CDT. A replacement bridge opened on Thursday, September 18, 2008.\n\n\n==== Air travel ====\nThe main airport in the region is Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), which is a major hub for Delta Air Lines. The airport is also the main hub and operating base for Sun Country Airlines. There are six smaller (relief) airports in the area which are owned and operated by the Metropolitan Airports Commission (the same agency operates the main MSP airport). Some people even commute by air to the Twin Cities from the northern part of the state.\n\nRelief airports in the metropolitan area are:\n\n\n==== Public transit ====\n\nMetro Transit, by far the biggest bus service provider in the area, owes its existence to the old streetcar lines that ran in the area. Metro Transit provides about 95% of the public transit rides in the region with over 900 buses, although some suburbs have other bus services. The University of Minnesota, Twin Cities operates a free bus system between its campuses. This system includes the Campus Connector bus rapid transit line which travels between the Minneapolis and Saint Paul campuses by a dedicated bus line, and throughout the two campuses on normal access roads. The METRO Blue Line LRT (light rail) began operations in June 2004, connecting downtown Minneapolis, Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport and the Mall of America in Bloomington. It was followed by the METRO Red Line BRT (bus rapid transitway) in 2013 connecting the Mall of America with Lakeville along Cedar Avenue through the southern suburbs. The METRO Green Line LRT connecting downtown Minneapolis, the University of Minnesota campus and downtown Saint Paul along University Avenue opened in June 2014. All three lines are operated by Metro Transit. Additionally, the Northstar Line commuter rail line connecting Minneapolis with Big Lake opened in November 2009; the line may be extended to St. Cloud as ridership numbers warrant.\nIn many ways the light rail of today is a return to the streetcars that existed in the past, it is being used as a stepping-stone to other projects.\n\nA variety of rail services are currently being pondered by state and local governments, including neighborhood streetcar systems, intercity light rail service, and commuter rail options out to exurban regions. In addition, Minnesota is one of several states in the Midwest examining the idea of setting up high-speed rail service using Chicago as a regional hub.The Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area has been criticized for inadequate public transportation. Compared to many other cities its size, the public transportation system in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area is less robust. As the metropolitan area has grown, the roads and highways have been updated and widened, but traffic volume is growing faster than the projects needed to widen them, and public transportation has not expanded enough to commensurate with the population. The Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area is ranked as the fifth worst for congestion growth of similar-sized U.S. metropolitan areas.\nAdditional lines and spurs are needed to upgrade public transportation in the Twin Cities. Plans are underway for Green Line extension connecting downtown Minneapolis to the southwest suburb of Eden Prairie. A northwest LRT (Blue Line extension) along Bottineau Boulevard is being planned from downtown Minneapolis to Brooklyn Park. The METRO Orange Line BRT will open in 2021, connecting downtown Minneapolis with Lakeville to the south along I-35W. The METRO Gold Line BRT is planned to connect downtown Saint Paul to the eastern suburbs within the next few years.\n\n\n== Honors ==\nThe United States Navy currently has one ship named for the region, USS Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul, a Los Angeles-class submarine launched in 1983. Previously, two sets of two ships each had carried the names USS Minneapolis and USS Saint Paul.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nFlyby video courtesy NASA/Goddard Scientific Visualization Studio\nFact sheet about Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul Metropolitan Area Comparison\nHistory of the National Weather Service in Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, Minnesota\nGIS-based Demographic Guide to Twin Cities Region\nLost Twin Cities \u2013 Documentary produced by Twin Cities Public Television",

          "Incredibly beautiful and informative display. Many interesting stories anniversary the lives of Native American women were featured. I also enjoyed a tasty and healthy lunch!",
          "We took an hour docent tour which was excellent but this is a huge museum with more displays that you can possibly see and enjoy in a day. After the docent tour we headed to one of the big areas but to see more we had to go back another time. A great deal of walking, a great",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this art institute. I spent about three hours walking through the displays and still didn\u2019t get to see everything. I cannot believe that it is free to the public. They have a little bit of everything to entice you and educate you. And they don\u2019t",
          "My hubby thought that we were heading to a gallery. Mind blown. I've loved this place for years. The Prosperity Gate installation is fantastic.",

          "I thought the Minneapolis Institute of Art would be a lot smaller. I was surprised at how large it is. I enjoyed myself. I would love to return to eat the restaurant that was closed for the season. There were a few exhibits I was not able to fully explore. There are various",
          "MIA offers endless possibilities to excite one's senses and intrigue one's curiosity. Special exhibits, as well as permanent collections, are bountiful and varied. We never run out of reasons to spend an afternoon at our favorite Minneapolis museum.",
          "This museum is wonderful. It's quite large and has a fantastic collection. Admission is free (but sometimes special exhibits have a fee). If you like looking at art, I highly recommend visiting and spending at least a couple hours.",
          "They had some of my faves: Miro, Picasso Missing some of my faves: Twombly, Naumann. Lots of non-modern stuff. Greek, Roman, early American. I'd like more modern, surreal, or video installations. But it is also FREE. How can you top that!",
          "The museum is downtown, but we found immediate street parking on a Sunday afternoon just outside. It's a lovely museum, a wonderful selection of art from medieval times to present, Europe and America, as well as specialized areas such as judaica. Plenty of artists whom we know",
          "Great way to spend a few hours or an entire day viewing Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Thailand Buddha\u2019s and art, Greek and Roman sculptures and art, African art, and just about every other type of art with great history and commentary. Also a selection of period rooms, stained",
          "We've been to many museums inside and outside the US, including many of the world's most well-known art museums. MIA ranks right up there, in our opinion. First off, it's much larger than we expected. We spent an entire day here and only got through one floor. There's so much",
          "Easy parking ramp just south of the building if street parking isn't available. It is now a paid ramp. Also a paid lot across the street. Cafe inside for a beverage or snack. The MIA is a beautiful building with a variety of items from around the world. If there is an event",
          "This museum is worth spending the day at. The variety of the collections is staggering. One gallery leads to the next, and so on until you feel a little lost in the art. There are paintings, statues, furniture, whole rooms! The jade collection is beautiful. There is also a",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Art Institute. We started on the third floor which had an interesting mix of American and European art plus furniture. There were also Impr paintings and Surrealism art. We never even made it to the 2nd floor - since we ran out of steam",
          "As we only had a short visit to Minneapolis, we only planned two hours for MIA. Boy that was not enough time at all. Not only do they have a great collection of art, the various experience there is awesome. I can't believe the whole thing is entirely free. We would definitely go",
          "Very extensive collection of ancient and modern artfrom the entire world. Beautiful architecture also.",
          "It's nice that the MIA is free to enter and you can donate if you want/are able. I've visited several times. The collections they have are quite varied, and I enjoy the spring art in bloom when they have flowers that they pair with art to mimic the mood or style of the",
          "Our family spent about an hour and a half here and enjoyed it. I was surprised how large it is - you could probably spend a whole day here. The museum was well laid out and the art was varied and high quality. Admission is free and there is a pay parking lot nearby.",
          "Went to the M.I.A. August 7 with 2 college students. Admission is free, except for special exhibits. Free on street parking nearby. Started on the 3rd floor, was there almost 2 hours-never made it to the 2nd floor! First floor is basically the gift store and a small grab and go",

          "There is way too much to take in here in just one visit. I would plan to focus on a couple of collections, and then just stroll through the various rooms. A highlight of the city.",
          "This museum does an amazing job of spanning so many different areas of the world and eras and styles of art. Give yourself plenty of time to browse as the collection is quite large and very well curated. I really was impressed by how many different types of exhibits they had.",

          "I have visited the M.I.A. at least 6 times a year for the past 4 years. Every time I've gone I have learned a great deal about art, d\u00e9cor, artists, and history. Whether a docent-led tour or just browsing my way through, it is informative and uplifting.",
          "Housed in a magnificent classical building, this museum is as huge as the Metropolitan in New York City and has an equally impressive collection of art. There is something for every art lover from every period of art. We spent and afternoon there and felt we had only scratched",
          "The current Hearts Of People, a collection of native American art, is one of the finest curated shows in the country. It is a beautiful show that captures the Indigenous culture. We are so fortunate to have this available to us. And ... this is one of the only major city",
          "MIA is a lovely Museum with a wide variety of art in an impressive space. You can easily spend half a day in here. Rotating exhibits are generally worth the extra cost of admission. Cold- bring a sweater.",

          "My first trip to MIA was exceptional. The exhibit of Native American Women's Art was impressive. Since we were in Minneapolis for the weekend, we are so glad we experienced the atmosphere of this museum and exhibit. Next visit we will stop by again.",
          "Definitely didn't get to spend as much time here as I would have liked. In a couple of hours, I really only had time to do a fly by on a small portion of the space. There were a number of unique exhibits. I think there is something there to interest people of all age groups and",
          "I went on a weekday just after lunch, used the adjacent parking garage and spent the next few hours enjoying some amazing art! Wear your best walking shoes and comfy clothes because you\u2019ll want to revisit some things on your tour. The Asian pottery alone runs from 5000 BCE to",
          "From innovative traveling exhibitions to compelling installations of traditional artwork, MIA is a feast for the eyes and mind.",
          "This place is a great way to spend a half day appreciating beauty and art. It's bigger than it looks from outside, but not as big as the Art Institute in Chicago or the Met in NYC, nor does it hold a wide range of pieces. Entrance is free and donations are welcome. It's located",
          "I was visiting Minneapolis for a conference, and saw an ad for the special exhibit of Native American women's art at MIA. Kudos to MIA for putting together such an amazing exhibit--it is fantastic! I walked through the special exhibit twice to better take it all in. I would",
          "I went there with my mother and sister and we found it to be very interesting. We definitely learned new things and the sculptures, and improvised rooms will transport you to that era. I would definitely go back if I have more than two hours to walk in it.",
          "I'm not much of an \"art\" person, but I do like history and enough of the exhibits seem to fall into the history category that I did enjoy myself. The Asian exhibit seems to be the primary focus.",
          "We went here to see the exhibition of work by native American women artists and it was magical. Very sensitively done and content rich. Respectful of native traditions and understanding that nobody speaks for everyone. The rest of the museum is equally well done with traditional",
          "We love the MIA! We attended the Art in Bloom event, as my niece had a work accepted for the event. What a wonderful experience! Floral artists are invited to interpret one of the artworks from the museum and have it displayed for the weekend. It is free admission, which is so",
          "This museum will wear you out - it's so large. The rooms go on and on. You will see works by many well-known artists: Van Gogh, Gaughin, Monet, Renoir, Picasso, and a Rembrandt that really surprised us. Many more too. The gift shop is quite nice. How nice that the museum is free",
          "If you are a museum lover, don;t miss this one. Admission is free. Excellent Asian exhibit that includes rooms as they would have looked centuries ago. Permanent collection is strong with many well known pieces. Quite interesting are the exhibits of furniture and manufactured",
          "The museum's permanent collection is top notch, especially for a city of this size. I absolutely adore the Asian Art collection including Jade Mountain. However, the traveling exhibits of late have been overcrowded, hard to navigate, and very difficult for someone who is",
          "I\u2019m not an art fanatic, but this place had some very interesting things to see. What\u2019s so impressive is the age of lots of the items. It was great to see all they had on display. I\u2019m gonna have to make time to return since there was much that I didn\u2019t get to check out.",
          "I been in top museums all over the world and this museum ranks up there. the Asian collection is excellent with interesting addition to the normal collection of rooms that would have existed in homes in older Asian cultures. On the second floor, wonderful paintings, furnishing",

          "First, we were amazed this place was free. Then we started exploring the exhibits and were amazed at the variety and quality of the paintings and artifacts on display. We spent 3-4 hours there and we didn't feel like we scratched the surface. If you're interested in art, and",
          "So many surprising finds from all over the world at this museum that are amazing! The MIA (Minneapolis Institute of Art) is truly a treasure trove of original artifacts, relics, sculpture and paintings you will enjoy. The museum is huge and you can spend a good 4 hours in there",
          "I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was free admission with donations only. They had a fantastic art collection including paintings from several notable impressionist artists. The museum was bigger than we expected and it took us about 3 hours of quickly running through",
          "The Minneapolis Institute of the Arts (MIA) is an amazing and large museum! You can literally spend ALL DAY just wandering around looking at all the art. In addition to their ongoing exhibits including many of the masters such as Renoir, Monet and Van Gogh, they host amazing",
          "Had a great afternoon walking around the museum. Second time there this month and saw new things I somehow missed last time. Lots to see. Excellent space",
          "I have been going to MIA for decades for visits. They have a great collection of classical art, period art, preserved period rooms, modern art. Some of my favorites are Chihuly Glass, Monet Haystacks, armor and weapons, Eastern and African art.",
          "So much to look at that it requires several visits to really see everything. Great experience. Delicious little restaurant inside with healthy food options.",
          "The fact that this museum is free is unbelievable. The quality of this museum is outstanding. You need to reserve a couple of hours to discover this place. Totally recommended.",
          "Great free collection and interesting exhibits too. Good for all the family. Excellent cafe on site.",
          "MIA is one of the nation's few major art museums that still does no charge an entrance fee. They don't even pressure you up for a suggested donation. Just enter the lobby,walk past the desk, and enter the museum. (Note: Occasionally there are temporary special exhibits that",
          "It's Japanese collection has exploded! A great place to take the family. My wife & I like to take homemade sushi. We each take off separately to spend an hour or two at a specific collection, we meet back at the table area, buy drinks, eat sushi and talk about what we saw.",
          "Having lived in the Twin Cities for 10 years, I\u2019d never been to the Mia until very recently.... it is HUGE and incredible and full of thousands of interesting artifacts from all over the world. We spent two hours there and still hadn\u2019t seen everything. I highly recommend going",
          "We were amazed at the size and diversity of the MIA. It's more like a museum, it feels about the same size as the British Museum (not as many artifacts but the size feels similar). Expect to spend a lot of time and wear comfortable shoes. Free admission and free street",
          "Great museum in downtown Minneapolis. Be sure to see the Frank Lloyd Wright room. Just a joy to tour. Lovely cafe. Parking is close by.",
          "Went for a special exhibition that was super busy. The timed entry allowed you to view the exhibit without feeling crowded or rushed. Truly enjoyed",
          "Impressed with the fact that the long running exhibits are free of charge. However there are rotating or special exhibits that are also available for an admission fee. This was my first visit and I enjoyed the quality and variety of exhibits. Allow at least a couple of",
          "We moved to the Cities, via Denver and L.A. in 1996. Knowing nothing about Minneapolis or Minnesota before coming here, we half-expected the place to be a cultural iceberg. The MIA puts the lie to that expectation immediately, often, and reliably. (Several other museums and",
          "MIA offers art from ancient through modern, with rotating special exhibits and admission is free (except for some special shows). Wander through period rooms, photo exhibits, Dutch Master paintings, Frank Lloyd Wright pieces, Modernist design, and much more. Parking ramp",
          "We went to the Museum in the afternoon. It was busy,but the rooms are big and wide enough to allow room to analyse and enjoy the pictures, items and displays. We were entertained by a dance group, and were surprised to see so many famous artists represented. Lived that they had",
          "The museum was beautifully laid out. I loved all the exhibits. Me and my husband went in celebration of our 20th Anniversary. I could not have had a better day. There was so many amazing things to see that it was almost overwhelming. I would highly recommend this museum to",
          "Each year I take my fifth graders on a tour of the MIA. It is by far one of the most rewarding field trips. Many of the children & families have never visited the MIA & know that after this trip they will return!",
          "I went and toured the \"Sunken Cities\" Egypt special exhibit. The exhibit pieces were wonderful, amazing and it was really hard to understand how they could have been underwater that long and still even partially intact. The history presented with the exhibit information was",
          "Such an amazing museum...needed more time as we allotted for 1/2 day and most definitely didn\u2019t see everything. Went when the Egyptian traveling event was there and my teenaged boys liked it all!",
          "I have been twice in the month of March. I still cannot believe they don't charge for this wonderful exhibit of art. This is a must see for art lovers. Paintings. Sculptures. Furniture and architectural designs. I will be back.",
          "We went as a family to see the Egypt Sunken Cities special exhibit at MIA. It did not disappoint! They had great interpretive signs you could read and see all the ancient artifacts. There were some really gorgeous items on display and some fascinating history about the area",

The best part it\u2019s free!",

Small cafe and gift shop helps make memories for people of all ages. The one downside to this location is finding parking. Be prepared to walk a block or three.",

Check it out!",

Got free tickets to the underwater Egyptian city and it was one of the coolest things I've seen. You need to go check it out before it is gone. AMAZING!!!",

          "I can spend hours and hours here. Yes, I love the impressionist paintings, but I'm willing to look at whatever special exhibit they've got going on. Leave yourself some time for the weird (in a good way) sculpture garden outside. Logistics; Took a taxi the first time. Parking was pretty easy the one time I drove.",

          "The museum is amazing. It's 2 floors of wonderful history stuff. but the gift shop isn't that great. I didn't find anything to bring as a gift for myself and my family because it was not related to the museum or it was to expensive. Like 160$ for earrings.",
          "Love MIA! I spent 3 hours only at the third floor but it wasn\u2019t enough. I enjoyed the special exhibitions as well. Wish I can come here whenever I want.",
          "Great place to peruse. Generally free admission. Touring art exhibits are cool.",
          "My first experience at the MIA was with my sons 3rd grade field trip, we've since gone back.

          "I have never been here and have always wanted to see the spoon with the cherry, so I took a stroll around the place on a cold winter day after lunch. I am so happy to say I have finally been! The cherry on the spoon, the blue rooster and the LOVE sculptures were my favorites.",
          "This is a fairly modest sculpture garden with a few high tickets pieces that make it worthwhile visiting. The garden is laid out opposite the Walker Art Centre, which means it's a good double header for those wanting their art fix for the day. The garden's centrepiece is the",
          "It's just fantastic. If you go to the Walker, make sure you allow time to see this as well. There is a lot of really cool sculpture to see - a lot more than just the cherry on the spoon!",
          "If you have time this place is so cool. Located near the Walker Art Center the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is a fun place to see. Not only will you fall in LOVE with the cherry there are other LARGE art work to like the Blue Rooster and much, much more.",
          "Everyone goes to see Spoonbridge, but this park has some wonderful other sculptures! We had a great time walking around the beautiful space. While the grass was not yet green when we visited in March, I'm sure it's so lovely when it is. Lots of great photo ops and lots of unique",
          "Free, centrally located and always interesting art. Best photo spot in town, next door to Walker with nice food and gift shop.",
          "Truly a treasure and a must for sculpture lovers. There are surprises around every corner. Puts the adjacent Walker Art Museum to shame.",
          "The Minneapolis Sculpture Garden was closed for several years of renovations a couple years ago, but I have enjoyed it since childhood when the sculptures were still gems in Museum interiors. It is a charming Garden just across the Arty walking bridge from Loring Park, three",
          "While walking around Minneapolis I stumbled across this garden and enjoyed the experience. Great sculptures surrounded by lots of foliage. Butterflies and birds were everywhere. The museum attached to it was less impressive, however that could be because I'm not a huge fan of",
          "Great place near Downtown for kids of all ages It is moP all free Restrooms are nearby also Nice place to walk around in the winter or summer",
          "This is an easy, accessible walk through very interesting sculptures. The cherry on the spoon is unique. We were there on a sunny day and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.",
          "It was a very Grey day when we visited and I am sure it is even better in the sunlight but it was fun to see the sculptures, especially the spoon bridge which was unlike and very photogenic",
          "If Minneapolis is your destination, the sculpture garden is a must. Walk at your own pace, and see great sculpture and relax.",
          "This is a remarkable place and probably deserves five stars. The only reason I read it three stars is that they remove some of the best elements that the garden had grown into. They had planted massive trees years ago they had become very established and created very private",
          "We walked around the sculpture garden- doesn\u2019t take long. It is interesting, but not my favorite stop. I would say it was a must-do...but only to get the pic. Admittedly, I am not an sculpture/art fanatic.",
          "Love it, easy to access, free, wonderful sculptures. Winter can be a bit dull, but at least very quiet to wander around",
          "The garden is in close proximity to the Basilica of Saint Mary and there you could drop by here to visit. There are number of sculptors along with the history of how they ended up being here. There is a cathedral and a church near by as well in case you are fond of these",
          "This is really a neat place to walk through. it offers something for everyone. You get wrapped up in the surroundings and forget that your in a museum.",
          "Nice to see but will only take up to 45minutes so plan this location as part of a day activity. May be walked to from city across another park. Not a rainy or cold day location.",
          "An enjoyable day. Walk through the museum or the sculpture garden. Or play some mini golf. Plenty of photo opportunities.",
          "We visited on a cold day so didn't spend a lot of time. It is a great park to walk and enjoy some relaxation. We fed the geese which were really quite friendly if you have food. I would wait for a warm day next time so I could enjoy the park more.",
          "The Sculpture Garden is a lovely place to walk through. While I was there there were many flowers still in bloom which made for a very nice setting. The iconic Spoon and Cherry sculpture was neat to see in person. It was just an interesting and lovely place to visit.",
          "Great to visit. Recommend to everyone. Free entry. Various artists. Only few steps away from bus station.",
          "Large garden with various kinds of art everywhere. Enjoyable to walk around and watch the art. Take the bridge to the other side of the interstate to visit the basilica as well.",
          "Great iconic sculptures (I mean who has never seen the spoon & cherry?), with some kinetic sculptures. The wind chime tree? Delightful place to sit & people watch!",
          "I have been to a few sculpture parks since I enjoy them when I travel. This one says it has about 40 sculptures so I guess I missed some because it did not feel like 40. However, the area was well liked and busy enough. The Spoonbridge and Cherry just steals the show! Even",
          "Its a beautiful park, a nice leisurely walk around with some interesting art work. If ya have the time, take an hour or so and enjoy the stroll around",
          "My wife and I enjoyed a visit to the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden in early October. The weather was cool but not so cold to make it a worthwhile event. Parking was plentiful and there were several easy-pay stations located throughout the area. We arrived on Columbus Day, so",
          "The Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is unique and certainly one of the best free things one can experience. The cherry and spoon structure and the bright blue colored rooster are the best sculptures in this garden. Certainly worth visiting for any traveler in Minneapolis.",
          "Dress for the weather and take a stroll on one of my favorite sculpture gardens in the world. While the cherry-spoon sculpture is the most iconic, you will find plenty to admire in this beautifully laid out garden including a spectacular Henry Moore. This is a place to bring the",
          "Well worth the visit. The sculptures were varied and interesting. We had light drizzling rain when we visited, but the wild flower plantings brightened the whole garden.",
          "The spoon and cherry is a really cool sculpture. There are a couple of other nice ones but the majority are unmemorable. I'd skip this if I were doing over again.",
          "Not much to see really and parking was 4.00. We were there maybe 20 mins. I would save the money and go to the como zoo and conservatory!",
          "This is one of the must see places when visiting the wonderful city of Minneapolis. You may not think so, but allow yourself a good hour or even more to be able to walk around the grounds and see all the great sculptures. The number one most popular is the spoon and cherry.",
          "This was a unique place that we had to visit. The big spoon with cherry is an iconic piece that is a great picture memory spot. It was a nice little park with many different metal pieces of art work. The only cost for us was to park our car.",
          "It's a medium sized sculpture park. If you're in the area, definitely stop to see that famous cherry spoon. Lots of great photo opportunities. Another excuse to take a scooter ride!",
          "Definitely a must see in Minneapolis. Perfect for a quick touristy photo or long leisurely walks through the garden. Best part, its free!",
          "Although it is basically a sculpture garden across from the Walker Museum, it is a lovely shaded huge area with plenty of benches and short walking areas to stroll through, You will see pictures of the symbol of the huge cherry on a spoon all around Minneapolis but this is the",
          "I had definitely been to the Sculpture Garden before. It had been years, and we took some East Coast guests who wanted to see the iconic cherry and spoon sculpture. I was amazed at how amazing it still is! I was really impressed with the newer sculptures. They had a large",
          "This place was so much cooler than we expected! Based on the reviews, we thought there were a few sculptures and it would take maybe 30 minutes max. We ended up spending 2 hours wandering through the gardens and checking out the many sculptures and installations. It was a",
          "I didn\u2019t realize it was going to be all modern Art. But given that it is adjacent to a modern art museum, that makes sense. I especially liked that they were growing wildflowers in part of the park.",
          "It is truly amazing what the city's park department managed to put together. A variety of high quality works by many recognized artists. A must see.",
          "The iconic spoon and cherry is the drawing card, but there are lots of other sculptures in the park. I was there late in the summer, so the wildflowers were tall and had lots of bees and butterflies present.",
          "Had to check out the Minneapolis sculpture garden to see the famous spoon and cherry. We parked in the $4 parking lot and enjoyed strolling through the walkways to see some interesting sculptures. The native landscape and wildflowers only added to the beauty of the art and the",
          "If you are in the city, this is worth the visit! I loved how different each sculpture was. There was something for everyone!",
          "We didn't have enough time to see everything, even though it was a return visit. Spoonbridge was our priority, but there are many interesting pieces of art throughout the gardens. We only had about 30 minutes to explore and easily could have spent twice that if we weren't rushed.",
          "While the giant cherry is featured in most promo photos, the giant blue chicken might well be the star of this sculpture garden. A 30 minute easy stroll lets one see all of the statues even with stops.",
          "We visited way early in the morning, not many people there. A nice path to guide you through a bunch of okay sculptures. The centerpiece is the Spoonbridge and cherry. Oh, and there was ducks.",
          "I've visited Minneapolis many times but have not had a chance to visit the sculpture garden. I'm so glad that I was able to include this wonderful exploration of art in the midst of nature in all her glory as well. The art from some world renowned artists including Henry Moore",
          "While visiting Minneapolis for business, I found this wonderful peaceful spot in the middle of the crazy traffic. I enjoyed touring the sculptures the day I arrived and then returned for a run around the park the next day. Lots of people around but everyone was happy and",
          "Beautiful garden in Minneapolis, spoon and a cherry is my personal favorite! Nice greenery and surroundings!",
          "We strolled around the Sculpture Garden on a lovely Saturday afternoon. Very relaxing and engaging. Highly recommend",
          "If you love art and being outside, look no further. A great family fun place for free. A must see if in Minneapolis.",
          "Really great place to wander around and just enjoy the weather. They\u2019ve done a lot to make it more interactive which I love!",
          "I enjoyed the sculpture garden! Lots of neat exhibits and a great place to walk. I have been to Minneapolis several times but hadn\u2019t been here & I thought it was high time I saw the spoon & cherry. There was lots to see, and a good breeze blowing. There was an exhibit of",
          "This was such a cool and neat place to visit. The sculptures and flowers are so different. Glad to be able to see these and walk around the area. It\u2019s free to walk through and parking is $4.",
          "Very relaxing yo walk around with some great sculptures, worth taking a little time to see it. Near the heart of Minneapolis so easy yo walk to.",
          "This Minnesota icon must be witnessed in person. A visit to Minneapolis is incomplete without a visit to the Cherry and Spoon sculpture in the sculpture garden. Many people have fun with photos and this sculpture. So if you want an Instagram photo, check this place out as well",
          "This was such a great place to experience the city and see great sculptures. It was crowded when we arrived but there was still ample parking in the free lot. We enjoyed walking around the garden and taking photos. The blue cock has a \"twin\" at the Washington DC Smithsonian,",
          "Must visit the sculpture garden. They are amazing. Wonderful place for a stroll and you can also picnic there. Easy to get to from downtown on the #4 or #6 bus. And it's free.",
          "The city\u2019s famous \u201cSpoonbridge and Cherry\u201d sculptures here, along with the Blue Rooster, LOVE, and many other fantastic works. Park on the street for free!",
          "Great time in Minneapolis - beautiful city with a great progressive initiatives. Sculpture Park was Awesome",
          "Wonderful place to visit and see some interesting art work. Best way to see it is rent a bike in downtown Minneapolis and ride over to the area.",
          "We got lucky with perfect weather in late August and enjoyed the beautiful park. The sculptures are fun to see. The grounds are large so you get plenty of green space. It was a relaxing stroll. Doesn\u2019t take much time to walk through and you get good views of the Minneapolis",
          "Very nice park and sculptures with great photo opportunities against the backdrop of the city. Very nice benches with sayings along the way. Right across from the Walker museum.",
          "The sculptures are nice - but if you aren't lucky enough to get the on street parking you have to pay at the lot for a full day of parking. No hourly parking.",
          "Enjoyed a sunny afternoon walking round the sculpture garden. Easy to walk to from downtown through a few nice parks. Sculptures are pretty varied. Good photo opportunities. Got a little hot in the summer heat but worth a wander around if you have a spare hour downtown.",
          "Lovely garden with wild flowers, butterflies and some great sculptures. Good place to have a stroll in the sun without any costs.",
          "Outstanding public collection situated right outside the city center. My little one adored the Giant Spoon. This is worth a visit even if you aren\u2019t into art or art history!",
          "Great space to appreciate local artisans. Only need about 40 minutes to walk & view Installations. Spoon picture a must.",
          "Easy access to the garden from Loring Park. Very well kept and clean. The wind chime tree was my favorite. No admittance fees.",
          "This place is super fun to see and it\u2019s a must see. It\u2019s also a great photo-op and a fun place to walk.",
          "We visited primarily to see the famous spoon and cherry sculpture but enjoyed many of the other installations too. Although there are a number of sculptures that my husband classes as 'arty farty', there are also quite a few that will appeal to those that, like my husband, are",
          "It's a nice peaceful and quite place to visit. The Spoon bridge and cherry sculpture is beautiful. The garden has modern art and pretty wildflowers along the paths. You can spend an hour or two just walking and looking at the art. The day we went was just a nice and sunny day",
          "The sculpture garden is open all day and free. The highlight is the Spoonbridge and Cherry sculpture at the center of the garden, with chairs around it to sit and relax watching the kids climb on the spoon and the ducks enjoying the water flowing from the Cherry. There are also",
          "Beautiful area filled with modern art sculptures located walking distance from downtown. Lovely attention to any twin city visit.",
          "it was my first visit since they revamped it. it's a lot more open space, but you have to stick to their paths because they created pollinator-friendly areas, which is awesome. I like how they kept a few of the original sculptures but added new ones like the blue chicken. it",
          "We spent about 30 minutes walking around the garden and enjoyed it. Lots of interesting sculptures with good write-ups about the pieces and their sculptures. Definitely worth a stop if you\u2019re in the area.",
          "There is plenty of parking and nice walking paths throughout the sculpture garden. Very interesting pieces of art - I'm glad we stopped to take a look while visiting Minneapolis.",
          "Really neat place to see (and interact with in some cases) a variety of sculpture exhibits. Well integrated with local foliage and natural landscape.",
          "This is such a neat place to just walk around and see some incredible art. I love the conversations this park starts. Everybody has an opinion on art and these sculptures don\u2019t disappoint. We went after dinner on a Sunday and there were plenty of families, couples, and",
          "This is a cool garden with nice sculptures that were appreciated by both the kid and the adults in our crew. Early visit to the garden served asa well since there was not a lot of people around yet. Parking was plentiful and place was centrally located.",
          "You don\u2019t need but half hour here, but well worth the stop. Easy access to see all the sculptures with well laid out paths. Parking lot adjacenr which charges a few dollars for an hour. Garden is free!",
          "I'm not an art person. I look at most art and don't get it. I don't understand the inspiration or vision or whatever. And some art is not even interesting to me from a purely visceral standpoint. So, all that said... I really enjoyed the Sculpture Garden. It's a great",
          "Such a fun way to experience the city! Some really unique sculptures to enjoy on a nice day. Be sure to check out the wind chime tree!",
          "The museum and sculpture garden are an iconic spot and a must see. The weather is great in the summer and everything is well maintained. You can even park on the other side of the highway and take the pedestrian bridge over enhancing your experience with the fine dining offered.",
          "We enjoyed a recent walkabout at the MPLS Sculpture Garden on a gorgeous summer day. I love everything about this place--ample parking, convenient restrooms (thank you!!) and the (new?) prairie gardens--so much to see and enjoy. Low key, self-paced. Much appreciated.",
          "It may sound funny, but the winter months are my favorite time to visit. Is it the pristine snow between the works of art? Is it the quiet stillness, close to solitude? Is it simply because the Garden is spectacular any day, any time of the year? Prolly all of the above. We've",
          "First took a tour of the area, which was basically just a drive-by. Went back over a day or so later, to walk the grounds and take a closer look. Not overly exciting in my opinion.",
          "We enjoyed this park. The sculptures were mostly abstract. Not much in the way of flowers. People seemed to be parking across the footbridge.",
          "What a beautiful place. Everything about it. The gardens, the amazing art, the Minneapolis skyline. So many people -families, couples... hanging out. What a scene. If you haven\u2019t been go! We hadn\u2019t stopped here for 10 years and were very glad we did.",
          "My wife & I both loved the sculpture garden. We thought that all of the artwork was really interesting and unique. Our favorite ws the spoon and cherry. The groungs we well laid out and really easy to get to.",
          "We did come here to see the big spoon. Although, there is more here to see. Some really cool art work in what seems to be located in the historic district. Really good quiet spot.",
          "Lovely garden - clean with interesting sculptures. Easy walk and bridge to Loring park and Walker museum. Great for children.",
          "The pictures speak for themselves. This is a pretty cool location to take some great pictures. There is some free street parking if you are lucky, otherwise there is a pay lot.",
          "Walking around the sculpture garden at the Walker was a highlight. Some lovely pieces from some major sculptors including a very nice Alexander Calder. Lots of people picnic there and wander around.",

          "The Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is a cool park in Minneapolis. I liked the Blue Hen and Cherry & Spoon exhibits. There's a few lawn chairs to relax in. The Garden is very well maintained. You get a great view of the city of Saint Paul. It is free and parking is very",

          "Looking for something easy to do around Minneapolis-Saint Paul this is it. It was a perfectly pleasant walk around the sculpture garden. Great views of the city. I am not the biggest art lover and I loved going here.",
          "The MN sculpture garden was a good visit. It was fun seeing all the different sculpture around the park. It would recommend going early in the morning or in the spring because it was hot when we went in June other then that it was a fun visit.",
          "A very family friendly place. Lots of space to run and play between the sculptures. A beautiful of the city also.",
          "Avoid the heat and go at night - much better than in the middle of the hot day. We spent a long time people watching and enjoying the sculptures. Needs more chairs and people need to be aware that others want to sit, do not use the chairs for your purse while you take photos.",
          "Very well done. Worth visiting. We went there on a very hot and humid day. They are constantly trying to make it better and better. It was a delight to see a great place to visit in the middle of the town.",
          "I took my nieces on a short trip to Mall of America and my only request was that we eat at Hell's Kitchen and see the Spoonbridge and Cherry sculpture. We enjoyed the mile walk after lunch, through the park, to the Sculpture Garden. The fact that it didn't cost to see what we",

          "Take the opportunity to appreciate the Arts that exist in the cities. We took time between sports tournament games to expose kids to other things that don't include a ball. We spent about an hour and a half walking and observing the different sculptures. I think the boys liked",
          "After dinner nearby, we went for a walk over the freeway and stumbled upon the Sculpture Garden. So happy that we did. From above it was great to see all the installations. Beautiful grounds and art. A nice, peaceful walk.",
          "While this is an iconic site in the Twin Cities, I felt it was overrated. The sculptures are nice and if the weather is nice, it\u2019s a fine way to spend the day. But the signs don\u2019t have enough information on the art in my opinion.",
          "This 19-acre Sculpture Garden sits aside downtown Minneapolis, with world famous pieces to walk around and photograph. We've not seen anything to compare. You must see it!",
          "The sculpture garden is not to be missed. There is an eclectic range of sculptures, the blue chicken makes one laugh. Some of the art you can actually get on and move with the sculpture. The grounds are beautiful and there are plenty of places to sit down and just admire the",

          "Sculptures are my favorite art form so I was pretty happy to wander the 11 acres and oooh and aaah at this lot. These gardens are extremely attractive and their are some fab photo shots (and some fun ones too)",
          "Lovely place to take a walk. We wanted to see the cherry and spoon, which is quirky and fun, and there were a few other pieces we also really liked. Look for the empty coat, we really liked it.",
          "It all depends on why you go, as a place to walk and talk with friends I guess it's not bad. I'm just one of those people who want my art in a different form, not two pieces of metal or a giant spoon. The only one that amused me was \"snowman from the back\" the only piece where",
          "The Sculpture Garden is free. The nearby parking lot was $4 when we were there. It's an interesting park to stroll through, get great pictures and enjoy the Minneapolis skyline behind you. It's worth the stop if you're visiting the area.",
          "We took a tour of the sculpture garden that is offered by the Walker Museum--it is worth it because you really see more and get to know more about the sculptures. We also had lunch at the Walker cafe, which was superb.",

          "The Sculpture Garden is a nice park to take a walk and a break from the big city. the Spoonbridge and Cherry sculpture and the pond (whose shape resembles the linden trees nearby) are an icon of Minneapolis from the 1980s. The bridge over the freeway, my understanding, is part",

          "We stopped by here quickly during a trip on our way to somewhere else. We spent about an hour, but could have easily spent more. Lots of families and groups out enjoying the setting and the summer weather. If I lived in Minneapolis, this is certain a space I would take the",
          "This garden is a great place to relax and view some art...and get lots of sun. Not many trees or shade, so be wary of that. Great photo ops all around! Definitely adds some character to the city.",

          "My 6 yo daughter and I decided to kill some time and check it out. It was really neat to see the artwork displayed in such a way. We took a little walk through the Walker art center too. We were lucky enough to get free music for pride weekend too :)",
          "Neat spot to stop and take some pictures. Nice view of the downtown skyline and when the wind is blowing, the tree with all the chimes will sing you a great song.",
          "We stopped here because the reviews were so favorable and so glad we did. There are many sculptures, all so different. There were descriptions for each which were interesting to read. The cherry on the spoon was a highlight! There is also an art gallery with a lovely restaurant.",
          "Wanted to really like this park. However apart from the siting of the spoon and cherry I felt that the other sculptures were let down by the lack of decent landscape setting to set off the art and provide photographic opportunities. More miss than hit.",
          "Really wanted to enjoy this park. Unfortunately, the weather was rain and cold. We did get out and go to the spoon and cherry. It is really cool! Seen from the road or the park this piece of art is a standout piece. The wind was blowing really hard and there was a tree with",
          "I live nearby and understand that infrastructure issues with the site necessitated a redesign. I also get the desire to create a prairie with native grasses. However, 2 years after the opening it is a sorry sight. The absence of trees or bushes means nothing buffers the noise",

          "I am not crazy about sculpture. A group I belong to offered a docent tour, so I went along hoping to enjoy it. I do love the cherry. I did not like the blue rooster. It was interesting to learn about some of the sculptures, but I'm not in a hurry to go back.",
          "I had not been here before. The recent changes opening the garden to more viewing really show off the place and makes you want to visit. The sculptures are great. The cherry on the spoon is the icon, but others are great as well. Encourage everyone to see it.",
          "I'm not very into art but was with a group of people who wanted to see this so I went along. It's November so all of the plants are dead and the trees are bare so it looked very flat and barren during our visit. I could see in some areas that there had been lots of flowers",

          "Let's be clear, I'm not a fan of contemporary art. At all. That being said the sculptures at the sculpture garden still managed to capture my imagination and interest. Obviously the Cherry & The Spoon are a must see as they're one of the symbols of Minneapolis. Overall the place",

          "This place is another terrific park to enjoy. The sculptures go on and on... For free!!! Parking right nextdoor for $4.00 per day.",
          "My partner and I visited the sculpture garden on our recent trip to Minneapolis. It was a fun way to spend an hour or so: \u2022We walked to Minneapolis Sculpture Garden from Downtown Minneapolis. We took Nicolett Avenue to the Loring Greenway and then passed through Loring",
          "The Sculpture Garden is a beautiful place to take a peaceful walk surrounded by over forty outdoor sculptures. From the nice to the crazy, a variety of art is found in the Sculpture Garden. The center piece is \"Spoonbridge and Cherry\" by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. I",
          "Spent a couple of hours here on a beautiful Monday afternoon. Lots of fun sculptures. Among our favorites, a horse which looked like wood but was melt along, a big blue rooster, a spoonful of cherry and Love. The beautiful word, love. Lots of restoration going on to return part",
          "I saw the sculpture garden in passing and decided to pull over. It was extremely interesting, however I am not an artist nor am I overly artistic in terms of abstract sculptures. I can appreciate the level of effort however most of this goes over my head but if its your thing, I",
          "The Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is a very cool outdoor modern art installation with many different pieces. We've been to a few outdoor art installations and I think the Minneapolis one beats the Storm King Art Center in upstate NY and Olymlic Sculpture Park in Seattle.",
          "This is considered a must see in Minneapolis, but I think it's overrated. The spoon and cherry are what is always shown and, along with a giant rooster, is a main attraction. The other sculptures are just average. Some are odd, abstract art. If pressed for time, I would choose",
          "The city calls this the crown jewel of their parks system. So come walk around this amazing space & see why. You don\u2019t have to be an art lover to enjoy. Don\u2019t miss. It\u2019s free, easily accessible & open all year round.",
          "We had a wonderful time wandering around the Sculpture Garden on a muggy August afternoon. The majesty and variety of the pieces impressed us very much. The Oldenburg Spoonbridge with Cherry is a whimsical centerpiece, but no more memorable than many other masterpieces. As an",
          "If you're looking for something to do outdoors that's low impact and free, take a stroll through the Sculpture Garden. The artwork is delightful and there is enough space that you aren't competing with others to read about the artists and their work. I thoroughly enjoyed taking",
          "We only visited the sculpture garden and not the nearby museum but my kids loved it and we all enjoyed having some space to roam after a lot of hours traveling. Many of the sculptures were ones that they could just look at but several were more hands on that they could touch or",
          "Great way to spend the afternoon. Many sculptures throughout the park to browse and enjoy. Take a lunch and make a day of it.",
          "We were visiting friends who took us here to see the wonderful sculptures. It was a very relaxing place and we especially loved the spoon and cherry. All of the sculptures were unique and the tree with the wind chimes was a surprise. So nice that a place like this is free so",
          "It's a small park with very interesting sculptures. Some sculptures are interactive. Nice to sit and enjoy the view. It's right next to the highway so that view isn't the best.",
          "This is a fantastic exhibit of very large art works. Several piece here are found in many books magazines and pictures. And it is FREE. WOW We took 3 boys (11,12, & 14). They enjoyed the whole experience Now can say they saw spoon/cherry and blue roster. Icons . Several of the",
          "I really enjoyed the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. It was relaxing just walking around and enjoying the sculptures. It is also free which makes it even better. My most favorite part was the tree with alot of windchimes in it. Relaxing.",
          "One of the iconic places of Minneapolis, it worths a visit! Beautiful, with so many activities during the summertime ,and...did I mentioned that is beautiful?!? Oh yes, it is!! Lol",
          "Loved the museum and sculpture garden. Many fun art pieces. Enjoyed a free Thursday evening admission to the museum. Great place for everyone!!",
          "Very nice place. Great people, friendly and active. Great experience. We took a lot of pictures of the various sculptures. Super.",
          "I really enjoy sculpture and am glad I got to experience the Sculpture Garden. We were there on a Wednesday morning. It was not busy at all when we got there, and then three summer camp/day camp groups showed up toward the end of our visit. The art is lovely, and my entire",
          "This is a quick walk around a park. If you get a chance see it during the day and night. It will give you 2 different views and is less crowded during the evening. The park is very near the Basilica which is a must see!",
          "Maybe I just have no culture, but I don't really understand much of it. You can look online for more information about the sculptures, but I would have loved the stories to be next to the forms of art. The windchime tree was interesting- recommend it for anyone who hates their",
          "The outdoor sculpture park is great, but I have to admit that I was expecting more of the art installations to be as good as the cherry spoon.",
          "This is fun to stroll through if you have the chance. Neat sculptures and the grounds are very pretty. There were lots of people and more than one group of folks taking wedding pics, but we were also there on a busy Saturday afternoon. It was an unusually hot summer day and I",
          "We really liked the park & parking was not a issue. We went as a family & really enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere & appreciated the out art",
          "For me it was just something to look at. I can understand if you enjoy taking picture, you can have some fun with your camera, but thats it.",
          "Nice walk through Loring Green walkway to get to the sculpture garden. It was fun to see. It was a hot day and the kids loved running through the sprinkler to cool down. Fun to see some of the sculptures, but we were too hot to see them all.",
          "This is a beautiful park and a pleasure to walk through on a pretty day. The sculptures are so imaginative, fun and bigger than life. The array of color and form holds your interest as you meander from one section to the next. The pathways are level and easy to maneuver.",
          "***This review is for the sculpture garden only, not the museum. Other reviews I've read have jumbled the two. I love art. I studied art throughout college. I appreciate everything from Neoclassicism to Impressionism, even a lot of modernism, not so much contemporary art. That",
          "We went to the sculpture garden on a beautiful summer day! Very pretty grounds with many interesting sculptures to look at. Loved how some of them had a story about the art and the artist. The grounds have a lot of very nice flowers and was really well maintained and a pretty",
          "Nice place to enjoy a late afternoon/evening walk. There were many people enjoying the gardens. Also a few joggers utilizing the grounds. They are building a walkway bridge connecting the city to the sculpture gardens. Great place to stop and enjoy the artwork.",
          "Some of the art is just out there, but there are some really cool pieces to view. Loring Park, across the street, is a favorite as well.",
          "Fun, for all ages. And open anytime of day. This is a nice break after a lot of indoor activities. It\u2019s a great spot for kids to run off some energy or for a nice walk at any age.",
          "You can pay $4 to park or $5 to park in the covered parking lot, you basically just walk around a park and see about 10 different sculptures",
          "The sculpture garden is affiliated with an art museum ( which does charge admission), however the outdoor sculpture garden was free. It\u2019s a nice walk though the area and the sculptures are fun, unique, and provide great photo opportunities. Doesn\u2019t take long and we\u2019ll worth",
          "The kids and I enjoyed going through the park and viewing the sculptures. The grounds and walkways are well kept and easy to navigate. For photographers, you have to take pictures from certain angles because of all of the construction in Minneapolis right now. My older kids",
          "This was a relaxing summer afternoon walk on our first day in Minneapolis. We had never seen a sculpture garden before and enjoyed doing something different. The kids got a kick out of the cherry and spoon as well as the giant blue rooster. The activity was free and kept my",
          "My husband and I spent about 45 minutes walking around and checking out the sculptures. Everything is well maintained, and the descriptions for each sculpture are interesting. I wouldn't have wanted to spend a lot more time (it was hot!) there, but it was a fun activity!",
          "Sculpture garden was great to walk around. Kids enjoyed seeing the cherry on the spoon in real life as they have seen it many times in media.",
          "This trip was my husband and I and our two girls ages 10 and 13 years old. I would say half of the art was good really good and the other half was like\"ok\".... The cherry on a spoon sprays I mist which feels really good since it was warm out ! It does have a parking lot that you",
          "Wasn't really that amped-up to go see a spoon and a cherry, but I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Don't expect anything mind-blowing here, but this is a peaceful walk and a good way to spend part of an afternoon.",
          "We visited the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden about 1-2 hours before sunset on July 2. The highlight is most definitely the cherry sculpture, but all the others are interesting and I enjoyed reading about them and their artists. I learned that St. Laurence is the patron saint of",
          "Mainly a few large installations. I think most people go there for the spoon with cherry fountain. There are some other interesting pieces, but it can all be taken in fairly quickly.",
          "This was such a wonderful experience!!! After a day of rain, the sun came out and made this destination a great Sunday evening stroll!!! Loved the sculptures and explanations. When visiting, one MUST read the benches - makes one think, laugh, then think some more!",
          "The reopening of the park in 2017 was marred by the controversy over the sculpture \u201cscaffold\u201d an interactive piece meant to be climbed on by children. It was hard to imagine how the Walker could have commissioned a replica of the scaffolding on which 38 Dakota were executed",
          "Although parking cost is a bit steep, this was a wonderful way to spend a couple of hours outside. There are a lot of side exhibits, but the main route allows you to see everything. Not a lot of shade, though, if it's in the upper 90s",
          "There's a good variety of things to enjoy here. Some of the artwork is whimsical (like the famous spoon and cherry), while others are more abstract and thought-provoking. Take lots of photos \u2014 it's fun to look for unique angles for pictures.",
          "Loved the modern art in this park! Find free street parking, even if you go up a street to the area around the Walker center. The park doesn't take long to go through and paying $5 to park is silly. Definitely check out this park for good photo opportunities when in Minneapolis!",
          "We stopped here for some photos by the sculptures and visited the museum as it was the first Saturday of the month and it was free entry.The sculptures are nice to see,some better than others.The museum itself is nice but the art was good and bad.Just depends what your taste of",
          "I chose this location to take some maternity shots for my website and all the photos turned out great! There are tons of fun sculptures to see but I'm really sad they removed the hedge arches that can still be found in google search photos.",
          "The spoon and cherry are the iconic symbol of the garden but the infamous blue chicken could probably be seen from space. This rooster is one color, a hideous blue. It is not the best sculpture garden I have ever seen but it doe have some color and it a nice area to walk.",
          "Located just outside the downtown area. We enjoyed a couple of hours looking at all of the art. Everything from the rooster to a spoon and cherry - even a love piece similar to the one in Philly.",
          "Walking through Loring Park to the Basilica of St. Mary we discovered the Sculpture Garden and decided to visit. The location is nice and getting there will probably be easier once the walkway across the highway is finished. There seemed to be a lot of grounds under maintenance,",
          "Held the interest of everyone in our group. We had people from ages 13-55 years old. Great spring summer day trip. Clean, friendly, and handicap assessable.",
          "The cherry on the spoon is iconic. The rest? Kind of strange. It is a nice well kept park. It\u2019s art, so it is truely at the eye of the beholder",
          "The plants are in the process of growing so lots of areas where you have to keep off the grass...but the sculptures themselves are really fun to walk around and look at. Great photo opportunities everywhere",
          "The cherry in the spoon has become an iconic symbol of Minneapolis. The sculpture garden is a great place to visit on a nice day. Go for a half hour stroll and some tranquility, or spend half a day reading about the sculptures and appreciating the art.",
          "This sculpture garden in the heart of Minneapolis has a mixture of the profound, the amusing, and the head-scratching. Fortunately the balance is more towards the first two categories, with the two most iconic pieces in the park falling squarely into the \"amusing\"",
          "This sculpture garden is currently being overhauled. There are still many of the old favorites, with new installations as well. It won't be finished until next year.",
          "Don't miss this stop when you're in Minneapolis! Such an incredible experience. Thanks to those who had the foresight to establish this incredible park/garden/art exhibit.",
          "They keep updating this garden, which makes it a great place to visit time and time again -- and, all year long. Part of living in a place that has four seasons is visiting different landmarks in all four seasons. This place is a breath of fresh air in the spring and summer,",
          "Loved this sculpture garden. Doing an actual tour with a guide gave us a much more appreciation of the garden.",
          "So lucky to be able to walk over to the sculpture garden anytime. The redone space is much friendlier and seems to be more popular. I can't wait to do a free dance exercise class in the garden July 5. Sorry I missed the first one. Doesn't hurt that Fisker Grove, the restaurant",
          "Enjoy walking on the paths. Lots of room for strollers. The sculptures are fun for kids to look at at.",
          "I always like the cherry and the spoon statue is Minneapolis icon, recently the city renovated and looks great, nice new statues nice walking pats I personally LOVE the blue roster looks very nice",
          "This is a great little sculpture garden on the edge of downtown and next to the Walker Art Museum. It contains a lot of great contemporary sculptors as well as some classics. Includes Claus Oldenburg's classic Spoonbridge. Sculptures are nestled among a beautiful natural",
          "I always love going to the Sculpture Garden to see both the new and old sculptures! The iconic Spoonbridge with Cherry and the new Hahn/Cock are both fun to visit and view. I enjoy strolling around the paths (which are always clean, by the way) and chatting with tourists and",
          "The sculpture garden is a quiet area close to downtown Minneapolis and across from the Walker which we usually combine with in a visit. The extensive renovation has removed some of the most interesting outdoor exhibits and we look forward to future acquisitions.",
          "Easy stroll through lovely park grounds . The sculptures were nice to look at although would benefit from more explanation Park was beautiful even with nearby construction. Plus it\u2019s free",
          "Few world class art museums boast a glorious sculpture garden and an annual rock show! So cool...tons of fun as usual!",
          "Beautiful outdoor area of the City. Make sure you park in the nearby Walker parking garage. No charge to view sculptures, close to downtown, with beautiful skyline views.",
          "Super fun to walk here from downtown hotels to take some great pictures. We had fun walking here and looking at the art.",
          "I really don\u2019t get abstract art, but it was something to do in Minneapolis. Maybe budget one hour for this.",
          "Some of the reviews are a little harsh. Taken for what it is, it is a great place to just walk around and see a few sculptures. Yeah, maybe they are not connected to each other and maybe they don't seem to make sense, but I didn't find that necessary to enjoy the nice walk",
          "We had some extra time, so we decided to check out the sculpture garden. It was on Sunday, so parking was easy (only $1) in the museum garage. You don't need a lot of time. There are several sculptures that make no sense and several that really are not art. This was",
          "I love the sculptures. The Spoonbridge and Cherry is a must. My problem is the confusing parking garage. I was charged double for parking. The staff were not helpful.",
          "The garden is a very large square (with a parking lot) on which you can see the sculptures. It is a quick tour. From there, it is also possible to go see the squirrels on the park across the street and go to the St. Mary Basilica. Good tour for pictures.",
          "Experimental art is titillating and interesting, but in the end the sculpture garden is ugly. Definitely not an improvement to the landscape.",
          "Really neat, very unique park. We walked down from Sisyphus Brewery and had a great time checking out all of the artwork.",
          "Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is a must see when in the city, there is ample parking space and readily accessible by public transportation. There are other points of interest surrounding the area. You\u2019ll enjoy walking around and exploring what\u2019s in the area.",
          "Good diversion while kids at soccer practice at the field across the lot. Fun public art and easy walk ways to stroll in relatively confined urban space. Art museum across the street is a great place to end with a cocktail or lemonade on a hot day.",
          "What a great place to let the kids experience some great sculptures and the great weather. Our kids really enjoyed the gardener and exploring.",
          "love this place. my kids love to run around the place and it is a great place to take good pictures.",
          "Loved my walk through this city park in downtown Minneapolis. It\u2019s a peaceful park with various sculptures in grassy spaces and along sidewalks. It\u2019s Home to the Spoonbridge & Cherry, the Love cube, and a giant blue rooster, among many other modern works. It\u2019s also a great place",
          "Takes about 45 minutes to stroll around and look at all the sculptures. Had a picknic in the garden in lovely weather and had an excellent day there.",
          "Unfortunately the footbridge is currently out of action so access is only via crossing the busy road. The garden is beautifully kept. The sculptures are beautiful. Really enjoyed my visit.",
          "Do not miss if in the area and have a nice outdoor weather day to enjoy here. We enjoyed it more than we thought we would, and spent more time as they have nice sitting areas all around to sit and relax. Free and we found free parking on the street facing the back entrance.",
          "Nice little sculpture park. Was able to walk around and see the many works of art. You will have to pay to park and the parking lot we were in needs lots of work. Pot holes everywhere.",
          "I drive by the sculpture garden almost every day, but only think to visit when company comes to town. Spoonbridge and Cherry is an iconic landmark and it's fun to see Hahn/Cock (a giant blue rooster) having initially seen it in Trafalgar Square a few years ago. It's a lovely",
          "Unfortunately it started raining just add I arrived d do I cut my visit short. It is still ok in the rain but I was not prepared for rain. Just walk around at your leisure and see what catches your fancy.",
          "My parents are not the best on the knees. However, they did not want to miss one peice of art in the park. There was so many cool pieces to see.",
          "Wonderful creative smaller park close to downtown. Well worth seeing. Very doable in a short time, great for families with kids.",
          "Enjoyed the hour we spent here. Interesting artists (and art) and grounds. Open after hours, meaning after the Walker closes. Parking is $5 or you might find street parking.",
          "Park with great artwork and a nice place to rest while watching baseball on the adjacent ground. Street parking is best and they even have a paid parking lot with a flat rate of $4 for the whole day.",
          "This outdoor sculptures garden, with the famous of a huge cherry on a even bigger spoon, very interesting to look at different displays and walking around the garden.",
          "What a wonderful park to spend some time with family and friends. You can't go wrong with a visit to this park - it the best price in town - ALL FREE. Plan on at least a one hour visit or longer if you love artwork. Walk around, get some exercise, enjoy the unique sculptures",
          "I'm not much of an art person, but I enjoyed walking around the park for an hour or so. Like most art exhibits, I wouldn't recommend it for kids as there isn't really a lot for kids to do in the gardens. They do have a nice picnic area for lunch. Parking costs $5, so a bit much",
          "This park is nice for a quick stop to stretch your legs. You must pay to park in the parking lot. We were there during off season. Cute to walk around to see the various structures, but I can't imagine doing it in the summer. There is no shade in a vast majority of the park.",
          "This park seemed barren. I know it was almost May, but grass seemed green else where. It did not seem inviting.",
          "Even sloshing through the melting snow did not deter us from traipsing around the giant, wonderful sculptures. A Calder mobile was one of my favorites, along with a big blue rooster that is making its rounds across the world. After a refreshing stroll, cross the street to see",
          "Amazing park that is a must do when in town. The weather needs to cooperate in order to fully enjoy the garden. The Blue Rooster was my favorite. Really worth it!!",
          "The Big, Blue Rooster is fascinating! There were some new sculptures but it didn't take to long to walk around and see everything. It was something to do and enjoy as part of Minneapolis. If you have an hour or two to spare take a stroll!!",
          "We came here on s beautiful Saturday morning. Not too crowded and and the sculptures were awesome. Great for selfies! Only downfall, no public restrooms near.",
          "The sculpture garden has some nice pieces and the Museum (Walker Art Center) next door is well worth visiting as well.",
          "The Minneapolis sculpture garden is a attraction you should not miss! This great space is situated right on the edge of the city on Minneapolis. The walker is right next to the garden as well. There is a variety of works by numerous well known artists. The newly designed garden",
          "Beyond the Cherry & Spoon is a the Blue Chicken, a spectacle in itself. It's a beautiful walk particularly on warm day/ Stop at the Walker for a show or cocktail or both.",
          "It\u2019s a fun place to stop! As locals, we like to take visitors here to see the cherry! The recent renovations are nice and my favorite is the tree with windchimes!!",
          "You will have to pay a little for parking, but it's worth it. We spent about an hour walking and reading about the sculptures. Most were interactive, meaning you could walk into them or on them.",
          "What a treasure of beautiful, interesting and fun artwork. We had such an enjoyable experience checking out all of the interesting pieces and taking pictures.",
          "I've been here a couple of times and it was nice. But I can see from the highway, they've got the new sculptures up. I like visiting during spring and summer so I get to see the out door plants as well.",
          "So fun to see so many significant works by world renowned artists, Calder, De Suervo, Fritsch, Kcho, Cragg, Serra, Kelly to name a few. The large installation by Mark Manders was our favorite, not sure why. Easy to spend an hour hour without realizing how much significant",
          "Looks like some new sculptures since my last visit. Glad they kept the iconic cherry and spoon. The museum next door is wonderful too.",
          "This is a fun and unique sight to see, but not a place I would particularly recommend or want to visit again.",
          "Making a day downtown during the summer always includes some time at the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. Easy on the street parking, or in the ramp at the Walker Arts Center affords us easy access. There's even mini-golf which helps keep the kids engaged.",
          "This provides for some unique things to look at and walk around. Each item has its own story picture opportunity.",
          "These sculpture garden was located right outside of the Walker Museum. It was a bit cold but very iconic and fun sculptures. Great for taking pictures. You only need 20 minutes to really hit all the sculptures.",
          "A great park to walk around and some great art to have a look at. The kids could not resist climbing on it though. Also wrap up warm as it was blowing hard throughout. There was an underground parking lot and some on toad parking. Then further around a pay and display",
          "My friend and I had to take a picture with the iconic \"Spoon and Cherry\" sculpture. It\"s a quiet park in the middle of the city.",
          "Anytime is a good time for visiting... we had lots of fun.. interesting stories to read... absolutely worth it \ud83d\udc4d",
          "Such a neat place to visit. We are from Wisconsin and we go to Mall of America every year. We never miss visiting this park. It's a symbol of Minneapolis",
          "Cheery & Spoon park, Big purple color Roster are center of attraction at this park. You can spend quality time.",
          "I feel like this park is a must see, because of the Spoonbridge and Cherry centerpiece and the view behind it, bit other than that it wasn\u2019t much more to see. Do combine with the Walker Art Centre across the street to make your visit worthwhile.",
          "I visited the Sculpture Garden before the remodeling. It was not curated in the most intuitive way. However, it is one the Twin Cities' landmarks and worth the visit. If you happen to be in Des Moine, the Pappajohn Sculpture Park is amazing. I love their Jaume Plensa's Nomade.",
          "Stumbled upon this while driving around. Fun place to take photos and explore. Parking was easy and there are other things to walk to from here- museum, food.",
          "We went to this park in February, where temps were in the single digit. Most sculptures where covered with snow, but what we saw I was not very impressed. The LOVE sculpture is In Philadelphia and various other city, so to me not original.. The cherry and spoon what was the only",
          "Great place to bring kids, elementary or middle school aged. We like to hand out in downtown Minneapolis and make it a point to walk from Nicolette ave to the garden. It\u2019s s bit of a hike but not strenuous. It\u2019s actually a lovely walk. The park itself is really unique. We aren\u2019t",
          "Whether you're a tourist or long time resident of Minneapolis, this is a must see. The sculpture garden is free and a good place to go for a walk, stop by during lunch, or a picnic. Just across 94 from Loring Park and Basilica of St Mary, it's a good area to visit!",
          "The gardens are interesting but not spectacular. There is miniature golf, which is more interesting. Otherwise not worth the visit!",
          "Did you know that the Sculpture Garden across from the Walker Art Center is open all year round? In fact, all of the parks in Minneapolis are open 12 months a year. If you haven't thought to go during the winter, it is worth your time as long as you bundle up with a warm fleece",
          "This is a great spot to spend a quite summer morning or afternoon. All redone the place is amazing and great views of the cities",
          "Great place for couples or families. Get some fresh air and see beauty. Highly recommend. Plan to walk. Pick a day with great weather conditions. Take you phone to snap pictures.",
          "Fun and exciting place to visit. The sculptures are amazing and the people who visit are cheerful and fun to mingle with. The park puts everyone in a wonderful mood. The new sculptures and upgrades are worth the visit. The fact that it\u2019s free is a real plus.",
          "Recently renovated, the Sculpture Garden is one of the main attractions to visit while in Minneapolis. The famous Spoon Cherry bridge is the most known. Beautiful view of downtown Minneapolis at night",
          "The new upgrades to one of the city's treasures is worth a visit. There is a wonderful variety of traditional and modern sculptures from local and international artists. It is hard to miss the iconic cherry on a spoon but the new blue rooster is a favorite. While you are",
          "Fun sculpture garden with paths and some shade. Interesting to look at. Some make noise. Has the famous MNPLS landmark \u201cSpoon with Cherry\u201d. Fountain. Park is across the bridge over the highway. Snack bar. Mini golf.",
          "This is a great sculpture garden that is free to the public. The parking lot is a bit pricey but still worth it. It has the iconic Spoon and Cherry that Minneapolis is known for. I highly recommend!",
          "Perfect stop on a warm January day! Sculptures were a beautiful mix of different styles - very fun experience!",
          "At least once a year, we head to the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. They had some work done and the update and additions are wonderful. No ruining the surprise - go for yourself and enjoy! You will make it a yearly tradition!",
          "Everything is large and you must visit the Sculpture Garden whilst in Minneapolis. It's nice in the summer when the days are long and hot and just as magical in the winter when everything is covered in snow.",
          "I visited the sculpture garden in January with sub-zero temperatures. From the sections I saw, it seemed really neat and creative (this is coming from a non-artsy person.) My only regret is that the weather prohibited us from seeing the whole thing (really I can only blame",
          "On our first trip to Minneapolis, we took a stroll through this super cool park in -2 degree weather, and it was worth it. I am not particularly interested in art, but I was impressed with the creative sculptures. No matter if you're into art or not, at least take a quick walk",
          "We went to this park because it's very beautiful, it's impossible to have a long time because the cold. We made a nice pictures and we visited the Museum in front of the park.",
          "This is a landmark and it is part of an wonderful sculpture park (small enough to be manageable) and an indoor plant area with a great fish sculpture. It is also next to the Walker modern art museum which had a great restaurant. Finally it has easy access to freeways.",
          "I love going to the sculpture garden when I am in Minneapolis! It is so easy to get to and park. They have some fun, whimsical & beautiful sculptures to see. Who doesn't want to take a photo with the iconic cherry & spoon sculpture while visiting Minnesota! This is good for all",
          "I arrived at my hotel way before check-in and this famous cherry spoon thing was only a mile away so I took a walk over there. I enjoyed the walk from the Loews, spent about an hour marveling at the sculptures, then went through the art museum. I definitely recommend checking it",
          "Great cultures, great space. Open all year. If you like cold weather, visit it in the winter, it has a whole different atmosphere with snow and clear blue skys (but dress appropriately and visit at a time the Walker Art Center is open to warm-up in) . Still has the iconic Spoon",
          "Don't miss the sculpture garden. So many iconic pieces that define the Minneapolis art scene. You should visit at least once.",
          "Nice park to walk around in. We park in the walker art center lot since it's only 5 bucks. If it's not busy with screaming kids it's a great way to spend a peaceful morning or afternoon.",
          "We've been here several times, with and without kids. It is a completely pleasant experience, a walk in the parking with art. One warning, don't go on a really hot sunny day as there is not a lot of shade in some areas. Parking across the street.",
          "This is located at a central place. There are several interesting statues, such as the spoon and the apple, which is probably the best known one but there are others also beautiful and interesting, everything in a great garden.",
          "There have been extensive changes to the sculpture garden. While I hope that others like it, we were very disappointed particularly when compared to what the gardens used to be like.",
          "Minneapolis is a cool city, but the sculpture garden really does nothing for me. If you want to go to a tourist trap to get a picture with the cherry in the spoon, have at it, because this place is for you.",
          "I loved the variety of sculptures scattered throughout the garden, in sight of downtown Minneapolis. If you like miniature golf, this is the place for it - 18 holes made by artists.",
          "This is an unusual and pleasant attraction for anyone young, old, active or sedentary. There is a lot to see and it\u2019s handicap accessible or cycle down and walk your bike thru the park. Kids can run to their hearts content while the adults observe and contemplate the art. A fun",
          "I was actually just riding around and we saw all of these huge beautiful sculptures in a park like setting. It was awesome and the kids will love it.",
          "Who isn\u2019t impressed by a giant cherry on a spoon? I appreciate the openness of the area and being able to let small children run, teenagers roam and couples stroll all in the same place.",
          "While some have complained about the removal of a number of trees, most, including our family, find it masterful. The new garden is more wide-open and welcoming. One can still sit and enjoy, and have a feeling of calm. The art and the activities make this a great place for",
          "This place is definitely interesting. If you are artistic, it's definitely worth going to. If you are not, it's still fun to see, although you probably won't spend more than an hour there.",
          "The recent upgrades have resulted in a beautiful space that feels more like an outdoor gallery. Lots of information on the sculptures which deepens viewer appreciation. Sculptures are well positioned to take advantage of parts of the city as a backdrop.",
          "I've been a fan of the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden at the Walker Art Museum for many years. However, since the renovation of the garden with additions to the pieces on display, the garden is significantly improved. Lines of site are more conducive to taking in the immensity of",
          "They have a very interesting mini golf in the park which we had to pay for but it was worth the fun as it's quite different than your normal mini golf parks. Very nice walk around the sculpture garden as well.",
          "From the new sculpture garden amenities to the miniature golf course to a wide open expanse and spaces the sculpture garden is a true treasure attached to Parade Stadium and the Walker! Even if you\u2019re not the art aficionado make sure you take the time to spend a half an hour",
          "Free, fun and stimulating\u2014what\u2019s not to love? The approach is visually quite stimulating. There are several dozen unrelated gigantic installations throughout this outdoor space adjacent to the Walker Center. The area felt like 4-5 footballs. If you desire to observe each",
          "This is an interesting and relaxing place. It is good to go here for a stroll on a nice day, wether you are solo, a couple, or a family with young children.",
          "Just a short walk from our hotel, and close to the city itself, this location offered great photo opportunities. The main site was the spoon bridge, but it is worth spending time looking at the many other attractions in this peaceful park area. We went early in the morning, and",
          "We stopped by the sculpture garden after a long day of sightseeing. It was nice to walk among the sculptures. There are bathrooms available and benches for resting. I don't recommend the miniature golf course. It's too expensive and too long. It's also in poor condition. Still",
          "Go on a nice day, it is a great way to kill an hour. Free. Lots of photo opportunities. 20-30 art installations.",
          "Sculpture gardens can be amazing, but this one is a failure. The collection is great with the big names...Calder, LeWitt, Nevelson, but the work is too close together to give any one piece the space and attention it deserves. You see others behind each piece like they're at a",
          "The sculpture garden connect to Loring Park. Lot to do and see here. Nice family outing. Beautiful place for a relaxing walk and meditation.",
          "This area of Minneapolis is fascinating to walk or drive by on any type of day... whether it's winter, spring, summer or fall . . . I have driven past the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden shortly after living in the Minneapolis area five years after returning.",
          "I have loved the Sculpture Garden from its inception. But the recent rennovations broke my heart. What was once a charming collection of semi private, evergreen tree-bordered Secret Garden \"rooms\" filled with benches, lawns, and fanciful sculptures, is now an open flat field",
          "this is a wonderful modern sculpture garden that is free to the public. Some of the work is more interesting than others. But it is all worthwhile. You will not feel as if you have wasted your time. Summer is the best time to visit as the kiosk is open.",
          "I\u2019ve visited Minneapolis a couple of times over the past few months, and each time the garden was being renovated. I headed back this time and my patience was rewarded with remarkable sculptures that I got to experience with the perfect backdrop of...light snow! This sculpture",
          "A must visit location if you\u2019re in Minneapolis for work but can still use some of the early evening to take a walk or a run. The sculptures have names and the history behind them.",
          "I have been here several times over the past 30 years of visiting Minneapolis. It never fails to capture my interest. It was fun to see some old favorites and the new redo of the garden. I loved the blue chicken!",
          "I have lived in Minnesota my whole life and never visited this place until today (at 23). I finally got to see the spoon with the cherry and it was as awesome as I expected it would be. Lots of other great sculptures, unfortunately the Walker Art Center was closed as it was a",
          "I visited on a day the neighboring Walker Art Center had free admission. So wonderful to see so many families enjoying such a special outdoor space.",
          "This is so clever and beautifully designed. The cherry on spoon is exceptionally clever and worth the free visit",
          "I like art, but this is a little out there for my taste. I prefer more traditional art, but if you like eclectic or modern art, this might be the place for you. It is definitely an interesting place, there are a couple dozen or so outdoor sculptures, some of them are very",
          "We had a beautiful sunny day and made the most of it by walking to the Sculpture Garden. I found it nice and peaceful. An interesting place to check out on a nice day.",
          "Went after the game. Got street parking fairly easy. Easy area to walk around in and view the scuptures. There was a guided tour and we sat in on one exhibit to hear the guide. This made a difference and is recommended. Lots of photo ops given the diversity of the subject",
          "We visited in the afternoon, it was very warm, making the gardens a popular place! Very nice place with diverse pieces. I only wish I would have thought to bring lunch so that we could take it in longer.",
          "Easy tour, interesting art, great way to spend an hour or more outside. Fun for the whole family. Bring a picnic.",
          "What a fun place to take pictures of. It would be beautiful in some of the spots for Wedding photos.",
          "If you are in Minneapolis and have an hour to spare, the sculpture garden is a unique place. Make sure you read the quotes on the benches in the middle of the park, they are so much fun! There are about 25 of them carved into blocks of granite. If the weather is good it is a",
          "We went on a warm fall Friday and it was pretty crowded with families. The art was....modern! Overall a pretty chill place, and there are some trails down the block past the sports field that are relaxing.",
          "This is well worth the walk through! There is so much to see! Take a walk over the highway on the bridge (which is actually a work of art). The cherry spoon sculpture is definitely amazing to see as well. We visited in fall and the colours really added to the art.",
          "I don't get it. The \"new\" sculpture garden was a disappointment. The weather was hot and beautiful so walking around was good but there wasn't much to see. The glass palm enclosure is gone and that was one of my favorite things. So many wonderful pieces gone. Why do this?",
          "With the addition of the Blue Rooster, the sculpture garden is a nice place to go on a sunny weekend, just to meander around with the people.",
          "The best thing about the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden is that it's free. I know it's me. I just don't get \"modern\" art. We walked through the park and occasionally stifled a grin. Sometimes an outright laugh. I'll admit I enjoyed the giant Blue Rooster. But was it supposed to",
          "I really enjoyed the Sculpture Garden. Some of the art is excellent. It's a very nice area of the city. Go see it if you like art or even if you just like the outdoors!",
          "On our last day we walked to the Sculpture Garden during our stay downtown. To get to the Sculpture Garden we walked through Loring Park, which had some beautiful elements to it, but needs a little upkeep. The garden had various pieces of art around the campus. The park is right",
          "Many different art to see especially with the new upgrade. A great place to take pictures and walk around.",
          "It's free, it's unique and it's an iconic Mpls site. Bring a lunch or just take a walk around to view the sculptures. Great way to spend a half hour or lots more. Walk across the bridge to Loring Park. Near Loring are 2 great churches to see- The Basicilca ( which often has",
          "The sculpture has been closed for 3 years. It is finally open again and attracts lots of attention. Some of the beloved sculptures are gone, some new appeared. Nevertheless it's while worth a visit. Come and explore it by yourself. It is free and a good place to be outside in",
          "This summer (2017) the sculpture garden was redesigned so you need to go if you: A. Haven't ever been or B. You haven't been this year. It's free, they have done an awesome job, there is a mini golf course, and the cherry on the spoon is there! If that's not enough to make you",
          "A real destination spot, and we live close enough to walk the dogs through, which is always fun. Love that it connects by pedestrian bridge to Loring Park, a huge block of park land (MPLS's version of Central Park), and that then links to Nicollet Mall. Only reason it's not",
          "If you're in Minneapolis for any amount of time, this is a great place to spend a few hours enjoying the outdoors and art. Take a picnic, go for the walk, enjoy mini golf and food stands- take the whole family or enjoy an inexpensive date!",
          "The park was recently re-landscaped and sculptures re-positioned. Unfortunately the surrounding roadways (highways) are now so obtrusive that it is difficult to enjoy the art.",
          "Went here Bc it looked like it would be a cool spot . It's free. It's random objects of art pieces . If you have nothing to do it's a quirky spot to go outdoors . It was ok .",
          "For modern art lovers this garden is a must the the greater Minneapolis-SP metropolitan area. One should also cross over to the gorgeous green-lake on the other side of the main highway to which you reach via a pedestrian bridge.",
          "As a free event, the Sculpture Garden is a great outdoor place for couples and families. There are a number of sculptures to view. The only downfall is that guests are not allowed to touch the sculptures. My niece and nephew found this frustrating. Top Tip: There are",
          "Since it's re-opening in June after an extended renovation, we've been there twice, once as locals and another time with out of town visitors. New, Multi generational, and global artists provide an engaging array of art, with a spectacular view of the downtown skyline. It is",

          "Sculptures are interesting- lots of improvements since I was there about 10 years ago. New sculptures, improved walking paths, free parking",
          "What's missing? Here is a site that is convenient, with panoramic city views, some interesting sculptures, a clever miniature golf course and yet, like the Spruce Goose, it doesn't get off the ground. It may be that it needs some time for the vegetation to grow up, but"

        "wiki": "Saint Paul (St. Paul) is the capital of the U.S. state of Minnesota. It is the county seat of Ramsey County, the state's smallest and most densely populated county. As of 2019, its estimated population was 308,096, making it the 63rd-largest city in the United States and the 11th-most populous in the Midwest. Most of the city lies east of the Mississippi River at the confluence with the Minnesota River. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, is across the river to the west. Together they are known as the \"Twin Cities\". They are the core of Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area, home to over 3.6 million and the third-largest in the Midwest.Established near existing Native American settlements as a trading and transportation center, the city gained prominence when it was made the capital of the Minnesota Territory in 1849. The Dakota name for where Saint Paul is situated is \"Imnizaska\". The city is known for the Xcel Energy Center, home to the Minnesota Wild. Regionally, it is known for the Science Museum of Minnesota and its new soccer stadium. As a business hub of the Upper Midwest, it is the headquarters of companies such as Ecolab. Saint Paul and Minneapolis are also known for their high literacy rate.The first structure built in what would become St. Paul was constructed in 1838 at the entrance to Fountain Cave overlooking the Mississippi. It was built by Pigs Eye Parrant near where Randolph Avenue today meets the river. Parrant's \"tavern\" was well known and the surrounding area came to be known as Pigs Eye. That lasted until the Catholic missionary Lucien Galtier arrived in 1840. He did not care for Parrant, his tavern, or the use of his name. The priest's arrival brought the eviction of Parrant from his establishment and the building of a log chapel near where steamboats had an easy landing. Galtier named the chapel St. Paul's, making it known that the settlement was then to be called by that name, as \"Saint Paul as applied to a town or city was well appropriated, this monosyllable is short, sounds good, it is understood by all Christian denominations\". While Pigs Eye was no longer the settlement's name, it came to refer to wetlands and an island south of the city's center. As the region grew the city became the seat of an archdiocese that built a grand St. Paul's Cathedral overlooking the downtown.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nBurial mounds in present-day Indian Mounds Park suggest the area was inhabited by the Hopewell Native Americans about 2,000 years ago. From the early 17th century to 1837, the Mdewakanton Dakota, a tribe of the Sioux, lived near the mounds after fleeing their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake from advancing Ojibwe. The Dakota called the area I-mni-za ska dan (\"little white rocks\") for its exposed white sandstone cliffs on the river's eastern side. In the Menominee language it is called S\u0101\u0113nep\u0101n-Men\u012bk\u0101n, which means \"ribbon, silk or satin village\", suggesting its role in trade throughout the region after the introduction of European goods.Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, US Army officer Zebulon Pike negotiated approximately 100,000 acres (40,000 ha; 160 sq mi) of land from the local Dakota tribes in 1805 to establish a fort. The negotiated territory was on both banks of the Mississippi River, from Saint Anthony Falls in present-day Minneapolis to its confluence with the Saint Croix River. Fort Snelling was built on the territory in 1819 at the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers, which formed a natural barrier to both Native American nations. The 1837 Treaty with the Sioux ceded all local tribal land east of the Mississippi to the U.S. government. Taoyateduta (Chief Little Crow V) moved his band at Kaposia across the river to the south. Fur traders, explorers, and missionaries came to the area for the fort's protection. Many of the settlers were French-Canadians who lived nearby. But as a whiskey trade flourished, military officers banned settlers from the fort-controlled lands. Pierre \"Pig's Eye\" Parrant, a former fur trader turned bootlegger who particularly irritated officials, set up his tavern outside the military reservation, upriver from Lambert's Landing. By the early 1840s, the community had become important as a trading center and destination for pioneers heading west. Locals called the area Pig's Eye (French: L'\u0152il du Cochon) or Pig's Eye Landing after Parrant's popular tavern. In the 1840s-70s the M\u00e9tis brought their oxen and Red River Carts down Kellogg Street to Lampert's landing to ship buffalo hides to market from the Red River of the North.  St. Paul was the southernmost stop on the Red River Trails. In 1840 Pierre Bottineau became a resident of St. Paul with a claim in the heart of the settlement.\n\nIn 1841, Father Lucien Galtier was sent to minister to the Catholic French Canadians and established a chapel, named for his favorite saint, Paul the Apostle, on the bluffs above Lambert's Landing. Galtier informed the settlement it was to adopt the name Saint Paul in honor of his new chapel and to give up use of Pigs Eye. In 1847, the New York educator Harriet Bishop moved to the area and opened the city's first school. The Minnesota Territory was formalized in 1849 with Saint Paul as its capital. In 1857, the territorial legislature voted to move the capital to Saint Peter, but Joe Rolette, a territorial legislator, stole the physical text of the approved bill and went into hiding, preventing the move. On May 11, 1858, Minnesota was admitted to the union as the 32nd state, with Saint Paul still capital. Soon thereafter the country was torn by the Civil War. When the state learned that Governor Ramsey had volunteered a regiment to fight the South, communities across the state put together companies of volunteers for that regiment. St. Paul contributed A and C Companies to the formation of the 1st Minnesota Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe year 1858 saw more than 1,000 steamboats service Saint Paul, making the city a gateway for settlers to the Minnesota frontier or Dakota Territory. Natural geography was a primary reason the city became a landing. The area was the last accessible point to unload boats coming upriver due to the Mississippi River Valley's stone bluffs. During this period, Saint Paul was called \"The Last City of the East.\" Industrialist James J. Hill constructed his railroad empire into the Great Northern Railway and Northern Pacific Railway, both headquartered in Saint Paul until merging into the Burlington Northern. Today they are part of the BNSF Railway.The Spanish\u2013American War saw the trans-Atlantic ocean liner SS Saint Paul (1895) converted and commissioned into the United States Navy as an auxiliary cruiser. She was the first ship in the navy to bear the city's name. She was decommissioned and returned to her owners only to be conscripted for service again for WWI, after which she was again decommissioned and scraped.\nCrooks' Haven In 1900 an Irishman named John O'Connor became chief of the St. Paul police and was known on the street as \"the Big Fellow\". That year he instituted the \"O'Connor Layover Agreement\" and made an effort to inform criminals of its existence. St. Paul police would ignore any transgressions of the law that took place outside their jurisdiction as long as criminals \"checked in\" when they arrived in town. There were three conditions to the agreement: check in with the police; pay a \"donation\" to the chief; and commit no crimes in St. Paul. Check-in was at the Savoy Hotel downtown. A great deal of \"business\" was taken care of at the \"Green Lantern\" speakeasy near the train station in Lowertown. It was also known for illegal gaming. More got done in the caves across the river from downtown. In 1930 the local mob even arranged that St. Paul's new police chief would be Tom Brown. The \"Agreement\" lasted through the prohibition until 1935. In that time St. Paul welcomed John Dillinger, Billie Frechette, Ma Barker, Baby Face Nelson, Alvin Karpis, Machine Gun Kelly, Kid Cann and many of their Irish associates. Barker's gang resided a block south of the city line on Robert St.. Karpis is quoted as saying, \u201cThere was probably never before as complete a gathering of criminals in one room in the United States, as there was in the Green Lantern on New Year\u2019s Eve in 1931. There were escapees from every U.S. Penitentiary. I was dazzled.\u201d  Al Capone and Bonnie and Clyde are known to have called on the city also.  According to crime historian Paul Maccabee the only criminal there is no record of visiting St. Paul during this period is Pretty Boy Floyd.  Events in 1935 changed the St. Paul police department and closed St. Paul's open doors.On August 20, 1904, severe thunderstorms and tornadoes damaged hundreds of downtown buildings, causing $1.78 million ($50.65 million today) in damages and ripping spans from the High Bridge.WWII  On the morning of December 7, 1941, the USS Ward was manned by naval reservists. It had a crew of 115, of whom at least 85 were from St. Paul. Duty that morning was patrolling the entrance of Pearl Harbor, T.H. The watch caught sight of a periscope trailing a freighter into the harbor and the Ward took action against the unknown intruder. The crew became the first Americans to fire their weapons in WWII. A 4\"/50 gun from the ship can be seen on the state capitol grounds. WWII brought into being the second USS St. Paul. This time the city had a Baltimore-class cruiser bearing its name. That ship's bell is on display in Saint Paul's city hall.\nDuring the 1960s, in conjunction with urban renewal, Saint Paul razed neighborhoods west of downtown for the creation of the interstate freeway system. From 1959 to 1961, the Rondo Neighborhood was demolished for the construction of Interstate 94. The loss of that African American enclave brought attention to racial segregation and unequal housing in northern cities. The annual Rondo Days celebration commemorates the African American community.Downtown St. Paul had skyscraper-building booms beginning in the 1970s. Because the city center is directly beneath the flight path into the airport across the river there is a height restriction for all construction. The tallest buildings, such as Galtier Plaza (Jackson and Sibley Towers), The Pointe of Saint Paul condominiums, and the city's tallest building, Wells Fargo Place (formerly Minnesota World Trade Center), were constructed in the late 1980s. In the 1990s and 2000s, the tradition of bringing new immigrant groups to the city continued. As of 2004, nearly 10% of the city's population were recent Hmong immigrants from Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Myanmar. Saint Paul is the location of the Hmong Archives.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSaint Paul's history and growth as a landing port are tied to water. The city's defining physical characteristic, the confluence of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, was carved into the region during the last ice age, as were the steep river bluffs and dramatic palisades on which the city is built. Receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz forced torrents of water from a glacial river that undercut the river valleys. The city is situated in east-central Minnesota.\nThe Mississippi River forms a municipal boundary on part of the city's west, southwest, and southeast sides. Minneapolis, the state's largest city, lies to the west. Falcon Heights, Lauderdale, Roseville, and Maplewood are north, with Maplewood lying to the east. The cities of West Saint Paul and South Saint Paul are to the south, as are Lilydale, Mendota, and Mendota Heights, although across the river from the city. The city's largest lakes are Pig's Eye Lake, which is part of the Mississippi, Lake Phalen, and Lake Como. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 56.18 square miles (145.51 km2), of which 51.98 square miles (134.63 km2) is land and 4.20 square miles (10.88 km2) is water.The Parks and Recreation department is responsible for 160 parks and 41 recreation centers. The city ranked #2 in park access and quality, after only Minneapolis, in the 2018 ParkScore ranking of the top 100 park systems across the United States according to the nonprofit Trust for Public Land.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nSaint Paul's Department of Planning and Economic Development divides Saint Paul into seventeen Planning Districts, created in 1979 to allow neighborhoods to participate in governance and use Community Development Block Grants. With a funding agreement directly from the city, the councils share a pool of funds. The councils have significant land-use control, a voice in guiding development, and they organize residents. The boundaries are adjusted depending on population changes; as such, they sometimes overlap established neighborhoods. Though these neighborhoods changed over time, preservationists have saved many of their historically significant structures.\nThe city's seventeen Planning Districts are:\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nSaint Paul has a continental climate typical of the Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, while summers are warm to hot and humid. On the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Saint Paul falls in the hot summer humid continental climate zone (Dfa). The city experiences a full range of precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog.Due to its northerly location in the United States and lack of large bodies of water to moderate the air, Saint Paul is sometimes subjected to cold Arctic air masses, especially during late December, January, and February. The average annual temperature of 47.05 \u00b0F (8.36 \u00b0C) gives the Minneapolis\u2212Saint Paul metropolitan area the coldest annual mean temperature of any major metropolitan area in the continental U.S.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants from about 400 A.D. were members of the Hopewell tradition who buried their dead in mounds (now Indian Mounds Park) on the bluffs above the river. The next known inhabitants were the Mdewakanton Dakota in the 17th century who fled their ancestral home of Mille Lacs Lake in central Minnesota in response to westward expansion of the Ojibwe nation. The Ojibwe would later occupy the north (east) bank of the Mississippi River.\nBy 1800, French-Canadian explorers came through the region and attracted fur traders to the area. Fort Snelling and nearby Pig's Eye Tavern also brought the first Yankees from New England and English, Irish, and Scottish immigrants who had enlisted in the army and settled nearby after discharge. These early settlers and entrepreneurs built houses on the heights north of the river. The first wave of immigration came with the Irish who settled at Connemara Patch along the Mississippi, named for their home in Connemara Ireland. The Irish would become prolific in politics, city governance, and public safety, much to the chagrin of the Germans and French who had grown into the majority. In 1850, the first of many groups of Swedish immigrants passed through Saint Paul on their way to farming communities in northern and western regions of the territory. A large group settled in Swede Hollow, which would later become home to Poles, Italians, and Mexicans. The last Swedish presence had moved up Saint Paul's East Side along Payne Avenue in the 1950s.In terms of people who specified European ancestry in the 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey, the city was 26.4% German, 13.8% Irish, 8.4% Norwegian, 7.0% Swedish, and 6.2% English. There is also a visible community of people of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, representing 4.2% of Saint Paul's population. By the 1980s, the Thomas Dale area, once an Austro-Hungarian enclave known as Frogtown (German: Froschburg), became home to Vietnamese people who had left their war-torn country. A settlement program for the Hmong diaspora came soon after, and by 2000, the Saint Paul Hmong were the largest urban contingent in the United States. Mexican immigrants have settled in Saint Paul's West Side since the 1930s, and have grown enough that Mexico opened a foreign consulate in 2005.The majority of residents claiming religious affiliation are Christian, split between the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant denominations. The Roman Catholic presence comes from Irish, German, Scottish, and French Canadian settlers who, in time, would be bolstered by Hispanic immigrants. There are Jewish synagogues such as Mount Zion Temple and relatively small populations of Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists. The city has been dubbed \"paganistan\" due to its large Wiccan population.As of the 2005\u20132007 American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, White Americans made up 66.5% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 62.1% were non-Hispanic whites, down from 93.6% in 1970. Blacks or African Americans made up 13.9% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 13.5% were non-Hispanic blacks. American Indians made up 0.8% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 0.6% were non-Hispanic. Asian Americans made up 12.3% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 12.2% were non-Hispanic. Pacific Islander Americans made up less than 0.1% of Saint Paul's population. Individuals of other races made up 3.4% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 0.2% were non-Hispanic. Individuals from two or more races made up 3.1% of Saint Paul's population, of whom 2.6% were non-Hispanic. In addition, Hispanics and Latinos made up 8.7% of Saint Paul's population.\nAs of the 2000 U.S. Census, there were 287,151 people, 112,109 households, and 60,999 families residing in the city. The racial makeup of the city was 67.0% White, 11.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 12.4% Asian (mostly Hmong), 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.8% from other races, and 3.9% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 7.9% of the population.\n\n\n=== 2010 census ===\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 285,068 people, 111,001 households, and 59,689 families residing in the city. The population density was 5,484.2 inhabitants per square mile (2,117.5/km2). There were 120,795 housing units at an average density of 2,323.9 per square mile (897.3/km2). The racial makeup of the city was 60.1% white, 15.7% African American, 1.1% Native American, 15.0% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 3.9% from other races, and 4.2% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino people of any race were 9.6% of the population.\nThere were 111,001 households, of which 30.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 34.1% were married couples living together, 14.8% had a female householder with no husband present, 4.9% had a male householder with no wife present, and 46.2% were non-families. 35.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.47 and the average family size was 3.33.\nThe median age in the city was 30.9 years. 25.1% of residents were under the age of 18; 13.9% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 29.6% were from 25 to 44; 22.6% were from 45 to 64; and 9% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 48.9% male and 51.1% female.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul\u2013Bloomington area employs 1,570,700 people in the private sector as of July 2008, 82.43 percent of which work in private service providing-related jobs.Major corporations headquartered in Saint Paul include Ecolab, a chemical and cleaning product company which was named in 2008 by the Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal as the eighth best place to work in the Twin Cites for companies with 1,000 full-time Minnesota employees, and Securian Financial Group Inc.The 3M Company is often cited as one of Saint Paul's companies, though it is located in adjacent Maplewood. 3M employs 16,000 people throughout Minnesota. St. Jude Medical, a manufacturer of medical devices, is directly across the northern border of Saint Paul in Little Canada, though the company's address is listed in Saint Paul.The city was home to the Ford Motor Company's Twin Cities Assembly Plant, which opened in 1924 and closed at the end of 2011. The plant was in Highland Park on the Mississippi River, adjacent to Lock and Dam No. 1, Mississippi River, which generates hydroelectric power. The site is now being cleared of all buildings and tested for contamination to prepare for redevelopment. As the lead developer, the Ryan Company has released a proposed set of zoning changes that will shape how the land will be used.The city of Saint Paul has financed city development by use of tax increment financing (TIF). In 2018, the city had 55 TIF districts. Some projects that have benefited from TIF funding include the St. Paul Saints stadium, and the affordable housing along the Twin Cities Metro Green Line.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nEvery January, Saint Paul hosts the Saint Paul Winter Carnival, a tradition that began in 1886 when a New York reporter called Saint Paul \"another Siberia\". The organizers had a model in Montreal Winter Carnival the year before. The event has now been held 135 times  with an attendance of 350,000. It includes an ice sculpting competition, a snow sculpting competition, a medallion treasure hunt, food, activities, and an ice palace when it can be arranged. The Como Zoo and Conservatory and adjoining Japanese Garden are popular year-round. The historic Landmark Center in downtown Saint Paul hosts cultural and arts organizations. The city's recreation sites include Indian Mounds Park, Battle Creek Regional Park, Harriet Island Regional Park, Highland Park, the Wabasha Street Caves, Lake Como, Lake Phalen, and Rice Park, as well as several areas abutting the Mississippi River. The Irish Fair of Minnesota is held annually at the Harriet Island Pavilion area. The country's largest Hmong American sports festival, the Freedom Festival, is held the first weekend of July at McMurray Field near Como Park.\nThe city is associated with the Minnesota State Fair in neighboring Falcon Heights just west of Como Park. The fair dates to before statehood. With the competing interests of Minneapolis and St. Paul, it was held on \"neutral ground\" between both.  That area refused to become part of St. Paul or Roseville and became Falcon Heights in the 1950s. The University of Minnesota Saint Paul Campus is actually in Falcon Heights. \nFort Snelling is often identified as being in St. Paul but is actually its own unorganized territory. The eastern part of Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory (MSP included) has a St. Paul mailing address. The western side has a Minneapolis ZIP code. \n\nSaint Paul is the birthplace of cartoonist Charles M. Schulz, who lived in Merriam Park from infancy until 1960. Schulz's Peanuts inspired giant, decorated sculptures around the city, a Chamber of Commerce promotion in the late 1990s. Other notable residents include writer F. Scott Fitzgerald and playwright August Wilson, who premiered many of the ten plays in his Pittsburgh Cycle at the local Penumbra Theater.The Ordway Center for the Performing Arts hosts theater productions and the Minnesota Opera is a founding tenant. RiverCentre, attached to Xcel Energy Center, serves as the city's convention center. The city has contributed to the music of Minnesota and the Twin Cities music scene through various venues. Great jazz musicians have passed through the influential Artists' Quarter, first established in the 1970s in Whittier, Minneapolis, and moved to downtown Saint Paul in 1994. Artists' Quarter also hosts the Soapboxing Poetry Slam, home of the 2009 National Poetry Slam Champions. At The Black Dog, in Lowertown, many French or European jazz musicians (Evan Parker, Tony Hymas, Beno\u00eet Delbecq, Fran\u00e7ois Corneloup) have met Twin Cities musicians and started new groups touring in Europe. Groups and performers such as Fantastic Merlins, Dean Magraw/Davu Seru, Merciless Ghosts, and Willie Murphy are regulars. The Turf Club in Midway has been a music scene landmark since the 1940s. Saint Paul is also the home base of the internationally acclaimed Rose Ensemble. As an Irish stronghold, the city boasts popular Irish pubs with live music, such as Shamrocks, The Dubliner, and O'Gara's. The internationally acclaimed Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the nation's only full-time professional chamber orchestra.

The Minnesota Wild play their home games in downtown Saint Paul's Xcel Energy Center, which opened in 2000. The Wild brought the NHL back to Minnesota for the first time since 1993, when the Minnesota North Stars left the state for Dallas, Texas. (The World Hockey Association's Minnesota Fighting Saints played in Saint Paul from 1972 to 1977.) Citing the history of hockey in the Twin Cities and teams at all levels, Sports Illustrated called Saint Paul the new Hockeytown U.S.A. in 2007.The Xcel Energy Center, a multipurpose entertainment and sports venue, can host concerts and accommodate nearly all sporting events. It occupies the site of the demolished Saint Paul Civic Center. The Xcel Energy Center hosts the Minnesota high school boys hockey tournament, the Minnesota high school girls' volleyball tournament, and concerts throughout the year. In 2004, it was named the best overall sports venue in the US by ESPN.\n\nThe St. Paul Saints is the city's independent league baseball team. There have been several different teams called the Saints over the years. Founded in 1884, they were shut down in 1961 after the Minnesota Twins moved to Bloomington. The St. Paul Saints were brought back in 1993 as an independent baseball team in the Northern League, moving to the American Association in 2006. Their home games are played at the open-air CHS Field in downtown's Lowertown Historic District. Four noted Major League All-Star baseball players are natives of Saint Paul: Hall of Fame outfielder Dave Winfield, Hall of Fame infielder Paul Molitor, Hall of Fame pitcher Jack Morris, and first baseman Joe Mauer.

Minnesota's oldest athletic organization, the Minnesota Boat Club, resides in the Mississippi River on Raspberry Island. Saint Paul is also home to Circus Juventas, the largest circus arts school in North America.On March 25, 2015, Major League Soccer announced that it had awarded its 23rd MLS franchise to Minnesota United FC, a team from the lower-level North American Soccer League. Bill McGuire and his ownership group, which includes Jim Pohlad of the Minnesota Twins, Glen Taylor of the Minnesota Timberwolves, former Minnesota Wild investor Glen Nelson, and his daughter Wendy Carlson Nelson of the Carlson hospitality company, had intended to build a privately financed soccer-specific stadium in Downtown Minneapolis near the Minneapolis Farmer's Market. But their plan was met with heavy opposition from former Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges, who said her city was suffering from \"stadium fatigue\" after building three stadiums, for the Minnesota Twins, Minnesota Vikings and the Minnesota Golden Gophers, within a six-year span. On July 1, 2015, after failing to reach an agreement with the city of Minneapolis, McGuire and his partners turned their focus to Saint Paul.On October 23, 2015, Bill McGuire of Minnesota United FC and former Saint Paul Mayor Chris Coleman announced that a privately financed soccer-specific stadium would be built on the vacant Metro Transit bus barn site in Saint Paul's Midway neighborhood near the intersection of Snelling Avenue and University Avenue. It is midway between downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis. The stadium, Allianz Field, opened in April 2019 and seats 19,400. The team began playing in the MLS in 2017.On May 15, 2018, the Minnesota Whitecaps joined the National Women's Hockey League as their fifth franchise.

The mayor is the chief executive and chief administrative officer for the city and the seven-member city council is the legislative body. The mayor is elected by the entire city, while members of the city council are elected from seven different geographic wards of approximately equal population. Both the mayor and council members serve four-year terms. The current mayor is Melvin Carter (DFL), Saint Paul's first African-American mayor. Aside from Norm Coleman, who became a Republican during his second term, Saint Paul has not elected a Republican mayor since 1952.\n\nThe city is also the county seat of Ramsey County, named for Alexander Ramsey, the state's first governor. The county once spanned much of the present-day metropolitan area and was originally to be named Saint Paul County after the city. Today it is geographically the smallest county and the most densely populated. Ramsey is the only home rule county in Minnesota; the seven-member Board of Commissioners appoints a county manager whose office is in the combination city hall/county courthouse along with the Minnesota Second Judicial Courts. The nearby Law Enforcement Center houses the Ramsey County Sheriff's office.\n\n\n=== State and federal ===\n\nSaint Paul is the capital of the state of Minnesota. The city hosts the capitol building, designed by Saint Paul resident Cass Gilbert, and the House and Senate office buildings. The Minnesota Governor's Residence, which is used for some state functions, is on Summit Avenue. The Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (affiliated with the Democratic Party) is headquartered in Saint Paul. Numerous state departments and services are also headquartered in Saint Paul, such as the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.\nThe city is split into four Minnesota Senate districts (64, 65, 66 and 67) and eight Minnesota House of Representatives districts (64A, 64B, 65A, 65B, 66A, 66B, 67A and 67B), all of which are held by Democrats.Saint Paul is the heart of Minnesota's 4th congressional district, represented by Democrat Betty McCollum. The district has been in DFL hands without interruption since 1949. Minnesota is represented in the US Senate by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, a former Hennepin County Attorney, and Democrat Tina Smith, former Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota.\n\n*District also includes Falcon Heights, Lauderdale and Roseville.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nSaint Paul is second in the United States in the number of higher education institutions per capita, behind Boston. Higher education institutions that call Saint Paul home include three public and eight private colleges and universities and five post-secondary institutions. Well-known colleges and universities include the Saint Catherine University, Concordia University, Hamline University, Macalester College, and the University of St. Thomas. Metropolitan State University and Saint Paul College, which focus on non-traditional students, are based in Saint Paul, as well as a law school, Mitchell Hamline School of Law.The Saint Paul Public Schools district is the state's largest school district and serves approximately 39,000 students. The district is extremely diverse with students from families speaking 90 different languages, although only five languages are used for most school communication: English, Spanish, Hmong, Karen, and Somali. The district runs 82 different schools, including 52 elementary schools, twelve middle schools, seven high schools, ten alternative schools, and one special education school, employing over 6,500 teachers and staff. The school district also oversees community education programs for pre-K and adult learners, including Early Childhood Family Education, GED Diploma, language programs, and various learning opportunities for community members of all ages. In 2006, Saint Paul Public Schools celebrated its 150th anniversary. Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen by their families under Minnesota's open enrollment statute.A variety of K-12 private, parochial, and public charter schools are also represented in the city. In 1992, Saint Paul became the first city in the US to sponsor and open a charter school, now found in most states across the nation. Saint Paul is currently home to 21 charter schools as well as 38 private schools. The Saint Paul Public Library system includes a central library and twelve branch locations.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nResidents of Saint Paul can receive 10 broadcast television stations, five of which broadcast from within Saint Paul. One daily newspaper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, two weekly neighborhood newspapers, the East Side Review and City Pages (owned by The Star Tribune Company), and several monthly or semimonthly neighborhood papers serve the city. It was the only city in the United States with a population of 250,000 or more to see an increase in circulation of Sunday newspapers in 2007. Several media outlets based in neighboring Minneapolis also serve the Saint Paul community, including the Star Tribune. Saint Paul is home to Minnesota Public Radio, a three-format system that broadcasts on nearly 40 stations around the Midwest. MPR locally delivers news and information, classical, and The Current (which plays a wide variety of music). The station has 110,000 regional members and more than 800,000 listeners each week throughout the Upper Midwest, the largest audience of any regional public radio network. Also operating as part of American Public Media, MPR's programming reaches five million listeners, most notably through Live from Here, hosted by Chris Thile (previously known as A Prairie Home Companion, hosted by Garrison Keillor, who also lives in the city). The Fitzgerald Theater, renamed in 1994 for Saint Paul native and novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald, is home to the show.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Interstate and roadways ===\n\nResidents use Interstate 35E running north\u2013south and Interstate 94 running east\u2013west. Trunk highways include U.S. Highway 52, Minnesota State Highway 280, and Minnesota State Highway 5. Saint Paul has several unique roads such as Ayd Mill Road, Phalen Boulevard and Shepard Road/Warner Road, which diagonally follow particular geographic features in the city. Biking is also gaining popularity, due to the creation of more paved bike lanes that connect to other bike routes throughout the metropolitan area and the creation of Nice Ride Minnesota, a seasonally operated nonprofit bicycle sharing and rental system that has over 1,550 bicycles and 170 stations in both Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Downtown Saint Paul has a five-mile (8 km) enclosed skyway system over twenty-five city blocks. The 563-mile (906 km) Avenue of the Saints connects Saint Paul with Saint Louis, Missouri.\nThe layout of city streets and roads has often drawn complaints. While he was Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman, and remarked that the streets were designed by \"drunken Irishmen\". He later apologized, though people had been complaining about the fractured grid system for more than a century by that point. Some of the city's road design is the result of the curve of the Mississippi River, hilly topography, conflicts between developers of different neighborhoods in the early city, and grand plans only half-realized. Outside of downtown, the roads are less confusing, but most roads are named, rather than numbered, increasing the difficulty for non-natives to navigate.\n\n\n=== Mass transit ===\n\nMetro Transit provides bus service and light rail in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area. The METRO Green Line is an 11-mile (18 km) light rail line that connects downtown Saint Paul to downtown Minneapolis with 14 stations in Saint Paul. The Green Line runs west along University Avenue, through the University of Minnesota campus, until it links up and then shares stations with the METRO Blue Line in downtown Minneapolis. Construction began in November 2010 and the line began service on June 14, 2014. Roughly 45,000 people rode on the first day; an average 28,000 riders are expected per day.Metro Transit opened the METRO A Line, Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul's first arterial bus rapid transit line, along Snelling Avenue and Ford Parkway. The A Line connects the METRO Blue Line at 46th Street station to Rosedale Center with a connection at the Green Line Snelling Avenue station. The A Line is the first in a series of planned arterial bus rapid transit lines and is set to open in early 2016.\n\n\n=== Railroad ===\nAmtrak's Empire Builder between Chicago and Seattle stops twice daily in each direction at the newly renovated Saint Paul Union Depot. Ridership on the train increased about 6% from 2005 to over 505,000 in fiscal year 2007. A Minnesota Department of Transportation study found that increased daily service to Chicago should be economically viable, especially if it originates in Saint Paul and does not experience delays from the rest of the western route of the Empire Builder. Saint Paul is the site of the Pig's Eye Yard, a major freight classification yard for Canadian Pacific Railway. As of 2003, the yard handled over 1,000 freight cars per day. Both Union Pacific and Burlington Northern Santa Fe run trains through the yard, though they are not classified at Pig's Eye. Burlington Northern Santa Fe operates the large Northtown Yard in Minneapolis, which handles about 600 cars per day. There are several other small yards located around the city.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nHolman Airfield is across the river from downtown St Paul.  It is the location where Lamprey lake existed until it was filled in with dredgings by the Army Corps of Engineers starting in the early 1920's.  Northwest Airlines began initial operations from Holman in 1926.  During WWII Northwest had a contract to install upgraded radar systems in B-24s employing 5,000 at the airfield.  Post WWII Holman Airfield competed with the Speedway Field for the growing aviation industry in the twin cities and lost out in the end.  Today Holman is a reliever airport run by the Metropolitan Airports Commission. It is home to Minnesota's Air National Guard, a flight training school and is tailored to local corporate aviation. There are three runways, with the Holman Field Administration Building and Riverside Hangar on the National Register of Historic Places.  The historical importance of the Northwest Airlines original building was only realized after demolition had commenced.\nFor the most part Saint Paul's aviation needs are served by the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul International Airport (MSP), which sits on 2,930 acres (11.9 km2) in the Fort Snelling Unorganized Territory bordering the city to the southwest. MPS serves three international, twelve domestic, seven charter, and four regional carriers and is a hub and home base for Delta Air Lines, Mesaba Airlines and Sun Country Airlines.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nSaint Paul has eight sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International:\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nWalter Abel (1898\u20131987), actor\nLoni Anderson (born 1946), actress\nLouie Anderson (born 1953), comedian\nWendell Anderson (1933\u20132016), US Senator\nRichard Arlen (1899\u20131976), actor\nRoger Awsumb (1928-2002), TV show host \"Casey Jones\"\nHarry Blackmun (1908\u20131999), US Supreme Court Associate Justice, grew up in St. Paul\nWinfield S.

It\u2019s a small zoo so you don\u2019t have to do a lot of walking and has a lot of rides and other things to do. Only downside is parking is sometimes hard",

        "wiki": "The Cherokee (; Cherokee: \u13a0\u13c2\u13f4\u13eb\u13ef\u13a2, romanized: Aniyvwiya\u0294i, or Cherokee: \u13e3\u13b3\u13a9, romanized: Tsalagi) are one of the indigenous people of the Southeastern Woodlands of the United States. Prior to the 18th century, they were concentrated in what is now southwestern North Carolina, southeastern Tennessee, edges of western South Carolina, northeastern Georgia and northeastern Alabama.The Cherokee language is part of the Iroquoian language group. In the 19th century, James Mooney, an American ethnographer, recorded one oral tradition that told of the tribe having migrated south in ancient times from the Great Lakes region, where other Iroquoian-speaking peoples lived; however, anthropologist Thomas R. Whyte writes that the origin of the proto-Iroquoian language was likely the Appalachian region and the split between Northern and Southern Iroquoian languages began 4,000 years ago.By the 19th century, European settlers in the United States classified the Cherokee of the Southeast as one of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\", because they were agrarian and lived in permanent villages and began to adopt some cultural and technological practices of the European American settlers.\nToday three Cherokee tribes are federally recognized:  the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians (UKB) in Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation (CN) in Oklahoma, and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina.The Cherokee Nation has more than 300,000 tribal members, making it the largest of the 567 federally recognized tribes in the United States. In addition, numerous groups claim Cherokee lineage, and some of these are state-recognized. A total of more than 819,000 people are estimated to have identified as having Cherokee ancestry on the U.S. census; most are not enrolled members of any tribe.Of the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes, the Cherokee Nation and the UKB have headquarters in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and most of their members live in the state. The UKB are mostly descendants of \"Old Settlers\", also called Western Cherokee: those who migrated from the Southeast to Arkansas and Oklahoma about 1817 prior to Indian Removal. They are related to the Cherokee who were later forcibly relocated there in the 1830s under the Indian Removal Act. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians is located on land known as the Qualla Boundary in western North Carolina. They are mostly descendants of ancestors who had resisted or avoided relocation, remaining in the area. Because they gave up tribal membership at the time, they became state and US citizens. In the late 20th century, they reorganized as a federally recognized tribe.\n\n\n== Name ==\nA Cherokee language name for Cherokee people is Aniyvwiya\u0294i (\u13a0\u13c2\u13f4\u13eb\u13ef), translating as \"Principal People\". Tsalagi (\u13e3\u13b3\u13a9) is the Cherokee word for the Cherokee language.Many theories, though none proven, abound about the origin of the name \"Cherokee\". It may have originally been derived from the Choctaw word Cha-la-kee, which means \"people who live in the mountains\", or Choctaw Chi-luk-ik-bi, meaning \"people who live in the cave country\". The earliest Spanish transliteration of the name, from 1755, is recorded as Tchalaquei. Another theory is that \"Cherokee\" derives from a Lower Creek word Cvlakke (\"chuh-log-gee\"). The Iroquois Five Nations based in New York have historically called the Cherokee Oyata'ge'rono\u00f1 (\"inhabitants of the cave country\"). It's possible the word \"Cherokee\" comes from a Muscogee word meaning \u201cpeople of different speech.\u201d\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nAnthropologists and historians have two main theories of Cherokee origins. One is that the Cherokee, an Iroquoian-speaking people, are relative latecomers to Southern Appalachia, who may have migrated in late prehistoric times from northern areas around the Great Lakes, the traditional territory of the  Haudenosaunee nations and other Iroquoian-speaking peoples. Another theory is that the Cherokee had been in the Southeast for thousands of years.\nResearchers in the 19th century recorded conversations with elders who recounted an oral tradition of the Cherokee people migrating south from the Great Lakes region in ancient times. They may have moved south into Muscogee Creek territory and settled at the sites of mounds built by the Mississippian culture and earlier moundbuilders. In the 19th century, European-American settlers mistakenly attributed several Mississippian culture sites in Georgia to the Cherokee, including Moundville and Etowah Mounds. However, other evidence shows that the Cherokee did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century and could not have built the mounds.\nThe Connestee people, believed to be ancestors of the Cherokee, occupied western North Carolina circa 200 to 600 CE.Pre-contact Cherokee are considered to be part of the later Pisgah Phase of Southern Appalachia, which lasted from circa 1000 to 1500. Despite the consensus among most specialists in Southeast archeology and anthropology, some scholars contend that ancestors of the Cherokee people lived in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee for a far longer period of time. During the late Archaic and Woodland Period, Native Americans in the region began to cultivate plants such as marsh elder, lambsquarters, pigweed, sunflowers, and some native squash. People created new art forms such as shell gorgets, adopted new technologies, and developed an elaborate cycle of religious ceremonies.\nDuring the Mississippian culture-period (800 to 1500 CE), local women developed a new variety of maize (corn) called eastern flint corn. It closely resembled modern corn and produced larger crops. The successful cultivation of corn surpluses allowed the rise of larger, more complex chiefdoms consisting of several villages and concentrated populations during this period. Corn became celebrated among numerous peoples in religious ceremonies, especially the Green Corn Ceremony.\n\n\n== Early cultures ==\nMuch of what is known about pre-18th-century Native American cultures has come from records of Spanish expeditions. The earliest ones of the mid-16th-century encountered people of the Mississippian culture, the ancestors to later tribes in the Southeast such as the Muscogee and Catawba. Specifically in 1540-41, a Spanish expedition led by Hernando de Soto passed through what was later characterized as Cherokee country by English colonists based on their historical encounter. De Soto's expedition visited villages in present-day western Georgia and eastern Tennessee, recording them as ruled by the Coosa chiefdom. It is now considered to be a chiefdom ancestral to the Muscogee Creek people, who are from a different language and cultural group. The Spanish recorded a Chalaque nation as living around the Keowee River where North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia meet. As some of this work was not translated into English until the 20th century, alternative views had developed among English-speaking historians, related to the limited understanding by English colonists of historic Native American cultures in the Southeast. In addition, the dominance of English colonists in the Southeast led to a discounting of Spanish sources for some time in their construction of history of the area.\nThe American writer John Howard Payne wrote about pre-19th-century Cherokee culture and society. The Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional two-part societal structure. A \"white\" organization of elders represented the seven clans. As Payne recounted, this group, which was hereditary and priestly, was responsible for religious activities, such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the \"red\" organization, was responsible for warfare. The Cherokee considered warfare a polluting activity. After warfare, the warriors required purification by the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century.\nResearchers have debated the reasons for the change. Some historians believe the decline in priestly power originated with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the Ani-kutani. Ethnographer James Mooney, who studied the Cherokee in the late 1880s, was the first to trace the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt. By the time that Mooney was studying the people, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.Another major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the didanvwisgi (\u13d7\u13d3\u13c5\u13eb\u13cd\u13a9), Cherokee medicine men, after Sequoyah's creation of the Cherokee syllabary in the 1820s. Initially only the didanvwisgi learned to write and read such materials, which were considered extremely powerful in a spiritual sense. Later, the syllabary and writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.\nUnlike most other Native Americans in the American Southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an Iroquoian language, an indication of their migration from another area. Since the Great Lakes region was the territory of most Iroquoian-language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. This view is supported by the Cherokee oral history tradition. According to the scholars' theory, the Tuscarora, another Iroquoian-speaking people who inhabited the Southeast in historic times, and the Cherokee broke off from the major group during its northern  migration.\nOther historians hold that, judging from linguistic and cultural data, the Tuscarora people migrated South from other Iroquoian-speaking people in the Great Lakes region in ancient times. After extended harsh warfare in the Southeast, in the 1700s, the Tuscarora left the area and \"returned\" to the New York area, counting their tribal migration complete by 1722. The Iroquois Five Nations accepted the Tuscarora as the Sixth Nation of their political confederacy, known as the Haudenosaunee.Linguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting they had migrated long ago. Scholars posit a split between the groups in the distant past, perhaps 3500\u20133800 years ago. Glottochronology studies suggest the split occurred between about 1,500 and 1,800 BCE. The Cherokee have claimed the ancient settlement of Kituwa on the Tuckasegee River as the original Cherokee settlement in the Southeast. It was formerly adjacent to and is now part of Qualla Boundary (the reserve of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians) in North Carolina.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 17th century: English contact ===\nIn 1657, there was a disturbance in Virginia Colony as the Rechahecrians or Rickahockans, as well as the Siouan Manahoac and Nahyssan, broke through the frontier and settled near the Falls of the James, near present-day Richmond, Virginia.  The following year, a combined force of English and Pamunkey drove the newcomers away.  The identity of the Rechahecrians has been much debated.  Historians noted the name closely resembled that recorded for the Eriechronon or Erielhonan, commonly known as the Erie tribe, another Iroquoian-speaking people based near the Great Lakes.  This Iroquoian people had been driven away from the southern shore of Lake Erie in 1654 by the powerful Iroquois Five Nations, who were seeking more hunting grounds.  The anthropologist Martin Smith theorized some remnants of the tribe migrated to Virginia after the wars (1986:131\u201332), later becoming known as the Westo to English in the Carolina colony. A few historians suggest this tribe was Cherokee.Virginian traders developed a small-scale trading system with the Cherokee in the Piedmont before the end of the 17th century; the earliest recorded Virginia trader to live among the Cherokee was Cornelius Dougherty or Dority, in 1690.\n\n\n=== 18th century ===\n\nThe Cherokee gave sanctuary to a band of Shawnee in the 1660s, but from 1710 to 1715 the Cherokee and Chickasaw allied with the British, and fought the Shawnee, who were allied with the French, and forced them to move northward. The Cherokee fought with the Yamasee, Catawba, and British in late 1712 and early 1713 against the Tuscarora in the Second Tuscarora War. The Tuscarora War marked the beginning of a British-Cherokee relationship that, despite breaking down on occasion, remained strong for much of the 18th century. With the growth of the deerskin trade, the Cherokee were considered valuable trading partners, since deer-skins from the cooler country of their mountain hunting-grounds were of a better quality than those supplied by the lowland tribes who were neighbors of the English colonists.\nIn January 1716, Cherokee murdered a delegation of Muscogee Creek leaders at the town of Tugaloo, marking their entry into the Yamasee War.  It ended in 1717 with peace treaties between the colony of South Carolina and the Creek.  Hostility and sporadic raids between the Cherokee and Creek continued for decades.  These raids came to a head at the Battle of Taliwa in 1755, present-day Ball Ground, Georgia, with the defeat of the Muscogee.\nIn 1721, the Cherokee ceded lands in South Carolina. In 1730, at Nikwasi, a former Mississippian culture site, a Scots adventurer, Sir Alexander Cuming, crowned Moytoy of Tellico as \"Emperor\" of the Cherokee.  Moytoy agreed to recognize King George II of Great Britain as the Cherokee protector.  Cuming arranged to take seven prominent Cherokee, including Attakullakulla,  to London, England.  There the Cherokee delegation signed the Treaty of Whitehall with the British.  Moytoy's son, Amo-sgasite (Dreadful Water), attempted to succeed him as \"Emperor\" in 1741, but the Cherokee elected their own leader, Conocotocko (Old Hop) of Chota.Political power among the Cherokee remained decentralized, and towns acted autonomously.  In 1735 the Cherokee were estimated to have sixty-four towns and villages, and 6,000 fighting men.  In 1738 and 1739 smallpox epidemics broke out among the Cherokee, who had no natural immunity to the new infectious disease.  Nearly half their population died within a year.  Hundreds of other Cherokee committed suicide due to their losses and disfigurement from the disease.\n\nAmerican colonist Henry Timberlake described the Cherokee people as he saw them in 1761:\n\nThe Cherokees are of a middle stature, of an olive colour, tho' generally painted, and their skins stained with gun-powder, pricked into it in very pretty figures. The hair of their head is shaved, tho' many of the old people have it plucked out by the roots, except a patch on the hinder part of the head, about twice the bigness of a crown-piece, which is ornamented with beads, feathers, wampum, stained deers hair, and such like baubles. The ears are slit and stretched to an enormous size, putting the person who undergoes the operation to incredible pain, being unable to lie on either side for nearly forty days. To remedy this, they generally slit but one at a time; so soon as the patient can bear it, they wound round with wire to expand them, and are adorned with silver pendants and rings, which they likewise wear at the nose. This custom does not belong originally to the Cherokees, but taken by them from the Shawnese, or other northern nations.\nThey that can afford it wear a collar of wampum, which are beads cut out of clam-shells, a silver breast-plate, and bracelets on their arms and wrists of the same metal, a bit of cloth over their private parts, a shirt of the English make, a sort of cloth-boots, and mockasons (sic), which are shoes of a make peculiar to the Americans, ornamented with porcupine-quills; a large mantle or match-coat thrown over all complete their dress at home ...\nFrom 1753 to 1755, battles broke out between the Cherokee and Muscogee over disputed hunting grounds in North Georgia. The Cherokee were victorious in the Battle of Taliwa.  British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to defend against the French in the Seven Years' War, which was fought across Europe and was called the French and Indian War on the North American front. These included Fort Loudoun near Chota.  In 1756 the Cherokee were allies of the British in the French and Indian War.  Serious misunderstandings arose quickly between the two allies, resulting in the 1760 Anglo-Cherokee War.King George III's Royal Proclamation of 1763 forbade British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, as his government tried to afford some protection from colonial encroachment to the Cherokee and other tribes.  The Crown found the ruling difficult to enforce with colonists.In 1771\u20131772, North Carolinian settlers squatted on Cherokee lands in Tennessee, forming the Watauga Association. Daniel Boone and his party tried to settle in Kentucky, but the Shawnee, Delaware, Mingo, and some Cherokee attacked a scouting and forage party that included Boone's son.  The American Indians used this territory as a hunting ground by right of conquest; it had hardly been inhabited for years.  The conflict in Kentucky sparked the beginning of what was known as Dunmore's War (1773\u20131774).\nIn 1776, allied with the Shawnee led by Cornstalk, Cherokee attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina in the Second Cherokee War. Overhill Cherokee Nancy Ward, Dragging Canoe's cousin, warned settlers of impending attacks. Provincial militias retaliated, destroying more than 50 Cherokee towns. North Carolina militia in 1776 and 1780 invaded and destroyed the Overhill towns. In 1777, surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the new states.\nDragging Canoe and his band settled along Chickamauga Creek near present-day Chattanooga, Tennessee, where they established 11 new towns. Chickamauga Town was his headquarters and the colonists tended to call his entire band the Chickamauga to distinguish them from other Cherokee. From here he fought a guerrilla war against settlers, which lasted from 1776 to 1794. These are known informally as the Cherokee\u2013American wars, but this is not an historians' term.  The first Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse, signed November 7, 1794, finally brought peace between the Cherokee and Americans, who had achieved independence from the British Crown. In 1805, the Cherokee ceded their lands between the Cumberland and Duck rivers (i.e. the Cumberland Plateau) to Tennessee.\n\n\n==== Scots (and other Europeans) among the Cherokee in the 18th century ====\nThe traders and British government agents dealing with the southern tribes in general, and the Cherokee in particular, were nearly all of Scottish ancestry, with many documented as being from the Highlands. A few were Scots-Irish, English, French, and German (see Scottish Indian trade).  Many of these men married women from their host peoples and remained after the fighting had ended. Some had mixed-race children who would later become significant leaders among the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast.Notable traders, agents, and refugee Tories among the Cherokee included John Stuart, Henry Stuart, Alexander Cameron, John McDonald, John Joseph Vann (father of James Vann), Daniel Ross (father of John Ross), John Walker Sr., John McLemore (father of Bob), William Buchanan, John Watts (father of John Watts Jr.), John D. Chisholm, John Benge (father of Bob Benge), Thomas Brown, John Rogers (Welsh), John Gunter (German, founder of Gunter's Landing), James Adair (Irish), William Thorpe (English), and Peter Hildebrand (German), among many others. Some attained the honorary status of minor chiefs and/or members of significant delegations.\nBy contrast, a large portion of the settlers encroaching on the Native American territories were Scots-Irish, Irish from Ulster who were of Scottish descent and had been part of the English plantation of northern Ireland. They also tended to support the Revolution. But in the back country, there were also Scots-Irish who were Loyalists, such as Simon Girty.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\n\n==== Acculturation ====\nThe Cherokee lands between the Tennessee and Chattahoochee rivers were remote enough from white settlers to remain independent after the Cherokee\u2013American wars.  The deerskin trade was no longer feasible on their greatly reduced lands, and over the next several decades, the people of the fledgling Cherokee Nation began to build a new society modeled on the white Southern United States.\n\nGeorge Washington sought to 'civilize' Southeastern American Indians, through programs overseen by the Indian Agent Benjamin Hawkins.  He encouraged the Cherokee to abandon their communal land-tenure and settle on individual farmsteads, which was facilitated by the destruction of many American Indian towns during the American Revolutionary War.  The deerskin trade brought white-tailed deer to the brink of extinction, and as pigs and cattle were introduced, they became the principal sources of meat.  The government supplied the tribes with spinning wheels and cotton-seed, and men were taught to fence and plow the land, in contrast to their traditional division in which crop cultivation was woman's labor.  Americans instructed the women in weaving.  Eventually Hawkins helped them set up smithys, gristmills and cotton plantations.\nThe Cherokee organized a national government under Principal Chiefs Little Turkey (1788\u20131801), Black Fox (1801\u20131811), and Pathkiller (1811\u20131827), all former warriors of Dragging Canoe.  The 'Cherokee triumvirate' of James Vann and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s The Ridge and Charles R. Hicks advocated acculturation, formal education, and modern methods of farming.  In 1801 they invited Moravian missionaries from North Carolina to teach Christianity and the 'arts of civilized life.'  The Moravians and later Congregationalist missionaries ran boarding schools, and a select few students were educated at the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions school in Connecticut.\nIn 1806 a Federal Road from Savannah, Georgia to Knoxville, Tennessee was built through Cherokee land. Chief James Vann opened a tavern, inn and ferry across the Chattahoochee and built a cotton-plantation on a spur of the road from Athens, Georgia to Nashville.  His son 'Rich Joe' Vann developed the plantation to 800 acres (3.2 km2), cultivated by 150 slaves.  He exported cotton to England, and owned a steamboat on the Tennessee River.The Cherokee allied with the U.S. against the nativist and pro-British Red Stick faction of the Upper Creek in the Creek War during the War of 1812. Cherokee warriors led by Major Ridge played a major role in General Andrew Jackson's victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. Major Ridge moved his family to Rome, Georgia, where he built a substantial house, developed a large plantation and ran a ferry on the Oostanaula River.  Although he never learned English, he sent his son and nephews to New England to be educated in mission schools. His interpreter and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chief John Ross, the descendant of several generations of Cherokee women and Scots fur-traders, built a plantation and operated a trading firm and a ferry at Ross' Landing (Chattanooga, Tennessee). During this period, divisions arose between the acculturated elite and the great majority of Cherokee, who clung to traditional ways of life.\nAround 1809 Sequoyah began developing a written form of the Cherokee language. He spoke no English, but his experiences as a silversmith dealing regularly with white settlers, and as a warrior at Horseshoe Bend, convinced him the Cherokee needed to develop writing. In 1821, he introduced Cherokee syllabary, the first written syllabic form of an American Indian language outside of Central America.  Initially his innovation was opposed by both Cherokee traditionalists and white missionaries, who sought to encourage the use of English. When Sequoyah taught children to read and write with the syllabary, he reached the adults. By the 1820s, the Cherokee had a higher rate of literacy than the whites around them in Georgia.\n\nIn 1819, the Cherokee began holding council meetings at New Town, at the headwaters of the Oostanaula (near present-day Calhoun, Georgia). In November 1825, New Town became the capital of the Cherokee Nation, and was renamed New Echota, after the Overhill Cherokee principal town of Chota. Sequoyah's syllabary was adopted. They had developed a police force, a judicial system, and a National Committee.\nIn 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a Constitution modeled on the United States, with executive, legislative and judicial branches and a system of checks and balances. The two-tiered legislature was led by Major Ridge and his son John Ridge. Convinced the tribe's survival required English-speaking leaders who could negotiate with the U.S., the legislature appointed John Ross as Principal Chief. A printing press was established at New Echota by the Vermont missionary Samuel Worcester and Major Ridge's nephew Elias Boudinot, who had taken the name of his white benefactor, a leader of the Continental Congress and New Jersey Congressman. They translated the Bible into Cherokee syllabary.  Boudinot published the first edition of the bilingual 'Cherokee Phoenix,' the first American Indian newspaper, in February 1828.\n\n\n==== Removal era ====\n\nBefore the final removal to present-day Oklahoma, many Cherokees relocated to present-day Arkansas, Missouri and Texas.  Between 1775 and 1786 the Cherokee, along with people of other nations such as the Choctaw and Chickasaw, began voluntarily settling along the Arkansas and Red Rivers.In 1802, the federal government promised to extinguish Indian titles to lands claimed by Georgia in return for Georgia's cession of the western lands that became Alabama and Mississippi. To convince the Cherokee to move voluntarily in 1815, the US government established a Cherokee Reservation in Arkansas. The reservation boundaries extended from north of the Arkansas River to the southern bank of the White River. Di'wali (The Bowl), Sequoyah, Spring Frog and Tatsi (Dutch) and their bands settled there. These Cherokees became known as \"Old Settlers.\"\nThe Cherokee, eventually, migrated as far north as the Missouri Bootheel by 1816.  They lived interspersed among the Delawares and Shawnees of that area.  The Cherokee in Missouri Territory increased rapidly in population, from 1,000 to 6,000 over the next year (1816\u20131817), according to reports by Governor William Clark.  Increased conflicts with the Osage Nation led to the Battle of Claremore Mound and the eventual establishment of Fort Smith between Cherokee and Osage communities. In the Treaty of St. Louis (1825), the Osage were made to \"cede and relinquish to the United States, all their right, title, interest, and claim, to lands lying within the State of Missouri and Territory of Arkansas ...\" to make room for the Cherokee and the Mashcoux, Muscogee Creeks. As late as the winter of 1838, Cherokee and Creek living in the Missouri and Arkansas areas petitioned the War Department to remove the Osage from the area.A group of Cherokee traditionalists led by Di'wali moved to Spanish Texas in 1819. Settling near Nacogdoches, they were welcomed by Mexican authorities as potential allies against Anglo-American colonists. The Texas Cherokees were mostly neutral during the Texas War of Independence.  In 1836, they signed a treaty with Texas President Sam Houston, an adopted member of the Cherokee tribe. His successor Mirabeau Lamar sent militia to evict them in 1839.\n\n\n===== Trail of Tears =====\n\nFollowing the War of 1812, and the concurrent Red Stick War, the U.S. government persuaded several groups of Cherokee to a voluntary removal to the Arkansaw Territory.  These were the \n\"Old Settlers\", the first of the Cherokee to make their way to what would eventually become Indian Territory (modern day Oklahoma).  This effort was headed by Indian Agent Return J. Meigs, and was finalized with the signing of the Jackson and McMinn Treaty, giving the Old Settlers undisputed title to the lands designated for their use.During this time, Georgia focused on removing the Cherokee's neighbors, the Lower Creek.  Georgia Governor George Troup and his cousin William McIntosh, chief of the Lower Creek, signed the Treaty of Indian Springs in 1825, ceding the last Muscogee (Creek) lands claimed by Georgia.  The state's northwestern border reached the Chattahoochee, the border of the Cherokee Nation.  In 1829, gold was discovered at Dahlonega, on Cherokee land claimed by Georgia.  The Georgia Gold Rush was the first in U.S. history, and state officials demanded that the federal government expel the Cherokee.  When Andrew Jackson was inaugurated as President in 1829, Georgia gained a strong ally in Washington.  In 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, authorizing the forcible relocation of American Indians east of the Mississippi to a new Indian Territory.\nJackson claimed the removal policy was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing extinction as a people, which he considered the fate that \"...the Mohegan, the Narragansett, and the Delaware\" had suffered.  There is, however, ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting to modern farming techniques.  A modern analysis shows that the area was in general in a state of economic surplus and could have accommodated both the Cherokee and new settlers.The Cherokee brought their grievances to a US judicial review that set a precedent in Indian country.  John Ross traveled to Washington, D.C., and won support from National Republican Party leaders Henry Clay and Daniel Webster. Samuel Worcester campaigned on behalf of the Cherokee in New England, where their cause was taken up by Ralph Waldo Emerson (see Emerson's 1838 letter to Martin Van Buren). In June 1830, a delegation led by Chief Ross defended Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia.\nIn 1831 Georgia militia arrested Samuel Worcester for residing on Indian lands without a state permit, imprisoning him in Milledgeville.  In Worcester v. Georgia (1832), the US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall ruled that American Indian nations were \"distinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights,\" and entitled to federal protection from the actions of state governments that infringed on their sovereignty. Worcester v. Georgia is considered one of the most important dicta in law dealing with Native Americans.\nJackson ignored the Supreme Court's ruling, as he needed to conciliate Southern sectionalism during the era of the Nullification Crisis. His landslide reelection in 1832 emboldened calls for Cherokee removal. Georgia sold Cherokee lands to its citizens in a Land Lottery, and the state militia occupied New Echota.  The Cherokee National Council, led by John Ross, fled to Red Clay, a remote valley north of Georgia's land claim. Ross had the support of Cherokee traditionalists, who could not imagine removal from their ancestral lands.\n\nA small group known as the \"Ridge Party\" or the \"Treaty Party\" saw relocation as inevitable and believed the Cherokee Nation needed to make the best deal to preserve their rights in Indian Territory. Led by Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot, they represented the Cherokee elite, whose homes, plantations and businesses were confiscated, or under threat of being taken by white squatters with Georgia land-titles. With capital to acquire new lands, they were more inclined to accept relocation. On December 29, 1835, the \"Ridge Party\" signed the Treaty of New Echota, stipulating terms and conditions for the removal of the Cherokee Nation. In return for their lands, the Cherokee were promised a large tract in the Indian Territory, $5 million, and $300,000 for improvements on their new lands.John Ross gathered over 15,000 signatures for a petition to the U.S. Senate, insisting that the treaty was invalid because it did not have the support of the majority of the Cherokee people.  The Senate passed the Treaty of New Echota by a one-vote margin.  It was enacted into law in May 1836.Two years later President Martin Van Buren ordered 7,000 Federal troops and state militia under General Winfield Scott into Cherokee lands to evict the tribe. Over 16,000 Cherokee were forcibly relocated westward to Indian Territory in 1838\u20131839, a migration known as the Trail of Tears or in Cherokee \u13c5\u13be \u13d3\u13a4\u13b3 \u13e8\u13f1 or Nvna Daula Tsvyi (The Trail Where They Cried), although it is described by another word Tlo-va-sa (The Removal). Marched over 800 miles (1,300 km) across Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas, the people suffered from disease, exposure and starvation, and as many as 4,000 died. As some Cherokees were slaveholders, they took enslaved African Americans with them west of the Mississippi. Intermarried European Americans and missionaries also walked the Trail of Tears. Ross preserved a vestige of independence by negotiating permission for the Cherokee to conduct their own removal under U.S. supervision.In keeping with the tribe's \"blood law\" that prescribed the death penalty for Cherokee who sold lands, Ross's son arranged the murder of the leaders of the \"Treaty Party\". On June 22, 1839, a party of twenty-five Ross supporters assassinated Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot.  The party included Daniel Colston, John Vann, Archibald, James and Joseph Spear. Boudinot's brother Stand Watie fought and survived that day, escaping to Arkansas.\nIn 1827, Sequoyah had led a delegation of Old Settlers to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the exchange of Arkansas land for land in Indian Territory. After the Trail of Tears, he helped mediate divisions between the Old Settlers and the rival factions of the more recent arrivals. In 1839, as President of the Western Cherokee, Sequoyah signed an Act of Union with John Ross that reunited the two groups of the Cherokee Nation.\n\n\n===== Eastern Band =====\n\nThe Cherokee living along the Oconaluftee River in the Great Smoky Mountains were the most conservative and isolated from European\u2013American settlements. They rejected the reforms of the Cherokee Nation.  When the Cherokee government ceded all territory east of the Little Tennessee River to North Carolina in 1819, they withdrew from the Nation. William Holland Thomas, a white store owner and state legislator from Jackson County, North Carolina, helped over 600 Cherokee from Qualla Town obtain North Carolina citizenship, which exempted them from forced removal. Over 400 Cherokee either hid from Federal troops in the remote Snowbird Mountains, under the leadership of Tsali (\u13e3\u13b5), or belonged to the former Valley Towns area around the Cheoah River who negotiated with the state government to stay in North Carolina. An additional 400 Cherokee stayed on reserves in Southeast Tennessee, North Georgia, and Northeast Alabama, as citizens of their respective states.  They were mostly mixed-race and Cherokee women married to white men. Together, these groups were the ancestors of the federally recognized Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and some of the state-recognized tribes in surrounding states.\n\n\n==== Civil War ====\n\nThe American Civil War was devastating for both East and Western Cherokee. The Eastern Band, aided by William Thomas, became the Thomas Legion of Cherokee Indians and Highlanders, fighting for the Confederacy in the American Civil War. Cherokee in Indian Territory divided into Union and Confederate factions, with most supporting the Confederacy.\nStand Watie, the leader of the Ridge Party, raised a regiment for Confederate service in 1861. John Ross, who had reluctantly agreed to ally with the Confederacy, was captured by Federal troops in 1862. He lived in a self-imposed exile in Philadelphia, supporting the Union. In the Indian Territory, the national council of those who supported the Union voted to abolish slavery in the Cherokee Nation in 1863, but they were not the majority slaveholders and the vote had little effect on those supporting the Confederacy.\nWatie was elected Principal Chief of the pro-Confederacy majority. A master of hit-and-run cavalry tactics, Watie fought those Cherokee loyal to John Ross and Federal troops in Indian Territory and Arkansas, capturing Union supply trains and steamboats, and saving a Confederate army by covering their retreat after the Battle of Pea Ridge in March 1862. He became a Brigadier General of the Confederate States; the only other American Indian to hold the rank in the American Civil War was Ely S. Parker with the Union Army.  On June 25, 1865, two months after Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox, Stand Watie became the last Confederate General to stand down.\n\n\n==== Reconstruction and late 19th century ====\n\nAfter the Civil War, the U.S. government required the Cherokee Nation to sign a new treaty, because of its alliance with the Confederacy. The U.S. required the 1866 Treaty to provide for the emancipation of all Cherokee slaves, and full citizenship to all Cherokee freedmen and all African Americans who chose to continue to reside within tribal lands, so that they \"shall have all the rights of native Cherokees.\" Both before and after the Civil War, some Cherokee intermarried or had relationships with African Americans, just as they had with whites. Many Cherokee Freedmen have been active politically within the tribe.\nThe US government also acquired easement rights to the western part of the territory, which became the Oklahoma Territory, for the construction of railroads. Development and settlers followed the railroads. By the late 19th century, the government believed that Native Americans would be better off if each family owned its own land. The Dawes Act of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land into individual household allotments. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. The U.S. government counted the remainder of tribal land as \"surplus\" and sold it to non-Cherokee individuals.\nThe Curtis Act of 1898 dismantled tribal governments, courts, schools, and other civic institutions. For Indian Territory, this meant abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as a combined state. In 1905, the Five Civilized Tribes of the Indian Territory proposed the creation of the State of Sequoyah as one to be exclusively Native American, but failed to gain support in Washington, D.C.. In 1907, the Oklahoma and Indian Territories entered the union as the state of Oklahoma.\n\nBy the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokee were laboring under the constraints of a segregated society. In the aftermath of Reconstruction, conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively disenfranchise all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed Jim Crow laws that divided society into \"white\" and \"colored\", mostly to control freedmen. Cherokee and other Native Americans were classified on the colored side and suffered the same racial segregation and disenfranchisement as former slaves. They also often lost their historical documentation for identification as Indians, when the Southern states classified them as colored.  Blacks and Native Americans would not have their constitutional rights as U.S. citizens enforced until after the Civil Rights Movement secured passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, and the federal government began to monitor voter registration and elections, as well as other programs.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Cultural institutions ===\nThe Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual, Inc., of Cherokee, North Carolina is the oldest continuing Native American art co-operative. They were founded in 1946 to provide a venue for traditional Eastern Band Cherokee artists. The Museum of the Cherokee Indian, also in Cherokee, displays permanent and changing exhibits, houses archives and collections important to Cherokee history, and sponsors cultural groups, such as the Warriors of the AniKituhwa dance group.In 2007, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians entered into a partnership with Southwestern Community College and Western Carolina University to create the Oconaluftee Institute for Cultural Arts (OICA), to emphasize native art and culture in traditional fine arts education, thus preserving traditional art forms and encouraging exploration of contemporary ideas. Located in Cherokee, OICA offered an associate's degree program. In August 2010, OICA acquired a letterpress and had the Cherokee syllabary recast to begin printing one-of-a-kind fine art books and prints in the Cherokee language. In 2012, the Fine Art degree program at OICA was incorporated into Southwestern Community College and moved to the SCC Swain Center, where it continues to operate.The Cherokee Heritage Center, of Park Hill, Oklahoma hosts a reproduction of an ancient Cherokee Village, Adams Rural Village (including 19th-century buildings), Nofire Farms, and the Cherokee Family Research Center for genealogy. The Cherokee Heritage Center also houses the Cherokee National Archives. Both the Cherokee Nation (of Oklahoma) and the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee, as well as other tribes, contribute funding to the CHC.\n\n\n=== Marriage ===\nBefore the 19th century, polygamy was common among the Cherokee, especially by elite men. The matrilineal culture meant that women controlled property, such as their dwellings, and their children were considered born into their mother's clan, where they gained hereditary status.  Advancement to leadership positions was generally subject to approval by the women elders.  In addition, the society was matrifocal; customarily, a married couple lived with or near the woman's family, so she could be aided by her female relatives.  Her oldest brother was a more important mentor to her sons than was their father, who belonged to another clan. Traditionally, couples, particularly women, can divorce freely.It was unusual for a Cherokee man to marry a European-American woman.  The children of such a union were disadvantaged, as they would not belong to the nation.  They would be born outside the clans and traditionally were not considered Cherokee citizens. This is because of the matrilineal aspect of Cherokee culture. As the Cherokee began to adopt some elements of European-American culture in the early 19th century, they sent elite young men, such as John Ridge and Elias Boudinot to American schools for education. After Ridge had married a European-American woman from Connecticut and Boudinot was engaged to another, the Cherokee Council in 1825 passed a law making children of such unions full citizens of the tribe, as if their mothers were Cherokee. This was a way to protect the families of men expected to be leaders of the tribe.In the late nineteenth century, the U.S. government put new restrictions on marriage between a Cherokee and non-Cherokee, although it was still relatively common. A European-American man could legally marry a Cherokee woman by petitioning the federal court, after gaining approval of ten of her blood relatives.  Once married, the man had status as an \"Intermarried White,\" a member of the Cherokee tribe with restricted rights; for instance, he could not hold any tribal office. He remained a citizen of and under the laws of the United States. Common law marriages were more popular. Such \"Intermarried Whites\" were listed in a separate category on the registers of the Dawes Rolls, prepared for allotment of plots of land to individual households of members of the tribe, in the early twentieth-century federal policy for assimilation of the Native Americans.\n\n\n=== Ethnobotany ===\nSee Cherokee ethnobotany\n\n\n=== Gender roles ===\nMen and women have historically played important yet, at times, different roles in Cherokee society. Historically, these roles have tended to support the idea of a balanced gender binary, with gender determining social and ceremonial roles. Historically, women have primarily been the heads of households, owning the home and the land, farmers of the family's land, and \"mothers\" of the clans. As in many Native American cultures, Cherokee women are honored as life-givers. As givers and nurturers of life via childbirth and the growing of plants, and community leaders as clan mothers, women are traditionally community leaders in Cherokee communities. Some have served as warriors, both historically and in contemporary culture in military service. Cherokee women are regarded as tradition-keepers and responsible for cultural preservation. As a matrilineal society, Cherokee women are expected to be strong members of their communities.\nWhile there is a record of a non-Native traveler in 1825 noticing what he considered to be \"men who assumed the dress and performed the duties of women,\" there is a lack of evidence of what would be considered \"two-spirit\" individuals in Cherokee society, as is generally the case in matriarchal and matrilineal cultures.\nThe redefining of gender roles in Cherokee society first occurred in time period between 1776-1835. This period is demarcated by De Soto exploration and subsequent invasion, was followed by the American Revolution in 1776, and culminated with the signing of Treaty of New Echota in 1835. The purpose of this redefinition was to push European social standards and norms on the Cherokee people. The long\u2014lasting effect of these practices reorganized Cherokee forms of government towards a male dominated society which has affected the nation for generations. Miles identifies white agents as the main culprits in the shifting of Cherokee attitudes toward women\u2019s role in politics and domestic spaces. These \"white agents\" could be identified as white missionaries and white settlers seeking out \"manifest destiny\".  By the time of removal in the mid-1830s, Cherokee men and women had begun to fulfill different roles and expectations as defined by the \"civilization\" program promoted by US presidents Washington and Jefferson. This program included anti-black laws and a loss of autonomy outside of the home both of which were enforced by domestic violence, as domestic violence against women was exacerbated by the promotion of alcohol usage among men in Cherokee society.\n\n\n=== Slavery among the Cherokee ===\n\nSlavery was a component of Cherokee society prior to European contact, as they took captives as slaves. By their oral tradition, the Cherokee viewed slavery as the result of an individual's failure in warfare and as a temporary status, pending release or the slave's adoption into the tribe. In colonial times, the English and later the British purchased or impressed Cherokee as slaves during the period of the Indian Slave Trade in the early 18th century.From the late 1700s to the 1860s, the Five Civilized Tribes in the American Southeast began to adopt some colonial and American customs. Some men acquired separate land and became planters, buying African-American slaves for laborers in field work, domestic service, and various trades. The 1809 census taken by Cherokee agent Colonel Return J. Meigs, Sr. counted 583 \"Negro slaves\" held by Cherokee slaveowners. By 1835, that number increased to 1,592 slaves, with more than seven percent (7.4%) of Cherokee families owning slaves. This was a higher percentage than generally across the South, where about 5% of families owned slaves.Cherokee slaveowners took their slaves with them on the Trail of Tears, the forced removal of Native Americans from their original lands to Indian Territory. Of the Five Civilized Tribes removed to Indian Territory, the Cherokee were the largest tribe and held the most enslaved African Americans. Prominent Cherokee slaveowners included the families of Joseph Lynch, Joseph Vann, Major Ridge, Stand Watie, Elias Boudinot, and Principal Chief John Ross.\nWhile slavery was less common among full-blood Cherokee, because these people tended to live in more isolated settlements away from European-American influence and trade, both full-blood and mixed-blood Cherokee became slaveowners. Among the notable examples of the former is Tarsekayahke, also known by the name \"Shoe Boots\". He participated in the 1793 raid on Morgan's Station, Montgomery County, Kentucky, the last Indian raid in the state. The raiders took as captive Clarinda Allington, a white adolescent girl, and she was adopted into a Cherokee family and assimilated. Shoe Boots later married her and they had children: William, Sarah and John. Shoe Boots fought for the Cherokee in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend during the Creek War.\nAt this time Shoe Boots held two African-American slaves, including Doll, who was about Clarinda's age. Clarinda left, taking their children with her. Afterward, Shoe Boots took Doll as a sexual partner or concubine. He fathered three children with her, whom he named as Elizabeth, Polly and John. The couple essentially had a common-law marriage.\nThe Cherokee tribe had a matrilineal kinship system, by which inheritance and descent were passed on the mother's side; children were considered born into her family and clan. Since these mixed-race children were born to a slave, they inherited Doll's slave status. The Cherokee had adopted this element of slave law common among the slave states in the United States, known as partus sequitur ventrem. For the children to be fully accepted in the tribe, they would ordinarily have had to be adopted by a Cherokee woman and her clan. But on October 20, 1824, Shoe Boots petitioned the Cherokee National Council to grant emancipation for his three children and have them recognized as free Cherokee citizens. Shoe Boots stated in his petition,\n\nThese is the only children I have as Citizens of this Nation, and as the time I may be called to die is uncertain, My desire is to have them as free citizens of this nation. Knowing what property I may have, is to be divided amongst the Best of my friends, how can I think of them having bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh to be called their property, and this by my imprudent conduct, and for them and their offspring to suffer for generations yet unborn, is a thought too great a magnitude for me to remain silent any longer.\nAfter consideration, his request was granted by the Cherokee National Council on November 6, 1824. That year the Council passed a law prohibiting marriage between Cherokee and slaves, or Cherokee and free blacks. But, the following year in 1825, the Council passed a law giving automatic Cherokee citizenship to mixed-race children born to white women and their Cherokee husbands. Gradually more Cherokee men were marrying white women from outside the tribe. The Council wanted to provide a way for the children of these male leaders to be considered members of the tribe. Before this time, mixed-race children had generally been born to Cherokee women and white men, most often traders. Because of the matrilineal kinship system, these children were traditionally considered born to the mother's family and clan, and thus members of the tribe by birth.\nWhile granting his request for emancipation of his children, the Council ordered Shoe Boots to cease his relationship with Doll. But he fathered two more boys with her, twin sons Lewis and William, before his death in 1829. Heirs of his estate later forced these two sons into slavery. His sisters inherited his twin sons as property, and they unsuccessfully petitioned the Council to grant emancipation and citizenship to the twins.The nature of enslavement in Cherokee society in the antebellum years was often similar to that in European-American slave society, with little difference between the two. The Cherokee instituted their own slave code and laws that discriminated against slaves and free blacks. Cherokee law barred intermarriage of Cherokee and blacks, whether the latter were enslaved or free. African Americans who aided slaves were to be punished with 100 lashes on the back. Cherokee society barred those of African descent from holding public office, bearing arms, voting, and owning property. It was illegal for anyone within the limits of the Cherokee Nation to teach blacks to read or write. This law was amended so that the punishment for non-Cherokee citizens teaching blacks was a request for removal from the Cherokee Nation by authorities.After removal to Indian Territory with the Cherokee, enslaved African Americans initiated several revolts and escape attempts, attesting to their desire for freedom. In the Cherokee Slave Revolt of 1842, several African-American slaves in Indian Territory, including 25 held by Cherokee planter Joseph Vann, left their respective plantations near Webbers Falls, Oklahoma to escape to Mexico. The slaves were captured by a Cherokee militia under the command of Captain John Drew of the Cherokee Lighthorse near Fort Gibson. On December 2, 1842, the Cherokee National Council passed \"An Act in regard to Free Negroes\"; it banned all free blacks from the limits of the Cherokee Nation by January 1843, except those freed by Cherokee slaveowners. In 1846, an estimated number of 130-150 African slaves escaped from several plantations in Cherokee territory. Most of the slaves were captured in Seminole territory by a joint group of Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole slaveowners.\n\n\n== Language and writing system ==\n\nThe Cherokee speak a Southern Iroquoian language, which is polysynthetic and is written in a syllabary invented by Sequoyah (\u13cd\u13cf\u13c9\u13ef) in the 1810s. For years, many people wrote transliterated Cherokee or used poorly intercompatible fonts to type out the syllabary. However, since the fairly recent addition of the Cherokee syllables to Unicode, the Cherokee language is experiencing a renaissance in its use on the Internet.\nBecause of the polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language, new and descriptive words in Cherokee are easily constructed to reflect or express modern concepts. Examples include ditiyohihi (\u13d7\u13d8\u13f2\u13af\u13af), which means \"he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose,\" meaning \"attorney.\" Another example is didaniyisgi (\u13d7\u13d3\u13c2\u13f1\u13cd\u13a9) which means \"the final catcher\" or \"he catches them finally and conclusively,\" meaning \"policeman.\"\nMany words, however, have been borrowed from the English language, such as gasoline, which in Cherokee is ga-so-li-ne (\u13a6\u13d0\u13b5\u13c1). Many other words were borrowed from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 20th century. One example relates to a town in Oklahoma named \"Nowata\". The word nowata is a Delaware Indian word for \"welcome\" (more precisely the Delaware word is nu-wi-ta which can mean \"welcome\" or \"friend\" in the Delaware Language). The white settlers of the area used the name \"nowata\" for the township, and local Cherokees, being unaware the word had its origins in the Delaware Language, called the town Amadikanigvnagvna (\u13a0\u13b9\u13d7\u13a7\u13c2\u13ac\u13be\u13ac\u13be)  which means \"the water is all gone from here\", i.e. \"no water\".\nOther examples of borrowed words are kawi (\u13a7\u13eb) for coffee and watsi (\u13e9\u13e5) for watch (which led to utana watsi (\u13a4\u13d4\u13be \u13e9\u13e5) or \"big watch\" for clock).\nThe following table is an example of Cherokee text and its translation:\n\n\n== Treaties and government ==\n\n\n=== Treaties ===\n\nThe Cherokee have participated in at least thirty-six treaties in the past three hundred years.\n\n\n=== Government ===\nAfter being ravaged by smallpox, and feeling pressure from European settlers, the Cherokee adopted a European-American Representative democracy form of government in an effort to retain their lands. They established a governmental system modeled on that of the United States, with an elected principal chief, senate, and house of representatives. On April 10, 1810 the seven Cherokee clans met and began the abolition of blood vengeance by giving the sacred duty to the new Cherokee National government. Clans formally relinquished judicial responsibilities by the 1820s when the Cherokee Supreme Court was established. In 1825, the National Council extended citizenship to the children of Cherokee men married to white women. These ideas were largely incorporated into the 1827 Cherokee constitution. The constitution stated that \"No person who is of negro or mulatto  [sic] parentage, either by the father or mother side, shall be eligible to hold any office of profit, honor or trust under this Government,\" with an exception for, \"negroes and descendants of white and Indian men by negro women who may have been set free.\" This definition to limit rights of multiracial descendants may have been more widely held among the elite than the general population.\n\n\n== Modern Cherokee tribes ==\n\n\n=== Cherokee Nation ===\n\nDuring 1898\u20131906 the federal government dissolved the former Cherokee Nation, to make way for the incorporation of Indian Territory into the new state of Oklahoma. From 1906 to 1975, the structure and function of the tribal government were defunct, except for the purposes of DoI management. In 1975 the tribe drafted a constitution, which they ratified on June 26, 1976, and the tribe received federal recognition. In 1999, the CN changed or added several provisions to its constitution, among them the designation of the tribe to be \"Cherokee Nation,\" dropping \"of Oklahoma.\" According to a statement by BIA head Larry Echo Hawk the Cherokee Nation is not the historical Cherokee tribe but instead a \"successor in interest.\"  The attorney of the Cherokee Nation has stated that they intend to appeal this decision.The modern Cherokee Nation, in recent times, has experienced an almost unprecedented expansion in economic growth, equality, and prosperity for its citizens. The Cherokee Nation, under the leadership of Principal Chief Bill John Baker, has significant business, corporate, real estate, and agricultural interests. The CN controls Cherokee Nation Entertainment, Cherokee Nation Industries, and Cherokee Nation Businesses. CNI is a very large defense contractor that creates thousands of jobs in eastern Oklahoma for Cherokee citizens.\nThe CN has constructed health clinics throughout Oklahoma, contributed to community development programs, built roads and bridges, constructed learning facilities and universities for its citizens, instilled the practice of Gadugi and self-reliance in its citizens, revitalized language immersion programs for its children and youth, and is a powerful and positive economic and political force in Eastern Oklahoma.\nThe CN hosts the Cherokee National Holiday on Labor Day weekend each year, and 80,000 to 90,000 Cherokee Citizens travel to Tahlequah, Oklahoma, for the festivities. It publishes the Cherokee Phoenix, the tribal newspaper, published in both English and the Sequoyah syllabary. The Cherokee Nation council appropriates money for historic foundations concerned with the preservation of Cherokee Culture.\nThe Cherokee Nation supports the Cherokee Nation Film Festivals in Tahlequah, Oklahoma and participates in the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah.\n\n\n=== Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians ===\n\nThe Eastern Band of the Cherokee Indians in North Carolina, led by Chief Richard Sneed,\nhosts over a million visitors a year to cultural attractions of the 100-square-mile (260 km2) sovereign nation. The reservation, the \"Qualla Boundary\", has a population of over 8,000 Cherokee, primarily direct descendants of Indians who managed to avoid \"The Trail of Tears\".\nAttractions include the Oconaluftee Indian Village, Museum of the Cherokee Indian, and the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual. Founded in 1946, the Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual is country's oldest and foremost Native American crafts cooperative. The outdoor drama Unto These Hills, which debuted in 1950, recently broke record attendance sales. Together with Harrah's Cherokee Casino and Hotel, Cherokee Indian Hospital and Cherokee Boys Club, the tribe generated $78 million dollars in the local economy in 2005.\n\n\n=== United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians ===\n\nThe United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians formed their government under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 and gained federal recognition in 1946. Enrollment into the tribe is limited to people with a quarter or more of Cherokee blood. Many members of the UKB are descended from Old Settlers \u2013 Cherokees who moved to Arkansas and Indian Territory before the Trail of Tears. Of the 12,000 people enrolled in the tribe, 11,000 live in Oklahoma. Their chief is Joe Bunch. The UKB operate a tribal casino, bingo hall, smokeshop, fuel outlets, truck stop, and gallery that showcases art and crafts made by tribal members. The tribe issues their own tribal vehicle tags.\n\n\n=== Relations among the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes ===\nThe Cherokee Nation participates in numerous joint programs with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. It also participates in cultural exchange programs and joint Tribal Council meetings involving councilors from both Cherokee Tribes. These are held to address issues affecting all of the Cherokee People.\nThe administrations of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians and the Cherokee Nation have a somewhat adversarial relationship. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians interacts with the Cherokee Nation in a unified spirit of Gadugi.The United Keetoowah Band tribal council unanimously passed a resolution to approach the Cherokee Nation for a joint council meeting between the two Nations, as a means of \"offering the olive branch\", in the words of the UKB Council. While a date was set for the meeting between members of the Cherokee Nation Council and UKB representative, Former Chief of the Cherokee Nation Chad Smith vetoed the meeting.174 years after the Trail of Tears on July 12, 2012 the leaders of the three separate Cherokee Communities met in North Carolina.\n\n\n== Contemporary settlement ==\nCherokees are most concentrated in Oklahoma and North Carolina, but some reside in the US West Coast, due to economic migrations caused by the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression, job availability during the Second World War, and the Federal Indian Relocation program during the 1950s\u20131960s. Cherokees constitute over 2% of population of three largely rural communities in California\u2013Covelo, Hayfork and San Miguel, one town in Oregon and one town in Arizona. Destinations for Cherokee diaspora included multi-ethnic/racial urban centers of California (i.e. the Greater Los Angeles and SF Bay areas), and they usually live in farming communities, by military bases and other Indian reservations.\n\n\n== Membership controversies ==\n\n\n=== Tribal recognition and membership ===\n\nThe three Cherokee tribes have differing requirements for enrollment. The Cherokee Nation determines enrollment by lineal descent from Cherokees listed on the Dawes Rolls and has no minimum blood quantum requirement. Currently, descendants of the Dawes Cherokee Freedman rolls are members of the tribe, pending court decisions. The Cherokee Nation includes numerous members who have African-American, Latino American, Asian American, European-American, and other ancestry. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-sixteenth Cherokee blood quantum (genealogical descent, equivalent to one great-great-grandparent) and an ancestor on the Baker Roll. The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-quarter Keetoowah Cherokee blood quantum (equivalent to one grandparent), and the UKB does not allow members that have relinquished their membership to re-enroll in the UKB.In 2000 the U.S. census reported 875,276 people self-identified as Cherokee Indian; however, only 316,049 people were enrolled in the federally recognized Cherokee tribes.\nOver 200 groups claim to be Cherokee nations, tribes, or bands. Cherokee Nation spokesman Mike Miller has suggested that some groups, which he calls Cherokee Heritage Groups, are encouraged. Others, however, are controversial for their attempts to gain economically through their claims to be Cherokee. The three federally recognized groups assert themselves as the only groups having the legal right to present themselves as Cherokee Indian Tribes and only their enrolled members as Cherokee.One exception to this may be the Texas Cherokees. Before 1975, they were considered a part of the Cherokee Nation, as reflected in briefs filed before the Indian Claims Commission. At one time W.W. Keeler served not only as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, but at the same time held the position as Chairman of the Texas Cherokee and Associated Bands (TCAB) Executive Committee.\nFollowing the adoption of the Cherokee constitution in 1976, TCAB descendants whose ancestors had remained a part of the physical Mount Tabor Community in Rusk County, Texas were excluded from citizenship. Their ancestors did not appear on the Final Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes, registered under the Dawes Commission. However, most if not all TCAB descendants did have an ancestor listed on either the Guion-Miller or Old settler rolls.\nWhile most Mount Tabor residents returned to the Cherokee Nation following the death of John Ross in 1866, today there is a sizable group that is well documented but outside that body. It is not actively seeking a status clarification. They do have treaty rights going back to the Treaty of Bird's Fort. From the end of the Civil War until 1975, they were associated with the Cherokee Nation. The TCAB formed as a political organization in 1871 led by William Penn Adair and Clement Neely Vann. Descendants of the Texas Cherokees and the Mount Tabor Community joined together to try to gain redress from treaty violations, stemming from the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836. Today, most Mount Tabor descendants are in fact members of the Cherokee Nation. Only some 800 are stuck in limbo without status as Cherokees. Many of them still reside in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas.\nOther remnant populations continue to exist throughout the Southeast United States and individually in the states surrounding Oklahoma. Many of these people trace descent from persons enumerated on official rolls such as the Guion-Miller, Drennan, Mullay and Henderson Rolls, among others. Other descendants trace their heritage through the treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government which gave individual allotments to Cherokees.  State recognized Tribes require varying levels of genealogical proof that applicants are of Cherokee descent. Current enrollment guidelines of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma have been approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Such facts were pointed out by Cherokee citizens of CN during the Constitutional Convention held to ratify a new governing document. The document that was eventually ratified by a small portion of the electorate. However, the tribe does not have the power to change its membership procedures and maintain federal recognition. Any changes to the tribe's enrollment procedures must be approved by the Department of Interior. Under 25 CFR 83 the Office of Federal Acknowledgment is required to first apply its own anthropological, genealogical, and historical research methods to any request for change by the tribe. It then forwards its recommendations to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs for consideration.\n\n\n=== Cherokee Freedmen ===\n\nThe Cherokee freedmen, descendants of African American slaves owned by citizens of the Cherokee Nation during the Antebellum Period, were first guaranteed Cherokee citizenship under a treaty with the United States in 1866. This was in the wake of the American Civil War, when the U.S. emancipated slaves and passed US constitutional amendments granting freedmen citizenship in the United States.\nIn 1988, the federal court in the Freedmen case of Nero v. Cherokee Nation held that Cherokees could decide citizenship requirements and exclude freedmen. On March 7, 2006, the Cherokee Nation Judicial Appeal Tribunal ruled that the Cherokee Freedmen were eligible for Cherokee citizenship. This ruling proved controversial; while the Cherokee Freedman had historically been recorded as \"citizens\" of the Cherokee Nation at least since 1866 and the later Dawes Commission Land Rolls, the ruling \"did not limit membership to people possessing Cherokee blood\". This ruling was consistent with the 1975 Constitution of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, in its acceptance of the Cherokee Freedmen on the basis of historical citizenship, rather than documented blood relation.\nOn March 3, 2007, a constitutional amendment was passed by a Cherokee vote limiting citizenship to Cherokees on the Dawes Rolls for those listed as Cherokee by blood on the Dawes roll, which did not include partial Cherokee descendants of slaves, Shawnee and Delaware. The Cherokee Freedmen had 90 days to appeal this amendment vote which disenfranchised them from Cherokee citizenship and file appeal within the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council, which is currently pending in Nash, et al. v. Cherokee Nation Registrar. On May 14, 2007, the Cherokee Freedmen were reinstated as citizens of the Cherokee Nation by the Cherokee Nation Tribal Courts through a temporary order and temporary injunction until the court reached its final decision.  On January 14, 2011, the tribal district court ruled that the 2007 constitutional amendment was invalid because it conflicted with the 1866 treaty guaranteeing the Freedmen's rights.\n\n\n== Notable historical Cherokee people ==\nThis includes only Cherokee documented in history.

        "wiki": "The Smith Avenue High Bridge or the High Bridge is an inverted arch bridge that carries Minnesota State Highway 149 and Smith Avenue over the Mississippi River in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States.  It was built and opened in 1987 at a cost of $20 million.  The bridge carries two lanes of street traffic over the river and is the highest bridge in St. Paul, with a deck height of 160 ft (49 m) and a clearance below of 149 ft (45 m).The current bridge replaced a 2,770-foot (840 m) iron Warren deck truss bridge constructed in 1889.  In 1904 the original bridge was partially destroyed by a tornado or severe storm and the southernmost five spans had to be rebuilt.  With modest alterations it served for nearly a century, but in 1977 an inspection found irreparable structural deficiencies.  The Minnesota Department of Transportation enacted a weight restriction on the bridge until it was closed in 1984 and demolished in 1985.  The ornamental ironwork on the replacement was built using iron from the old bridge.  The first bridge had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981 and was delisted in 1988.\nIn February 2008, City Pages, a weekly publication in the Twin Cities, published a feature about the long history of suicide at the bridge.  The article included testimony of a survivor who leapt from the bridge.The bridge closed September 2017 for a redecking project. It reopened to traffic the afternoon of November 21, 2018.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of crossings of the Upper Mississippi River\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Smith Avenue High Bridge (1987) at Wikimedia Commons\n Media related to Smith Avenue High Bridge (1889) at Wikimedia Commons\nHistoric American Engineering Record: Smith Avenue High Bridge",

        "wiki": "The Thomas Irvine Dodge Nature Center, founded in 1967, is a nonprofit organization in Minnesota. The center's properties are West St. Paul, Mendota Heights and Cottage Grove and contain nature preserves, community gardens, a working model farm, a nature education-based preschool, a raptor center and a bee aviary. Its revenue streams and program offerings have grown over the years. The center's 40 educational programs serve over 50,000 visitors annually with the help of 1,400 volunteers and approximately 20 paid staff.\n\n\n== History ==\nOlivia Irvine Dodge was a philanthropist who donated the land for Dodge Nature Center and formed the nonprofit which operates it. In the 1970s she invited school programs to the nature center to have gardening plots. Dodge installed a model farm, a greenhouse, and also provided training resources. The center mainly hosted school trips, birding sessions, and nature classes. Dodge said, \"We believe in teaching and engendering in our young a love and reverence for nature\".\n\n\n== Nature preserve ==\nAfter Dodge observed that the area around her in West St. Paul was becoming developed, she decided to preserve some of the land for the public. \"A nature center seemed, and still does, the wisest way to use the land\u2014save it, respect it, and use it to teach children\", she said. Volunteer naturalists were invited starting in 1977 to lead structured training programs for school children. Animals on the preserve have included pigs, sheep, cattle, and horses, many of which were kept on site through old age .Over the years the center has fostered close cooperation with local schools. In 2013 an additional donation of land in Cottage Grove expanded its facilities, bringing the total amount of land to over 400 acres and eight miles of trails. The center also offers various outdoor summer events at the amphitheater at the West St. Paul location. The Olivia Irvine Dodge Library and History Center was added as part of the organization's 50th-anniversary celebration in 2017.\n\n\n== Nature Preschool ==\nIn the late 1990s the center's board of directors decided to create an on-site preschool. The Dodge Nature Center Preschool opened in September 2000 in a three-classroom building designed for that purpose.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBray, Ashley (February 26, 2012). \"'Changing the face of education, Dodge Nature Center hopes to fuel a movement to change the way early education is done',\". \u201cStarTribune\u201d. p.

        "wiki": "St Paul's Cathedral is an Anglican cathedral in London, United Kingdom, which, as the cathedral of the Bishop of London, serves as the mother church of the Diocese of London. It sits on Ludgate Hill at the highest point of the City of London and is a Grade I listed building. Its dedication to Paul the Apostle dates back to the original church on this site, founded in AD 604. The present cathedral, dating from the late 17th century, was designed in the English Baroque style by Sir Christopher Wren. Its construction, completed in Wren's lifetime, was part of a major rebuilding programme in the City after the Great Fire of London. The earlier Gothic cathedral (Old St Paul's Cathedral), largely destroyed in the Great Fire, was a central focus for medieval and early modern London, including Paul's walk and St Paul's Churchyard being the site of St Paul's Cross.\nThe cathedral is one of the most famous and most recognisable sights of London. Its dome, framed by the spires of Wren's City churches, has dominated the skyline for over 300 years. At 365 feet (111 m) high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1963. The dome remains among the highest in the world. St Paul's is the second-largest church building in area in the United Kingdom after Liverpool Cathedral.\nServices held at St Paul's have included the funerals of Admiral Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher; jubilee celebrations for Queen Victoria; peace services marking the end of the First and Second World Wars; the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer; the launch of the Festival of Britain; and the thanksgiving services for the Silver, Golden and Diamond Jubilees and the 80th and 90th birthdays of Queen Elizabeth II. St Paul's Cathedral is the central subject of much promotional material, as well as of images of the dome surrounded by the smoke and fire of the Blitz.The cathedral is a working church with hourly prayer and daily services. The tourist entry fee at the door is \u00a320 for adults (August 2020, cheaper online), but no charge is made to worshippers attending advertised services.The nearest station is St. Pauls which is 0.12 KM (2 min) away from St Paul's Cathedral.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Norman cathedral ===\nBede records that in AD 604 Augustine of Canterbury consecrated Mellitus as the first bishop to the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the East Saxons and their king, S\u00e6berht. S\u00e6berht's uncle and overlord, \u00c6thelberht, king of Kent, built a church dedicated to St Paul in London, as the seat of the new bishop. It is assumed, although not proved, that this first Anglo-Saxon cathedral stood on the same site as the later medieval and the present cathedrals. \nOn the death of S\u00e6berht in about 616, his pagan sons expelled Mellitus from London, and the East Saxons reverted to paganism. The fate of the first cathedral building is unknown. Christianity was restored among the East Saxons in the late 7th century and it is presumed that either the Anglo-Saxon cathedral was restored or a new building erected as the seat of bishops such as Cedd, Wine and Earconwald, the last of whom was buried in the cathedral in 693. This building, or a successor, was destroyed by fire in 962, but rebuilt in the same year.King \u00c6thelred the Unready was buried in the cathedral on his death in 1016; the tomb is now lost. The cathedral was burnt, with much of the city, in a fire in 1087, as recorded in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.\n\n\n=== Cathedral or temple before 604 AD? ===\nThere is evidence for Christianity in London during the Roman period, but no firm evidence for the location of churches or a cathedral.  London is said to have sent 2 delegates to the Council of Arles in 314 AD.\nA list of the 16 \"archbishops\" of London was recorded by Jocelyn of Furness in the 12th century, claiming London's Christian community was founded in the 2nd century under the legendary King Lucius and his missionary saints Fagan, Deruvian, Elvanus and Medwin. None of that is considered credible by modern historians but, although the surviving text is problematic, either Bishop Restitutus or Adelphius at the 314 Council of Arles seems to have come from Londinium.The location of Londinium's original cathedral is unknown.  But legend and medieval tradition claims it was St Peter upon Cornhill. St Paul is an unusual attribution for a cathedral, and suggests there was another one in the Roman period.  Legends of St Lucius link St Peter upon Cornhill as the centre of the Roman Londinium Christian community. It stands upon the highest point in the area of old Londinium, and it was given pre-eminence in medieval procession on account of the legends.  There is, however, no other reliable evidence and the location of the site on the Forum makes it difficult for it to fit the legendary stories.  In 1995, a large 5th-century building on Tower Hill was excavated, and has been claimed as a Roman basilica, possibly a cathedral, although this is speculative.  The Elizabethan antiquarian William Camden argued that a temple to the goddess Diana had stood during Roman times on the site occupied by the medieval St Paul's Cathedral. Wren reported that he had found no trace of any such temple during the works to build the new cathedral after the Great Fire, and Camden's hypothesis is no longer accepted by modern archaeologists.\n\n\n=== Old St Paul's ===\n\nThe fourth St Paul's, generally referred to as Old St Paul's, was begun by the Normans after the 1087 fire. A further fire in 1135 disrupted the work, and the new cathedral was not consecrated until 1240. During the period of construction, the style of architecture had changed from Romanesque to Gothic and this was reflected in the pointed arches and larger windows of the upper parts and East End of the building. The Gothic ribbed vault was constructed, like that of York Minster, of wood rather than stone, which affected the ultimate fate of the building.\n\nAn enlargement programme commenced in 1256. This \"New Work\" was consecrated in 1300 but not complete until 1314. During the later Medieval period St Paul's was exceeded in length only by the Abbey Church of Cluny and in the height of its spire only by Lincoln Cathedral and St. Mary's Church, Stralsund. Excavations by Francis Penrose in 1878 showed that it was 585 feet (178 m) long and 100 feet (30 m) wide (290 feet or 87 m across the transepts and crossing). The spire was about 489 feet (149 m) in height.By the 16th century the building was starting to decay. The English Reformation under Henry VIII and Edward VI, and particularly the Chantries Acts led to the destruction of elements of the interior ornamentation and the chapels, shrines, chantries. In October 1538, an image of St Erkenwald, probably from the shrine, was delivered to the master of the king\u2019s jewels. Other images may have survived, at least for a time. More systematic iconoclasm happened in the reign of Edward VI; the Grey Friar\u2019s Chronicle reports that the rood and other images were destroyed in November 1547, and \"Alle the alteres and chappelles in alle Powlles churche\" were taken down in October 1552. Some of the buildings in St Paul's Churchyard were sold as shops and rental properties, especially to printers and booksellers. In 1561 the spire was destroyed by lightning, an event that Roman Catholics writers claimed was a sign of God's judgement on England's Protestant rulers. Bishop James Pilkington preached a sermon in response, claiming that the lightning strike was a judgement for the irreverent use of the cathedral building. Immediate steps were taken to repair the damage, and the citizens of London and the clergy offering money to support the rebuilding. But the cost of repairing the building properly was too great for a country and city recovering from a trade depression. Instead, the roof was repaired and a timber \"roo\"\u2019 put on the steeple.\nIn the 1630s a west front was added to the building by England's first classical architect, Inigo Jones. There was much defacing and mistreatment of the building by Parliamentarian forces during the Civil War, and the old documents and charters were dispersed and destroyed. During the Commonwealth, those churchyard buildings that were razed supplied ready-dressed building material for construction projects, such as the Lord Protector's city palace, Somerset House. Crowds were drawn to the north-east corner of the churchyard, St Paul's Cross, where open-air preaching took place.In the Great Fire of London of 1666, Old St Paul's was gutted. While it might have been possible to reconstruct it, a decision was taken to build a new cathedral in a modern style. This course of action had been proposed even before the fire.\n\n\n=== Present St Paul's ===\n\nThe task of designing a replacement structure was officially assigned to Sir Christopher Wren on 30 July 1669. He had previously been put in charge of the rebuilding of churches to replace those lost in the Great Fire. More than 50 City churches are attributable to Wren. Concurrent with designing St Paul's, Wren was engaged in the production of his five Tracts on Architecture.Wren had begun advising on the repair of the Old St Paul's in 1661, five years before the fire in 1666. The proposed work included renovations to interior and exterior to complement the classical facade designed by Inigo Jones in 1630.  Wren planned to replace the dilapidated tower with a dome, using the existing structure as a scaffold. He produced a drawing of the proposed dome which shows his idea that it should span nave and aisles at the crossing. After the Fire, it was at first thought possible to retain a substantial part of the old cathedral, but ultimately the entire structure was demolished in the early 1670s.\nIn July 1668 Dean William Sancroft wrote to Wren that he was charged by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in agreement with the Bishops of London and Oxford, to design a new cathedral that was \"Handsome and noble to all the ends of it and to the reputation of the City and the nation\". The design process took several years, but a design was finally settled and attached to a royal warrant, with the proviso that Wren was permitted to make any further changes that he deemed necessary. The result was the present St Paul's Cathedral, still the second largest church in Britain, with a dome proclaimed as the finest in the world. The building was financed by a tax on coal, and was completed within its architect's lifetime with many of the major contractors engaged for the duration.\nThe \"topping out\" of the cathedral (when the final stone was placed on the lantern) took place on 26 October 1708, performed by Wren's son Christopher Jr and the son of one of the masons. The cathedral was declared officially complete by Parliament on 25 December 1711 (Christmas Day). In fact, construction continued for several years after that, with the statues on the roof added in the 1720s. In 1716 the total costs amounted to \u00a31,095,556 (\u00a3165 million in 2019).\n\n\n==== Consecration ====\nOn 2 December 1697, 31 years and 3 months after the Great Fire destroyed Old St Paul's, the new cathedral was consecrated for use. The Right Reverend Henry Compton, Bishop of London, preached the sermon. It was based on the text of Psalm 122, \"I was glad when they said unto me: Let us go into the house of the Lord.\" The first regular service was held on the following Sunday.\nOpinions of Wren's cathedral differed, with some loving it: \"Without, within, below, above, the eye / Is filled with unrestrained delight\", while others hated it: \"There was an air of Popery about the gilded capitals, the heavy arches ... They were unfamiliar, un-English ...\".\n\n\n=== Since 1900 ===\n\n\n==== War damage ====\n\nThe cathedral survived the Blitz although struck by bombs on 10 October 1940 and 17 April 1941. The first strike destroyed the high altar, while the second strike on the north transept left a hole in the floor above the crypt. The latter bomb is believed to have detonated in the upper interior above the north transept and the force was sufficient to shift the entire dome laterally by a small amount.On 12 September 1940 a time-delayed bomb that had struck the cathedral was successfully defused and removed by a bomb disposal detachment of Royal Engineers under the command of Temporary Lieutenant Robert Davies. Had this bomb detonated, it would have totally destroyed the cathedral; it left a 100-foot (30 m) crater when later remotely detonated in a secure location. As a result of this action, Davies and Sapper George Cameron Wylie were each awarded the George Cross. Davies' George Cross and other medals are on display at the Imperial War Museum, London.\nOne of the best known images of London during the war was a photograph of St Paul's taken on 29 December 1940 during the \"Second Great Fire of London\" by photographer Herbert Mason, from the roof of a building in Tudor Street showing the cathedral shrouded in smoke. Lisa Jardine of Queen Mary, University of London, has written:\nWreathed in billowing smoke, amidst the chaos and destruction of war, the pale dome stands proud and glorious\u2014indomitable. At the height of that air-raid, Sir Winston Churchill telephoned the Guildhall to insist that all fire-fighting resources be directed at St Paul's. The cathedral must be saved, he said, damage to the fabric would sap the morale of the country.\n\n\n==== Post-war ====\nOn 29 July 1981, the wedding of Prince Charles and Princess Diana was held at the cathedral.\n\n\n==== Restoration ====\nExtensive copper, lead and slate renovation work was carried out on the Dome in 1996 by John B. Chambers. A 15-year restoration project\u2014one of the largest ever undertaken in the UK\u2014was completed on 15 June 2011.\n\n\n==== Occupy London ====\nIn October 2011 an anti-capitalism Occupy London encampment was established in front of the cathedral, after failing to gain access to the London Stock Exchange at Paternoster Square nearby. The cathedral's finances were affected by the ensuing closure. It was claimed that the cathedral was losing revenue of \u00a320,000 per day. Canon Chancellor Giles Fraser resigned, asserting his view that \"evicting the anti-capitalist activists would constitute violence in the name of the Church\". The Dean of St Paul's, the Right Revd Graeme Knowles, then resigned too. The encampment was evicted at the end of February 2012, by court order and without violence, as a result of legal action by the City Corporation.\n\n\n==== 2019 terrorist plot ====\n10 October 2019 Safiyya Shaikh, a Muslim convert, was arrested following an MI5 and Metropolitan Police investigation. In September 2019, she had taken photos of the cathedral's interior. While trying to radicalise others using the Telegram messaging software, she planned to attack the cathedral and other targets such as a hotel and a train station using explosives. Shaikh pleaded guility and was sentenced to 14 years in prison.\n\n\n== Ministry and functions ==\nSt Paul's Cathedral is a busy church with four or five services every day, including Matins, Eucharist and Evening Prayer or Choral Evensong In addition, the cathedral has many special services associated with the City of London, its corporation, guilds and institutions. The cathedral, as the largest church in London, also has a role in many state functions such as the service celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The cathedral is generally open daily to tourists and has a regular programme of organ recitals and other performances. The Bishop of London is Sarah Mullally, whose appointment was announced in December 2017 and whose enthronement took place in May 2018.\n\n\n=== Dean and chapter ===\nThe cathedral chapter is currently composed of seven individuals: the dean, three residentiary canons (one of whom is, exceptionally, lay), one \"additional member of chapter and canon non-residentiary\" (ordained), and two lay canons. Each has a different responsibility in the running of the cathedral. As of February 2020:\nDean \u2014 David Ison (since 25 May 2012)\nPrecentor \u2014 James Milne (since 9 May 2019)\nTreasurer \u2014 Jonathan Brewster (since July 2017) is responsible for finance and for the cathedral building.\nChancellor \u2014 Paula Gooder (since 9 May 2019; lay reader since 23 February 2019)\nAdditional member of chapter and canon non-residentiary \u2014 Sheila Watson (since January 2017).\nLay canon \u2014 Pamela (Pim) Jane Baxter (since March 2014). Also Deputy Director at the National Portrait Gallery, with experience in opera, theatre and the visual arts.\nLay canon \u2014 Sheila Nicoll (October 2018). She is also Head of Public Policy at Schroder Investment Management.\n\n\n=== Registrar ===\nThe registrar, Emma Davies from September 2015, is the cathedral's principal administrator and lay officer, and assists the cathedral chapter in its work, overseeing more than 150 full-time staff, together with volunteers.  She is a solicitor and was a senior civil servant prior to her appointment.\n\n\n=== Minor canons and priest vicar ===\n\n\n=== Director of Music ===\nThe Director of Music is Andrew Carwood.  Carwood was appointed to succeed Malcolm Archer as Director of Music, taking up the post in September 2007. He is the first non-organist to hold the post since the 12th century.\n\n\n==== Organs ====\nAn organ was commissioned from Bernard Smith in 1694.In 1862 the organ from the Panopticon of Science and Art (the Panopticon Organ) was installed in a gallery over the south transept door.The Grand Organ was completed in 1872, and the Panopticon Organ moved to the Victoria Rooms in Clifton in 1873.\nThe Grand Organ is the fifth-largest in Great Britain, in terms of number of pipes (7,256), with 5 manuals, 136 ranks of pipes and 137 stops, principally enclosed in an impressive case designed in Wren's workshop and decorated by Grinling Gibbons.Details of the organ can be found online at the National Pipe Organ Register.\n\n\n==== Choir ====\nSt Paul's Cathedral has a full professional choir, which sings regularly at services. The earliest records of the choir date from 1127. The present choir consist of up to 30 boy choristers, eight probationers and the vicars choral, 12 professional singers. In February 2017 the cathedral announced the appointment of the first female vicar choral, Carris Jones (a mezzo-soprano), to take up the role in September 2017.During school terms the choir sings Evensong six times per week, the service on Mondays being sung by a visiting choir (or occasionally said) and that on Thursdays being sung by the vicars choral alone. On Sundays the choir also sings at Mattins and the 11:30 am Eucharist.Many distinguished musicians have been organists, choir masters and choristers at St Paul's Cathedral, including the composers John Redford, Thomas Morley, John Blow, Jeremiah Clarke, Maurice Greene and John Stainer, while well-known performers have included Alfred Deller, John Shirley-Quirk and Anthony Way as well as the conductors Charles Groves and Paul Hillier and the poet Walter de la Mare.\n\n\n== Wren's cathedral ==\n\n\n=== Development of the design ===\n\nIn designing St Paul's, Christopher Wren had to meet many challenges. He had to create a fitting cathedral to replace Old St Paul's, as a place of worship and as a landmark within the City of London. He had to satisfy the requirements of the church and the tastes of a royal patron, as well as respecting the essentially medieval tradition of English church building which developed to accommodate the liturgy. Wren was familiar with contemporary Renaissance and Baroque trends in Italian architecture and had visited France, where he studied the work of Fran\u00e7ois Mansart.\nWren's design developed through five general stages. The first survives only as a single drawing and part of a model. The scheme (usually called the First Model Design) appears to have consisted of a circular domed vestibule (possibly based on the Pantheon in Rome) and a rectangular church of basilica form. The plan may have been influenced by the Temple Church. It was rejected because it was not thought \"stately enough\". Wren's second design was a Greek cross, which was thought by the clerics not to fulfil the requirements of Anglican liturgy.Wren's third design is embodied in the \"Great Model\" of 1673. The model, made of oak and plaster, cost over \u00a3500 (approximately \u00a332,000 today) and is over 13 feet (4 m) tall and 21 feet (6 m) long. This design retained the form of the Greek-Cross design but extended it with a nave. His critics, members of a committee commissioned to rebuild the church, and clergy decried the design as too dissimilar to other English churches to suggest any continuity within the Church of England. Another problem was that the entire design would have to be completed all at once because of the eight central piers that supported the dome, instead of being completed in stages and opened for use before construction finished, as was customary. The Great Model was Wren's favourite design; he thought it a reflection of Renaissance beauty. After the Great Model, Wren resolved not to make further models and not to expose his drawings publicly, which he found did nothing but \"lose time, and subject [his] business many times, to incompetent judges\". The Great Model survives and is housed within the cathedral itself.\nWren's fourth design is known as the Warrant design because it received a Royal warrant for the rebuilding. In this design Wren sought to reconcile Gothic, the predominant style of English churches, to a \"better manner of architecture\". It has the longitudinal Latin Cross plan of a medieval cathedral. It is of \u200b1 1\u20442 storeys and has classical porticos at the west and transept ends, influenced by Inigo Jones\u2019s addition to Old St Paul's. It is roofed at the crossing by a wide shallow dome supporting a drum with a second cupola, from which rises a spire of seven diminishing stages. Vaughan Hart has suggested that influence in the design of the spire may have been drawn from the oriental pagoda. Not used at St Paul's, the concept was applied in the spire of St Bride's, Fleet Street. This plan was rotated slightly on its site so that it aligned, not with true east, but with sunrise on Easter of the year construction began. This small change in configuration was informed by Wren's knowledge of astronomy.\n\n\n=== Final design ===\nThe final design as built differs substantially from the official Warrant design. Wren received permission from the king to make \"ornamental changes\" to the submitted design, and Wren took great advantage of this. Many of these changes were made over the course of the thirty years as the church was constructed, and the most significant was to the dome: \"He raised another structure over the first cupola, a cone of brick, so as to support a stone lantern of an elegant figure ... And he covered and hid out of sight the brick cone with another cupola of timber and lead; and between this and the cone are easy stairs that ascend to the lantern\" (Christopher Wren, son of Sir Christopher Wren). The final design was strongly rooted in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The saucer domes over the nave were inspired by Fran\u00e7ois Mansart's Church of the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, which Wren had seen during a trip to Paris in 1665.The date of the laying of the first stone of the cathedral is disputed. One contemporary account says it was 21 June 1675, another 25 June and a third on 28 June. There is, however, general agreement that it was laid in June 1675. Edward Strong later claimed it was laid by his elder brother, Thomas Strong, one of the two master stonemasons appointed by Wren at the beginning of the work.\n\n\n=== Structural engineering ===\n\nWren's challenge was to construct a large cathedral on the relatively weak clay soil of London. St Paul's is unusual among cathedrals in that there is a crypt, the largest in Europe, under the entire building rather than just under the eastern end.  The crypt serves a structural purpose. Although it is extensive, half the space of the crypt is taken up by massive piers which spread the weight of the much slimmer piers of the church above. While the towers and domes of most cathedrals are supported on four piers, Wren designed the dome of St Paul's to be supported on eight, achieving a broader distribution of weight at the level of the foundations.  The foundations settled as the building progressed, and Wren made structural changes in response.One of the design problems that confronted Wren was to create a landmark dome, tall enough to visually replace the lost tower of St Paul's, while at the same time appearing visually satisfying when viewed from inside the building. Wren planned a double-shelled dome, as at St Peter's Basilica.  His solution to the visual problem was to separate the heights of the inner and outer dome to a much greater extent than had been done by Michelangelo at St Peter's, drafting both as catenary curves, rather than as hemispheres. Between the inner and outer domes, Wren inserted a brick cone which supports both the timbers of the outer, lead-covered dome and the weight of the ornate stone lantern that rises above it. Both the cone and the inner dome are 18 inches thick and are supported by wrought iron chains at intervals in the brick cone and around the cornice of the peristyle of the inner dome to prevent spreading and cracking.The Warrant Design showed external buttresses on the ground floor level. These were not a classical feature and were one of the first elements Wren changed. Instead he made the walls of the cathedral particularly thick to avoid the need for external buttresses altogether. The clerestory and vault are reinforced with flying buttresses, which were added at a relatively late stage in the design to give extra strength. These are concealed behind the screen wall of the upper story, which was added to keep the building's classical style intact, to add sufficient visual mass to balance the appearance of the dome and which, by its weight, counters the thrust of the buttresses on the lower walls.\n\n\n=== Designers, builders and craftsmen ===\nDuring the extensive period of design and rationalisation Wren employed from 1684 Nicholas Hawksmoor as his principal assistant. Between 1696 and 1711 William Dickinson was measuring clerk. Joshua Marshall (until his early death in 1678) and Thomas and his brother Edward Strong were master masons, the latter two working on the construction for its entirety. John Langland was the master carpenter for over thirty years. Grinling Gibbons was the chief sculptor, working in both stone on the building itself, including the pediment of the north portal, and wood on the internal fittings.  The sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber created the pediment of the south transept while Francis Bird was responsible for the relief in the west pediment depicting the Conversion of St Paul, as well as the seven large statues on the west front. The floor was paved by William Dickinson in black and white marble in 1709\u201310 Jean Tijou was responsible for the decorative wrought ironwork of gates and balustrades. The ball and cross on the dome were provided by an armorer, Andrew Niblett.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nSt Paul's Cathedral is built in a restrained Baroque style which represents Wren's rationalisation of the traditions of English medieval cathedrals with the inspiration of Palladio, the classical style of Inigo Jones, the baroque style of 17th century Rome, and the buildings by Mansart and others that he had seen in France. It is particularly in its plan that St Paul's reveals medieval influences.  Like the great medieval cathedrals of York and Winchester, St Paul's is comparatively long for its width, and has strongly projecting transepts. It has much emphasis on its facade, which has been designed to define rather than conceal the form of the building behind it. In plan, the towers jut beyond the width of the aisles as they do at Wells Cathedral. Wren's uncle Matthew Wren was the Bishop of Ely, and, having worked for his uncle, Wren was familiar with the unique octagonal lantern tower over the crossing of Ely Cathedral, which spans the aisles as well as the central nave, unlike the central towers and domes of most churches. Wren adapted this characteristic in designing the dome of St Paul's. In section St Paul's also maintains a medieval form, having the aisles much lower than the nave, and a defined clerestory.\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe most notable exterior feature is the dome, which rises 365 feet (111 m) to the cross at its summit, and dominates views of the City. The height of 365 feet is explained by Wren's interest in astronomy. Until the late 20th century St Paul's was the tallest building on the City skyline, designed to be seen surrounded by the delicate spires of Wren's other city churches. The dome is described by Sir Banister Fletcher as \"probably the finest in Europe\", by Helen Gardner as \"majestic\", and by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as \"one of the most perfect in the world\". Sir John Summerson said that Englishmen and \"even some foreigners\" consider it to be without equal.\n\n\n==== Dome ====\n\nWren drew inspiration from Michelangelo's dome of St Peter's Basilica, and that of Mansart's Church of the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, which he had visited. Unlike those of St Peter's and Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, the dome of St Paul's rises in two clearly defined storeys of masonry, which, together with a lower unadorned footing, equal a height of about 95 feet. From the time of the Greek Cross Design it is clear that Wren favoured a continuous colonnade (peristyle) around the drum of the dome, rather than the arrangement of alternating windows and projecting columns that Michelangelo had used and which had also been employed by Mansart. Summerson suggests that he was influenced by Bramante's \"Tempietto\" in the courtyard of San Pietro in Montorio. In the finished structure, Wren creates a diversity and appearance of strength by placing niches between the columns in every fourth opening.  The peristyle serves to buttress both the inner dome and the brick cone which rises internally to support the lantern.\nAbove the peristyle rises the second stage surrounded by a balustraded balcony called the \"Stone Gallery\". This attic stage is ornamented with alternating pilasters and rectangular windows which are set just below the cornice, creating a sense of lightness. Above this attic rises the dome, covered with lead, and ribbed in accordance with the spacing of the pilasters. It is pierced by eight light wells just below the lantern, but these are barely visible. They allow light to penetrate through openings in the brick cone, which illuminates the interior apex of this shell, partly visible from within the cathedral through the ocular opening of the lower dome.The lantern, like the visible masonry of the dome, rises in stages. The most unusual characteristic of this structure is that it is of square plan, rather than circular or octagonal. The tallest stage takes the form of a tempietto with four columned porticos facing the cardinal points. Its lowest level is surrounded by the \"Golden Gallery\" and its upper level supports a small dome from which rises a cross on a golden ball.  The total weight of the lantern is about 850 tons.\n\n\n==== West front ====\n\nFor the Renaissance architect designing the west front of a large church or cathedral, the universal problem was how to use a facade to unite the high central nave with the lower aisles in a visually harmonious whole. Since Alberti's additions to Santa Maria Novella in Florence, this was usually achieved by the simple expedient of linking the sides to the centre with large brackets. This is the solution that Wren saw employed by Mansart at Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce. Another feature employed by Mansart was a boldly projecting Classical portico with paired columns. Wren faced the additional challenge of incorporating towers into the design, as had been planned at St Peter's Basilica. At St Peter's, Carlo Maderno had solved this problem by constructing a narthex and stretching a huge screen facade across it, differentiated at the centre by a pediment. The towers at St Peter's were not built above the parapet.\nWren's solution was to employ a Classical portico, as at Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce, but rising through two storeys, and supported on paired columns. The remarkable feature here is that the lower story of this portico extends to the full width of the aisles, while the upper section defines the nave that lies behind it. The gaps between the upper stage of the portico and the towers on either side are bridged by a narrow section of wall with an arch-topped window.\nThe towers stand outside the width of the aisles, but screen two chapels located immediately behind them. The lower parts of the towers continue the theme of the outer walls, but are differentiated from them in order to create an appearance of strength. The windows of the lower story are smaller than those of the side walls and are deeply recessed, a visual indication of the thickness of the wall. The paired pilasters at each corner project boldly.\nAbove the main cornice, which unites the towers with the portico and the outer walls, the details are boldly scaled, in order to read well from the street below and from a distance. The towers rise above the cornice from a square block plinth which is plain apart from large oculi, that on the south being filled by the clock, while that on the north is void. The towers are composed of two complementary elements, a central cylinder rising through the tiers in a series of stacked drums, and paired Corinthian columns at the corners, with buttresses above them, which serve to unify the drum shape with the square plinth on which it stands. The entablature above the columns breaks forward over them to express both elements, tying them together in a single horizontal band. The cap, an ogee-shaped dome, supports a gilded pine cone-shaped finial. It is unclear whether the final is pine cone or a pineapple. The website of the trust claims it is a pineapple. The pine cone however is a common motif in religious, especially Christian architecture. This is most prominent at The Courtyard of the Belvedere. It is thus plausible that Christopher Wren based his design on this inspiration. It can also be argued that a pineapple has a crown, while a pine cone doesn't. The ornament final in this work has no crown thus a logical argument can be made for the pine cone over the pineapple inspired design.\nThe transepts each have a semi-circular entrance portico. Wren was inspired in the design by studying engravings of Pietro da Cortona's Baroque facade of Santa Maria della Pace in Rome. These projecting arcs echo the shape of the apse at the eastern end of the building.\n\n\n==== Walls ====\n\nThe building is of two storeys of ashlar masonry, above a basement, and surrounded by a balustrade above the upper cornice. The balustrade was added, against Wren's wishes, in 1718. The internal bays are marked externally by paired pilasters with Corinthian capitals at the lower level and Composite at the upper level. Where the building behind is of only one story (at the aisles of both nave and choir) the upper story of the exterior wall is sham. It serves a dual purpose of supporting the buttresses of the vault, and providing a satisfying appearance when viewed rising above buildings of the height of the 17th-century city. This appearance may still be seen from across the River Thames.\nBetween the pilasters on both levels are windows. Those of the lower storey have semi-circular heads and are surrounded by continuous mouldings of a Roman style, rising to decorative keystones. Beneath each window is a floral swag by Grinling Gibbons, constituting the finest stone carving on the building and some of the greatest architectural sculpture in England. A frieze with similar swags runs in a band below the cornice, tying the arches of the windows and the capitals. The upper windows are of a restrained Classical form, with pediments set on columns, but are blind and contain niches. Beneath these niches, and in the basement level, are small windows with segmental tops, the glazing of which catches the light and visually links them to the large windows of the aisles. The height from ground level to the top of the parapet is approximately 110 feet.\n\n\n==== Fencing ====\nThe original fencing, designed by Wren, was dismantled in the 1870s. The surveyor for the government of Toronto had it shipped to Toronto, where it has since adorned High Park.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nInternally, St Paul's has a nave and choir in each of its three bays. The entrance from the west portico is through a square domed narthex, flanked by chapels: the Chapel of St Dunstan to the north and the Chapel of the Order of St Michael and St George to the south. The nave is 91 feet (28 m) in height and is separated from the aisles by an arcade of piers with attached Corinthian pilasters rising to an entablature. The bays, and therefore the vault compartments, are rectangular, but Wren roofed these spaces with saucer-shaped domes and surrounded the clerestory windows with lunettes. The vaults of the choir are decorated with mosaics by Sir William Blake Richmond.  The dome and the apse of the choir are all approached through wide arches with coffered vaults which contrast with the smooth surface of the domes and punctuate the division between the main spaces. The transepts extend to the north and south of the dome and are called (in this instance) the North Choir and the South Choir.\nThe choir holds the stalls for the clergy, cathedral officers and the choir, and the organ. These wooden fittings, including the pulpit and Bishop's throne, were designed in Wren's office and built by joiners. The carvings are the work of Grinling Gibbons whom Summerson describes as having \"astonishing facility\", suggesting that Gibbons aim was to reproduce popular Dutch flower painting in wood. Jean Tijou, a French metalworker, provided various wrought iron and gilt grilles, gates and balustrades of elaborate design, of which many pieces have now been combined into the gates near the sanctuary.The cathedral is some 574 feet (175 m) in length (including the portico of the Great West Door), of which 223 feet (68 m) is the nave and 167 feet (51 m) is the choir.\nThe width of the nave is 121 feet (37 m) and across the transepts is 246 feet (75 m). The cathedral is slightly shorter but somewhat wider than Old St Paul's.\n\n\n==== Dome ====\n\nThe main internal space of the cathedral is that under the central dome which extends the full width of the nave and aisles. The dome is supported on pendentives rising between eight arches spanning the nave, choir, transepts, and aisles. The eight piers that carry them are not evenly spaced. Wren has maintained an appearance of eight equal spans by inserting segmental arches to carry galleries across the ends of the aisles, and has extended the mouldings of the upper arch to appear equal to the wider arches.Above the keystones of the arches, at 99 feet (30 m) above the floor and 112 feet (34 m) wide, runs a cornice which supports the Whispering Gallery so called because of its acoustic properties: a whisper or low murmur against its wall at any point is audible to a listener with an ear held to the wall at any other point around the gallery. It is reached by 259 steps from ground level.\nThe dome is raised on a tall drum surrounded by pilasters and pierced with windows in groups of three, separated by eight gilded niches containing statues, and repeating the pattern of the peristyle on the exterior. The dome rises above a gilded cornice at 173 feet (53 m) to a height of 214 feet (65 m). Its painted decoration by Sir James Thornhill shows eight scenes from the life of St Paul set in illusionistic architecture which continues the forms of the eight niches of the drum. At the apex of the dome is an oculus inspired by that of the Pantheon in Rome. Through this hole can be seen the decorated inner surface of the cone which supports the lantern. This upper space is lit by the light wells in the outer dome and openings in the brick cone. Engravings of Thornhill's paintings were published in 1720.\n\n\n==== Apse ====\n\nThe eastern apse extends the width of the choir and is the full height of the main arches across choir and nave. It is decorated with mosaics, in keeping with the choir vaults. The original reredos and high altar were destroyed by bombing in 1940. The present high altar and baldacchino  are the work of W. Godfrey Allen and Stephen Dykes Bower. The apse was dedicated in 1958 as the American Memorial Chapel. It was paid for entirely by donations from British people. The Roll of Honour contains the names of more than 28,000 Americans who gave their lives while on their way to, or stationed in, the United Kingdom during the Second World War. It is in front of the chapel's altar. The three windows of the apse date from 1960 and depict themes of service and sacrifice, while the insignia around the edges represent the American states and the US armed forces. The limewood panelling incorporates a rocket\u2014a tribute to America's achievements in space.\n\n\n=== Artworks, tombs and memorials ===\n\nSt Paul's at the time of its completion, was adorned by sculpture in stone and wood, most notably that of Grinling Gibbons, by the paintings in the dome by Thornhill, and by Jean Tijou's elaborate metalwork. It has been further enhanced by Sir William Richmond's mosaics and the fittings by Dykes Bower and Godfrey Allen.  Other artworks in the cathedral include, in the south aisle, William Holman Hunt's copy of his painting The Light of the World, the original of which hangs in Keble College, Oxford. The St. Paul's version was completed with a significant input from Edward Robert Hughes as Hunt was now suffering from glaucoma. In the north choir aisle is a limestone sculpture of the Madonna and Child by Henry Moore, carved in 1943. The crypt contains over 200 memorials and numerous burials. Christopher Wren was the first person to be interred, in 1723. On the wall above his tomb in the crypt is written in Latin: Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice (\"Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you\").\n\nThe largest monument in the cathedral is that to the Duke of Wellington by Alfred Stevens. It stands on the north side of the nave and has on top a statue of Wellington astride his horse \"Copenhagen\". Although the equestrian figure was planned at the outset, objections to the notion of having a horse in the church prevented its installation until 1912. The horse and rider are by John Tweed. The Duke is buried in the crypt.\n\nThe tomb of Horatio, Lord Nelson is located in the crypt, next to that of Wellington. The marble sarcophagus which holds his remains was made for Cardinal Wolsey but not used as the cardinal had fallen from favour. At the eastern end of the crypt is the Chapel of the Order of the British Empire, instigated in 1917, and designed by John Seely, Lord Mottistone. There are many other memorials commemorating the British military, including several lists of servicemen who died in action, the most recent being the Gulf War.\nAlso remembered are Florence Nightingale, J. M. W. Turner, Arthur Sullivan, Hubert Parry, Samuel Johnson, Lawrence of Arabia, William Blake and Sir Alexander Fleming as well as clergy and residents of the local parish. There are lists of the Bishops and cathedral Deans for the last thousand years. One of the most remarkable sculptures is that of the Dean and poet, John Donne. Before his death, Donne posed for his own memorial statue and was depicted by Nicholas Stone as wrapped in a burial shroud, and standing on a funeral urn. The sculpture, carved around 1630, is the only one to have survived the conflagration of 1666 intact.  The treasury is also in the crypt but the cathedral has very few treasures as many have been lost, and on 22 December 1810 a major robbery took almost all of the remaining precious artefacts.The funerals of many notable figures have occurred at the cathedral, including those of Lord Nelson, the Duke of Wellington, Winston Churchill, George Mallory and Margaret Thatcher.\n\n\n=== Clock and bells ===\n\nA clock was installed in the south-west tower by Langley Bradley in 1709 but was worn out by the end of the 19th century. The present mechanism was built in 1893 by Smith of Derby incorporating a design of escapement by Edmund Denison Beckett similar to that used by Edward Dent on Big Ben's mechanism in 1895. The clock mechanism is 19 feet (5.8 m) long and is the most recent of the clocks introduced to St Paul's Cathedral over the centuries. Since 1969 the clock has been electrically wound with equipment designed and installed by Smith of Derby, relieving the clock custodian from the work of cranking up the heavy drive weights.\nThe south-west tower also contains four bells, of which Great Paul, cast in 1881 by Taylor's bell foundry of Loughborough, at 16 1\u20442 long tons (16,800 kg) was the largest bell in the British Isles until the casting of the Olympic Bell for the 2012 London Olympics. Although the bell is traditionally sounded at 1 pm each day, Great Paul has not been rung for several years because of a broken chiming mechanism. While a design has recently been proposed regarding a new mechanism for ringing Great Paul, apparently, no additional progress has been made on the project as of this moment. The clock bells included Great Tom, which was moved from St Stephen's Chapel at the Palace of Westminster and has been recast several times, the last time by Richard Phelps. It chimes the hour and is traditionally tolled on occasions of a death in the royal family, the Bishop of London, or the Lord Mayor of London, although an exception was made at the death of the US president James Garfield. It was last tolled for the death of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, in 2002.\nIn 1717, Richard Phelps cast two more bells that were added as \"quarter jacks\" that ring on the quarter hour. Still in use today, the first weighs 13 long cwt (1,500 lb; 660 kg), is 41 inches (100 cm) in diameter and is tuned to A\u266d; the second weighs 35 long cwt (3,900 lb; 1,800 kg) and is 58 inches (150 cm) in diameter and is tuned to E\u266d.\nThe north-west tower contains a ring of 12 bells by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough hung for change ringing. In January 2018 the bells were removed for refurbishment and were rehung in September that year, being rung again for the first time on All Saints' Day. The original service or \"Communion\" bell dating from 1700 and known as \"the Banger\" is rung before 8 am services.\n\n\n== Education, tourism and the arts ==\n\n\n=== Interpretation Project ===\nThe Interpretation Project is a long-term project concerned with bringing St Paul's to life for all its visitors. In 2010, the Dean and Chapter of St Paul's opened St Paul's Oculus, a 270\u00b0 film experience that brings 1400 years of history to life. Located in the former Treasury in the crypt, the film takes visitors on a journey through the history and daily life of St Paul's Cathedral. Oculus was funded by American Express Company in partnership with the World Monuments Fund, J. P. Morgan, the Garfield Weston Trust for St Paul\u2019s Cathedral, the City of London Endowment Trust and AIG.\nIn 2010, new touchscreen multimedia guides were also launched. These guides are included in the price of admission. Visitors can discover the cathedral\u2019s history, architecture and daily life of a busy working church with these new multimedia guides. They are available in 12 different languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean and British Sign Language (BSL). The guides have fly-through videos of the dome galleries and zoomable close-ups of the ceiling mosaics, painting and photography. Interviews and commentary from experts include the Dean of St Paul\u2019s, conservation team and the Director of Music. Archive film footage includes major services and events from the cathedral's history.\n\n\n==== Charges for sightseers ====\nSt Paul's charges for the admission of those people who are sightseers, rather than worshippers; the charge is \u00a320 (\u00a317 when purchased online). Outside service times, people seeking a quiet place to pray or worship are admitted to St Dunstan's Chapel free of charge. On Sundays people are admitted only for services and concerts and there is no sightseeing. The charge to sightseers is made because St Paul's receives little regular or significant funding from the Crown, the Church of England or the state and relies on the income generated by tourism to allow the building to continue to function as a centre for Christian worship, as well as to cover general maintenance and repair work.\n\n\n=== St Paul's Cathedral Arts Project ===\nThe St Paul\u2019s Cathedral Arts Project explores art and faith. Projects have included installations by Gerry Judah, Antony Gormley, Rebecca Horn, Yoko Ono and Martin Firrell.\nIn 2014, St Paul's commissioned Gerry Judah to create an artwork in the nave to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War. Two spectacular sculptures consisting of three-dimensional white cruciforms reflect the meticulously maintained war graves of northern France and further afield. Each sculpture is also embellished with miniaturised destroyed residential blocks depicting war zones in the Middle East\u2014Syria, Baghdad, Afghanistan\u2014thus connecting 100 years of warfare.Bill Viola has created two altarpieces for permanent display in St Paul's Cathedral. The project commenced production in mid-2009. Following the extensive programme of cleaning and repair of the interior of St Paul's, completed in 2005, Viola was commissioned to create two altarpieces on the themes of Mary and Martyrs. These two multi-screen video installations are permanently located at the end of the Quire aisles, flanking the High Altar of the cathedral and the American Memorial Chapel. Each work employs an arrangement of multiple plasma screen panels configured in a manner similar to historic altarpieces.\nIn summer 2010, St Paul's chose two new works by the British artist Mark Alexander to be hung either side of the nave. Both entitled Red Mannheim, Alexander's large red silkscreens are inspired by the Mannheim Cathedral altarpiece (1739\u201341), which was damaged by bombing in the Second World War. The original sculpture depicts Christ on the cross, surrounded by a familiar retinue of mourners. Rendered in splendid giltwood, with Christ's wracked body sculpted in relief, and the flourishes of flora and incandescent rays from heaven, this masterpiece of the German Rococo is an object of ravishing beauty and intense piety.\nIn March 2010, Flare II, a sculpture by Antony Gormley, was installed in the Geometric Staircase.In 2007, the Dean and Chapter commissioned Martin Firrell to create a major public artwork to mark the 300th anniversary of the topping-out of Wren's building. The Question Mark Inside consisted of digital text projections to the cathedral dome, West Front and inside onto the Whispering Gallery. The text was based on blog contributions by the general public as well as interviews conducted by the artist and on the artist's own views. The project presented a stream of possible answers to the question: \"What makes life meaningful and purposeful, and what does St Paul's mean in that contemporary context?\" The Question Mark Inside opened on 8 November 2008 and ran for eight nights.\n\n\n=== Depictions of St Paul's ===\nSt Paul's Cathedral has been depicted many times in paintings, prints and drawings. Among the well-known artists to have painted it are Canaletto, Turner, Daubigny, Pissarro, Signac, Derain, and Lloyd Rees.\n\nPaintings and engravings of St Paul's\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n==== Photography and film ====\nSt Paul's Cathedral has been the subject of many photographs, most notably the iconic image of the dome surrounded by smoke during the Blitz.(see above)  It has also been used in films and TV programmes (including The Famous Thames Television Ident), either as the focus of the film, as in the episode of Climbing Great Buildings; as a feature of the film, as in Mary Poppins; or as an incidental location such as Wren's Geometric Staircase in the south-west tower which has appeared in several films including Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.\nFilms in which St Paul's has been depicted include:\n\nSt. Paul's Cathedral (1942), a wartime documentary film for the British Council, the final part of which shows bomb damage in and around St Paul's.\nLawrence of Arabia (1962) shows the exterior of the building and the bust of T.E. Lawrence.\nMary Poppins (1964) shows the steps and west front of the cathedral, the main setting for the song '\"Feed the Birds'\".\nSt Paul's Cathedral has appeared as a filming location twice in Doctor Who, in the 1968 serial The Invasion, and in the 2014 two-part story \"Dark Water\"/\"Death in Heaven\". In both, the Cybermen are shown descending steps outside the cathedral.\nSt Paul's is seen briefly in the Goodies episode \"Kitten Kong\" (1971). During his rampage through London, Twinkle damages London landmarks, including St Paul's Cathedral, the dome of which is knocked off.\nIn the BBC educational programme \"A Guide to Armageddon,\" (1982) a 1-megaton nuclear weapon is detonated over London, with St Paul's used as ground zero.\nLifeforce (1985) the cathedral's interior is the setting for the climax of the film.\nThe Madness of King George (1994) shows the Geometric Staircase in the South West Bell Tower.\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) shows the Geometric Staircase in the south west bell tower, representing the staircase towards the Divination classroom.\nIndustrial Revelations: Best of British Engineering \u2014 Buildings, with Rory McGrath series 5, episode 1, 2008, focuses on St Paul's Cathedral.\nSherlock Holmes (2009) shows the North side of the West Steps, and the Geometric Staircase in the South West Bell Tower.\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009); the southern fa\u00e7ade was briefly shown.\nClimbing Great Buildings (2010)\nCars 2 (2011) shows Mater and Lightning McQueen flying past the cathedral on their way to Buckingham Palace.\nStar Trek Into Darkness (2013) depicts St Paul's in 23rd century London along with other notable modern-day London buildings.\nThor: The Dark World (2013) depicts St Paul's as one of several London landmarks that Thor and his enemy, Malekith, fight over during an attack on the city.\nLondon Has Fallen (2016) depicts the cathedral as the scheduled site of the British Prime Minister's funeral.\nPaddington 2 (2017) depicts the cathedral when Phoenix Buchanan is impersonating a nun.\nMission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout (2018) depicts the cathedral as one of the places agent Ethan Hunt runs through as he chases after John Lark\nMortal Engines (2018) depicts the cathedral on top of the traction city London, as well as the location of the superweapon MEDUSA.\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018) shows Newt Scamander meeting Albus Dumbledore atop the cathedral's roof.St Paul's in photography and film\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nCyril Raikes (fire watching on the dome of the St Paul's Cathedral in the Second World War)\nCategory:Burials at St Paul's Cathedral\nList of cathedrals in the United Kingdom\nList of churches and cathedrals of London\nMagnificat and Nunc dimittis for St Paul's Cathedral\nPaternoster Square\nTall buildings in London\nHistory of early modern period domes\nList of tallest domes\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBarker, Felix; Hyde, Ralph (1982), London as it might have been, John Murray\nBBC staff (15 June 2011), St Paul's Cathedral completes \u00a340m restoration project, BBC News, retrieved 23 November 2011\nBBC staff (28 February 2012), St Paul's protest: Occupy London camp evicted, BBC\nBede (1969),  Colgrave, Bertram; Mynors, R.

        "wiki": "\"America's Favorite Architecture\" is a list of buildings and other structures identified as the most popular works of architecture in the United States.\nIn 2006 and 2007, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) sponsored research to identify the most popular works of architecture in the United States. Harris Interactive conducted the study by first polling a sample of the AIA membership and later polling a sample of the public.In the first phase of the study, 2,448 AIA members were interviewed and asked to identify their \"favorite\" structures. Each was asked to name up to 20 structures in each of 15 defined categories. The 248 structures that were named by at least six of the AIA members were then included in a list of structures to be included in the next phase, a survey of the general public. The survey of the public involved a total of 2,214 people, each of whom rated many photographs of buildings and other structures drawn from the list of 248 structures that had been created by polling the architects. The public's preferences were ranked using a \"likeability\" scale developed for the study.As part of the commemoration of the organization's 150th anniversary in 2007, the AIA announced the list of the 150 highest-ranked structures as \"America's Favorite Architecture\". New York City is the location of 32 structures on the list, more than any other place. Of the 10 top-ranked structures, 6 are in Washington, DC, which is the location of 17 of the 150 structures on the complete list. Chicago has 16 structures on the list.\nThe 150 top-ranked structures are listed below.\n\n\n== List of \"America's Favorites\" ==\n\n\n== Criticisms ==\nWhen it was released, critics observed that the list of \"favorites\" did not reflect the judgments of architectural \u201cexperts\u201d. Upon the list's release, AIA president R.K. Stewart acknowledged that the rankings did not represent architects' professional judgments, but instead reflected people's \"emotional connections\" to buildings. Buildings named by critics as being some that architects consider to be highly significant, but that did not achieve top 150 ranking in the public survey, included the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, designed by Louis Kahn; the Inland Steel and John Hancock buildings in Chicago; Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia, designed by Eero Saarinen; and the Seagram Building in New York City, designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. John King of the San Francisco Chronicle pointed out that in 1991 the AIA had named Eero Saarinen's design for Dulles Airport as one of ten \"all-time works of American architects.\" King noted that the public's ratings were based on seeing just one photo of each building, and pointed out that \"There's more to architecture than a picture can convey.\"\n\n\n== Structures ranked below the top 150 ==\nThe 98 buildings that were listed by architects as significant, but did not rank in the top 150 in the public vote, were:\n860\u2013880 Lake Shore Drive Apartments \u2013 Chicago, Illinois\nAmerican Folk Art Museum \u2013 New York City\nArt & Architecture Building \u2013 Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut\nBaker House \u2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts\nBeinecke Rare Book Library \u2013 Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut\nBeth Sholom Synagogue \u2013 Elkins Park, Pennsylvania\nBoston City Hall \u2013 Boston, Massachusetts\nBradbury Building \u2013 Los Angeles, California\nBurton Barr Library \u2013 Phoenix Public Library, Phoenix, Arizona\nCarpenter Center for the Visual Arts \u2013 Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts\nCathedral of Our Lady of the Angels \u2013 Los Angeles\nCathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption \u2013 San Francisco\nCBS Headquarters/ Black Rock \u2013 New York City\nYale Center for British Art/Museum of British Art \u2013 Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut\nChapel/W15 \u2013 Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts\nChapel of St. Ignatius \u2013 Seattle University, Seattle\nCrown Hall \u2013 Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), Chicago\nDallas City Hall \u2013 Dallas, Texas\nDallas-Fort Worth International Airport \u2013 Dallas, Texas\nM.

          "Very small venue with a collection that is not as coherent as I would like from such a small place. The walking patterns are good and there are truly some terrific pieces. The building itself is truly ugly. It is as though the architect took a red brick building and placed",

          "For all the imaginative, glorious splendor that is the external architecture, the inside looks as drab as a common business class hotel. While some of the exhibits in the permanent collection are interesting enough for a 1 hour visit, the true show is the exterior. So, save",

          "1pm every weekend day they have a free tour and the guides are insightful and they can also be easily ditched if it is not your vibe. An amazing fact is that student and staff can RENT art from this museum and a perk of being at the University. Lots of variety, always a twist",

          "The striking architecture alone makes the Weisman worth seeing. It is nicely laid out in a open, naturally lighted galleries. I would call most of the collection modern art - lots of really interesting pieces. And it's free (suggested donation box at the door).",

          "As in most of Gehry's creations, the best part is driving up to the unique architecture. This did not disappoint. Sails afloat in the sky up close. From afar, looks somewhat like a hillside cluster of homes! Very nice collection of contemporary art. Easyily navigated.",

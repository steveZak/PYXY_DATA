          "You can walk there from the Old port in Marseille, the walk takes about 30-45 minutes its definitely some what of a low grade hike with a lot of stairs when you get to the basilica. The view from up top is amazing though and definitely worth the walk up there!",
          "Wonderful view around! The cathedral is beautiful and light. Not easy to get there by foot",
          "The view is incredible and the Basilique is free to visit. The only downside is that it is so high up that it is hard to walk up there, especially in this kind of sunny weather thats why I had to took the bus 60. Highly recommend if you want to take a panoramic photo of Marseille",
          "It has such scenic view overlooking the sea.\nThe only issue I have is the stairs. I was not able to go all the way to the top. \ud83d\ude0d",

          "The basilica is amazing to see inside and out and the architecture is very interesting. But the whole trip up the hill is worth even just for the view which is incredible! Would definitely recommend going",
          "This is a sure site to visit while in marseille. There are several different types of transportation up to the church. When you arrive there is still a short uphill walk to reach the facility. The view is outstanding. Well worth a visit.",

          "The neo-Byzantine style church was built in 1853 and is located on the top of a limestone peak 149 meters above sea level and raised another thirteen meters above due to the foundations of an old fortress that was at the top.

          "There are many reasons to there, to watch a beautiful sunset, to get a panoramic view of the city, to learn a bit about Marseille history, or to pray. Either one is your reason, yo won't be disappointed.",
          "Quite an amazing place; located high above the city on a hill, it has magnificent views of the Marseilles Bay and surrounding areas. It was really windy up there, but well worth taking a walk along the ramparts to see the incredible views. \u2026",
          "The most beautiful place which i visited in my life if we are talking about city view. During sunny day the place is amazing for view on all sides. The Notre-Dame has also breathtaking inner design and giving you opportunity to buy gifts.",
          "If you visit in Marseille, you must see this church. It dominates the highest point overlooking the ocean, old port and the entire city. You can take a little tourist tram up or you can go up walking to the hill. It takes about 20 minutes \u2026",

          "Great panoramic view over Marseille. Good place to take photos.",

          "Amazing basilica. Very bright colours and a lot of naval motifs. \nOn the walls you can see people's graces and thanks for the Notre Dame.  \nThere's a bus from the old port straight to the basilica: it's number 60. It's one of  the cheapest way to get here. Bonus: you have a feel of the streets and beautiful buildings.",

          "Amazing piece of architecture loved the amazing stained glass windows. The views from the top are amazing!",
          "A beautiful basilica with a powerful message... The trust people seek is clearly visible from a force beyond human comprehension! The Notre-Dame De La Garde looks down upon the city of Marseille protecting her ships and people... The people \u2026",

          "If you are not travelling by your own car, there is also a bus. But if you're fond of walking while travelling like myself, my goodness, make sure you don't choose a extremely hot day for an urban hiking or middle of the day when sun is \u2026",
          "Great place to watch the sunset in the evening!",
          "Iconic place in Marseille which you can\u2019t avoid to visit. Magnificent views over the city of Marseille and surroundings. Basilica itself \u2013 very nice, colourful, richly decorated inside \u2013 which is not common for catholic cathedrals.  Bus 60 goes directly to Basilica. Big parking area (for free) located nearby.",

          "A painful walk on a hot day up from the main town is well worth it. The views over the city and the sea are spectacular. The church itself is interesting, but surprisingly small. For me it's the best thing to do as a tourist in Marseilles",
          "If you're not fit, don't try to walk up from the city. We did and I regretted every moment of it. Take the bus or the Petite Train,  they drop you off right to the doors. This is a huge place sitting on a hill, so you have a 360 view of Marseille. What a view it is, you can see the habror. and the promenade very clearly.",

          "Must visit church as part of your trip to Marseille. A fabulous view once you get to the top. I walked up the hill in October with the Mistral blowing at full force and came to the conclusion it would be almost impossible in July and August \u2026",
          "Must see, best views in the city. VERY high up",
          "A must to visit place in Marseille. There are few free car parks near the Basilique. We were here near in the sunset. Unfortunately, the souvenir shop was already closed, even if the Basilique was still open. We did not pay the entrance to \u2026",
          "It\u2019s a must see place if you are at Marseille... it\u2019s one of the oldest church in the south of France located at the peak place of the city of Marseille.\n\nGood time to visit would be during summers from June/July till September. Views from \u2026",

          "It is a beautiful building and very well preserved. It\u2019s a long walk up the hill (and stairs) but it\u2019s worth it. Stats are impressive, especially those related to the number of mosaic tesserae estimated to cover the ceiling of the basilica. A must see!",

          "It\u2019s a bit of a walk all the way to the top but it looks very nice once you are there! Inside not so impressive but with the view its worth a trip.",
          "Well worth the trek up the hill although I'd recommend taking a bus all the little train as it's long and steep. Views over the city are spectacular.",
          "What a truly wonderful visit this turned out to be. It is situated at the top of an extremely steep incline, by design, intended so it can be seen from everywhere surrounding Marseille. Marble, gold leaf, art and sumptuous craftsmanship sums this church up. It is very similar to",

          "Great visit of the church and the crypte and view to the vieux port and the city of Marseille. Notre Dame de la Garde is the one keeping an eye on Marseille citizen and for this one precise reason, when in Marseille it is a one to visit !",
          "One of the tallest place of Marseille with un incredible view on the town. Beautiful establishment full of historical things. Unmissable",
          "Certainly it was hard work for us to climb up to this magnificent church. But it was well worth the physical effort. One could get a bus but that is not the way we do things. The inside of the church is absolutely magnificent and the 360 degree views of Marsaille are stunning.",

          "Really enjoyed the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde. The Basilique is beautiful and the panoramic views are amazing. You can walk to the top from Vieux Port in 25 minutes (safe) with basic fitness or alternatively take the bus 60 in about 15 mins (2 euro each way). You will not",

          "The setting of the Basilica on the highest point in Marseille is great and the panoramic views of the city stunning. Although the interior of the church is impressive the real star is the location. We had no problem parking our vehicle at the site. However, we did visit late",
          "A 20min walk from Le Vieux Port...do this and you won't regret it. Many take the bus but its not too difficult. Go at your own pace to conquer the slope and steps. Views from above are simply breath-taking. Spend a good hour at least for the effort getting there. Its not a big",
          "Best known local landmark the Basilica is worth the hike up here on it's own, but even better are the stunning views in all directions. If you don't fancy the 2.5 km, 40 min and 149m high schlep from the old port take the touristy Petit Train, it's cheap and saves those leg",

          "The view of Marseille is amazing from Notre Dame. Watch for them to open the draw bridge which is the way in and out at some point. There is another way out via stairs. It is well worth the time and effort walk up the hill from Marsielle. One of the tour busses stops at",
          "Going in the church is optional-the real star of the show is the impressive view. That being said, it is definitely a leap of faith to drive up to the top. Not a lot of parking even when it isn't peak tourist season. There is a small train that makes the trip, but we noticed",
          "We walked here from our hotel. I would recommend taking the little train or driving- as the hills are steep and it\u2019s a long walk!! The views of the city and sea are beautiful. There is also a gift shop, bathroom, and cafe. It was worth the walk because of the gorgeous views of",
          "Not been the religious type and more fear of bursting into flames if I went in, I was excited to see the views from up there. We went up on the small train which is a splendid journey seeing other parts of Marseille. Upon arrival you notice how windy it is and the higher you get",
          "I expected this to be way more impressive inside, matching the amazing exterior that towers over Marseille, hence the 4/5. The view is amazing from up there and it's a must visit.",
          "We did not go into the church but the viewsfrom the terraces over Marseille, the docks, the mountains beyond and out to Chateau D\u2019If and the collection of islands were wonderful. The Office de Tourisme recommended walking route is a hike up on foot and a good cardiovascular",

          "Do not miss seeing this gorgeous cathedral whilst in Marseille. The views of the city are incredible along with the wonderful architecture of the cathedral. You can walk up/down the hill to access or you can take the local #60 bus or Petit Train, all very frequent depends on",
          "I agree, some (not most) of Marseille's populace is catholic, for them \"La Bonne Mere\" (the good mother) is a symbol as Marseille's protector. However, a lot of other people don't think the same and here come a lot of disputes. Concerning the building - nice cathedral, on the",

          "This is a must do when in Marseille. A 360 degree platform around the Basilique provides amazing view of the entire city of Marseille as well as the Islands and Sea immediately surrounding. Once inside, the amount of detail on the Catheral is inspiring. There is a small",
          "It s a must see. This cathedrale is located on a little high of a mount. Up there u can see MArseille fron the top. Great place to participate in the holly mass on sunday and to benefit from a great view outside",
          "The architecture of this hill top church is fabulous and it provides stunning views over Marseille City. We arrived on the \"hop on hop off bus\" and there was a short climb up a steep hill, but as an alternative there is parking close to the building for those arriving by taxi.",

          "We went to the cathedral at sunset. That alone was beautiful. A wonderful view of the city. I was particularly interested in this cathedral because it is linked with ships and I worked on cruise ships. It has displays of anchors, other ship-related items.",
          "The statue of Our Lady (Notre Dame, known affectionately as the Good Mother) which overlooks the harbour is a key image of Marseille in France. I wasn\u2019t aware of it before I visited but I now see why the towering figure and beautiful church is a must see. It offers the great",

          "First get in shape to start the climb from the Vieux Port to Notre Dame de Bonne Garde. Yes, on foot because that\u2019 s the way to discover Marseille bit by bit, from high to higher. Ans once you get there breath and give your eyes all the pleasure they can absorb. By Mistral",
          "Fantastic 360 degree view of Marseille from top of hill. Church is 19th century in the Byzantine style The interior is a gem and is not over the top. It was worth the trip to Marseille alone !!!!",

          "You can get the little train or 60 bus from the port, but I like the walk up the hill to the cathedral. Great views over the bay from the top. The cathedral is interesting inside - I particularly liked the model boats handing from the ceiling. Entrance is free.",

          "It was quite a schlep to get there and back for what is a very bling, relatively new church atop a very cold and windy hilltop. The cafeteria is pretty bleak and looks like its been taken out from some provincial retirement home. Best admired from afar!",
          "Well worth a visit, use petit train, tourbus or local bus from the quay. If feeling like a challenge it takes about 25 minutes walking mainly uphill but it\u2019s great when you arrive at the top. Beautifully maintained and a lovely peacefulness when inside.",
          "It's a tough uphill climb(good level of fitness required) to get here, but there are hop-on and hop-off tourist transports if you need them. The views over Marseille in every direction are breathtaking and absolutely worth then effort.",

          "Much of the area around the church was closed during the Mistral we had on our visit in September. It was just too windy. Once you can figure out the alternate way to get in, it's beautiful and well worth the visit.",
          "Most everyone visits, as the church is such a famous Marseille landmark, but I was pleasantly surprised by how different this religious building is from most others. The colorful interior, and the tangible and moving tributes covering the walls and hanging from the ceiling are",
          "Having very little time, we took the tourist train from the Vieux Port to the basilica, otherwise we would have walked up the hill as it seemed like a nice stroll. The view of the city seen from the platforms in front of Notre Dame is really cool, with Chateau d'If, the port,",
          "Standing at the top I was absolutely awestruck by the history of the place, where fishermen from the past left offerings of thanks in the form of ships and paintings in the Basilique, and looking down on the city I could really appreciate the changes over the decades. Absolutely",
          "Lovely place with a very stunning view of all of Marseille. Walking to it from the city centre was actually quite nice. Highly recommend visiting.",
          "It's good to take a bus to the hill. It takes 10-15 min to get three, instead od walking more than hour. Beautifull church with amazing view on the whole surrindings of the city.",

          "This basilica sits high on a hilltop overlooking all of Marseille and the harbor. It was built in the 1800's in Byzantine style and features red striped columns and lots of mosaics, mostly gold plated. There is also a tall tower with a gold plated statue of Mary and the baby",

          "The basilique is very beautiful, gold and elegant. The view is very emotional, from the up you can see all Marseille and enjoy the landscape of the city. To go up you need from the city center around 30 minutes and it is a little bit hard and wearisome, anyway, there are also",

          "We had hoped to take the Petite Train up to church however because it had been threatening rain it was not running. We took the #60 bus that was so packed that every bump and bend the passengers would scream and laugh. A beautiful view on the cool breezy day",
          "This is a must see in Marseille. You can easily get here on A local bus that will drop you off right in front. The views of Marseille and the sea are incredible. The inside of the church is amazing. Be sure to allow adequate time to enjoy this beautiful place.",

          "Worth the trip to the top for the incredible views, but the cathedral has its own unique beauty as well. Love the Romanesque style of the cathedral. The interior is a beautiful sight. Love the colors and my kids loved the hanging ships. Best way to see Marseille, from a",

          "It is quite a steep way up from the centre but from the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde you will have the most magnificent views over Marseille and across to the islands. The church itself is also beautiful but sadly overrun by tourists (us included). It should still be a place",
          "Long flight of stairs but what a stunning view of and from the church. Beautiful site to visit! We were here in April 2018 and the weather was warm but pleasant. Cute shop with lots of souvenirs to choose from.",
          "This neo or revival Byzantine style exists only in name. Nineteenth century pretension is more like it. The hanging models of ships, presumably those lost in the local seas, were interesting. If you must, take the #60 bus from the old port, but don\u2019t expect much.",
          "Strikingly beautiful church which has strong and obvious associations with the maritime community. The view over Marseille is in itself worth the visit but do not miss going into the upper and lower sanctuaries. Do be aware that if your mobility is limited there is an uphill",
          "Very beautiful church (inside and out). The church sits high atop a hill. We used a mini van to access the site. Very narrow and winding streets. Walking to the church may be difficult for many. The views of the city from the church are wonderful. No entrance fees. This is a",

          "One of the most beautiful basilica's I've ever visited. It's a steep climb, but once you get at the top of the hill, you have a great view over Marseille and it's suuroundings. The Basilica is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen due to its interior made of mosaics. Very",

          "We were fortunate is being driven up by coach but I@m not sure how you would get there on your own - taxi maybe. The views from the top are out of this world. You can see how Marseille is bigger in area than Paris, despite being less populated. There are many many steps to climb",

          "We had not planned a visit to the Basilique but thankfully our guide drove us to the top for a phenomenal view. Be prepared for large crowds of people and many steps to see this beautiful church.",
          "The church (known as Bonne Mere) is gorgeous, but there's quite a hike to see it! At least there's a lift for the last few steps; too bad it doesn't go all the way. Still, it is well worth the effort to see this lovely church, and the view of the city is amazing.",
          "These are must views of Marseille and the inside of the church is pretty good. Skip the choo choo train and catch the number 60 bus from the marina. The choo choo provides very average commentary in about 6 languages, so you get nothing of value.",
          "This Basilique is set on a hill giving you a stunning view of the city of Marseille. It is a really beautiful building.",
          "Best tip I could give is for you to take the noddy train up as it is such a huge climb. Lovely Basilica, but have seen much better around the world. Glad I went though",
          "A wonderful building that can be seen nearly all over Marseille. Definitely worth going for the spectacular views when you get to the top. Free to wander around along with car parking but not sure if that\u2019s chargeable. We caught the small land train for \u20ac8.00 each which is a",
          "The 360-degree view from there is really impressive. Since the Middle Ages, Notre-Dame de la Garde is considered as the guardian of seamen and fishermen.",
          "Lovely views of Marseille, seeing for miles, nice and peaceful. A bit of a steep walk up if taking the hop on hop off buss",
          "The basilique has a great deal of charm but the highlight for me was the view of the surrounding area.",
          "Sitting on top of the hill at the port. The walls bear the marks of the Battle of The Liberation of Marseilles, August 1944. Stunning 4 sided views of the port, hillside. Site is free to all and you may enter the Cathedral. There is an elevator if needed and steps are",
          "Best thing is the view. The church is nothing special. And Pickpockets stole our bag inside the church. That made our day :-(",
          "Definitely get to Notre Dame de la Garde and remember, when walking inside you should remove your hat. Also, this has got to be the best view of the entire city as it's on a peak. We took the Petit Train to get there for $9 each.",
          "This basilique sits atop of a hill right next to Vieux Port. You get beautiful sights of the city. The visit is free of charge, and you can get there by riding the bus line 60 that departs from Vieux Port (I looked it up ahead of time but the sign says Notre Dame de la Garde).",
          "In typical European style this cathedral was simply magnificent- a must see in Marseille. Beautiful little side chapels, incredible paintings. Amazing view overlooking Marseille all around. We took the little \u201ctrain\u201d which showed us around the city too enroute to the Notre Dame.",
          "Beautiful. Breath-taking and magnificient. Next to the basilique its spacious and nice place to relax and see the amazing view of Marseille. It is easy to access by bus 60. Little bit crowded.",
          "Nice old building, with great views. We walked up from old port, which didn't take to long. We brought some sandwiches and had an early lunch overlooking the city. it was nice.",
          "You can travel to the church with the public bus or with touristic buses. There you have a fantastic view of Marseille",
          "... but a stunning facade which was well worth seeing close up on a very windy day. The mistral was felt...",
          "Take a bus, walk, or drive there, but it is a must visit in Marseille. At the top you can view the whole city too!",
          "A very nice view from the top deck. The solemn visit inside the Basilica. Enchanting experience inside.",
          "This was amazing we started at the point and walked up the hill- was a hard work but so satisfying when you get to the top and get to see the views! Amazing looking out over the port and sea and back over the beautiful hills. Inside is just as beautiful I love the colours!",
          "We recently went to Marseille for a day and took the Petit Train to the Basilique and it was fantastic! The building is so impressive and I cannot think of many finer Catholic cathedrals anywhere. The building is amazing, but the views of the town were breathtaking. Large",
          "View from the \u201cTop of the world\u201d that shouldn\u2019t be missed...free access and great gift shops. Took some great 360 photos.",
          "It was jaw dropping beautiful the view of the city was breathtaking and the history in the cathedral was amazing",
          "For us the visit at the basilique was mostly to see the lovely view. And the view is realy adorable! We took a train up.",
          "The Notre Dame de la Garde sits above the city of Marseille and is absolutely incredible from near and far. A beautiful sight above the city, it is even more impressive up close. You don't have to be Catholic, or even religious to appreciate the architecture and splendor of the",
          "We've taken the bus, because it's pretty far from the city. The church is up on the hill and road until up is nice. From church's yard you can see a great city panorama that's worth photographed. The church is full of history and it has a unique interior. There is no entry fee,",
          "Situated at he top of the hill, it has great views of the city. With the Petit Train that takes you up and down again, it is easy on the legs too :)",
          "The Basilica of Notre Dame de la Garde is an extravagant neo-Byzantine building dating back to the 19th century. It is a very ornate structure with beautiful mosaics and, at 155m, is built on the highest point of the city providing stunning views over the surrounding city and",
          "Notre-Dame de la Garde Basilica is perched up on Garde Hill at 154 metres. We didn\u2019t have the energy for that sort of climb, so we took bus #60 from Quai des Belges, which is in front of the Vieux Port. The bus stops right near the basilica and takes around 15-20 minutes. The",
          "We took the little train from Vieux Port it was only \u20ac8 each ( children over 11 pay adult price) the train takes you up the hills via the narrow streets of Marseille which is a joy in itself. Then once at Notre Dame De La Garde you get to go into the Cathedral on floor 4 and 6 (",
          "OK - I won't go on about this because if you're visiting Marseille you're bound to visit this imposing church. However, here's a few tips \u2026 Use the little tourist train (8e) for a return trip to the top. It's worth it just to see how the driver gets this long train round the",
          "The church is on top of the highest hill overlooking Marseilles which gives great views over the city. It was built in the 1860s and has a very beautiful interior full of Byzantine-style frescoes. Easiest way to visit is to drive to the car park just below the church although",
          "Just visit and see yourselves. Unforgettable emotion and wish to come back to see this place again!!!",
          "The views from the basilica are fantastic of the entire area. We took the hop-on hop-off bus to the basilica. There are a lot of steps to get up to the basilica from where they drop you off, and then more inside the church. Worth the views.",
          "A big big big hiking tour of marseille but totally worth it for the view but mostly for the church itself",
          "Incredible views and jaw dropping interiors. It\u2019s not far from the Old Port - about a mile, but it\u2019s steep and in the summer very hot; we were appreciative of the free water fountains to drink and splash on our faces / heads!",
          "This is a, must do whilst in Marseilles. Take the local bus up there as it is up hill all the way. The views of the Port are spectacular. Amazing photos.",
          "We took the last scheduled city bus up from the old port around 7pm, less than 2 \u20ac per person. Beautiful views in the early evening as the sun moved toward setting. We walked back down in the twilight hour. Highly recommended.",
          "So worth the incredible hike to the top of this attraction. If you are not capable of the walk and stairs there is a bus and train-like thing that do get you much closer (but there are still stairs/hill once you are dropped off). The view of the city is the best part of this",
          "This is Marseille\u2019s famous and magnificent church on a hill, the highest monument in all the city. Once you get up there (you have your options: bus, tourist train, walking, to name a few), you might find that the church is somewhat smaller than you expected when you saw it from",
          "Truly lovely and rich in history. We visited this during a cruise stop in Marseille. The views from Notre Dame were amazing and the beauty of the basilica was breathtaking. Loved learning of the history from our guide.",
          "The coach tour we where on dropped us off & said we had to be back in 20 minutes , so off we went up all the steps in 38 degree heat , But the views where AMAZING and it's a Stunning building , just a shame we didn't get time to go inside . It's the one thing you always see",
          "Located in a place with stunning views, this church cannot be missed. Easy to arrive by a local bus. And it is not just the vies: the church is very pretty (and small), too. As the church can be seen from all over the city, do spend an hour here wondering it.",
          "The drive up was slow, but there was adequate parking. It took much less time than the tram. The church is small and crowded, but the view makes it all worth while!",
          "We used the hop on hop off bus to access the Basilica, but it's still quite a climb to reach it. Don't be put off by the climb for the reward is well worth it. The Basilica is outstanding. Beautiful in its magnificence the internals are breathtaking.",
          "Amazing, beautiful, priceless! If you re at Marseille, your MUST visit Notre Dame de la Garde! To go there, take small train from Marseille port or city tour bus. Don t go by car, parking is very small, and by walk, quite high so difficult for aged people",
          "There are three parkings, the top one for handicapped signs. There are many stories on the walls of this church, many thanks to Mother Mary, many comments about sea and sailors in despair, and the roof is beautiful representing peacocks and boats.",
          "This imposing building, high on top of a hill , is not the city Cathedral, but was apparently built for the spiritual welfare of the many sailors who would depart Marseille on long voyages. It an be reached by a long walk uphill on foot, by bus, or, most enjoyably, by the little",
          "Nothing was planned on our first full day in Marseille. Instead, we followed Anne\u2019s advice to visit the city\u2019s top attraction - the Notre Dame de la Garde. But before we journeyed out to the Basilica, on our way to get coffee, we saw colorful street art and happened upon a",
          "It is on a hill, so you have to put some effort ir going by foot. But it is worth the view: you can see the city and the islands, it is really amazing! Basilique is beautiful inside and outside, it was free to visit.",
          "Do not miss out on this spectacular historical place - 3 hr - very good parking right next to the entrance-",
          "If you\u2019re a bit like my wife and I who like to walk, well to tackle this hill to the top to see the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde is a must. It is a gradual climb from Place Castellane until you get to the point where you know you haven\u2019t got far to climb. Take some water as",
          "Breathtaking from all angles. I must see if you are visiting Marseille. We used the hop on hop off bus to get there. Once there the views are stunning",
          "Simply breathtaking cathedral, overlooking the city, with impressive mosaic ornaments in the inside of the cathedral. The view from the terrace surrounding the church is also stunning!",
          "Breathtaking views of 360 degrees around the church of Marseilles ,If and the island's. It's heavily populated by pickpockets and if tourists videoing and photographing holy sites annoy you don't go. If you are a left footer peaceful if usurious place to light a votive in the",

          "My wife and I went to marseille thinking we may go on an excursion further inland. We decided to stay and ended up going to see the cathedral. It was very beautiful and a great place to walk around. We took the little train at the old pier and for 8 Euros each had round trip",
          "View was amazing . We caught the Sunday service where hundreds of people were inside . Toilet services was bad !",

          "Beautiful and amazing ! you have to go, mandatory visit if you go to Marseille. I recommand to all of you",
          "After a long hot walk (there is a bus!) up from the old port we were rewarded with stunning views and a beautiful( if small) cathedral",

          "Basilique has great views of the city amazing place! Must see while visiting Marseille. Better to take transport, bus or tourist train to go up. 360 views of the city from the top",
          "It was very windy and cold but the view was magnifique and the architecture was amazing, because it was so early there were no buses or trains yet so we had to walk up, definitely worth it but not for the unfit should you chose to do so.",
          "Beautiful building with stunning views. A must see if in Marseille. I wouldn't recommend walking, we took the petite train up there for 8 euros per adult.",
          "This is the iconic view of Marsailles from above and can be seen from miles away. We took a bus up to the top as it would be a long hill in the soaring temperatures. But the cathedral is nothing special - just go up for the view!",
          "Worth the visit. The Basilique itself is not that stunning, but the view and the location are beautiful",
          "Basilique Notre Dame...very beautiful! Located at the top of the hill over Marseille! and I do mean the top! Gorgeous views...and wonderful history.",
          "It is a beautiful basilica. The views inside are nice as well as a view from the top. Nice view of the city. Be prepared to walk. Once you get there, there is a long set bbn of stairs from the parking lot . Then to get to the top and th basilica, more stairs.The elevator is",

          "We came to Marseille from Aix en Provence. Bought a day ticket for public transport in Marseille for 5.20 euros and rode the metro and buses. Notre Dame de la Garde is one of the more notable churches in Nice. You can spot it from almost anywhere in Marseille since it sits on",

          "This is a VERY strenuous walk to the top of the hill. My handicapped parents could not make it. The rest of us were breathing hard. It was well worth it for the view both inside and outside. This unique church has lovely tributes to the sea. There are ships hanging from the",

          "A highlight of the trip, visited during the hop-on-hop-off bus excursion. Very very well-preserved and a quiet and reverent atmosphere despite a large number of visitors. Recommended sight to see.",
          "Awesome view of marseille. And that is quite a view. The church is up a really steep hill so uber or cab up. Easy walk down to the port tho. Church is unremarkable itself tho.",
          "Great place to visit, probably the best thing to see in Marseille. You wont' be disappointed. if you have walking difficulty you will need a ride to the top don't try to walk. Offers a commanding view of the city and harbour. The Basillica is very good to walk around and",
          "This cathedral is totally different from other cathedrals we have seen up to now. The inside and outside is completely opposite from each other. When you stand on the top of the hill on which the cathedral is built, you have a spectacular view and can get very nice photographs",
          "The church is fantastic. The views spectacular. It is a hike from the Hop on Hop off bus stop. There are cabs that get you closer. I don't think our trip to Marseille would have been complete without this stop.",
          "It is a charming place with all area majestic! We went in January when the weather is nice, sunny but windy. Best to go on a weekday if you want to have a more peaceful visit with less people.",
          "The beautiful location on top of a small hill makes this whole visit even more enjoyable. View of the city, Mucem and sea. Big cathedral with moorish influences on the outside is impressive. Inside is also nice, but relatively simple for a church of this size and importance.",
          "My husband and I took a taxi from Vieux Port (the old port) up to the church (less than 10 euros), which meant we didn't have to walk all the way to the tourism office (which is out of the way) to catch the touristic train, which would have cost us 8 euros anyway. You can walk",

          "We took the tram to the Basilique. It is the best way to go as it is a 15 minute ride and you get a great view of the beaches and the beautiful homes on the hill. If you are walking this is a great hike and it is about 4 miles from the port. Casual attire comfortable shoes and",
          "This is a really nice church with great views of the city from the area around the church. Both the inside and the outside of the church are worth viewing. There is a train that does a tour around the area that starts in the harbor area and takes you up and back for a reasonable",

          "The Basilique is easily reachable, either by bus, car or just walking (no more than 30-40 minutes form the old port). It provides 360 degrees of astonishing views of Marseille from the top of the hill. There are benches outside that invite you just to sit there and savor the",
          "This experience was so easy. Lifts to the top. Public toilets within easy reach and no entrance fees. View are fabulous!",

          "we put in a request to see the basilica as a part of our walking tour and did not regret it one bit.The Notre Dame de la Garde can be easily accessible by bus and a short walk a from the port. This basilica is free to enter and this is a must do if you are visiting Marseille as",
          "This is the place to visit weather your religious or not the views are absolutely out of this world !",

          "The Basilica is built on the highest hill overlooking the City, Garde Hill and was constructed on the ruins of an ancient fort. The Basilica was consecrated in 1864. We started our tour by taking the lift to the top, 360 views of the City, the bell tower and golden statue of the",
          "Visited on an extremely hot day in Marseille by the little white train which was by far the best way to do it. The views over Marseille are exceptional and this alone is worth the visit even if visiting Basilicas is not your thing! However the Basilica is very interesting both",
          "Amazing views. Beautiful building. Wouldn\u2019t recommend driving up the hill - we did - although there is parking. Maybe take the petit train next time.",
          "This place was part of our Cruise tour. Fantastic place. You should go inside to get some incredible views. It would be advisable to have a guide to understand the history.",

          "The Notre Dame de la Garde can be easily accessible by nearby metro followed by a short walk and taking the bus number 60 from the port. This basilique is free to enter and this is a must see if you are visiting Marseille as the views cannot be matched anywhere else !",
          "Take a long walk up to this beautiful basilica. It is a fantastic viewpoint for taking in the Marseille area.",
          "Our small tour included this spot. We were grateful that we had been driven up to it as walking would have included an incredibly steep and winding trek. As it is, to go up to the top most area to take in the view of the area, you must walk up many steps. If you can, include",
          "Across from the Panier, on top a hill stands Notre Dame de la Garde, Protector of Marseille and its sailors. There are ship ex votos hanging from the vaults and paintings displayed on the walls. It is a long climb from the harbour but well worth it. Many steps have to be climbed",
          "Well worth seeing but it's situated high up on a hill overlooking the city and harbour. I would recommend taking bus 60 from the old port for 2 euros and walking down to enjoy the experience. The church is rather beautiful inside and you can enter to pray.",
          "Amazing architecture for walking by and pictures, beautiful details showing soldiers, saints, crowns and its on top of a hill so you can see it frok almost anywhere in the city",

          "How on earth did people think on this scale hundreds of years ago? The site is on top of a hill and the scale of the structure is mind blowing. Not to be missed (a number 60 bus goes to the doorstep",

          "I understood immediately why this church has become a symbol of Marseille as soon as I saw it from below. The beautiful 19th-century Romano-Byzantine structure stands atop a 489-feet limestone outcropping at the South side of the city's Old Port. Its exterior features white and",

          "A definite must-see while in Marseille. A beautiful castle-like church atop a hill with views of the entire city & coastline. Take the petit train for an easy ride up the hilly streets. Well worth a visit!",
          "Worth a visit for the views alone. The Little Train takes you much closer to the top. The Hop on Hop Off buses leave you with quite a climb. Still chuckling about the translated commentary on said Train. The gold statue on top of the Cathedral is apparently \"The Virgin and Kid\"!",
          "Standing majestically on a hill top is the beautiful Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde. The imposing Golden Madonna and Child statue at the pinnacle of the structure can be seen from miles away. Take time to go through the chapel and be amazed at the lovely mosaic on the roof and",

          "Must stop when you visit Marseille. The view from this church is breathtaking. The inside of the church is also gorgeous. Take the elevator to the top deck if you don\u2019t want to walk the steps.",
          "Even if you are not looking to visit a church, the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde is a must. It is amazingly constructed and very clean and beautiful. But the best part is the views of Marseilles and the entire region from it. It is atop the hill in the middle of the city and",

          "A truly amazing location, great views and a beautiful architecture and decorations inside. For believers, a spiritual place, a definite must see. Loved the miniature boats hanging for the ceiling!",
          "Oh boy those steps kept us in shape on our weekend away. The crypt and church itself is very pretty but let\u2019s face it, most people who are claiming that hill are going to check the view and it is totally worth it.",
          "built on top of an old look out tower on top of a hill,this great looking building can be seen from miles around.the actual building isn't steeped in history and i think the location is why it is where it is.however,the inside of the basilique is really worth a visit.from here",
          "A nice and outstanding church over a hill, with a beautiful view of the city. You can walk up the hill but it\u2019s a little challenging.",
          "We visited as part of the \u2018Colorbus\u2019 tour. There was quite a steep (but short) path to the church but it was completely worth it. Beautiful views of Marseille and a lovely experience. We visited the Basilique, which was peaceful but stunningly decorated, and the crypt. We were",
          "One can board bus from Vieux Port for the Notre Dame de la Garde. The cathedral also houses a restaurant , a souvenir shop. Do not forget to carry camera/bottled water/umbrella or jacket (depending on weather). But mostly believe that it will be windy due to location at height",
          "As a church this is a powerful place so come as a tourist to see a wonderful building with FAB views of Marseille but come as a believer and it is simply a wonderful church. Shame today that the man in charge of the candles was singularly rude but no doubt God will forgive him.",
          "There are buses and tourist \"trains\" that take people up to the Basilique, but if you are capable, I recommend that you walk up to it. You'll appreciate better the what most worshipers experienced over the history of this trip, and the importance it must have played in their",
          "This church is incredibly beautiful. The inside is poor art and the outside has an outstanding architecture. The view from the town is fantastic. The place is easily accessed by the city centre with the bus. There are not many places too park a car, I would avoid it and take the",
          "Don't walk up catch the number 60 bus to the top from the old port and enjoy stunning views from the church it's very striking inside and out and when you've done walk back down to castellane down steps etc which is signposted all the way which is a nice part of Marseille",
          "Easy access via bus 60 from Vieux-Port. Free entrance into basilique. Fantasy view from hill of marseille city. A must to see in Marseille.",
          "Breathtaking, I\u2019m not religious, but I can see why people give thanks here, for looking after the city,their families, getting saved at sea etc.. writing just does not do it justice.. just go there",
          "This is a must when visiting Marseille. Steep steps to the top but we'll worth while. Make sure you have at least an hour if not longer. Take the hop on hop off bus from hotel deville 15\u20ac for the day. It takes you right to the bottom of the steps.and the cost is nil. .plenty of",
          "Walked up the many steps to this magnificent church which dominates the hill above Marseille. Well worth the walk and the views inside and outside- spectacular.",
          "Quite possibly one of the best views you\u2019ll get of the city, you get a 360 degree of your surroundings, it is worth the walk up the hill and the steps, the cathedral is spectacular both inside and out",
          "Very nice panoranma over the city. It is situated on the top of the mountain and is really worth to go there for the magic view of Marseille. The cathedral itself is rather nice but rather small for the big amount of tourists, so i was more impressed about the nature and view",
          "Lots of different areas to visit inside. Beautiful designs inside the church and the chapel area was beautiful. Small caf\u00e9 inside to have a coffee and tasty pastry.",
          "Le Petite Train took us up through the hills to this beautiful and intricate church. Our Lady of Notre Dame stands high above the city offering protection and solace to its citizens. Even if you don't typically sightsee churches, the views here are worth the time. @ 90 minutes.",
          "Beautiful piece of architecture and stunning views of Marseille - 360 degree views! Must see place in Marseille and some exercising while climbing there",
          "We walked from the vieux port of Marseille up to the notre dame de la Garde, so when we arrived I had done my workout dor the day \ud83d\ude00. We visited on a tuesday in low season, so it was not busy at all and no pickpockets were present. Interesting, well-decorated basilique. Great",
          "Visited here on a sunny winters day and the views were amazing from the top and the Basilica itself was also lovely to look at. Even in the winter it was busy so I can see at the height of summer this place being very hard to walk around. There are a lot of steps so not so easy",
          "What a gorgeous shrine in an amazing location. Panoramic views abound outside while the inside of the basilica pays tribute to the seafaring nature of Marseille.",
          "We saw Notre Dame as part of the E-Bike tour (provence-connection-tours) and it was the best and quickest way to see this fabulous piece of architecture and history! A must visit when visiting Marselle and Provence.",

          "After an arduous walk from the Old Port, we found this beautiful church, perched on a hill overlooking Marseille. The viewpoint offers a nearly 360 degrees view of Marseille surroundings. A great spot for selfie lovers! It\u2019s stunning and well worth the walk.",
          "We took a bus from the old port up to the basilica on our first day in Marseille, and arrived shortly before the gates were closed at 19.00. Fantastic views of the city, and the basilica is beautiful. I remembered the boats hanging from the ceiling from my first visit as a",
          "Amazing view over the old port and the sea combined with the visit of the beautiful Cathedral. Its better to use the bus for the first way up and to walk down by feet to watch the beautiful view."

The park on the top is gorgeous and offers an excellent view on the Old Port of Marseille. One tip: go there at dusk, under a clear weather for awesome colors.",

          "A big museum on Mediterranean culture and history. It also covers other history and interests of painters and activists as well as history of arts on Africa. It has a great view and very very nice rooms. The use of technology in the museum is quite interesting and makes the whole experience immersive.",
          "Great architecture,  interesting exhibits, nothing spectacular in exhibits,  still worth a visit.",
          "I loved it. They have restored the site thoughtfully and the ancient/modern mix is just right. You don't have to go into the exhibits and pay the \u00a320, you can just walk around the fort. Incredible views. Herb garden on top is an interesting feature, Jardin du Migration. Don't miss",

          "Perfect place to visit when in Marseille. The new and modern building fits perfectly in the old and historic area of Marseille. We paid \u20ac9,50 to visit and I would stay that\u2019s a fair price. Besides the expositions you van also walk across the old buildings. A point of improvement; more English translations on the expositions.",
          "Very interesting museum, starting from the architecture, to the permanent exhibition about the history of Mediterranean cities and their present cultural imprint. The temporary exhibition \"on dance\" is really amazing. Don't miss the garden, \u2026",

          "Amazing construction. Is for sure a must see, combining the old with the new and the historical with modern art , this is a place you will remember forever! The buildings itself are a piece of art. There is 2 concrete bridges from 1 build \u2026",

          "I don't recommend this museum. Nothing interesting to see on the exhibitions. Waste of time and money. I am strongly dissatisfied. I would rather just take a walk on the open spaces of the building but then you can't call it museum. Waste of 2 hours of my life and I didn't go on a cruise because of this choice. :(",
          "Charming spot, beautiful thematic expositions, great architecture.",
          "If you are planning on visiting a museum in Marseille, make sure to visit this one! Great museum with interesting exhibits on Marseille. Check for special events- we went for the Night of Museums, and were able to do the museum at night (midnight)! Word of caution- this museum can get busy, so it\u2019s worth buying tickets in advance",

          "Beautiful architecture and well worth visiting the outsides for free, but the museum's exhibits itself are a bit disappointing, especially considering the high entry price. Bar at the top of the new museum is very expensive (\u20ac4.5 coke, \u20ac5.5 wine, \u20ac4 beer and it's awful Heineken), very slow service and they messed up our order.",
          "It was goof place only very confusing inside something to find",
          "The museum layout is confusing at best, has no english translation within the exhibit or the free mobile app. Unless you speak fluent French you must pay extra for the audio recording",

          "Very nice museum with astonishing architecture. Great location at the harbour. Exhibitions were very interesting. Great place to spend up to two days. Quite relaxing and marvellous views. \n4 Stars only because the restaurant is quiet expensive. And a lot of descriptions are ONLY in French.",
          "Very beautiful pattern and architecture",
          "The outside looks like the Borg hive ( if you are a star Trek fan) the inside is a revelation",

          "You can see rhe mix of history and arts presented together. You can also enjoy the beautiful scenery outside the museum",
          "A stunning building and a carefully curated exhibit inside. A near-must for a visit to Marseille.",
          "Only visited the top sun garden that can be reached from fort Saint-Jean on a metallic bridge. This walk gives you an iconic view of the port and the town. The top of the museum was very nice, have free sun beds and a restaurant. Ideal \u2026",
          "Nice view, interesting walk on the fort wall and it's free :D",
          "It's a great place to visit. You can enter the paid area, but it's even wonderful if you just stay outside. You can get nice view of the sea, the port, and the old fortress.",

          "Great museum and beautiful setting. Well worth the visit.",
          "One of the best views to the sea, very good museum. Lots of things to see",
          "Worth a peak and a walk around. Not necessary to pay the additional fee to see the exhibitions, they are a bit underwhelming.",
          "What cool design! Right on the sea! Lovely place to have a tour and see interesting artifacts. Also good place to have a bite or coffee. The place requires a few hours to see everything. I somehow managed to do it within two hours, but I'd recommended having a full afternoon to see things slowly and avoid rushing.",

          "One of my favourite museums. Beautiful to walk around. Great for toddling children and fab exhibitions",
          "As an architectural achievement this is an excellent building, the bridges connecting the old fort and new museum works well as a metaphor for Marseille. The toilet facilities are badly thought out, and there are huge queues on busy days. The exhibition was \u20ac9.50 so we didn't go. The views on the top floor are good.",

The second time I went was for a free night.   It was too crowded so I left without seeing much. Interesting architecture. ",

          "Fantastic museum, but the entire area has been remodelled into a pleasant part of town with caf\u00e9s and shops nearby. The musuem itself is an unassuming work of art, and the collection is quite interesting. A place to visit, for sure.",

          "As a regular museum-goer (I live in Paris), I really believe that MuCem is a combo of nice architecture, scenery, park & greenery, history and art. Even without a ticket, you can stroll through the vicinity, experiencing the labyrinth space of the ancient fort, the newly built",

          "The building itself is worthy of a visit never mind the exhibits. The spaces and walk ways linking it up to the old museum and above all the different views are amazing. When we were there we saw an excellent AinWeiwei exhibition which was a highlight of our Marseille visit.",
          "There is lots to see here, not least the architecture of the building itself. And even if you don't want to spend time looking at exhibits, lunch or a drink on the rooftop provides an amazing view of the bay. There is an engineered walkway to take you back towards the port that",

          "\"Mucem\" is a museum I picked To visit but like many other modern art Museums, there's a lot of space. In part, History - the interesting bit and part \"art\" Based on the theory of Duchamps that Anything can be art (I lack tact).",
          "Great contrasts of modern architecture and the old fort. You can go to the old and new areas for free (during opening hours) and sit in the gardens, courtyards and cafes. The only part I didn't think much of was the permanent exhibition - a very light run through Mediterranean",
          "We really enjoyed our day here - and trust me, you can spend an entire day! They building is magnificent; like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. Various floors, with a wrap around walkway, plus a high walkway over to the old fort. It all was good, but the star of the show was",
          "Stumbled on this place whilst wandering. Entry is free to the outside areas and the area is enough to keep one amused. There is a cafe/restaurant on site with tables and chairs also, some loungers with waiting service. Ideal place for an afternoon at little or no cost.",

          "Amazingly beautiful building done by Rudy Ricciotti, this museum is worth visiting even for the building itself and not only the exhibition taking place at the moment. I've seen a very well curated Ai Weiwei exhibition. The staff was very friendly. There is a large bookstore",
          "great expectations were not confirmed when we visited. Location is fantastic, but architecture is not up to standard to the location. Missed opportunity. The walk around the building to get to the terrace is a \"joke\". So many offices. Our income taxes go to pay all these people",

          "One of Marseille\u2019s most extraordinary attributes, this fort was built in the mid-1600s to defend the entrance to the Port of Marseille. As such, it occupies a beautiful piece of real estate in the city. If you like history, you\u2019ll love this place, but even if you don\u2019t have any",
          "We entered the museum via the old port entrance to the fort. As a disabled person the route took us via a series of lifts and high level walkways with great views over the port and the fort. We had a rest at the outdoor restaurant on the top floor before visiting the",

          "We really enjoyed the permanent exhibition at Mucem call Connectivity. It provides an excellent review of Mediterranean history. We spent several hours here. It cost 7 euros per person (discounts only for EU citizens) but worth it. You can also visit the fort itself. Some",
          "Fantastic place - lots of hidden gems and the Ai Weiwei exhibition was a welcome surprise. Be prepared for lots of walking upstairs but the seats overlooking the port entrance at the top of Des Armes offer a place to catch your breath! Allow at least three hours to cover",
          "Perfect fusion between the old traditional style of the fort and the new modern design. Get their the first time through the top passerel, enjoy the terrasse and the view before wandering on the esplanade. The settings are just awesome... Curation wise, the permanent exhibition",
          "We enjoyed our morning here. It was free and full of amazing citylines for photos. You need to be able bodied here as far as I could tell. Free was a plus too!",
          "It is a beautiful place and there are a huge outdoor space and plenty of exhibitions. It cost 9.50\u20ac, but 5\u20ac if under 25 years old. You will get an amazing view there. The only thing missing is info in english about the exhibitions, since it is mainly in french.",
          "We came to Marseille from Aix en Provence. Bought a day ticket for public transport in Marseille for 5.20 euros and rode the metro and buses. We visited on July 4 and it was pretty hot. We took a bus and arrived to this area. It is next to Fort Saint Jean so visited MuCEM as",
          "We came to Marseille from Aix en Provence. Bought a day ticket for public transport in Marseille for 5.20 euros and rode the metro and buses. We visited on July 4 and it was pretty hot. So if you want to have some shade, bring an umbrella. Entrance to Fort Saint-Jean is free",
          "If you are not into museums, nevertheless don't skip this one. Don't pay for the exhibitions (9,5 euros/person) if you don't like that but enjoy the architecture of it and the way it is connecting the new and the old building. Also, relax at the terrace where you can sit or lay",
          "Nice for the view of the town. Linked to MUCEM so relax at the terrace. It is not huge so you won't spend too much time.",
          "Once a castle, the Mucem is an interesting combination of old and new. A sky bridge links the Mucem to the ultra modern J4 building which currently houses a very interesting exhibit by Ai Weiwei. Also in the J4 building are exhibits of the roots of Mediterranean agriculture",
          "This is a beautiful museum and a lovely fortress; the building is so interesting and the bridge which joins other building is a must to see.",
          "Free entry (as at june 2018), exhibition displays are chargeable Roam the inside of the old fort area, beautifully restored. Walk around the top edge of the fort for fantastic 360 degree views of Marseille. After cross the modern metal bridge to the exhibition area , relax in",
          "Have visited the Mucem a number of times since it opened in 2013, when Marseille was declared the cultural city of Europe for the year. Well displayed, well curated, great place to wander, wonder and learn.",
          "I did not have any great expectations about this place but was pleasantly surprised. It is located within one of the forts at the entrance to the Vieux Port and is a creative combination of old and contemporary architecture. There are views of the sea on one side and the city on",
          "Interesting building and views, but the content was hard to find and badly laid out. This is not a museum, it is an exhibition centre. Go visit the buildings and grounds for free but do not buy a ticket.",
          "This was another attraction on our free morning schedule, but, like the Cathedral, opening time was 11.00am. It dates to 1660, constructed at the direction of Louis XIV and incorporated two existing structures. The fort was severely damaged during WW2 and handed to the Ministry",
          "If you have time its worth going inside. You may need to take ticket to visit inside. Outside the fort you can get some good views.",
          "Nice place in city Center where art meet modern style and history of Mediterranean province. Terasse on top is nice for Chilling. Picasso and Or exhibition worth To be visit.",
          "This museum offers a fantastic variety of things to do. You can take in the latest exhibitions but also enjoy it's overall design and the quirky bridges that link it to the old Fort and beyond.",
          "Don\u2019t get me wrong it is a spectacular building/s however if you go here to see \u2018art\u2019 it is either in very short supply or else it is hidden away somewhere where we did not find it. Very clumsy and no great directions on where to go, was very disappointed having paid 9\u20ac to not",
          "a must visit if you are passing from Marseille, brilliant architecture, fantastic view, interesting exhibitions",
          "Superbly renovated with great style and design. Beautiful place to wander around. Every view is great! The cafe is really good as well. Came back three times over the weekend it is that good.",
          "Fort St Jean is joined to the MuCEM by a bridge and the Panier by another. There was an unusual exhibit tied with Voyages imaginaires : Picasso et les ballets russes, design of costumes and backdrops Picasso did for the Russian ballet. A recent film with excerpts from the",
          "my main reason to visit Marseille was the MuCEM. Its lace like architecture is a pleasure to wander through. The permanent collection houses artifacts from the Mediterranean. A temporary exhibit on gold was the main feature. Some of the pieces shown were known such as Cesar\u2019s",
          "A total disappointment. Blocks of concrete, endless corridors, steep staircases and very few, if any, \"oeuvres d'art.\" A wate of time and money.",
          "Very nice museum and kid friendly. Exhibits were really amazing. Enjoyed Picasso at the Fort which is right across the walkway.",
          "On our one day in Marseille Abbaye Saint-Victor was closed so we headed to Fort Saint-Jean. The fort buildings are free but you need to pay to go into the museum. It was a beautiful sunny afternoon and the water was absolutely sparkling. There were also spring flowers around",
          "Mucem is an amazing museum, we like the combination of new with old, the gardens and the views,it's a must",
          "You must go to the rooftop, enjoy the view on the port, and the 'rade'. Try to tune out the ferry's wheel if you can. And you will also find a nice exhibition. All that downtown! No car or transportation required!",
          "Great view from the Vieux Port, plenty of medieval architecture and interesting exhibition for a very affordable price",
          "Fort St Jean is a bit of a city oasis - within the walls the buzy Marseille outside disappears. It's connected to the MUCEM with a cool bridge. The Tour du Roi Rene provides a superb view over the old harbour and Notre Dame de la Garde! There's nice sunbeds for an afternoon nap,",
          "After hearing so much about the Mucem, I had high hopes, but everything about the museum is really poorly designed. Even though I went in April- not high tourist season- the museum was barely capable of handling the number of people here (and there were not that many of us).",
          "The fort which guards the westernmost side of the entry to the old harbour, is a very impressive construction, and is being kept in an excellent condition we enjoyed walking around and in particular the view from some of the seaward walkways are very impressive We got to the",
          "This is very interesting building with a concrete lacework cubic outer shell over a modern interior Entry at the ground floor is free and their a good quality toilets and a cloakroom Tickets can them be bought to enter the various different galleries, there is a restaurant on",
          "Must do in Marseille, great views of the port, can explore multiple levels and its free of charge. Lovely seating area at the top, walkways to other surrounding areas.",
          "Mucem is one of the best museums in Europe and a traveller or anyone who is in Marseille should visit it. The museum is established to highlight the history of the mediterranean region and culture. The architecture is quite contemporary and refreshing and it uses the older part",
          "great overview of Marseille, nice walk to the port and to the museum MUCEM, a lot of history. Good to start with",
          "It is a dirt where you can walk around for free it has got good views out to sea and of the port, it has a cafe and also has an audio guide you can listen too (you have to pay for that) the history is impressive too.",
          "Very nice museum for it's architecture, multiple exhibits but was disappointed in the Picasso exhibit... La Vieille Charit\u00e9 is much nicer - go up to the terrasse... view the Mediterranean, the landscape... Fort St.Andr\u00e9, the walkway between the two",
          "a must do for the view - a pity that the restaurant on the terrasse overlooking the ocean closes at 5 (museum closes at 6 during the winter months).... such a pity - definitely not adapted for tourists who would appreciate having a nice hot chocolate, crepe or more after",
          "A beautiful building to explore, as well as great displays. The whole experience was educational and interesting.",
          "Even though a lot was not in English, it was easy to navigate and to appreciate the exhibits to understand the importance of wine, wheat, and olives to Mediterranean life and history. Very informative",
          "Beautiful large old port with two ancient forts on each side of the sea entrance.Filled with hundreds of small pleasure boats and some deluxe yachts. Surrounded by restaurants - expecially on the Northern, sunny side. In Marseille, all roads lead to the Vieux Port.",
          "The building itself is worth the visit for its architectural merit. Whilst it is a very modern building, its facade is made of beautifully crafted steel panels, almost like lace. The steel bridge connecting the modern building and the old fort is one of the many interesting",
          "I went with my family there . Very interesting museum. You can see how Marseille was growing. When you get there you will get a translator. Very easy to use .",
          "So far the main attractiveness of this museum is the building itself. It is a modern building that makes references to the Mediterranean architecture (the moucharabieh). It has a nice terrace with a wonderful view, a nice gift shop and a fine restaurant. When I visit this place,",
          "It was a very windy February day when we visited. Our only thoughts were how quickly could we leave.",
          "There was only one exhibit that we found somewhat interesting. The rest of the exhibits were not to our taste and the curation was not thought provoking. The ticket we paid for allowed access to the exhibits in the fort - the only problem is that they were between exhibits - so",
          "I wanted to see the permanent show about Mediterranean civilisations. Only one room about agriculture was open. The one about religions was closed down. The show about football was not too convincing.",
          "Worth the visit! We visited the Fort thinking it wouldn\u2019t be overly exciting, but the views of the harbour are absolutely stunning. We visited for free (you can walk around the grounds without museum entry for free). The fort is a labyrinth of stairs and alleys leading to",
          "This is a truly interesting and multi-faceted museum right on the Mediterranean Sea and within a short walking distance of the Old Port. The displays were well done and highly illuminating on the history of cultures and civilizations that touch the Mediterranean.",
          "I would recommend stopping here and exploring what this museum has to offer. Well worth the price of entry.",
          "Unless you visit the now attached museum, you are only able to see the outside. But the cost is minimal and there is quite a bit of history. A great stop.",
          "Another piece of architecture to grace the port. A nice walk to visit all seasons. I imagine it would be. Even more beautiful in summer",
          "You will need a full day to explore all the attractions of the site and the museum's displays. The modernist building in itself is worth the visit together with the bridges that link it to the fortress and thence to the city",
          "This place was top of our list of places we wanted to visit in Marseille. If you are a lover of modern innovative Architecture you will love it. We wound round the various levels of the structure and were amazed at how the outer shell is constructed. The open area at the top",
          "This was one of my favourite places we visited in Marseille. It has been really beautifully restored and has some very nice quirky architectural touches. I took loads of photos here as there was so much to explore. My other half went up the narrow steps of the square tower and",
          "great place in Marseille to feel what was the life around Mediterranean see. Several expositions give you this flavor. On top of that Fort St Jean built by Vauban give you the opportunity to understand How the old city was protected",
          "A sprint through development of agriculture and cities, great time line, excellent introduction to a visit to marseille and then up to \u2018nous sont foot\u2019",
          "Lovely place to wander and gaze over Marseille. The place has been renovated to a good standard and is surprisingly wheelchair friendly, considering the number of levels. It is free and a must to visit.",
          "While the museum may be the main attraction, I really enjoyed walking over the various rooftops (all with different accesses and on different levels) and especially looking at the various plants/trees plantes on each one. The views on the sea, port, city and other sites are also",
          "Seems interesting but lots of exhibits are closed except the football ones.Dont know for how much time.Anyway it looks stunning.Dont miss it !",
          "Looked forward to visiting this museum and we were very disappointed that it is temporarily closed except for a special exhibit on football. It was interesting to enjoy the ocean view from the mucem and the connecting fort.",
          "When we visited Mucem, there was a nice football related exhibition. A couple of other exhibitions weren't ready yet, so the timing for our visit wasn't very optimal. Anyhow this is a nice museum to spend some time!",
          "A good place to rediscover the city from the former piers and at the fortified entrance of the old harbor. We saw a superb temporary exhibition of Mediterranean trade from antiquity to middle age, at the cross road of civilizations. Don\u2019t miss the visit!",
          "Good views, impressive structure. Can wander right around this solid structure. Lovely walk on a sunny day!",
          "It was an exhibition featuring football. As this is not our main sport we found this exhibit not to our liking. The videos were in French and as English speaking left us uneducated in their popular sport",
          "Well worth a visit on a clear day. Quirky bridges between the 3 buildings (closed Tuesdays) and no entry fees",
          "Great modern architecture. Actually it is a complex of a modern masterpiece, an old fortress and beautiful blue Mediterranean water.",
          "Even if you don't attend an exhibition the building is a very worthwhile visit in its own right, and provides some excellent photo opportunities. Restaurant in the open air on the roof.",
          "Very beatiful view. Nice buildingm very good to take photo there. It has special archtiecture. ..........",
          "Loads to see and do and wonderful displays and gardens - Loovely area and attached to other places so you can spend ages in this area",
          "A great place to spend a couple of hours - so well kept and wonderful views from the top . It is in a wonderful part of the town.Internally it is beautifully kept with superb garden areas",
          "Great collection of medieval buildings and home of various exhibitions. The buildings breath an ambience of history and some spots provide a great view on Marseilles harbour, sea and coastline.",
          "All state museums in Marseille give free entrance the first Sunday of every month- It's not very well advertised. (We went in October) We enjoyed and were interested in a display History room in this museum, but found other rooms 'not our cup of tea'. Worth checking what",
          "This area has been rejuvenated and made over as a great tourist destination. With a lot to see about 'old' Marseille and its history.",
          "Depends on the temporary exhibitions, but the permanent historical section was excellent. One very expensive restaurant, one reasonable one in the fort",
          "A restored fort which made for a nice walk and introduction to the the waterfront Includes a museum (mucem) with varying exhibitions and many public areas that are free to enjoy for the entire family. Very age friendly with Ramps, elevators and public bathrooms.",
          "You can walk all the way around the fort. Nice places to sit and unwind while looking over the sea and the lovely Palais Pharo",
          "What an amazing museum. Constructed within a 13th Port fortification, a perfect marriage of old and new architecture by Rudy Ricciotti The museum has some great exhibits and a outdoor great caf\u00e9.",
          "On a flying visit to Marseille we had to make a choice about visits and I am so glad I was advised to stroll around the museum site. The mix of old and new architecture is amazing, coupled with 360\u00b0 views of the city and the sea....stunning. From this vantage point you will",
          "After reading reports we decided not to go into the actual exhibit areas as by all accounts the displays were unexciting and a bit sparse having said that there was a football exhibit due to take place in October which we would have been tempted by! The real star of the show is",
          "This is a must for Marseille history with detailed video to watch. A great spot for harbour viewing as well. A walking bridge connecting the Museum of European and Mediterranean",
          "It had been a military base and there had been no tourist\u2019s visiting before it has developed and redesigned by France government since 2013. Now it\u2019s very hot place for not only tourists but local persons. You can see the quite good city and port view and feel the relaxed life",
          "Getting access to this monument is really nice, it has a long history, a lot of small paths. The map does not explain circulation very well, but I found it part of the experience, how to get around. The view over the harbor and its entrance is stunning.",
          "Go there. If the expos are not to your taste, the buildings architecture is worth the trip anyway. Right now the topics are agriculture and sea-faring, both interesting in my opinion. Take the bridge to the Fort St Jean and get lost in guard paths.",
          "Exhibitions are niche and change regularly so I would recommend checking online before you go; you could go and not be interested in any of the exhibitions. There a football exhibition opening soon! I would recommend Audio guides for non-French speakers as not all the written",
          "The renovation of this commanding historic stone complex at the entrance to the old port is a credit to Marseille. It offers great views on both the city and the seas, as well as various exhibits.",
          "What an amazing building but sadly not very interesting inside. You will find a cultural room with the local history and a media place on different floor. What amazing views on the port especially when you will cross on the bridge to join the old fort",
          "Great place. An impressive expression of merging the old with the new. The old fort that houses half of the exhibitions transitions flawlessly to the modern buildings that house the other half. The view is great from the top of the old fort, the exhibitions are also very",
          "This fort is to beautiful and amazing. Inside, you can see the city in angle of 360\u00b0 from many different points, and each one provides you a different view of the city. There are many exhibitions there. It's next to the Cathedral \"La Major\" and the Port. You can go on foot. The",
          "My husband and I visited and found little information about what to see there. We just stumbled on an exhibit about sea travel, which we found only marginally interesting. The building itself was the most interesting part of our visit. We were glad it was free the day we visited.",
          "Nice walk around the fort, most of it is free but there are some exhibitions you have to pay to visit. Some fantastic views and the architecture is fab. There's a cafe on the top floor that's worth a visit, in the part of the building that is a sculpture in itself with great",
          "Interesting just to walk across the bridge that connects the old fort to the new museum. You also get a great view back across the port.",
          "This is connected by a walk bridge to a modern museum. Thehas museum has various floors and rooms with interesting displays, that you can pay to visit.",
          "Like many new projects it looks stunning and the approach over the footbridge is dramatic, via the old fort to the roof terrace and restaurant of Mucem. But where is the entrance? Ah down some stairs, or via this ramp, we're unsure but eventually arrive at ground level and",
          "This is a funny looking building and you can walk to it via a bridge from the Fort St. Jean. It gives a nice view out to sea but there is not much there and it wouldn't be the end of the world if you didn't go.",
          "You can walk around most of the fort for free and it gives a nice view out to sea. It was quite nice but there was not much there. You can pay to go into certain parts.",
          "The architecture of this museum, occupying part of a windswept space overlooking the sea, is imaginative and pleasing. However it was really difficult to work out what you were paying for when buying a ticket; the exhibitions were confusingly signed, and the toilets very hard to",
          "We went to this place by accident as Le Petit Train Touristique wasn't running due to filming in progress on the sea front. It's an amazing place - lovely to walk around, admire the views, stop in the coffee place on the top floor. Architecture is fantastic.",
          "It is a combination of a modern building with contemporary exhibitions and a medieval fortress with beautiful view of the sea and the Old port of marseille. Pay attention: it is free to walk inside the museum and in the fortress. You will have to pay only if you want to go to",
          "This is a remarkable museum in many many ways. While the specific exhibits change and range from fascinating to \"oh, well\" the design of the building, its flow from the Old Port is astonishing. Space, light, sudden views of the harbor, even the food are all first rate! not",
          "Pictures speak a thousand words. We have a great time walking around the fort and you are able to take pictures of marsellie from different directions. Highly recommend",
          "The mucem is worth a visit to anyone going to Marseille. Not only is the history about the area interesting, the architecture of the mucem building itself is very beautiful. It's structure reminded me of a bees honeycomb. Within the mucem there is a walkway/cafe where you can",
          "The MUCEM is a wonderful new addition to Marseille's culture. The building is absolutely stunning. This is a must-see when in Marseille.",
          "We didn't enter the exhibition part of the Mucem, but we could see the view from the castle - it was marvelous!",
          "First, I love that this place was free to enter. We enjoyed wandering around checking things out. Even though it was a scorching hot day in July, we enjoyed the views of the sea and the city of Marseille. It was cool to walk around the fort and visualize the history. There is a",
          "It's really great to see the modern building from the outside and walking up inside offers a new insight into the surroundings. Crossing the bridge is amazing, and so are the old buildings on the other side. But we couldn't find half the exhibitions, and the permanent one is",
          "We went to Marseille mostly to see this museum \"Mus\u00e9e des Civilisations de l'Europe et de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e\", (Mucem) Our trip was more than worth it! We found the building itself simply fantastic! The relatively new museum (built 2013) is situated at the harbour and somehow",
          "The bar closes at 6.30!pm whilst plenty of people are around. I can't understand this. The place as such is superb",
          "A great place to visit loads to see in the two locations and a great value at \u20ac14.99 for a family of 4 and \u20ac3.50 for a unit to translate for you. There is no time limit so you can enjoy at your own leisure there is a lovely cafe where you can sit and enjoy watching the boats.",
          "With some very nice viewpoints, a connection between old and modern art this is definitely a recommendation when being in Marseille. They show you which part of the castle was from the commandants and the soldiers etc. With a modern bridge you are brought to some fancy buildings",
          "We did not even go into the museum, but the building itself is worth going to!!! Closes at 1930, be in time!",
          "very interesting museum , probably can get a little enhanced by using some supporting museum technologies",
          "The idea of a museum of Mediterranean civilisations sounded interesting. The modern building housing the museum is fantastic and is connected to the old fort by s walkway. The old fort is fascinating and the walkway was a great experience. However, the museum itself has very",

          "The architecture is fascinating and the melding of the new building with the old fort was done in an interesting way. That said, the exterior is the best part. Visit the old fort for free and do not waste time or money on the MUCEM experience. Walk around outside and enjoy the",
          "Being in Marseille - one of the oldest cities in Europe, this museum is a major disappointment. Architecture is beautiful, and it was obvious that government spent \u20ac68 mln on this project. Yet, there is barely any collection to display, expositions feel random, educational",
          "Interesting fortress where the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations is situated & also a path to the famous district Le Panier.",

          "Imagine soldiers defending their city centuries ago, imagine batteleship entering the port! Impressive!",
          "What an incredibly chilled and beautiful part of Marseille. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the old fort, walking along the walls and enjoying the sunshine. The views out to sea make for a perfect picture opportunity. What made this trip so photographic for me was the blend of",
          "It is definitely an iconic building with a beautiful metal cladding. There is quite a good exhibit about the peoples of the Mediterranean but after that not much else...I really would not take young children and our teenagers' interest was not held for long. I can see what they",
          "The architecture is a chapter of its owvn. Try to take the walk around the main building - from level 0 or 1 to the caf\u00e9 level - its a nice and beautiful walk. The exhibitions in July 2017 is very interesting and extremely relevant due to challenges the world face to day,",
          "Built in 2013, the Mucem really changes the image of Marseille. The architecture is really modern and interesting. You really feel comfortable when being here. But when it comes to the museum itself, I do not understand much of what to see here. You only pay for certain",

          "This museum is in many ways a one-off, since it combines old and new, in both exhibits and architecture. You dump your bag downstairs, but you can take your camera with you for later.I liked the display of \" what defined Provence \" i.e. wheat, olive oil and wine - and how these",
          "Great view, very nice waiters who gave us free water, great place to relax and stay for a while admiring the view",
          "Great space for exploring wandering and gazing. Well worth the visit. Loved the walking links between museum and old fort. Forget the map, just wander and have a look at the views. Great exploring. Couldn't figure how to get to every bit - which was good, half the fun is trying",
          "We didn't visit many of the exhibits, but loved the new architecture and the exhibit on waste and recycling. In the city of Marseille and Paris itself we found little recycling though so hopefully the exhibit will start to make an impact eventually.",
          "I really don't understand the mixed reviews on here - it's an amazing building and the exhibits were interesting and varied, despite my poor language skills! As a lot of reviewers have commented - the building itself is a work of art. Visibly impressive, it's also functional,",
          "Great views, stairs leading to hidden gardens, elevated bridges and spectacular architecture. We didn't even feel like we needed to go inside the museums.",
          "I've been here many times. I haven't yet seen an exhibition that is memorable - interesting certainly. But each time I visit the Mucem my breath is taken away by the astounding view and the fact that most of the public spaces are free and publicly accessible.",
          "Part of the renovated complex that includes the Mucem. Most of the public places are free! You get incredible views and can have a drink in one of the two cafes. There are also art installations you can view -- again free.",
          "The modern building itself in very interesting,and inside the walk up with the view is beautiful. The exhibitions that were there weren't very interesting in my opinion ,was a bit weak .but the roof with the bar and the scenery and the bridge to cross and to go to the fort",
          "We didnt go inside the museum as the day was simply too gorgeous, but it is an amazing building to walk around and view from outside.",
          "Mucem is a stunning new addition to Marseille. Marseille has re-invented itself in recent years and has lifted itself to a serious good place to visit... I am biased as I have always liked Marseille this recent (and 5th visit)makes me proud of Marseille",
          "Great views of the city! Great place to walk around and take photos. entrance is free if you don't go into the museum. Cafe is highly overpriced.",
          "Sure the building itself is interesting if you're a buff about architecture, and the fort is OK though there really is not much to see. That's where it all ends, there is literally nothing else to see here, absolutely NOTHING, how this is considered a museum is beyond me, I'm",
          "This museum was my favourite part of Marseille. The city itself is run down and the Grand Hotel at the old port is not so grand. Lots to see both inside and outside this museum - take the time to take a look and entrance to the main areas in free (and the WiFi is free as well).",
          "Really interesting but complicated museum. When I was there, there was the most thought provoking display on waste - absolutely brilliant. There are many parts of the museum that you can wander around for free, you only really pay for the exhibits. There is free wifi inside",
          "Bad luck it was pouring rain when I decided to walk from the Vieux Port with a friend of mine, local. Pouring rain, we got there drenched but the benefit is that the place was empty! Do not expect too much from the collections, depending also on temporary exhibitions... but",
          "This stunning museum encompassing 3 buildings is what drew us to Marseille and it is worth visiting for the architecture alone.The MUCEM building with its 'lace' and glass facade' is stunning and an experience in graceful views which reflected the exterior facade along the",
          "A major component of the Muceum is walking the grounds of the fort. The views of the coast and the massive nature of the structure are impressive. Unfortunately, due to my own lack of French, I couldn't appreciate the history because their signs weren't translated on the",
          "There is plenty to explore apart from the exhibitions. The building is outstanding with very modern features and architectural originality.",
          "What an amazing place! The architecture, the exhibitions and the facilities! Not expensive and really worth the visit, wonderful",
          "The museum building was fantastic! Very innovative and modern. We recommend the surrounds and the grounds. But the exhibition on the history of the Mediterranean? So disappointing! It is quite unbelievable that an area so rich in history could be reduced to such a mundane",
          "Gallery Mediterranean is where we went. Expensive, nothing really old, a bit amateurish. All in French except for introductory panels - if you want anything else you pay for an audio-guide. Architecture interesting but tick-box. Don't bother unless you want to spend a whole",
          "Amazing mix of old and new buildings and spaces vie for supremacy with the exhibitions they host. J4 seems to float within the harbour. A dark monolith accessed at the top by a footbridge. Abstract exterior panels of cast concrete play with light and views to excite the eye.",
          "If You love the Sea and the boats you would love this place. I remember coming here with friends in the summer of 2009. Though of coming here again to just sit here enjoy the sea breeze that I love so much and the boats. For me it was the best way to relax and unwind after some",
          "Just walk around the fort, the bridge to the museum and around/through the building itself. Unless you have a group of kids with you that didn't pay attention in class, don't bother paying to see the exhibits.",
          "The real attraction here is the building and the outlying complex in the fort, and you could spend a good deal of time exploring. You'll find great views of Vieux Port throughout the museum complex. You may also happen upon an outstanding exhibit inside, such as a Picasso show",
          "The MuCEM is the result of a major cleanup of the old Marseille port, making it inviting without sacrificing the historic forts. The MuCEM is not a collection of great art. It is a space from which to approach the old city. Use it as an access point, walk across the bridge to",
          "I just wanted to have good views of the Mediterranean and of the Old Port. The fort provided both of these, and was free to visit. There is a museum, but just visiting the fort itself is perfect for seeing boats coming in and the sun setting or rising. There are many food",
          "Not a place to go to specifically just a fortress from the outside nothing in the inside but if you happen to be there take some photos.",
          "Dont go there it is a hidious ugly building with nothing inside that a 8 years old boy doesn't know it is far from the city center and offers nothing new just an ugly metal architechture that disfigured the beautiful old harbor",
          "This one of the two old forts at the entry to the old harbour has been renovated to provide a series of walkways and gardens with lovely views as well as museums.",
          "I thought the most interesting item was the building itself, especially the exterior walls, which looked like metal lace. It makes a big difference whether you're looking inside out or outside in. I think that ordinarily it would be very calming to sit or stand or walk along",
          "A reason in itself to go to Marseille. An absolutely stunning structure. Plan to sit at their terrace coffee shop and relax.",
          "When you visit Fort Saint-Jean, you should simultaneously visit the Cath\u00e9drale de la Major, the MuCem, the Eglise Saint-Laurent and the ever present Vieux-Port. You can also see the Panier, Le Pharo and Fort Saint Nicholas in the same process. If you have decently good legs",
          "We got a lot of exercise and wonderful views by walking all around the fort, which had historical exhibits and which was connected by walkways to some other museum (whose name I forget) that had exhibits of history and art.",
          "No displays, just this restored fort building. Yes, you get good views of Vielle Port from the ramparts, but that's about it.",
          "Unless the MUCEUM has a special exhibit that appeals to you, do not bother to go there. Lot's of exhibit space which is likely to host avant garde art shows.",
          "A hard to describe experience. A lot about the people of the Mediterranean and all very interesting. The inevitable language difference does get in the way a bit but still worth a visit.",
          "This museum was recently built and has a permanent exhibit on the medeterranian culture(s), as well as other temporary exhibits. I saw the one on garbage (2017) which is very well done, as is focuses both on local in international issues. The rooftop terrace, the bridges to and",
          "Mucem is well worth a visit to explore the fantastic building and surrounds alone. I wasn't quite so impressed by the permanent collection, but some of the special exhibitions were memorable.",
          "Costs nothing to get into if you are not interested in the exhibitions, amazing architecture and you can walk around the building on a ramp that internal to the outer skin but outside the main building itself all the way to the top. If not keen on heights there is a lift to take",
          "Very attractive fort with loads of seats to slump on, great views over Marseille and an interesting video on the history of the place in the Guardroom just by the modern bridge that connects the castle to the church. Nice garden area at the top. Either enter from the base and",
          "Try visiting on the first Sunday of the month when entrance if free. Even if you don't like art galleries it's well worth visiting just to explore its glorious buildings, terraces, restaurants, bars and fabulous gardens - and to enjoy the magnificent views over the harbour and",
          "Architectural beauty, fantastic location and interesting cultural exhibitions. At the new harbor. The old fort St Jean is directly connected with an amazing footbridge. Worth visiting !",
          "The architecture is really the first attraction at the museum. If you want to visit the exhibitions and appreciate everything the museum offers, you will probably spend at least five hours there. The Fort Saint-Jean is linked to the museum with a pedestrian bridge and it's",
          "You can already see this fort from the main street. Impressive, large, built in a citadel formation, designed to keep invaders out. Not much else to see except the history of the fort and how is kept out enemies. Impressive walls, and embattlements.",
          "This impressive fort, a historical monument, is located on the west side of the Old Port and was purposely built to protect the port's entrance. This fort has seen many historical events taking place and was also used as a prison. This fort was also occupied by the Germans",
          "The building is very nice, hidden from view behind the old fort in the harbour. The exhibitions aren't though, I guess its a place to bring school classes. It explains commonly known facts in laymans terms supported by infographics and a few exihibits. Didn't meet my",
          "A wonderful area on different levels to wander around. Even on a gray drizzly day we enjoyed the vistas and walkways, but would love to visit on a sunny day. A lovely fusion of traditional and modern.",
          "Signage and visitor flow is very poor. Some English translations accompany the exhibits but not all. Practice your French as the Museum staff (three we tried) don't do English! Check the exhibitions listed in the literature are currant. You may wish to use the audio guide, we",
          "We visited the MuCem and thoroughly enjoyed the exhibit on the worlds garbage and its impact on the planet. Fascinating and extremely well done. Also enjoyed walking across the long bridge to the Fort and walked through that aa well. Fascinating building, lovely visit. Stand on",
          "Really well preserved, it is connected to the Mus\u00e9e des civilizations et de la Mediterran\u00e9e (MuCem). Mixture of modern parts very beautifully integrated with the Fort.",
          "Stunning modern architecture in a beautiful setting. Not so impressed with the expositions, but the place is very lively and in a gorgeuos setting.",
          "located just next to the Fort Saint-Jean and linked to it with a pedestrian bridge, the Mucem is the modern part of the exhibition rooms. On the rooftop, there is a nice little restaurant and place for relaxing.",
          "located on the entrance of the old harbour, this impressive fortress was well reconstructed. it hosts some exhibitions, but you can wonder for free around in the outside part and the gardens, offering some stunning views on the town and the harbour. definitely a must when in",
          "Great place to sit down, relax, and enjoy the sun and the beautiful views. Lovely gardens, too. The terraces and gardens are free to visit but closed on Tuesdays.",
          "This looks a little futuristic from the outside, however it is really interesting once you get in. Lots of historical and cultural information to find out and lots of space to see things in",
          "Very interesting place, great to wander round and good views. Worth a visit as part of short stay in Marseille",
          "very nice building, spectaculair views, beautiful made. Nice walk, but further more not very much to see.",
          "We found the architecture compelling and the connecting ramps to and from the J4 dramatic. The integration with Fort Saint-Jean was well done and the views are sweeping. I would have expected more of the permanent collection which seemed like a bit lashed together. The audio",
          "This place is lovely to explore in the sunshine. You can enter via a footbridge from the MUCEM, a footbridge over the road from Vieux Port or straight off the road at the bottom of the fort. An interesting building to wander around but there are also lots of places to sit down",
          "We took advantage of the free entrance in many French museums on the first Sunday of the month. We saw the permanent exhibition on the history of the Mediterranean in particular Greek and Roman regarding agriculture (wine, olives, wheat production especially) and the creation of",
          "After visiting the exhibition, and before going back to the permanent collections of the Mucem, we enjoyed the quiet and sun of the site.",
          "Saw the \"Babel\" exhibition. It was interesting. Very cool building with good views from the roof. It is also worth wandering around the exterior of the building and admission is free the first Sunday every month.",
          "We spent longer here than we intended as we couldn't find our way out. The various exhibitions were interesting. I particularly enjoyed the one on translation. We felt that all the exhibitions spaces in Marseille were rather self-indulgent as there were large areas of space",
          "We visited on a wet day and found the lack of signage frustrating. There were two temporary exhibitions as well as a permanent one and access to buildings. The site is large on various levels and has many signs saying \"Sortie\" which we assumed were for the way out although some",
          "We enjoyed tea at Mucem and vies of the ocean. Intersting European history! Glad you can walk into the place without paying and access very many areas. No need for a guide!",
          "The architecture of the building is an attraction in itself and the occasion of shooting lots of photos of Fort Saint-Jean through its concrete lattice. Even though one knows most of the things on display the stories are told differently and it is always a pleasure to review",
          "Professional, astonishing temporary exhibitions ( after babel, translate) interesting presentation of permanent collection, overwhelming architecture.",
          "This is a full-day visit. The museum is excellent, very well laid out and with detailed information in French and English (although they don't always say the same thing!). The building is interesting and imaginative, the cafes are good and the toilets clean. It is a pity that,",
          "The camp of death is just behind this museum which doesn't exactly cheer you up as you approach, also from a distance it looks like a big black square box. The metallic lacework on three sides is interesting as you near but I was disappointed for several reasons. If you are",
          "For the price, this museum was a disappointment. The architecture was interesting, and the connection to Fort Saint Jean was imaginative and creative, but the museum itself was somewhat lacking in materials. It is a huge space, and it was a bit of a puzzle of why it was built",
          "Nice place to visit we love the eposition coffee and citadel plus regular exposition the best is the building so modern so nice",
          "Preface: I do not enjoy modern art. We went because we bought the 72 hour city pass (COMPLETELY WORTH IT) and wanted to hit up as many museums as we could. This one was...weird. The outside kind of reminds me of the Bird's Nest in Beijing, and the interior is a maze of ramps",
          "The multimedia (audio) features in the permanent exposition are way too loud and redundant... can't hide that I found it difficult to imagine a consistent narrative through the various parts: it looks more as a series of expositors unlinked due to poor captioning. I Was",
          "The Fort Saint Jean is a lovely old fort with great views across the harbour and the sea. The footbridge to the J4 building is made of black concrete suspended in the air above the sea and is a technological feat. The J4 building is impressive, love the design and the two",
          "It is a must see if you are in Marseille. Just the structure alone is breathtaking!! Lots of restaurants, cares and shopping nearby.",
          "The 17th-century historical monument is located at the end of the Old Port. It is adjacent to Mediterranean History & Culture center and connected by two footbridges to Mucem and the Panier neighborhood. Prepare to spend and relax yourselves 1-2 hours here just wondering around",
          "I only had the time to visit the permanent collection, which I was a little disappointed with. I thought it was overall a little scattered and lacked clarity. Would maybe suggest visiting some exhibits instead, or spending some time seeing the Fort Saint Jean's history.",
          "We were lucky for very interesting temporary exhibitions. Mediterranean hall is quite ambitious but not really conviced me, even if the proposed path is original, apart from the first part already more or less seen. External architecture very original.",
          "This is an amazing place in Marseille between the city and the sea. You can either go there to find sophisticated art topics or have a walk in an incredible mix of past and present architecture. Really a place to go in Marseille.",
          "The fort is pretty cool, but its not worth a trip if thats all youre going for. Its well restored and you can see how the fortification defended the harbor well. Cool for people who like war history.",
          "Random items, in random places, terrible exhibits with no order or meaning. Very disappointing... Only the view from atop the towers were nice.",
          "This attraction is well worth a visit with beautiful views overlooking the old port, entry is free to the main circulation area of the fort so if short of time it's ideal.",
          "A place to go and walk around but you might be very disappointed because the permanent collections are a bit limited ! It will all depend on the special exhibitions when you'll visit the Mucem :-))",
          "This place is an architectural success! Even if you don't want to see the exhibitions, take the time to walk around the building, it's amazing! The best way is to come across the footbridge from the top of the recently renovated Fort St Jean (definitely worth a visit). From",
          "Muceum has 2 main buildings across a canal with great view. We walked thru the museum for 5 hours, and have a lunch on the top. The exhibition is lively, children would find lots of fun. But you can also walk around for hours around the stairs of the building, in a good",
          "There are so many reviews, so much praises about the muscem architecture, design,location etc already, today I actually want to talk about the museum itself-- the gallery of the Mediterranean.As I pass by and visit it umpteenth times since its completion in 2013, I have long",
          "We visited the Mucem on the first Sunday of the month when entry to the exhibits is free. While they were interesting I'm not sure I would have thought the entrance fee was justified had I gone another time. Some of the temporary exhibits may be worth it, like last year's one on",
          "Nice place by the harbor. We walked in for free. You have to pay only for exhibition. You get nice view of the marina. Recommend. There is free WiFi :)",
          "This museum/gallery is located by the fort Saint Jean and the route takes in both the old fort and the very modern Mucem building. Exhibitions change in the Mucem but there were 3 available when we visited so probably something of interest for everyone.",
          "The building, the exposition, the view to the sea, the atmosphere, everything was splendid. The museum also has very interesting temporary expositions.",
          "I had some time before a couple of days of meeting and chose to see MUCEM - great choice! Really well done museum and historic site with the great contrast of modern stunning buildings. Experienced a history of coffee exhibition that was really informative.",
          "Fantastic arcitecture, incredible location, permanent presentation of mediterenian history and culture, different expositions of modern artists ( last year including Picasso). use a minimum of 3 hours to walk around, have a lunch at restaurant on top ( reserve a table",
          "Just one word: splendid! This visit is not to be missed! The premises are charged with history, the view stunning and the architectural work combining the historic site with modern additions is simply stunning. Exhibitions will probably vary in quality but the key point here is",
          "Good scenic areas. Look for a caf\u00e9 around the area, an open cafe, relax whilst you sip your coffee, enjoy the breath taking historic scenic environment. Best experienced walking around. one or 2 hours are good here.",
          "The huge structure offered only an extensive, if rather didactic, exhibit on mediterranean history than seemed more directed to kids, though I would wager kids would think the price of admission is better spent on an ice cream",
          "This is an amazing piece of architecture, and an interesting museum too. they have videos playing, but the language is French. free entry for students below 26. they have a piece of the Berlin wall too.",
          "We were in Marseille in last Christmas and visited this place on the very first day. We took Tram T3 from the hotel area to reach the port area. After seeing the port, we noticed the Mucem as the Fort and Castle was visible from a distance. We walked about a kilometre to reach",
          "After visiting Fort St Jean and crossing the bridge to the MuCem building, the architecture of the building is really inspiring, leaving one to expect the same feeling from the display. This was not the case, and very disappointing. The general impression was that of very little",
          "This place is a perfect blend of new and old, preserving St Jean's Vieux Port and at the same time opening up a new public space. The walk from the Museum (3rd floor) via the new bridge to the Old Port is a must. The whole place is elegant and clever. The wrap around the",
          "The Mucem is worth a visit! It explains the cultures of the Mediterranean and it has incredible views. The architecture is very modern and there are places to seat and relax and a restaurant that looked very nice. It is hard to explain the collection, it is a combination of",
          "Mucem main benefits : its extraordinary location on Marseille sea side, unic contrast between Fort Saint Jean and its impressive building covered by a concrete mesh, a roof top terrace with scenic view on Mediterranea, the bridge linking the museum with Provence gardens around",
          "The MuCEM (Mus\u00e9e des civilisations de l'Europe et de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e) is one of the best things to do when in Marseille - especially if you're interested in history and art. First off, the location is simply great overlooking the old port (vieux port) and the Mediterranean. The",
          "Great to crawl around this reconstructed port fort - feel all the history of the ages as you stroll through the gardens at the top of the fort.",
          "The MuCEM is located right in the centre of Marseille, between the Vieux-Port, & the Panier & Joliette neighbourhoods. You can walk around the Fort Saint Jean before taking the bridge to this Museum. It is devoted to the cultures of the Mediterranean & is a large complex. Well",
          "The site of the fort of Saint-Jean was really interesting. Stunning Mediterranean gardens have been developed which offer an ideal location for a delightful stroll & a breathtaking view across the J4 & the Joliette port.",
          "the Fort and the Mucem give a rich history of the Mediterranean- get the audio and follow along with the exhibits. (note that they don't necessarily all follow in alphabetical order) but I spent about 4 hours wandering around the Mucem and the Fort-",
          "Not only the exhibitions but also the architecture itself was quite interesting for me. Don't miss to cross the bridge to Fort Saint-Jean!",
          "Nice conclusion to a self-guided walking tour around the whole of the Old Port area. Makes for some more nice views of this picturesque area.",
          "Well worth a visit. It's very extensive and has been well designed. Easy access to all areas. The Mycenae is attached to it so very handy.",
          "The mixture of old fort and magnificent new museo is a fine venture. We were a little late for lunch at the cafe and there was almost nothing left. Should have taken a picnic.",
          "Exceptional site, amazing views. the permanant exhibition is not so interesting, the display is a bit confusing. the temporary exhibition Picasso was great, very well presented and pleasant to visit, even though crowded. Mucem is a must see, the restaurant on the other side of",
          "The fort is on the coast and the top is free to walk around on with a footbridge to Mucem. The views of the port and the surrounding area are really beautiful. It's a great place to go to take pictures.",
          "Wonderful, creative exhibit. I wish all museums were like this. They threw out the typical chronological exhibit style and still found a wal to make it work. They focused on aspects of humanity and the region that people have in common and it was a thought provoking and",
          "One of the most beautiful views of the Vieux-Port of Marseille. Walk all over de fortress. It's very well maintained with free entrance and very clean restrooms. There are also some beautiful gardens.",
          "This Museum is sited in a very important part of the city right on the waters edge and surrounded by much older buildings but it fits in well.",
          "Don't set your expectations too high based n the size of this place. The ground floor main exhibit is really nice and interesting, but it's not huge. You'll get the basics on the holy trinity of the mediterranean; Olive Oil, Wine, and Wheat. There are also other floors with",
          "We walked the fort St.Jean and the temporary exhibit housed there. We were not at all impressed with the temporary exhibit in this location. We took the sky bridge over to the Art Deco building and sort of liked the model ship exhibit there. We were feeling so so about the",
          "The museum architecture is the outstanding feature here and the outside are the most interesting. Most museum visits should only be a couple of hours , the external view of the harbour are also stunning. Terrance restaurant with a visit. This is even great for non museum",
          "The little island has beautiful views and a cafe to relax a little and maybe read some of the information about the jail before going in. There are some differences about the novel and the reality, but it gives an idea of what you are looking at. The place only has empty celds.",
          "As the title says it, the architecture is outstanding. It has a bridge and a terrace with a cafe/restaurant. Amazing views I fell in love with the place and even the pathways that surround the museum used to go up to the terrace. I wish there was something more than boats and",
          "It's possible to go round the permanent collection without knowing French and still understand what they're trying to say about Mediterranean culture. Very interesting, just like the building!",
          "Ok, so let me be honest here. I do not enjoy museums too much.. i don't know, i find them a bit boring. BUT this \"museum\" is not boring - you get to see great views over the city from couple of towers walk the rooftop bridge from old building to the new one, take some great",
          "This museum and its surroundings is an absolute masteripiece. A beautiful and most positive example of gentrification of previously derelict area. Everything is built with class and beauty. It is worth multiple visits.",
          "I visited with my friend, arriving from Vieux Port side. I was surprised that we didn't have to pay to enter the area. We didn't visit any of the exhibits but instead we walked around the complex, admiring the old juxtaposed with the new. We did try to get served in the",
          "The collection is somewhat interesting but the items are very close together, poorly explained and the video explanations are very loud. The layout is not easy to follow. The exterior of the building is very interesting. Perhaps one should spend time exploring the building over",
          "This museum is well worth going to for the architecture and wonderful view from the terrace bar. The two outdoor footpaths, coupled with the mantilla, which acts as a wind breaker, are the most interesting features of this museum. The outdoor space is also very charming. I did",
          "Great location with a historic slant as you look over the Vieux Port. Exhibitions are well organised ... Mediteranean civilisations ...",
          "This museum is part of the MUCEM, which is probably one of the most spectacular new museums to be recently built. Highly recommend to commence your visit within Fort St. Jean and make your way to to the MUCEM across a stunning bridge for lunch on the roof terrace. The majority",
          "Great wonderful steel cube of a cheese grater on the end of the vieux port, however the interior seemed badly designed and was too much open retail space and not enough exhibition space.",
          "This is an amazing museum!! Take a long time of your day to visit it. It has a lot of interesting things to see and a great view. The building itself is also really nice!",
          "We really enjoyed exploring this museum. Lots of interesting things to look at. It was an old fort at the entrance to the Harbour.",
          "I am a bit of an architectural fan so what I can say about MuCEM is that you definitely need to see the structure and walk around the building! I had no time to view the expositions but just being there was amazing. The museum is literally by the sea and it is a very special",
          "Worth visiting, nice place to spend a day, walk around and explore. Stunning views, Few places to chill out and grab a drink or something to eat. I would defenitely go again !",
          "Called in here on our Hop On Hop OFF bus tour and it is definitely worth a visit. Entry is free and the views from the ramparts are spectacular. Make sure you leave enough time to stroll across the pedestrian bridge to the very unusual Mucem building. Another very interesting",
          "This small fort is a walking distance from the port in the structure and design of this fort you will notice that they didn't spend much effort to ensure strong deference methods are in place, and it can stands major attacks or siege!! The visit was pretty short, and it is free",
          "A beautiful building with a fantastic perspective of the Mediterranean Sea. Make sure to grab a drink on the rooftop cafe.",
          "Got here hoping the Picasso exhibition was still on but we'd just missed it. Went in anyway as we were here (it is connected to the Old Fort in a part of Marseille on most people's itinerary) and wondered that such a huge beautiful building could have so little content. The",

          "The architecture of this building is awesome and impressive at night. Nevertheless the content is curious. I was expecting more about the mediterranean cultures. If you are in a hurry, prefer having a look from outside and spend time in the museum of Marseille which is wonderful.",
          "We had a great time wandering around the top of the forst, enjoying the absolutely stunnings views of the harbour, the city, and out to the ocean. If you are going to Mucem, make sure you do this as well.",
          "Great place to visit. Lots of attraction inside and outside. The building itself is wonderful. you spent many hours there.",
          "Loved what they had but as an english speaker it was tricky without the audio guide. That said, this is France and rather than expecting to be catered for i should expand my linguistic horizons. Great building, as is the connecting fort. Recommended!",
          "This was a great shout to go a visit this attraction. Not only is the structure unique and rather interesting there are also a number of bridges linking the museum with other parts of Marseille. Not being particularly arty myself, I still enjoyed the walk and the views and not",

          "A good walk which offers spectacular view over the sea. After finish walking the fort, grab an ice cream or beer at one of the cafe at the port is refreshing.",
          "I've been there a couple times - you've got to check the current expostion as the permanent exhibition is interesting but well ... permanent. There can be a lot of people at time so check if they have some late night openings. There are restaurants on the top floor. What's",
          "I am truly impressed with how they leveraged the spaces and the surroundings of the museum. It is a beautiful place with incredible views, passages, places to seat and relax as well as historic/artistic expositions. I would recommend the museum at the end of the afternoon to",
          "Impressive location fo the MuCEM and great views from the top and from the walkway over to Fort Saint Jean. You'll find some mixed comments on the MuCEM in your guidebooks, but we only had enough time to see the Picasso exhibition - which is on until the end of August). We'd",
          "Watch out if you have vertigo: not only the two foot bridges are high up, but the ramp going round the building (apparently the view is nice) is very 'open'. There are stairs and lifts as well. The permanent exhibitions are interesting and chilled, the temporary one (Picasso)",
          "We had lunch close to Fort Saint-Jean and decided to visit the fort after. The entrance is free and it's a quite big fort with a lot of vantage points to get great photos from. Several elevators inside the fort makes it possible for families with children to visit the fort.",
          "Loved the Picasso exhibition! Loved the way they showed us what inspired Pablo and the fact that they also show his bromze sculptures, cheramics, carpets etc.",
          "Combining a new large museum building with the old Fort St Jean has led to a marvellous result. When we were, there was an excellent temporary Picasso exhibition, which of course added to our very positive impression of this wonderful place. Do they always have both art and",
          "MuCEM is a museum, devoted to European and Mediterranian civilisations. It sounds boring, but it isn't. It houses a book shop and permanent collections as well as temporary exhibitions like the wonderful exhibition of Picasso we were able to visit last June. The modern building",
          "I guess i expected a bit more from all the hype, but it does offer some creative and intersting exhibits and features. I recommend the secyion on immigration in Marseille, across the Mediterranean. Not just numbers but stories, imported styles and related artwork make it quite",

          "When in Marseille, don't miss out on this museum. We loved the exhibitions and despite many of the signs being only in French, it was really informative. Bring your smartphone along and you can scan QR-codes and get the audio guide in your language. There's free wifi so anyone",
          "The Mucem is the most unusual place you need to visit it to understand The Architecture is absolutely amazing, the walls are like concrete lace The exhibits are superb. I saw the Picasso exhibition - truly amazing with so many items I had never seen before. The cafes and",

          "One of the most beautiful building in Marseille with a lovely open space and view on the sea and port, a must see!",
          "The building is very impressive and in a great location. Our own fault for not checking but Tuesday is a strange day to close. The setting is great. An easy walk from the old port.",
          "This building is quite impressive, but the exhibits are bit dumbed down, but worth exploring all the same. The view from the museum is worth it all though.",
          "This ultra modern building is worth a look even if you don't go into the Mucem. It is joined by bridges to Fort Jean and on the day we went it was very windy crossing the bridge. The cost to get in is 9.50\u20ac each. There is currently a Picasso exhibitition which was extensive and",
          "The MuCEM is an amazing building. It is of course a great museum of European and Mediterranean civilisations, with a range of exhibits, but the we though that the building itself is a beautiful work of art, and that alone merits a visit. If you have the time and the inclination,",
          "This is an amazing place. It has been nicely reconstructed and it is ideal for families as well as for just about everyone. It was built in the 17th century in order to protect the city, at the entrance to the port. It has a very long history and people can freely roam around",
          "The outside of the building is amazing and it is close to the cathedral. The things inside are nice (like Picaso) but most of them boring.",
          "You can enter the site of the museum without paying entrance - at the site is really the beautiful part. So worth to go for anyone. Surely the most beautiful spot of Marseille I saw, with breathtaking views.",
          "I loved this museum. It has a unique contemporary architecture and is linked to the Fort St. Jean with gorgeous views of the harbor and hillsides. The Picasso exhibit was incredible and extensive with works I had never seen before. Take some time with the art then go over to the",
          "Go all the way up to the top of the building. It is a nice place for the ocean view. There are flat chairs for you to lie down and enjoy the sea breeze. The restaurant on the top of the building looks very nice, too.",
          "I adored this place. Fabulous setting, wonderful exhibitions, a blend of light, sun, heat and shade. Go in the summer. You will not want to leave and you will return again and again.",
          "My visit to Fort Saint Jean was one of the few things that i shall remember from Marseille. A quite big fort with much room for exploration with free entrance. I visited the place at around 21:00 and sun was still up while there was a small festival with cold beer and local fast",
          "We didn't see much of Marseille, but managed to visit this, the Cathedral and the Museum in the same area. Very nice to walk around in and explore the sights.",
          "The stunning old fort has been combined with the contemporary museum. The views are break taking and the architecture has been creatively and uniquely done. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "Take some time to visit Mucem! You don't need to be a museum freak to enjoy the retelling of ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, with movies, sounds, paints and objects (permanent exhibition). There are also nice seasonal exhibitions, so pay attention to them. It's also",
          "We did not have time to see the Picasso exhibition which looked interesting. However, you can enter and go to the top for free, which we did. From there you have some great views of the city and Mediterranean. Also you can appreciate the great design of the building that is",
          "Wonderfull! I enjoyed this trip with my husband and my family! A real space of ancient and modernity! A melting pot of M\u00e9dit\u00e9ran\u00e9en culture Latin culture and also Eastern Europe culture! Very intersting!",
          "It is a very nice place for you to have a panoramic view of the old port. Besides looking from the fort, should also go down to its bottom to feel the breeze and the cool water in a sunny day.",
          "We visited the area of Mucem on the Thursday of the semi final of the europeen soccer Championship. So there wer a lot of people, but it was still not overcrowded. The entrance for the main builing is free. You can have a walk around the total area, except the exibithins",
          "I was disappointed. The streets are very old and good to see the architecture but that was it. Very few shops and restaurants. Easy to get lost. If you have to see it go by mini train its much quicker than walking!",
          "We were a bit disappointed as this is basically a castle with little on show next to an exhibition centre showing a Mediterranean museum and housing the Picasso exhibit. On Sunday there was over a 1 hour queue to see Picasso so we didn't see it. Very good because it was free",
          "The MUCEM and surrounding museums and the Fort St. Jean have completely revitalized this area of the Marseille port. Great views from everywhere and easy to visit. Good advice given by staff at the entry. The entry price of euros 9.50 is pretty steep so we did not visit the",
          "Bit tricky to find. Entrance was by walkway over the road. Walkway all grey coloured and quite depressing. It cost 9.50 euros and you got a small map to assist you. The rooms were odd with little signage and no obvious exits. There didn't seem to be much logic applied to the",
          "Mucem is connected to old castle and there is walkway going above - so the views are really nice. Currently there is Picasso exhibition ongoing.",
          "Wonderful. Beautiful. Don't miss it There was a Picasso exhibit on. Very complete and well curated. Easy to get to on foot or ferry or 82, 83 bus.",
          "My husband and I saw the Picasso exhibit and it was fascinating. We highly recommend going to the terrace and enjoying the breeze and views of Mediterranean Sea.",
          "Beautiful Site and great views of the Old Port and Mediterranean Sea. We highly recommend eating at the fort restaurant rather than at Muceum restaurant. The food is exquisite and the prices are better.",
          "You have to see the MUCEM. The building is extra-ordinary. There are temporary exhibitions. We went for the Picasso exhibition. Fantastic! The caf\u00e9 restaurants is a place to relax.",
          "The fort is refurbished and gives acces to the MUCEM. From the remparts of the fort you have a nice view on the skyline of Marseille: from Notre Dame de la Garde upto the building of Zaha Haddid.",
          "It's an overpriced museum.Visit it (and pay of course the entrance ) only for the excellent views and the relaxation on the top floor",
          "Unfortunately, my review is probably tainted by my disappointment over Bleu Evasion cancelling our tour. We ended up walking around Fort Saint-Jean, and it was a nice fort, for a fort.",
          "Great site. Beautiful art. Amazing building so modern and smart design. We absolutely loved it. The views are incredible.",
          "People of all walks of life will appreciate the copious amounts of artifacts and historical events displayed here",
          "You can spend all day walking around this place! I especially appreciated the museum close by with artifacts of all centuries.",
          "Really enjoyed the monumental architecture and use of the old fort with connection to the newer modern gallery space via interesting walkways. However maybe I missed something fundamental during our visit because I could find the exhibitory easily or at all! I was admittedly",
          "We went for a morning walk and ended up visiting this place. I loved it, so beautiful and the view from there it's amazing",
          "After a disappointing lunch - this place was a much needed lift! Great views, wonderful exhibition on Picasso. The French do a wonderful job on blending the old and new and creating vibrant public spaces. bravo",
          "Fantastic setting with superb views of the Old Port. The best Picasso exhibition we have seen in many years. Eating here is very expensive.",
          "Having missed the MuCEM on previous visits to Marseille, it was at the top of our list this time. We were not disappointed. Incredible walk through 8000 years of history and civilizations on both sides of the Mediterranean in a wonderful combination of static displays, films",
          "The museum building is a terrific piece of architecture and worth a wander across the bridge from Fort St Jean to the top terrace with its cafe. Don't know if you'd have to pay to get there as it was a free (and quite crowded) day when we went. But then you have the, initially",
          "Either get in from the bottom from the seafront or up the steps and over the bridge. Lots of nooks and crannies to explore but it helps to have some French to understand the signs (or, I'm told, the tours) and there's lots of steps. Some good views and a decent cafe before you",
          "Such a surprisingly interesting and beautiful sight, we really recommend taking half a day just climbing and walking around outside.",
          "If your a fan its awesome, If not??? There is not much else to see. Nice location, too much of a walk for older folks to get out of the museum.",
          "As others have said previously, a spectacular setting at the mouth of the Vieux Port. Before going into the exhibition make time to sit on the upper terrace and take in the view. The one thing that makes Mucem a must see in Marseille apart from its beautiful setting is the",
          "Although there is a lot of walking this is a must do. Walk across the bridge and find a cafe on the other side. The views are absolutely amazing. To tour all of the fort requires walking up and down stairs.",
          "Unfortunately we dont speak good French so we really didn't understand anything...great views though"

        "wiki": "The Palais Longchamp is a monument in the 4th arrondissement of Marseille, France. It houses the Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts and Mus\u00e9um d'histoire naturelle de Marseille. The surrounding Longchamp Park (French: Parc Longchamp) is listed by the French Ministry of Culture as one of the Notable Gardens of France.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Palais Longchamp was created to celebrate the construction of the Canal de Marseille, which was built to bring water from the Durance River to Marseille. Although the foundation stone was laid by the Duke of Orleans on 15 November 1839, the building took 30 years to complete, partly because of the enormous expense and partly because of difficulties with local regulations. Designed by the architect Henri-Jacques Esp\u00e9randieu, the building was centered on the structure and elaborate fountain known as the ch\u00e2teau d'eau (\"water castle\").\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe Palais Longchamp has three main parts:\n\nThe ch\u00e2teau d'eau\nThe east wing, which houses the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts\nThe west wing, which houses the Museum d'Histoire Naturelle\n\n\n== Park ==\nLongchamp Park was opened in 1869, at the same time as the palace; in addition, the art and natural-history collections, which had been housed elsewhere, moved into the palace at this time. The park also contained a zoo, which was run by the city from 1898 until 1987, when, because of public disaffection with traditional zoos, it was closed.\nAt the summit of the fountain are sculptures of four large bulls and three women\u2014a central figure representing the Durance flanked by one who represents grapes and one who represents wheat and fertility. Behind the women, within the central structure of the palace, is a manmade stone grotto decorated with carved stalactites and nymphs. From beneath the three women and from the bulls, water flows into a secondary basin, and then into an artificial pond. The water drains out of the pond into underground pipes, from which it emerges in a waterfall-like structure, and in twelve ornate bronze fountains lined alongside it, flowing into a second, larger pond.\nThe central feature of the garden behind the palace is a classic garden \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, which is known as the Jardin du plateau. The garden also includes an English landscape garden, with winding alleys and many notable trees, including a 150-year-old plane tree and an oak and a Siberian elm that are both 120 years old.\nThe area that was occupied by the 19th-century zoo still contains many of its picturesque buildings in fantastic styles, including oriental pavilions for the giraffe and elephant, cages ornamented with Turkish tiles, and bear cages and seal dens decorated with rocaille, or rock-work.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe music video of Soprano's single, \"Ils Nous Connaissent Pas\" was filmed at Palais Longchamp in 2014.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMarseille Observatory (Now an astronomical museum and planetarium nearby to the palais)\n\n\n== Sources and citations ==\nPage from the site of the French Committee of Parks and Gardens",

          "It was nice park. When we visited, there were very few people. If you have extra time and want to relax, you can visit this place. I am reducing one star, because lot of improvements can be done to this park. It looks like they made it and never bothered to take care.",
          "Beautiful (and free) picturesque area for a nice picnic or photoshoot. Area is spacious and not over congested. Just be aware it\u2019s a lot of stairs to the upper areas, with no accessible alternative.",
          "Gorgeous architecture with spectacular fountain. Unfortunately we didn't visit the museum as we had to catch a train. Nice shady spots for picnicking. Worth visiting if you're in Marseille, it's a few stops from the Vieux Port on the Metro",
          "I love this place! Ideal to walk and relax",
          "The palace is breathtaking and free! We walked there from the vieux port, which took us less than 30 minutes. The palace is beautiful, but the surrounding park is not very interesting. Would recommend going",

          "Nice place but missing few things for final glance. People sleeping around is big NO for a Palais like Longchamp is. Place definitely deserve more gratification.",

        "wiki": "Marseille Cathedral (French: Cath\u00e9drale Sainte-Marie-Majeure de Marseille or Cath\u00e9drale de la Major) is a Roman Catholic cathedral, and a national monument of France, located in Marseille. It has been a basilica minor since 1896. It is the seat of the Archdiocese of Marseille (formerly the Diocese of Marseille until its elevation in 1948).\n\n\n== Old cathedral ==\nPart of the earlier, much smaller cathedral still remains, alongside the new cathedral. It was built in the 12th century in a simple romanesque style. Two bays of the nave were demolished in the 1850s, when the new cathedral was built. What remains is the choir and one bay of the nave. It is commonly referred to as the \"Vieille Major\". The composer Charles Desmazures was organist at the old cathedral.\n\n\n== New cathedral ==\nThe present cathedral, the \"Nouvelle Major\", was built on an enormous scale in Byzantine-Roman Revival style from 1852 to 1896 on the site used for the cathedrals of Marseille since the fifth century, principally by the architects L\u00e9on Vaudoyer and Henri-Jacques Esp\u00e9randieu (1829-1874). It is 142 meters (469 ft) long, and the main cupola is 70 meters (231 ft) high. With a capacity of 3,000 seats, it is one of the largest cathedrals in France.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nThis cathedral should not be confused with the more famous basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde, also in Marseille.\nList of works by Eug\u00e8ne Guillaume\nList of works by Louis Botinelly\n\n\n== References ==\n\nCath\u00e9drale Sainte-Marie-Majeure at Structurae\nOld Sainte-Marie-Majeure Cathedral at Structurae\n\n\n== External links ==\nMinist\u00e8re de la Culture: Archive photographs of the new cathedral",

          "Small, but interesting historical site. If you\u2019ve seen \u201cThe Count of Monte Cristo,\u201d this is not the same prison as it is depicted in the Hollywood movie, but it is what Andre Dumas based the book after. Don\u2019t expect a grand castle, but you \u2026",

          "By only 20min from Marseille old port you can find a lovely spot with fabulous view. The castle was used to be a prison and it became notorious thanks to a famous novel of alexandre Dumas. You can enjoy a short but intresting visit of the \u2026",

          "Historic prison where you can find out the details of who was imprisoned here. Also used as the location where the Count of Monte Cristo was held in the book by Dumas.  There is a bar and restaurant here to relax after seeing the castle. The boat trip and the island itself give a great view back to the city of Marseille.",

          "A great place to feel the spirit of the era and to be in the shoes of a prisoner.",
          "Wow! Waited on the island for the boat to Marseille for hour and a half! For that kind of money they get from the tickets, maybe they should consider hiring someone with a proper English knowledge. A beautiful island, but poor poor organisation.",
          "Great experience, stay away from trying to take the last tour as the workers attempt to rush you out so they can leave for the day.  Wish I had more time to look at everything.",
          "Nice island, you need to take a boat to reach their which is very frequent. The view from the castle is very nice.",

          "Cool, but not amazing. If you like old forts, it's cool. The views of Marseille are great. If you can get the ferry tickets at a good price, it's worth it. ",

          "Really cool to visit castle/prison on cute island",

          "Since i've seen the Count of Monte Cristo, it made sense for me to visit this place while in Marseille. Spectacular views on the boat and from the castle itself. The emptiness of the rooms and the walls bring a sense of calm and meditation. It seems that the surroundings",
          "The trip by boat itself is relaxing, providing that you bought your tickets in advance. If not, be prepared to queue. The castle is huge and inside, it's chilly, regardless the temperatures outside. We have spent great morning there.",

          "As I went there, I had the great book of Dumas in my mind, Le Comte de Monte-Cristo, where the Castle of If takes a great place as it is the prison where Edmond Dantes the hero is kept many years. In real it is small but nice, on a tiny island directly situated in front of",

          "Beautiful ferry ride out to see this very historic sight. Be prepared to pay for the ferry and entrance into the castle, but if you love seeing this type of history, not to mention the tie in to the Count of Monte Cristo it is well worth time time and Euros. Make sure you are",
          "I was unimpressed with the Chateau d'If. One has to pay around 9 euros for the ferry to the island and then pay AGAIN to get into the castle itself. As all that is left is bare walls, there isn't much to see, particularly since the connection to the Count of Monte Cristo is,",

You can also go to the nearby Frioul Islands for the cost of",

          "We had a day in Marseille and decided to take the ferry to Chateau D'If. The boat ride to the island was a great way to see the Marseille and once on the island we spent an hour and half exploring the castle and history. Kids loved roaming the cells and walking the paths around",

          "We took a trip to Frioul island only. It's basically an empty dry rock with some infrastructure left behind. You can have sunbath in piece and have a swim in the small beach, and... and there is nothing else. I think it wanted to be a holiday place, but it failed, \"access",
          "Our cruise ship arrived Marseille on Tuesday, my first choice was to visit the Calanques but unfortunately the ferry only sail on Wednesday, so we picked Chateau d'If as our second choice because of the book the Count of Monte Cristo, and it did not disappoint me. The ferry ride",
          "This trip was well worthwhile. We were hesitant to go after reading some of the less complimentary reviews on tripadvisor, but we enjoyed our time at the Chateau d'If. The chateau boasts beautiful views of the other islands which are great for photos. The chateau itself is fun",
          "It was exiting to imagine how the life would have been had the Alexandre Dumas figure lived.",
          "from chateau d'if, you have an original view of marseille. The castle in itself, since it used to be a real political prison for the king's distinguished opponents, is a moving visit. better not in the summer heat",

          "Nothing to see, but will be a stop going to Frioul island, you can discover the jail where Alexandre Dumas situated the story of \"the comte de Monte cristo",
          "The only thing I did not like about it was that the guide was only in French. Maybe it was just my bad timing. Brilliant for those who love archaeology or history. I loved it as it was peaceful and interesting.",
          "The spirit of novel The Count of Monte Cristo comes to life. One of best place I was ever, I must return. It\u00b4s smaller and more beautiful than you think. Very nice blue see around the island, the trip on boat from Old Port in a summer day you never forgot.",

          "A complete waste of time (the queues were huge) and money. It's simply an old fortress with empty cells. It houses a museum which main and, actually, the only 'charm' is the fictitious story of The Count of Monte Cristo. I really expected more than going all this way to see the",
          "Chateau d'If was amazing - to get out to the island you need to take a boat from the Port out to the island, it takes about 20 minutes. Once you get there you follow the signs to the Chateau itself. It was bitterly cold and windy the day we went which made us appreciate even",
          "On a beautiful sunny day, this is wonderful. You take a nice ferry ride over to the island and then tour the Chateau and learn a bit about history. Nothing fancy, but well done. Beautiful views to enjoy from the island. You can take your time, but it doesn't take very long.",
          "The boat expedition to the island of If is memorable especially on a sunny day. The history behind this castle which has been used as a prison/fortress is very interesting. The guided tour was enriching!",
          "Chateau D'If itself (fortress on the island of If) is perhaps the most famous place I have every been where nothing really happened! It is, of course, the setting for fictional \"The Count of Monte Cristo\" where the main character is imprisoned on an island and manages to escape.",
          "After reading the average reviews for the island, I was shocked to find a place that is better suited as the setting for a horror film than a day trip. Many of the buildings are fenced off and abandoned, including tennis courts, rather like an unfinished development project.",
          "We took the ferry to the island of friouls, after reading the great things about it and the average reviews for If. It was dreadful in just about every way. If you are expecting an interesting historical or visually pleasant place do not even consider coming here. A lot of",
          "The Count of Monte Cristo aside, this is a great visit. If you look into every room it will take a couple hours. If you allow your self some time to enjoy the views add an hour. The boat trip to the island is separate from the entrance fee but reasonable for the experience and",

          "Rude staff in Ch\u00e2teau d'If ! Unfriendly to families with young children. Badly organised entrance. Once you get from the boat to the island you have to pay again to stay on the plaza in front of the museum even if you are not visiting the tower. It is a rip off without providing",
          "The 20 minute boat ride is very nice out to the island. The castle itself is unimpressive, but the story behind it makes it worthwhile. You get some nice views of the Mediteranean and Marseille.",

          "I didn't get to explore the park itself but I did a ferry tour around the area and it was absolutely stunning. I'd love to go back and explore it properly one day. It's such a beautiful place and being out on the water on board a ferry was a magical experience so I can't",
          "Take a boat and explore every calanque. Stop wherever you like and dive in. Little Kays or creeks everywhere ans some of them offer a place to berth and enjoy an ap\u00e9ritif, a lunch, a cup of coffee or all three, why not? C\u2019 est la France. Boats can be hired at the Vieux Port, on",
          "We have spend such \u00e0 great afternoon in a calanque, It was \u00e0 little bit long to reach It but It was so beautiful and quite, great discovery!",
          "If you're in Marseilles it's a must see. Easily accessible with the public transport. Amazing views within the reach!",
          "Took a 3 hour boat cruise (no stops or swimming) and loved seeing the gorgeous cliffs with the turquoise water. Cruise departed from dock in Old Port of Marseille, reasonable pricing and several trips daily. (If you purchase a cruise with them for this, you can get a discount on",
          "The 3 hour cruise along the coast from the port was great. The coastline was spectacular - rocky and dry. The colours in the water was beautiful. I visited in winter, but I imagine it is even better in summer.",
          "In summer last year, we had a chance to visit the Calanques. The park is very well protected, and absolutely no litter in sight. The real beauty lies in the hidden wild beaches, so beautiful and isolated. Quite a nice place for a picnic and swim away from the city noises. But,",
          "Its a great location but i have seen better , still worth a trip if your in the area. The water was quite cold but refreshing as it was very hot.",
          "Interesting especially if weather is warm, sea is calm and your skipper tells you stories and histories. However, in the end each cove is more or less the same as the others.",
          "Visiting the regions in September 2018 with a group of friends. We rented a house in Bandol. The owner was gracious enough to help out with visiting his part of the world. Took us on hike from the Callenlongue to the Marseilleveyre Callanque. The views, the clean crisp ocean",
          "We decided to take a day trip to Marseille as we were staying in Lyon for a couple weeks. Took the train from the Marseille bus station and then walked for about 1 hour to the park as we didn't want to wait 40 min for the next bus to come. We followed an online review of the",
          "November is not the best season as it rains a lot but regardless the beauty of this area is undeniable!! Take one of the tours and they drive through the park, stop at some excellent viewpoints to see the coastline and calanques.",
          "Mind you, you don't walk but hike thru this beautiful national park. Some of the views are breath taking but it's very doable even by people in their 60s. Bring water and fruit snacks. Wear good walking shoes or better yet wear sweatsuits and get some real exercise out of it.",
          "Having lived in Luminy for almost a year as a student, it is always a pleasure to come back. This time to run Marseille-Cassis through the Parc",
          "Long drive uphill along narrow roads. Adequate parking. Be mindful of your belongings. Narrow paths take you along a cliff, which overlooks the ocean. The walking is easy; however, the paths are a bit rocky and narrow. There are no safety rails or barriers. The views are",
          "Yes, you do have to walk a lot. Take some water and fruit to eat on the way and definitely bring good shoes. We walked a total of 25km, on a bright, sunny day, which we are totally not used to. Ngl, it was hard. But it was one of the best days in our whole trip. It\u2019s",
          "We experienced Parc national des Calanques by E-bike with guide. Higly recommended, and would gladly go back by feet, bike or boat the next time",
          "We took the bus to Luminy, and the walk to the coast was spectacular. Took around 1 hour (but we weren't walking that fast and the route we took may not have been the quickest). Starts in forests, then good paths between hills and finally you end up at the stunning coastline.",
          "We take a boat from the port, to ser the national parc from the sea. The boat was ok, very crowded because it was on a Sunday. It was very interesting the fact that the boat was using Both electric power and gas. The staff of Compagnies Maritimes give a lot of details in french",
          "sooo beautiful (a little bit too crowdy for me), many places to visit (I advise en vaux which is astonishing)",
          "A very beautiful place, which can also be seen from the rtm navette maritime. You can take the bus 19 from Castelanne, then change with 20 at the end of the line and return by boat. The boat is only 8 euros from Les Goudes to Vieux-Port, and you can see the splendid Calanques",
          "Superb but very rocky hike \u2014 very well waymarked \u2014 half an hour of it is pure rock scrambling. Gorgeous views. After Mounine it is easy. It took us 90 minutes one way( at age 65 and 76) but hikers in their 20s were doing it in 45 minutes. (Follows the GR 98-51). Lunch at",
          "The warm mediterranean sun this mid-September day was glorious. It can only be topped by this boat trip to the Calanques which wasn't only majestic but awe-spiring! Mother nature truly blessed the city of Marseille for this. The water around the Calanques were crystal clear. The",
          "The park is really close to the city, so it\u2019s easy access by public transportation. Absolutely worth spending your day there! Incredible views! Would recommend going there early in the morning to avoid crowds. Some paths are not that easy but it\u2019s doable. Simply one of the best",
          "It was a scorching hot September day, and we were already pretty tired from hiking up to Notre Dame, but this was absolutely worth it. It is so beautiful, and it felt like I was in another world. It was calming being down by the water, even though many others were there to take",
          "We got the map from the touristic information centre. We started our journey from Luminy following first the yellow line (Very easy wide path, kids and elderly people can do it), and after turned on the red line towards to our first destination Sugiton. The landscape is amazing,",
          "Wow - what an amazing place! We even ended up going 2 days in a row. The first day we arrived in flip flops & beach wear with just a few snacks - in hindsight a little unprepared (our fault). We found parking in the nearby residential area - be prepared for it to be busy and the",
          "This is such a beautiful landscape and a nice place to be. For me this is pure nature and you can do so many things in here. Hiking, biking or tasting wine in one of the very nice chateau's.",
          "Simply the best reason to visit Marseille, it can be a bit of a hike down but well worth the effort. Beware though water can be really cold even in summer",
          "A really nice experience. We went to the Calanque de Sugiton. The walking took about 50 minutes through a typical Mediterranean forest area. The really nice part are the little gulfs and fjiords where the mountain meets the sea. The water was cold but very clear and beautiful.",
          "The beauty of these cliffs are mesmerising.Boat ride was a good experience seeing 8 Calanques.Highy recommended.",
          "There are various ways to get to the numerous Calanques. One of the better ones I found is through Cassis. Though the ones closer to Marseille are not bad either.",
          "Really loved every single moment of this natural beauty place. Had to take a bus to the Luminy, and then walk for and hike for about 30minutes to reach the beach which is not accessible very easily, you actually have to have two hands free to hold on to anything you find not to",
          "Wow, this was a gorgeous hike! We were informed by our hotel to make a reservation at the restaurant early in the morning and we are sure glad we did. It is also important to point out that you also need to bring cash. The hike was spectacular and there were herbs of Provence",
          "Calanque is French for Creek. They are small inlets into the land with interesting rock formations and blue sea. However there isn't any Sandy beaches as the rock forms smaller rocks under the sea bed / beach area. So wear comfortable swim shoes. The large boat we caught from",
          "We visited this site by e bike We had an extra day in marseille by accident. So glad we were able to experience this beautiful part of the world.",
          "We started our trek from Cassis side. the road is rocky, you should consider wearing proper shoes (not just sandals or flipflops, but there are still locals wear casually) we passed by port-miou, keeps trekking up and down. then port-pin. we arrived at the top hill where we can",
          "Wandered around the park in March 2018 - the weather was just great. It's easy to get to calanques with the public transport and a bit of walking, which makes them an outstanding getaway idea for a day. Buses depart from Rond du Prado underground station. Alternatively, one",
          "I took public transportation to the Park and then walked to the beach. The hike was breath-taking and the sea was refreshing after the hike.",
          "We hiked the the park and walked along the sea. The views from both top and bottom were breathtaking. I am so glad we visited.",
          "We debated (a lot) whether to do by foot, by bus/transport, or by boat or private boat. The calanques are lovely, but in my opinion only if you can snorkel and enjoy looking up the cliffs, rather than down and out to sea. You can get a view anywhere in Marseille frankly, it is",
          "The three and a half hour trip along the coast to Cassis and back is breathtakingly beautiful. The skill of the captain exceptional.",
          "The view was beatiful and the water was perfect. You need to climb the rocks to get to a shore to swim. We were in calanque sormiou which has a pretty nice restaurant (Bar Nautic). The food there is really great but you need to make a reservation. They are always booked!",
          "The best day out, beautiful location and swimming - pack for the day, plenty of water, a bit of walking on okay pathway -",
          "It is beautiful but somehow expected more after hearing about it from so many sources. Took the 3hr boat tour. The sights are beautiful but the fact that one cannot access the beaches is frustrating. You basically see people enjoying several beaches from a boat. After a while it",
          "Just look at the pictures and convince yourself to make it to The Calanques. Less than a half hour bus ride from the centre of marseille on the number 21 bus for \u20ac2 and a 45 walk to some amazing swimming locations, who needs convincing?",
          "This is a true must-see if in Marseille. We took the bus to get there and walked ca 1h along the coast to the first bigger bay. The view is truly stunning. Bring good shoes, the trail is very rocky. Your reward is a cold drink or a nice snack at the terras at the bay.",
          "Beautiful National Parc, which can be easiest seen & experienced by boat trip from Marseille's old port. Best to book trip+swim, as the fish underwater are numerous. Snorkling sets can be rented on board for just 6 euro.",
          "Les calanques are not just about the coastal trails everyone is reviewing. Those will be accesable all year around. However you could also do an overnight hikes well deep into the hills. Those will most likely be restricted in summer due to fire hazard. If you happen to do the",
          "the place is just beautiful i walked for one hour. it does fill up with people traveling by kayak. Worth the trip.",
          "Come here for a day out and you won't be disappointed. From wherever you are get the metro to Rond-Point. Buy a 24 hour ticket for \u20ac5.20 as this will also cover your bus fair. Get the bus 22 to the end of the route called Les Baumettes. When you get off bus walk up the road up",
          "We took the boat at the corner of the \u00ab vieux port \u00bb to see the \u00ab essentials and refreshing / cold swim \u00bb tour and enjoyed the stunning views. Nice 3h30 cruise!",
          "Prior to arriving in Marseille, I had read about and heard Calanques National Park was a must see. I had researched going to Cassis and walking to Calanques or taking a boat cruise from Marseille. Neither seemed appealing. We wanted to Calanques from above and not from the",
          "We loved this. We took at cruise from the vieux port. It lasted 2 hours and 15 minutes. It\u2019s very nice, they take you to several bays to see the cliffs. You can also drive here park & then hike. I recommend the water route. If you\u2019re on land you only get one view, from the shore.",
          "The Calanques are an absolut must for everybody visiting Southern France. Amazing landscapes and colors, absolutely beautiful!",
          "Take the 3 hr boat ride. 7 canals and awesome rock formations to see. Lots of boats to remote places. Great cave diving. Less than e30 per person. Tour in french but english maps. So scenic and gorgeous. Get there 30 mins early for good seats outside under the roof.",
          "A peaceful couple of hours floating along the Calanques. As you leave and return to Marseilles, you get fabulous views of the city. The Calanques are unique and lovely to see. A couple of hours was enough for us. No food or drinks, but we took our own. The commentary was",
          "I have been to the Parc National Des Clanques on foot and it is something out of this world . Then I took a trip on a boat and it was so relaxing and so beautiful that i would want to do it again and again.",
          "I really love the Calangues! Its perfect for an long troll around the beach and shores, and really like the atmosphere as well! :) I would absolutely recommend to go here, also check out the websites of the council for unspoiled beaches around here.",
          "Basically it is a huge green area around 30 minutes or less bus drive from the city center. Which takes you to Luminy. From there, it is better to ask for directions, to reach the location itself, cause it's a relatively narrow road through mountains. If you will go by",
          "This place is a must see from a height! I took a bus from the town which stopped just outside the park, a 10-15 minute walk in and there's a sign to go left or right. Other tourists were heading right so I headed left! I'd advise you to go right and follow the others....I took",
          "A must do if you go to Marseille or Cassis! Even if this is not your first time! Gorgoes views of the calanques",
          "We went on a snorkelling excursion with Vincent of Aquadomia and had the best time ever....how beautiful and so much fun. I have snorkelled in Mauritius and around the coast of South Africa, do not expect the same kind of 'reef' ...it is limestone caves and little inlets outside",
          "A visit to Marseille needs to include a visit of the national parc des Calanques. The nature is amazing and the atmosphere fantastic. Be well prepared wearing appropriate shoes and bring with water and snacks with you. The way can be very rocky and very steep, making the way",
          "Stunning blue green seas, lovely cliffs and creeks leading to hidden beaches, trees perched on cliffs. Nice shady patches. Pebble beaches. Cliffs to jump off if you\u2019re playful",
          "One of the best trek in the world!not for everyone,but really impressive!lets start early in the morning-take care-check at what time the sun go down and buy a good map before to start!",
          "Worth every penny it was a very nice boat trip through the National Park withth beautiful coves and beaches.",
          "Marseille is encircled by hills, the only 3 ways to get in or out are by road east or west of the city or by boat through the harbour. The city was hard to invade in ancient times and still hard to navigate now due to traffic. The Calanques are the cliffs protecting the city",
          "A beautiful natural park just outside Marseille with steep and deep valleys heading directly to the sea",
          "We took the 45 min boat ride from Cassis. It was well worth it. I would like to go back and hike the trails next time for a different point of view.",
          "Really beautiful and worth the effort. Start at Cassis and take the blue path on the scenic route to Calanque d\u2019En Vau then the red path back. Will take you all day so pack plenty of water and some lunch (and sunscreen on sunny days) Enjoy!",
          "We hiked the d\u2019En-Vau trail from Cassis (follow green marks on the trail). Wear sturdy hiking shoes. Take water and food. No toilets. You can swim at a beach midway or at the end. Stunning vistas made this challenging hike a highlight of our trip.",
          "Set on a 3hr journey ..what a view and appreciate the nature and it's beauty ..must see if in Marseille .",
          "We walked from Cassis on the green marked path to Callanque de Port Pin, passing Port Miou it took us 1.5 hours and is an athletic walk with some steep, rocky climbs. We then carried on a little further on the blue path for half an hour before we found our spot high on the cliff",
          "We did a hike to the Calaques de Sormiou. Beautiful and views and nearly lonesome in April. Nice small beach. The Restaurant sells fresh drinks only for take-away.",
          "Most beautiful place that I have seen in all of Europe. The views from the coast are way better than those on the Amalfi Coast in my opinion. Not for the fainthearted.",
          "There are several calanques in the parc so you can choose the one that suits your aspiration best, whether you want to hike for several hours to reach a calanque or only walk a few minutes. We went out of season which is a pity when you see the beauty of the water in the",
          "Depending on preference, you can access and enjoy the amazing blue of the water in the shoreline calanques or climb into the mountains above for a different eco system with some awesome views. For some locations, a care might be handy, but we took city buses to a beautiful area",
          "We spent over a month in France, but the landscape here was completely different from everything else we saw. The blue water and the tall rock formations were majestic.",
          "I love to go to the Calanques for a walk or to just enjoy the view. You have to see it at least once when in Marseille.",
          "Take the ship and go to the Calangues. That place is amazing. You will sea beautiful view from the sea . Small beaches etc",
          "Whenever I'm staying in Marseille with a friend, we always go for a walk in The Calanques, setting off from the university site and walking up to some incredible viewpoints. It is a must for any visit to Marseille or the surrounding area.",
          "A must when travelling to Marseille. Have a very good pair of hicking shoes and enjoy the landscape. We went in December on a very sunny day and it was not crowded.",
          "The cotes d\u2019azur beauty personified! Blue waters, granite and marble rock hikes - definitely do this .. leave from cassis",
          "I spent a day hiking along the coastal trails. The view was amazing. It's an enjoyable experience if you love beautiful natural scene and walking. The park can be easily accessed by bus from Marseille. Just make sure you have brought enough water with you and pick a sunny date!",
          "We were staying at marseille & drove to cassis city center. From there we headed towards the port miou in cassis and parked our car their at the parking lot. Steep hike for one hour continuously lead us to beautiful calanques. We were able to see only one as the sun was setting",
          "The Parc National des Calanques is a gorgeous national park located near the seaside village of Cassis. The landscape features breathtaking cliffs and inlets, and beaches that can be seen by boat or on foot. We were on a day-trip out of Toulon where our cruise ship docked, and",
          "Lots of wonderful walks and hikes possible, with great views of cliffs, sea, heaths. You can pack a picnic and be gone for a while day, if you so wish, and if you choose a less obvious walk, you'll hardly see a person all day. Wonderful way to be immersed in nature!",
          "Coastline takes your breath away.Make sure you bring your phone or camera,you dont want to miss this views.",
          "The clean blue sea reminde me the Greek sea! The small houses for the fisherman build on the rocks really brought to my mind memories from Milos island. I totally enjoy the view.",
          "Our dive club hired a catamaran, the Victoria IV and we sailed around and dove many of the dive sites around this park. It is beautiful area to see and explore.",
          "Catch the bus to out of town. Get off at the university campus and walk to the most stunning coastline. Breath taking",
          "The Calanques is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. The stupend blue of the Mediterranean sea contrasting with the orange-yellowed mounts and the green trees in the top is simply fantastic. Unfortunatelly, I couldn't do the boat trip, but I heard that the view is",
          "This place is just astonishing. Love it love it love it. Go check it out- enough said. Seriously, it\u2019s worth your time",
          "What a beautiful trip. If you're in Marseille, do not miss this excursion by boat to this beautiful area. Commentary is in French, but don't worry the beauty of what you'll see can be appreciated in any language! Boat leaves from the Vieux Port",
          "I'll be honest, I'm not keen on boat trips and was dragged - if not screaming, at least reluctantly - aboard by my better half. So that makes my (very) favourable rating especially impressive. Ok - the sea was calm and the temperature very pleasant. but this is a wonderful",
          "A must see if in Marseille - take a guided tour for ease or even better a boat 3.5 hours trip which goes into the Calanques - awesome scenery and views - not to be missed",
          "The path is rocky and goes up and down the cliffs, some of them very steep. You are rewarded for your efforts with most amazing views at every turn. View points at the tops and swim stops at the bottom. Good boots and walking pole are recommended, can get a bit windy!",
          "spent an enitre day here. ad loved our stay. just a great park and place. so beautiful sea beach, park and nature. wish i could spend more time there. can take car in or can also walk around. can swim, cycle or walk. has hotel, restaurant and caffe inside. very safe, clean and",
          "The calanques of marseille are amazinggg! The sea is so transparent and the landscape is breathtaking. It takes about 40 minutes walking to go there but it worth every step. I wish I live there to enjoy that view over and over again!",
          "We took a right off the D559, approx 3 km before Cassis, coming from Marseille. The rough road called Route Gaston Rebuffat had a negotiable barrier (warning against continuing if it was windy - a fire risk). A 1km drive to a parking area and then walking down an easy winding",
          "Nice way to see the port from the sea. English wasn\u2019t spoken on our trip only French. We were given a prepared booklet to read in English. We went on the 2.5 hour trip and visited two the bays. It was of medium interest.",
          "For us using the GPS was a bit hard to find for some reason. We paid for parking which was located up above the main road that leads to the park so it was a bit of a walk just to get to the park entrance. You don't need to pay 8 euros for parking...there are some parking spaces",
          "We took the regular boat tour (tickets and embankment from the Old Port) and had a wonderful time seeing the beautiful naturally sculpted rocks of the park as well as the small beaches and wonderful water. A must do/see for a Marseille visit.",
          "Sooo beautiful!!! The trail is rocky and steep in places. If you have weak ankles, knees, or hips, make sure you have shoes with good support. We saw a lot of people with hiking poles and I\u2019m sure they were quite useful. The view was breathtaking and if your up for it I",
          "We were able to visit multiple calanques by boat - despite the weather being undesirable, the calanques themselves were stunning.",
          "It's a secluded lagoon with the clearest water and fantastic view. You have to walk for about an hour through a National park to get there. the water is much cooler than elsewhere at this time (August).",
          "The calanques are unlike any sea inlet I've come across before. The water is deep turquoise and the cliffs are massive! You can visit by boat but I would suggest setting off on foot from cassis and go and check the views from higher up before walking down into the gorges. Wear",
          "I did the boat trip but also want back later by car in this area, this is really beautiful. Nice walk around and some small area to chill under the sun",
          "24 eur for the 2hrs 15 mins short trip. Kids from 4yo 18 eur which is a bit rough. Not a word in English:-) but it was nice to see and relaxing. Good to do with kids. At least you don't have to run around:-) many of the places we saw you can access by car. Next time it would be",
          "I wanted to come here after seeing some pictures and I wasn't disappointed. It's pretty easy to get to by bus. I wouldn't bother with fancy tours and cruises, just catch the bus and wander around,you can't go wrong. The mountains with the alpine heath vegetation were stunning",
          "This was the highlight of my 10 day trip to France. Who would think that France could offer a natural attraction so divinely beautiful. This is a series of limestone cliffs and offer hidden beaches, pristine blue/green waters and incredible views of the Mediterranean. From",
          "Amazing views. Hiking trails for the more adventurous. Beautiful beaches with nature at its best. Lovely Cassis close by.",
          "It's a little bit difficult to get there but it worth it. Amazing place. Great views and beautiful beach.",
          "It's easy to get to from Marseille City centre the beach itself is rocky like the Beach on Nice so bring beach shoes. I visited in June and the water was warm enough to swim in. Very clear and clean water.",
          "Blue cristal water for this amazing place between Marseille and Cassis. As we say here, if you saw Paris but not Cassis you saw nothing.",
          "So we did the hike from Cassis, to Port Miou, Port Pin and En Vau. Getting to Port Pin was not a problem, and we were there in the morning, so not so many people, looking back we should have relaxed in there a bit longer, the swimming was lovely. But we soon went on to En Vau.",
          "Wow what a beautiful park full of hiking trails, little villages and beaches. It was stunning from top to bottom. We couldn't drive up due to the risk of forest fires so we had to hike up the road. We then took our first right through a trail at the peak of the road. Beautiful",
          "Today we finaly got to our hike in Parc national des Calanques, before you start, make sure you are allowed to access the parc. A lot of times the parc is closed because there is a heavy risk of fire. There is a special number to call +33 (0)811 201 313 (No wurries, it's a",
          "Breathtaking. All I will say is it's not for elderly and not for very young children. We parked our car outside the park them walked in, and didn't know what we we were heading towards???? We walked a little until we came to a mountain and had no choice but to keep going",
          "Getting to les calanques was an amazing experience. I recommend it for anyone who likes hiking and has good stamina. The area has pretty rocky and uneven ground so be careful, go on a cooler day and bring something too eat and lots of water (then again maybe there is a shortcut",
          "We took a boat ride from marselli for three hours. In the national park.although the rise was very scenic but there were few things not right.the commentary was only in French so most of the people could not follow what he was saying so we missed out on all the comments.the boat",
          "Amazing and gorgeous views! Will def come back and spend a few days exploring the beautiful small beaches!",
          "We visited the parc national des Calanques by kayak. There are a few companies that do this. I highly recommend vs a big boat with many people. It is fun + we also went for a swim. You get closer than by boat and have a great view. Highly recommended! You can only go when it is",
          "We walked from Cassis to Calanque de Port Pin and Calanque d'en Vau. Stunning scenery along the way and the beaches were beautiful with clear, emerald blue water. It is a bit of a trek (to see both probably 5 km all up each way) but worth it. Recommend wearing",
          "I took a guided tour though the calanques and it was amazing. The views are spectacular. Although I traveled with a tour guide, we took a pretty straight forward path. The trail we took was for moderately active people, and I was very tired by the end of it.",
          "Just made a few stops on our way from Marseille to Nice. So beautiful, we wished to get lost there. Definitely will come again. Just need to chose - hiking, boat, paraglide?..",
          "Took a boat trip from Marseille Harbour to the Parc national des Calanques. This was fantastic - our trip lasted 3.5 hours in total and took us into many of the calanques (alcoves/bays) during our visit. The sea here was crystal blue. Unfortunately our boat trip did not allow",
          "If you come Marseille you must see les calanques through the beautiful city of Cassis, you can pay a trip of 3, 5 or 8 calanques, i guess 5 is okey for about one hour, but really the best thing is if you stay on one of calanque and get swimming there so so nice",
          "Had a great time on the ship sailing in and out of the coves along the Calanques. It was very scenic and nice and cool out in the ocean. We took the two hour tour which seemd to be perfect.",

          "Only mamanaged to visit the first Calanques from Marseille on a run but it was absolutely stunning. Very easy to get to from the road but I hear the others are much more beautiful. Can't wait to explore more.",
          "We went to the park when we were driving from Marseille to Cassis. The park is beautiful with many peaks and hills. There are several interesting hiking trails for all level of fitness. The views are magnificent especially in the parts where the mountains meet the sea. From",
          "We have tried to visit the calanques 2 years previously but because of the weather (risk of fires) it wasn't possible. This year we did and it was stunning. I highly recommend a few things: check the internet everyday to check whether they are open (then go!), Take lunch and",
          "Awesome views of the Med. Very scenic and romantic. The place must have a heavy night scene with the smell of urine and litter around the areas.",
          "Indescribable scenery on the bluest of seas. Huge rock formations rise dramatically out of the water next to lower islands, forming deep coves that attract deep sea divers. Take the boat trip from the Quai des Belges.",
          "The Calanques National park offers incredible views of sunsets in the Mediterranean French coast. Very tourist friendly, many restaurants and bars around. The best way to visit it is renting a motorbike and go all the way along the coast. There are a lot of petite houses to",

          "The Parc de Calanques is one of the most breathtaking sites I've ever visited. The inlets, the cliffs, the vivid colour of the Mediterranean are enough to make you fall in love with it. The feeling of walking through the steep cliffs when reaching the Calanque d'En-Vau is",

          "We went to Cassis and got a boat trip to 3 calanques which took 45 mins. It was ok. The calanques are inlets and the first two we sea were not that interesting. The third one was much more impressive with steep, high cliffs. I think the calanques further up the coast from Cassis",
          "How do I get started?! This place is a true hidden gem, Marseille will surprise you and maybe disappoint you a bit, yet going to Cassis will raise the bar, specially the Parc National des Calanques, wherever you walk or aim for a long hike you will always be rewarded with great",

          "White and blue! A wonder! However the numerous boats will slowly destroy the banks and degrade the area",
          "One can take one of two or three several hour boat rides out to the park, which is the perfect thing to do when footsore and hot in Marseille. The view of the Calenques from the water is spectacular.",
          "Fascinating views of sea and mountains. An amazing day trip, visiting pristine beaches and rocky shores. Out of season the tour is available only Saturdays.",

          "Amazing place, pictures do not do it justice! So many great walks to beautiful little coves and beaches, stunning views from the peaks. Be prepared for some fairly tough walks, steep terrain, and gravelling underfoot paths but all very worth it. A couple of buses (19 & 22) go",
          "Visit by boat, hiking or car. You simply must see this stunning park. We highly suggest kayaking from Cassis, its the best way to see them period.",

          "We hiked down the the Calaque de Sugiton. The hike was about 5KM, and took an hour, it was quite arduous at times but the end result was well worth it. The water is the most beautiful turquoise colour I've ever seen. Be sure to pack at least 1.5L of water and snacks, since",
          "Spectacular! Day trip from Marseille. We visited the harbor of Cassis where we picked up a map and got directions to the hiking trails. We walked/hiked from Cassis to \"En Vau\", passing two other Calanques along the way. The hike was very steep in places, and a gentle walk in",

          "Cassis is a beautiful little town with great views and many options for seeing the Calanques. We opted for the 45 minute (3 calanques) boat ride as we had a full schedule that day. It was fun, and interesting! Wish we had more time in Cassis and more time to hike!",
          "We were a family of three with a 20month infant. Thus the options of hiking and going on a 2.5 hours boat journey was out. We started from Calanque et parc du Mugel in La Ciaotat. From the dedicated parking zone the walk is ten minutes only to the beach. Tariff minimum at 2\u20ac",

          "When it's hot in town, there is no better option than to get out on or in the water. Both are possible while taking in the beautiful coast east of Marseille in the adjacent national park. There are numerous boats/operators to choose from leaving from both Marseille and Cassis.",

          "I was very proud of myself for making it...don't do it on your own unless you are an experienced walker hiker or such. I was lucky to be able to join a local couple, without them I'd never have made it to the goal... It is a lot of hassle, but uf you like a challenge - there you",
          "We toured via Bleu Evasion and saw the beautiful and unique rocky shores from the water. We saw plentyt of folks hiking and sunbathing, but on such a hot day, a boat ride was the best way to see this National Park.",

          "We had a lovely day hiking around this national park! It was incredibly beautiful, but it was truely a HIKE not just a simple walk. On some places we had to climbe cliffs, I thought it was quite difficult at times. It was totally worth it though! Bring some lunch and spend the",

          "Enjoyed the boat trip to the Calanques. You have a choice between 2 or 3 hr trip and we took the 3 hour trip and we were not disappointed! The only negative was that the narration was in French and our French was a bit rusty but that did not take away from the beautiful scenic",
          "If you like hiking, be ready to spend a couple hours there. It is a big park and the ocean view is great. There is no facilities around, so, don't forget to bring with you something to eat and drink. Once it is by the ocean, it is a bit windy. There are different treks you can",

          "We did a boat trip to see the Calanques - unfortunately the sea was choppy and nearly everyone was sick. So I would suggest a bus trip to see this amazing scenery. Definitely worth the time while you are in this part of France.",
          "Needed time to rich En veau (the most beautiful of all calanques) is 30 minutes if you park your car at Col de la Gardiole. Plus, it is not hard hike at all,...it is relaxed walk! If you want to go to the view point or other calanque, then it becomes harder,....quite harder.",

          "The absolute highlight of our trip was walking to Calanque du Sugiton. Extremely easy to get there- take the 21 bus to the end of the line and walk along the trail (~45 minutes) until you reach the Calanque. If going during the summer I recommend going in the morning before it",

          "We went on a day trip to the beautiful city of Cassis and decided to take a boat to go to the Calanques. It was Magnificent! The views are breathtaking! The sea has a beautiful color and the Calanques make a beautiful contrast! Definitely worth the visit!",
          "We took a 90 minutes boat tour that visited 15 of the Calanques and were blown away by the outstanding natural beauty of the National Park. The only way to see the majesty of the Calanques is from the water so a boat trip of some sort is a must. If more time allows I'm sure one",

          "it is a long walk from the bus stop at kedge university campus but it is worth it. After a nice walk into the natural park (almost one hour and not 20 minutes as they say) you will get in this oasis of peace. it is like reaching a small fishermans' village in the Greek Islands,",

          "An excellent way to while away three hours plus on a well organised boat. You get an excellent chance to examine the Vieux Port on your way out to sea. The Parc National is well worth seeing even from the coast. Its expansive and covers a large area. The caves and small creeks",
          "This is a very scenic part of Marseille that many visitors miss. The boat trip was comfortable and delightful and even though the description of the scenery was in French only, it is beautiful."

        "wiki": "The Stade V\u00e9lodrome (French pronunciation: \u200b[stad vel\u0254d\u0281om]; Occitan: Estadi Velodr\u00f2m), known as the Orange V\u00e9lodrome for sponsorship reasons, is a multi-purpose stadium in Marseille, France. It is home to the Olympique de Marseille football club of Ligue 1 since it opened in 1937, and was a venue in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the 2007 Rugby World Cup and the UEFA Euro 2016. It occasionally hosts RC Toulon rugby club of the Top 14. It is the largest club football ground in France, with a capacity of 67,394 spectators. The stadium is also used regularly by the France national rugby union team.\nThe record attendance for a club game before renovation at the Stade V\u00e9lodrome was 58,897 (for a UEFA Cup semi-final against Newcastle United in 2004). Since expansion to 67,394, the record attendance at the ground now stands at 65,421 for the match against rivals Lyon that occurred on 10 November 2019. The stadium was also featured as a FIFA World Cup venue when the 1938 finals were held in France. The first-ever match to be played was between Marseille and Torino in 1937.\nThe French rugby union team began an impressive run of victories at the stadium in the early 2000s. They defeated New Zealand 42\u201333 in November 2000, and in 2001 defeated Australia by one point. They beat South Africa in 2002, followed by a win over England in 2003. However, their run of luck was broken in 2004 when they lost 14\u201324 to Argentina. The venue was used by France for a game against New Zealand in November 2009. In 2018, the stadium hosted its first Six Nations match with France hosting Italy. \nFrance is not the only rugby team to have used the V\u00e9lodrome in recent years. On 18 April 2009, Toulon took their home fixture in the Top 14 against Toulouse to the V\u00e9lodrome, drawing 57,039 spectators to see a 14\u20136 Toulon win which played a key role in the Toulonnais' successful fight against relegation in the 2008\u201309 season. Toulon has taken two home matches to the V\u00e9lodrome in each of the succeeding two seasons. The V\u00e9lodrome was also the venue for both semi-finals in the 2010\u201311 Top 14 season, and was used for the Toulon v Munster semi-final of the 2013\u201314 Heineken Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1935, the architectural firm Pollack Ploquin was chosen to build a stadium in Marseille. Henri Ploquin (who designed in 1932 with Charles Bouhana the Stade Municipal Louis Darragon) designed the stadium. For economic reasons, only the Stade V\u00e9lodrome was built. On 28 April 1935, the foundation stone was laid for the V\u00e9lodrome by Marseille Mayor Ribot, on a site between downtown and the suburban areas of St. Giniez and Sainte-Marguerite on military grounds belonging to the city. The Stade V\u00e9lodrome opened on 13 June 1937, when a friendly match was played between Olympique Marseille and Italian of Torino FC (which ended 2-1 to Olympique Marseille). On 29 August 1937 (the second day of the French national football championship) a match took place between OM and Cannes. This was the first official match at the stadium.\n\nAs its name suggests, Stade V\u00e9lodrome was used for cycling competitions but as these races became less common, seating replaced the track which circled the stadium. The V\u00e9lodrome remained famous for fans of OM (Olympique Marseille) since the sloped track which was under the extended seating acted as a slide to invade the pitch at the end of matches.\nOlympique de Marseille was long hostile to the Stade V\u00e9lodrome, calling it the \"stage of the City Council\". For fans of the Olympians between the wars, the real home of OM was Stade de l'Huveaune, owned by Olympique de Marseille and partly financed by fans in the early 1920s. After World War II, however, Marseille no longer owned the Stadium Huveaune. Seeking support from the city, Chairman Marcel Leclerc had OM play at Huveaune from 1945 to 1960. The City Council then relented, and Olympique de Marseille moved to the V\u00e9lodrome. During the 1970s, OM shared the Stade with the Marseille XIII Rugby League.\n\n\n=== First renovations ===\n1970 marked the first modifications to the V\u00e9lodrome, with the replacement of the floodlights on the Ganay and Jean-Bouin tribunes by four 60 meter towers for nighttime events. In March 1971, the capacity of the stadium was increased by nearly 6000 seats, with the reduction of the cycling track and the removal of the cinder running track. This brought the total capacity of the stadium to 55,000 people, including the standing area.\nOlympique returned to the Stade de l'Huveaune for the 1982\u20131983 season as Stade V\u00e9lodrome was under construction in preparation for the UEFA Euro 1984. The playing surface was completely replaced during this time. The semifinal between France and Portugal had set a record for attendance at an international match with 54,848 spectators. The capacity of the stadium was later reduced to 42,000 with the construction of lodges.\nThe cycling track was removed altogether once Bernard Tapie was appointed president of OM in 1985. He chose to remove it and rearrange the corners of the stadium, bringing the capacity up to 48,000. This renovation marked the end of the era of V\u00e9lodrome as a multi-use facility. The area around the stadium was also transformed with the creation of the second line of the metro which served the stadium from two stations and with the construction of the Palais des Sports nearby.\n\n\n=== 1998 World Cup and beyond ===\n\nThe Stade V\u00e9lodrome was completely renovated for the 1998 World Cup; its capacity increased from 42,000 to 60,031 seats (or 32 miles of seats). The V\u00e9lodrome hosted the final draw, which took place on 4 December 1997 (the first time the final draw was held in an outdoor venue) and seven matches, including France's first match against South Africa, the quarterfinal between Argentina and the Netherlands and the semifinal between Brazil and the Netherlands.\nAs of 2011, the record attendance for a football game (58,897 spectators) was the Newcastle United UEFA Cup semifinal on 6 May 2004 (2\u20130). During the 2007 Rugby World Cup the V\u00e9lodrome hosted six games, including two quarter-finals: Australia versus England (which holds the overall attendance record with 59,120 spectators) and South Africa versus Fiji. On 16 July 2009, during preparations for a Madonna concert, one of four winches used to hoist the structure failed; the 60-ton roof fell (leaving two dead, eight wounded and crushing a crane).\nWidely criticized and unloved by the Marseillais for its architecture (no roof, exposure to strong mistral winds and poor acoustics), the Stade V\u00e9lodrome has since 2003 been the subject of several projects to modernize and enlarge it. In July 2009, following an extraordinary council of the City of Marseille concerning the City Hall renovation project, a motion was passed launching a public-private partnership (PPP). On 21 June 2010, following France's winning bid for UEFA Euro 2016, Marseille announced that the stadium would receive another renovation (a roof and an increase in capacity from 60,031 to 67,000), making it a UEFA Elite Stadium. Works began in the spring of 2011 and were completed in summer 2014.\n\n\n== Attendance ==\nIn 2002, Division 1 was renamed Ligue 1. Olympique de Marseille's average attendance for each season since 2000\u201301 is listed below:\n\n\n== Tournament results ==\n\n\n=== 1938 FIFA World Cup matches ===\n\n\n=== 1960 European Nations' Cup ===\n\n\n=== UEFA Euro 1984 ===\n\n\n=== 1998 FIFA World Cup ===\n\n\n=== 2007 Rugby World Cup matches ===\nThe V\u00e9lodrome hosted 6 games of the 2007 Rugby World Cup which was hosted by France including two quarter-final games.\n\n\n=== UEFA Euro 2016 matches ===\nThe V\u00e9lodrome hosted six games at UEFA Euro 2016, including a semi-final. In 2016, the stadium became the first in Europe to have hosted three European Championship semi-finals after France's previous hosting of the tournament in 1960 and 1984.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe four stands in the stadium are named after athletes (runner Jean Bouin and 1920s cyclist Gustave Ganay), a historical figure of the 1720 plague epidemic (Chevalier Roze) and a popular Olympique de Marseille supporter (Patrice De Peretti, nicknamed \"Depe\", who died suddenly in July 2000).\n\n\n== Rugby League ==\nOther than the Rugby League World Cup games in 1954, 1972 and 1975, 14 other test matches were played at the stadium between 1938 and 1985. The French national team played in 16 of the internationals played at Stade V\u00e9lodrome.\n\n\n=== Rugby League World Cup ===\nOver three separate tournaments, the V\u00e9lodrome also hosted games of the Rugby League World Cup.\n\n\n=== Rugby League Test matches ===\nList of rugby league test matches played at Stade V\u00e9lodrome.\n\n\n== Situation and accessibility ==\nThe stadium is four kilometres from the Old Port of Marseille, in the neighbourhoods of Sainte-Marguerite and Saint-Giniez in the southern part of Marseille. It is bound to the south by the Huveaune river and to the north by the Parc Chanot and the headquarters of regional public TV station, France 3 M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. To its west runs the Boulevard Michelet and to the east the Marseille Palais des Sports and the Delort stadium.\nThe V\u00e9lodrome is serviced by the bus and metro networks of the R\u00e9gie des transports de Marseille. Besides several bus services operating in the area, two stations of the Marseille Metro line 2 are close to the stadium. Supporters wishing to reach the Ganay or North stands must alight at the Sainte-Marguerite Dromel station whereas the Rond-Point du Prado station caters for the South stand and the Jean-Bouin stand. This line, which also serves the Marseille Saint-Charles train station, has additional trains on matchdays.\nMarseille Provence Airport is thirty kilometres from the V\u00e9lodrome.\n\n\n== Current Situation ==\nThe Stade V\u00e9lodrome has increased its seating capacity in 2014 (in prevision of the UEFA Euro 2016 hosted by France), and continues to host games for Olympique de Marseille. Previously it held 60,031 spectators; following its renovation, it is now able to hold 67,000, including 7,000 VIP seats. The cost of the project was \u20ac267 million. The expansion and modernization of equipment was part of the French bid to organize Euro 2016. Marseille mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin's bid also provided for the creation of a new district.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nMarseille has increased the stadium's capacity and installed a roof, as required by UEFA standards. The project also includes multiple reception areas and media space, better access for the disabled and better seating. The new stadium has been officially inaugurated on 16 October 2014.\n\n\n=== Approaches ===\nThe esplanade Ganay has been preserved and refurbished. The RTM car park has been replaced with office towers and housing. RTM users benefit from a larger underground car park. Trees and wind turbines contribute to a new-neighbourhood HQE (high environmental quality).\n\n\n=== Cost ===\nThe total project estimate is \u20ac267 million, with \u20ac150M for the stadium and the remnant for the surrounding shopping mall, hotel and housing, the private sector to cover two-thirds of the investment; the remainder will be shared by the region, the department of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, MPM and the city of Marseille for 20m euros. The French government contributed to upgrade the area's infrastructure. After several studies, the mayor selected the contract of partnership arrangements included in a PPP (public-private partnership).\n\n\n=== Olympique de Marseille ===\n\"Olympique de Marseille will be closely associated with the project\", said Jean-Claude Gaudin. The club remains a tenant of the stadium. Elected officials want ticket prices to be controlled.\n\n\n=== Naming rights ===\nThe naming rights for the stadium were bought by French telecommunications multinational Orange S.A. The 10-year-deal was announced on 3 June 2016 by the Mayor of Marseille. The price is undisclosed.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOrange Velodrome",

          "Not large, two hours is plenty. Interesting special exhibition on the sea was very well done, mostly also in English. The main section of the museum has much to do with Roman times, ships, pottery etc...brilliantly done.",
          "Museum of the History of Marseille is located adjacent to the Vieux Port. This is a remarkable collection, obviously underpinned by highly sophisticated and competent research. For a casual visitor interested in Marseille and Mediterranean history, more than a couple of hours",

          "A great story to tell does not necessarily make a great museum. Neither do computer-based displays, even when they work (a few actually did work). A great location, at the very point where it all began, just helps a little. Marseille, when the Greeks (the Phoceans, nowadays",

          "I like history and I love museums, but I have to say Musee d'Histoire in Marseille disappointed me. The texts and explanations were almost all written in French.. The English audio-tour is not complete, allot of the artifacts are not included in the audio. Also 1 in 10",

          "Attractive inside and out, gorgeous view from the cafe and walkway, but most of the information in the exhibits was fairly generic - not a lot that most people wouldn't already know. The short line at the ticket counter took a ridiculously long time. Only some of the displays",
          "I was hoping that I was going to learn about more recent history of Marseilles or even the older history. However, none of the signs were in English and unfortunately that meant you gained very little from the museum. The cost is \u20ac5 unless you had the city pass which meant it",

          "I really liked the way that the museum took us round from the beginning of Marseilles to the current day in a logical and structured way. The exhibits were excellent. However, it did the cowardly thing, and while it mentioned the role of the resistance in WW2, it did not",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Abbey of Saint-Victor is a former abbey that was founded during the late Roman period in Marseille in the south of France, named after the local soldier saint and martyr, Victor of Marseilles.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe crypts of the abbey contains artefacts indicating the presence of a quarry that was active during the Greek period and later became a necropolis from 2 BC onward until Christian times.In 415, Christian monk and theologian John Cassian, having come from the monasteries of Egypt, founded two monasteries at Marseille \u2014 the Abbey of Saint Victor for men in the south of the Vieux-Port, as well as the Abbey of Saint Sauveur the other for women in the south of Place de Lenche. The Abbey of Saint Victor was later affected during the fifth century by the Semipelagian heresy, which began with some of Cassian's writings. Both monasteries suffered from invasions by the Vikings and Saracens, and were destroyed in 838 by a Saracen fleet, when the then-abbess Saint Eusebia was also martyred with 39 nuns. In 923, the Abbey of Saint-Victor was destroyed again by the Saracens.In 977, monastic life was restored in the abbey under the Rule of Saint Benedict through the efforts of Bishop Honorat and its first Benedictine abbot Saint Wiffred. It recovered quickly, and from the middle of the 11th century its abbots were requested to restore religious life in the surrounding monasteries that had become decadent.Saint Isarn (d. 1048), a Catalan monk and successor as abbot to Wiffred, began construction work in 1020, building the first upper church, tower and altar. Isarn was instrumental by his intercession with Ramon Berenguer I, Count of Barcelona, in obtaining the release from Moorish captivity of the monks of L\u00e9rins Abbey. Blessed Bernard, abbot of St. Victor from 1064 to 1079, was one of the two ambassadors delegated by Pope Gregory VII to the Diet of Forchheim, where the German princes deposed Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor. He was seized by one of the partisans of Henry IV and passed several months in prison. Gregory VII also sent him as legate to Spain and in reward for his services exempted St. Victor's from all jurisdiction other than that of the Holy See.\nThe abbey long retained contact with the princes of Spain and Sardinia and even owned property in Syria. The polyptych of Saint Victor, compiled in 814, the large chartulary (end of the 11th and beginning of the 12th century), and the small chartulary (middle of the 13th century), containing documents from 683 to 1336, document the economic importance of the abbey in the Middle Ages.Blessed Guillaume Grimoard, who was made abbot of Saint-Victor on 2 August 1361, became pope in 1362 as Urban V. He enlarged the church and surrounded the abbey with high crenellated walls. He also granted the abbot episcopal jurisdiction, and gave him as his diocese the suburbs and villages south of the city. Urban V visited Marseille in October 1365, consecrated the high altar of the church. He returned to St. Victor's in May 1367, and held a consistory in the abbey.\nThe abbey began to decline after this, especially from the early 16th century, when commendatory abbots acquired authority.\nThe loss of the important library of the Abbey of Saint-Victor, undocumented as it is, can probably be ascribed to the abuses of the commendatory abbots. The library's contents are known through an inventory of the latter half of the 12th century, and it was extremely rich in ancient manuscripts. It seems to have been dispersed in the latter half of the 16th century, probably between 1579 and 1591. It has been conjectured that when Giuliano di Pierfrancesco de' Medici was abbot, from 1570 to 1588, he broke up the library to please Catherine de' Medici, and it is very likely that all or many of the books became the property of the king.\nIn 1648 the \u00e9chevins (municipal magistrates) of Marseille petitioned Pope Innocent X to secularise the monastery, because of the unsatisfactory behaviour of the monks. The Pope was not willing to do so, but instead had the abbey taken over by the reformist Congregation of Saint Maur. Thomas le Fournier (1675\u20131745), monk of St. Victor's, left numerous manuscripts which greatly assisted them in their publications.However, the behaviour of the monks generally did not improve, and after their abysmal showing during the plague of 1720, during which they barricaded themselves inside their walls instead of providing any assistance to the stricken, Pope Benedict XIII secularised the monastery in 1726, converting it into a collegiate church with a community of lay canons under an abbot. This was confirmed by a bull of Pope Clement XII dated 17 December 1739..\nIn 1774, it became by royal decree a noble chapter, the members of which had to be Proven\u00e7als with four noble descents; from this date they bore the title of \"chanoine comte de Saint-Victor\".The last abbot of Saint-Victor was Prince Louis Fran\u00e7ois Camille de Lorraine Lambesc. He died in 1787 and was not replaced before the outbreak of the French Revolution.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\nIn 1794 the abbey was stripped of its treasures. The relics were burned, the gold and silver objects were melted down to make coins and the building itself became a warehouse, prison and barracks. All that now remains of the abbey is the church of St. Victor, dedicated by Pope Benedict IX in 1040 and rebuilt in 1200. The abbey was again used for worship under the First Empire and restored in the 19th century. The church was made into a minor basilica in 1934 by Pope Pius XI.The remains of Saint John Cassian were formerly in the crypt, along with those of Saints Maurice, Marcellinus and Peter, the body of one of the Holy Innocents, and Bishop Saint Maurontius.The abbey crypt previously held Cassian's remains, along with  were previously interred in the abbey crypt, along with the remains of Saints Maurice, Marcellinus, Peter,  also has it that it contains the relics of the eponymous martyr of Marseille from the 4th century. \n\n\n== See also ==\nSanta Maria, Uta, a church founded by St. Victor's monks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nM.

          "A beautiful medieval abbey with a treasure in the crypt : a fifth-century paleo-Christian church, that used to be outdoors, built on an antique necropolis.To visit absolutely if you like history (don't miss the sarcophagus and the altar). An interesting film to understand the",
          "One of the highlights of our trip to Marseilles, much to explore, much to learn and would definitely go back for another look",
          "The Abbaye Saint Victor is definitely worth a visit. This church is centuries old and it shows - the remaining artifacts are fascinating and thought-provoking.",
          "This ancient Abbaye is not really front and centre in the tour guides, but it is really worth going to see, not only for the walk overlooking the port, and the simple, beautiful church itself, but definitely take the time to go down to the crypt areas where there are",
          "We went to a fine classical concert there. Check out the very old and beautiful alter pieces and catafalques.",
          "Abbey was stripped of its treasures. The relics were burned, the gold and silver objects were melted down to make coins and the building itself became a warehouse, prison and barracks. The remains of the church are still a place of worship",
          "This is a recommended stop on a tour of Marseilles, in which you will find the remains of saints, lovely artwork, and a very old building to lose oneself in for an hour or so.",
          "More a castle than an abbaye, it is situated on the hill on the left of the old port with stunning view to the city of Marseille. The entrance is free, although the interior hasn't anything special to exhibit. There is a small square in front of the \"Abbaye Saint Victor\" where",
          "This is an amazing church, the stones used to build it assured its longevity since now the 13th century. The space inside inspire awe and prayer, this is a marvelous space for meditation",
          "I hadn't included this on my schedule during my day in Marseille but it was in the way down from Notre Dame. What makes this church worth a visit is the crypt as the main church is interesting but nothing special. The crypt is a real warren of chambers and contains an excellent",
          "This place is the heir church to a monastery which has been on the site for about 1600 years - it breathes history. Fortified on a hill visible from the Vieux port it almost looks like a castle, but the (well restored) church is beautiful inside. But the gem of this place is the",
          "great Church, oldest...crypt to be visited..many classical concerts have been made in it...wonderful view over the old port...",
          "Very nice abbaye, a must while in Marseille. The view from there is very nice two and it is just a stroll from the city center.",
          "I staggered from my hotel to the abbey not under the influence of the local sauce but as a result of a strained achilles tendon. What do you mean attention seeking? It is one of several churches that claim to be the oldest in France. The interior is sparse and does indeed give",
          "Mysterious on the outside, much like a castle ruin. There was a Bach concert when we walked by. The small train passes by",
          "Old, but damp church. Only cover if you have the time. Located just above the marina area. Nice seating area outside.",
          "Don't expect anything like Catedrale de la Major or Basilique de Notre Dame de la Garde. However, if you have time, visit it.",
          "Plan your visit to this church while going to Notre Dame Basilica. It is on the way and a definite visit must be done on the way. Otherwise, you can just visit but it is not a necessary stop since you may see lot of churches like that all around France.",
          "Fabulous from the outside, Don't miss the crypt. There is also a very nice bakery right near it that specializes in the local \"cookie\" - Navette",
          "People say this is the oldest church in France. It is very, very old, predates essentially everything except the Greek ruins by the shopping center. Feels extremely old. Not to be missed, a very interesting atmosphere. Check out the crypt, as others have said, and usually",
          "Its a nice walk up the JFK Corniche. The view towards the port is promising, though not as spectacular as from the Basilica Notre Dame. There was a marriage ceremony during our visit, therefore the whole area was bustling with activity. The interiors are quite sober. We did not",
          "Founded in the 5th.century by a monk,St.Cassien it was enlarged from the 11th.to 14th centuries. It is Marseilles finest piece of religious achitecture. The crypt is incredible and well worth a visit-there is a small charge. It contains sarcophagi, catacombs and the cave of St",
          "If you want to visit this place, try to see first the video film (at the right side of the entrance), so you understand a little it the complexe structure of this place. The crypt is a must if you visit the abbaye. But don't expect too much here !",
          "the building looks great around sunset. From the square nearby you will appreciate the view over the vieux port. The Abbaye itself is quite austere inside. We stayed on Saturday evening for a mass which was veery long due to many songs, be prepared to spend over 1h!",
          "As it is one of the oldest builing it is worth a visit while in the neighbourhood. The \"famous\" crypt is not worth the money. They show a free movie about the crypt in the church (wrong place: this should be in the crypt itself) , but since the building history of the area is",
          "Saint Victor is a very medieval looking church both on the outside and inside. When we went there on Sunday there was a church service occurring so you couldn't look around too much. There wasn't too much to see inside, however it had a great view of the port from the outside.",
          "The Abbaye St. Victor is very beautiful and a nice place to check out after you have seen other parts of Marseille. If you are only there for one day, I would say there are other more important sites to see. However, if you have a bit more time, it is a lovely place to check out",
          "Do not miss this place particularly the crypt (2 euros charge) underneath the church which dates back to the 5th century ac. It is a beauty. When you exit go towards the port and take one of the best pictures of the port and its surroundings. A bit further on the same street",
          "This very plain stone church dates back to the 5th century. Step inside to experience the beauty in its simple design and architecture. Stroll around the perimeter and see the case of relics, sit in the pews and reflect while gazing at the alter. Imagine the stories the stone",
          "A very old abbey located in the Vieux Port area in an elevated position so requires a short climb. Very simple outside and inside. A contrast to the highly decorated cathedrals so a limited amount to see but it is easy to get to.",
          "The old abbey and all it included does not exist anymore, and only the church remains. And it's not one of the nicest churches I've seen.",
          "Oldest cathedral in this city, the church has an interesting history, and is worth a visit to understand the early years of Marseille",
          "This is a wonderful old church and worth the visit. Bear in mind that the catecombs are currently closed and all you can do is watch a video tour (very disappointing). Still, there are some relics on display (including literally the front of someone's skull). It also has nice",
          "Having first been to Notre Dame de la Garde a vist to Abbaye Saint Victor gives you the most wonderful contrast. So simple yet so beautiful with wonderful music playing at the time of my visit. A visit it the catacombs is a must and great value at 2 euro.",
          "The abbey church is very lovely gothic. The windows are neat. There is a crypt containing the remnants of a previous church that has an additional entrance charge. Nice place to walk downhill from Notre Dame dela Garde.",
          "This old abby is amazing. From the moment you see the unique exterior, to the damp and old smell as you enter, to the Incredible Crypts below (very much worth the 2 euro charge!), you will be taken to another time and place. After your visit the views of the port are also",
          "Pure early gothic church, where you can enjoy practicing musicians in a calm atmosphere, wich is a blessing in roaring Marseille",
          "Great view across the port from outside and the outside of the building is impressive sitting just across from Fort Saint Nicolas. Typical interior although the caretaker had put out lovely fresh roses from the market so the church was quite fragrant.",
          "It is located close to the harbour and now is under construction, but still keeps a specific spirit of old and calm place. If you will come here, you should definetily visit \"Four des Navettes\" - 136, rue Sainte - it's a very old bakery, they make real navette, it's a Provence",
          "I visited Marseille firstly because I wanted to adore the relics of the saints. At many other european churches and cathedrals relics are usually kept at some places non-accessible to public and one can worship them only being in a group of pigrims. But at Abbaye Saint Victor",
          "visited this beautiful abbey with relics of st victor and other saints as well situated near the port area. During our visit the side of the abbey is under construction where the main entrance situated but there is no trouble for us to visit as its still open for public.",
          "This Abbaye was a lovely building comes highly recommended. We caught the metro there and returned via the tram. Well worth a visit.",
          "The abbey was being restored when I visited,so could'nt get as many nice photos id have liked,but it is stunning to look at,and the view of Marseille from up there,especially at night when the sun is just going down is quite spectacular.",

          "This is a huge park, close to the Corniche and the Med. This is a place where people enjoy to go for a stroll, run or simply rest. Children will love it. You can find a place to sit or even go for a drink. This is simply the place where the Marseillais go if they want to get",
          "Close to the sea, a happy surprise to have such a calm oasis close to the busy streets. A must go for every one. Just go to the little lake, order a \"ros\u00e9\" and enjoy the sweet idleness",

          "This is a big parc with lakes, botanic gardens, a castle and many birds. You may enjoy the mostly quiet atmosphere within the usually busy and loud city of Marseille. The parc offers many playgrounds for kids. As the parc is located close to the sea, you have a great view from",
          "Wonderful place with something for everyone... shade, sun, playgrounds, merry-go-rounds, a museum, peacocks~ The only negative: terrible bathrooms... although maybe now that the Chateau has reopened, there is another option.",
          "Very nice parc close to Marseille city center, but also close to the Prado beach, easily reachable by public transport - bus 83 or 19 - Metro rond point du prado. It is a lovely place to rent a bike and cycle with the kids before a nice pic nic on the grass.",
          "No dogs allowed. This park is big and beautiful but needs a good scrub! The grounds were littered with cigarette butts, food wrappers, tall weeds growing through the cracks in the street and homeless people sleeping on benches. However, looking past the garbage, the park was",

          "We spent 2 weeks in Marseille so had time to take a picnic to Borely park. Lots of lovely grassed area to sit on. You need to chose a day where there is very little wind! And be prepared to have quite a walk if going by car - chances are you will have to park at quite a distance",
          "Thepark's main attraction is the Musee Borely it is being renovated ,may open in April Park itself is large but not worth the detour by itself",

          "This is a peaceful, soothing park to stroll through in the midst of a very busy city. We visited the Botanic Gardens at the same time and met a very helpful receptionist who was so proud of the gardens. Worth a visit. In good weather, take a picnic. Catch a No 82 bus and",
          "Loved this huge park. Brink your roller blades or bikes and a snack. Or rent the fun multi person bikes by the hour. Loads of families and grass to stroll. After the park, take a five minute walk to the beach at the end of the park. You could spend a whole day at this park and",
          "Lovely park to wander round, there is a botanical garden, boating lake, rose garden and plenty of places to sit and take in the views. But the loos were awful and should be avoided. You can even watch the horse racing at the adjoining track.",
          "One of the more civilized, pleasant places in Marseille, this is a park where locals come to relax and get a sense of space. It is a short walk from the sea, and close to Pointe Rouge. If you are a local, this is a great place to unwind. But if you are a visitor (especially one",

          "We spent 3 weeks in the septieme and visited all the surroundings. We rented our bikes just in front our house and we used them to reach all the sea side attractions. You can spend all your day between Prado plages and Borely park, everybody will be satisfied, from the kids to",
          "I don't know if this will become a March tradition, but for the World Water Forum, the city of Marseille had an amazing Mediterranean themed carnival parade at Parc Borley - giant mermaids, hydraulic stilt walkers, dancers, acrobats, and pirates clearly representing a wide swath",

          "Great way to see Marseille by 'train' from the port to the Basilica (with an amazing view). Going up and down the hills of the city was a lot of fun.",
          "Awesome ride through the back streets and up to the church. A must do.",
          "Although we haven't taken it, I think the hop-on hop-off bus (ColorBus) might be a better option for route 1. It's difficult to actually see anything from the \"train\" and we could barely hear the audio commentary due to traffic and road \u2026",
          "Great way to see and experience this port area and the Cathedral on top of the hill. Signs that are posted on top at the Cathedral will warn you be mindful of your possessions. Some stair climbing. But spectacular views.  Enjoy",
          "At Euro 8 per person, excellent value for money. We took the tour that goes up to the Notre Dame and it was a wonderful ride. Very scenic with spectacular views of the city, the bay and the ocean. We spent an hour or so at the Cathedral, \u2026",
          "Very well organized, 5 languages presentation, comfortable ride!",
          "Excellent thought by government to show tourists their city in minimal price.",
          "Lovely little train that brings you all around the touristic spots of Marseille at an affordable price.",
          "I only had a one night stay in Marseille so this was a great way to see some of the sights of Marseille and tour the Basilica which seems to be the major sight.\n\nThe train has a stop at the Basilica where you can spend as little or as much \u2026",
          "Very good idea to have a tour with this mini-train going up to the Notre Damme de la Garde, passing along the seaside and facing Chateau d\u2019If.",
          "Good little tour up to the church with frequent enough trains that at most we waited minutes to board there and back. I didn't really follow the audio but it was available in at least English and German (I'm assuming French and maybe \u2026",
          "Nice sightseeing machine :)) Nice trip around the city.",
          "Nothing much by themselves, but it's a long way up (repeating, up!) to Notre Dame de la Garde. This is the way to go!",
          "great experience! really enjoyed this. would recommend taking a train around sunset.",
          "Best little \u201ctrain\u201d ride to bring you to Norte dame church. It\u2019s like a tram in Disney world. They have 2 circuits(paths). Circuit 1 goes to the church. I took circuit 1. No other stops. Good way to take some pics of you are going to the church.",
          "Great way to see Marseille in comfort and fun. Lovely helpful driver too, when we panicked about our return , a flight back home to take! ( We just skipped the basilica and jumped in another little train)",
          "A great service, 8 Euros for the return trip to Notre Dame church at the top of the hill....a long steep climb so this is the better option over walking it! Comes with a commentary, although it didn't always work properly so we missed \u2026",
          "Perfect way to visit all the sights in Marseille and a nice way to hide away from the sunshine a bit. (Trains have a roof). During the trip information about the sights is shared in French, English, Spanish and sometimes German and Italian \u2026",
          "Train ride was cool. Pretty quick though, you won't t be able to take pics",
          "You have to do the train ride while in Marseille! It takes you along very nice panoramic road to another must-see place: Notre Dame. Worth every cent!",

          "Amazing! Great route to the basilica and back, you can see some parts that, personally, I would not visit by foot or public transport. Trains run frequently and there are two routes, I picked this one up to Notre-Dame de la Garde and I\u2019m pleased!",
          "We took circuit 1 to the Basilica. The ride up was very pleasant with beautiful views along the way. I would have liked to have had more information and a chance to stop at the arch for a moment. The ride back from the basilica was very full and not as pleasant. But overall it was worth the ticket price just to get to the Basilica.",
          "It\u2019s nice \nCan take you to many place around the city \nNice prices \nValue of many \nShould try it",
          "marseille is so good! u can walked thru the city center and never got bored!",
          "Visiting a foreign city can be disorienting so I like to take a city bus tour to get a basic overview early in the day. \n  I enjoyed the Petit Trains tour in Marseille. The tour included a multilingual audio commentary which was \u2026",
          "How would I know? They didn't give me no stinking ride?  Toot-toot!",
          "Train was \u20ac8 and a great way to see some of the city. 20 minutes stop at the basillica.",

          "Tourist trap... they literally run through the sites you visit... don't waste your time, it's better to take a city bus and visit the main spots and spend the time you want on each one of them...",

          "Very nice way to tour Marseille.",
          "Lovely trip to Notre Dame on the train. Information given about various sites on route. Very well organised and good value",
          "Amazing experience but just wish the train would've went along more coastal routes. Otherwise it is a nice way to see the coast and the Notre Dame de La Garde and the views were amazing.",
          "This was a nice train ride to to top of Notre Dame de la garde. It cost eight euros and comes pretty frequently. They take you on a park with some nice views on the way to the top. Only downside is they give you 25 minutes at the top which is only enough time to take a few photos.",
          "We took a cab to the top of the hill to see the cathedral then happened upon the Petits Trains. Great ride down the hill into the harbor with a commentator.",

          "I absolutely loved Marseilles and everything about it.",
          "Nice tour, although the information/descriptions provided by the recorded audio guide is a bit poor",
          "See a lot of main sites without walking but you get what you pay for. Audio sound bites aren\u2019t super informative and you are open to traffic fumes, congestion and the occasional breeze. But at least you don\u2019t have to climb uphill to the cathedral. And the people are nice and trains seem frequent.",
          "Wonder mini train which takes u to Notre Dame cathedral",
          "Great way to see Notre-dame de la Garde, good value for money.",
          "The train was fine and the route really nice. We were travelling with two small children though and security was quite lax. There was only a small chain closing the compartments and we had to make sure they didn't fall off. The information \u2026",
          "It is very good way to see some of the best  attractions of Marseille. For us that was great opportunity to rest a little bit in the way to beautiful Notre Dame cathedral.",
          "Nice little train ride to the NotreDame if you choose the green route\nThey only give you 25 minutes to explore it and then you have to hop back on the train to be left where you started the ride\nIt's nice if you want to save yourself from the walk\n8 euros a person I believe",
          "Amazing trip to Notre dame de La Grade\ud83d\ude0d",
          "Rubbish! \nSqueeze 4 adults in 1 bench.\nVery uncomfortable.\nCommentary hard to understand, by the time English comes up you have passed what it may have been discussing.\nYou are better off getting the number 60 bus. I wish that we had.",
          "Good to walk around and stop for drinks",
          "We saw Les Petits Trains but didn't get on - The que's went on forever so didn't try - The price was very cheap - they looked cute - appeared comfy and I think they had a broadcast commentary about Marseilles",
          "Good little tourist activity and only 8 EUR pp. English commentary provides some unintentional amusement \ud83d\ude00",
          "Nice way to get up to de la Garde",

          "A good way to explore marseilles it's a very good route .... via France",
          "Was a lovely place right on the water way nice and easy to town and walks but a great disappointment was the roudy gipsys that were permanently parked on the place with rubbish every were way a shame for the town and proper camping car people",
          "Not bad for the price",
          "Have taken both the planned to rides around Marseille. An interesting way to spend 45 to 60 minutes. As other reviewers have said if you\u2019re here in the middle of the summer do expect a fairly hot and uncomfortable ride as a result as there \u2026",
          "Worth 8 euros to go up to Notre dame.",
          "Very beutiful place.",
          "The night view is good here!",
          "Fun if you have little time to visit marseille",
          "A very easy way to see the Old Port of Marseille and the long winding panoramic view leading up to Notre Dame De la Garde. Audio of points of interest along the way in a few languages. Very reasonable at 8 Euro per person.  Allows more time to see the sights!",
          "Overall a nice experience, a bit shorter than advertised ~20-30 minutes for circuit one, and they said it will take approximately 1 hour",

          "Another good way to see the sights of Marseille.  Not such good views as on the bus but still great little ride.",
          "Fairly priced. Marseille is delightful",
          "Expect whiplash. But worth it",
          "Great to be there's...",
          "Great for just riding and seeing the city",
          "A good way to get a high level impression of Marseille in an hour or two.  These trains are pretty common in the South of France.  Unlike most of the others, this one allows you to get off in the middle and get back on, which is a nice \u2026",
          "An inexpensive and enjoyable tour of the water-front of Marseilles leading to an amazing church built atop a hill overlooking all of Marseilles and the sea and islands therein; worth taking it instead of walking especially since the road up the church is quite steep.",
          "Very great but the ride was kinda short than they said :)",
          "I love little trains and always find it hilarious that they are packed with adults. \n\nThere are 2 routes to choose depending where you want to visit.\n\nI made a basic mistake of forgetting about european long lunches, artiving just as they \u2026",
          "We stumbled upon the petit train while attempting to do the tourist walks. Finding the train was wonderful, especially on a hot day. Open aired and nice simple facts about the area in multiple languages. Sometimes you needed to be quick \u2026",

          "Great French Town.",
          "Comfortable train ride if not more than 3 people on each bench.",
          "A fabulous way to get up quite a large hill. Undoubtedly the highlight is the Lady and the Kid. Look out for her.",
          "Little bit of a guide in English, french, Italian and German. Takes the costal route up the hill and the straight route back. View from the top is excellent. Notre Dame is beautiful inside, unlike organised religion in general.",

          "It's OK put very cramped seating",
          "This was one fun ride. ! !",
          "Worth it for the view from the basilica alone......but go inside and wow.",

          "Good",
          "One of the best ways to experience Marseille, strategically placed next to the harbor it easy to access and also an affordable way to witness the most famous places in Marseille like the Notre-Dame de la Garde on top of the mountain. This \u2026",

          "Excellent way to sightseeing the city if you are on a tight schedule. We reached Notre Dame de la Garde in half hour with a recorded voice in French and English telling bits about the places we were passing through. 8\u20ac return ticket. Totally worth it.",

          "It is the precise way to know the narrow streets of Marseille, comfortable, with precise comments on the attractions of the city. Reasonable price. Both routes, 1 or 2 have the same value, I decided for the second one, which shows the old city.",
          "I waited awhile before reviewing the \"train\". It is a great way to see Notre Dame which I highly recommend seeing. It is beautiful inside and out. You can stay as long as you like there unless it's late in the day and the train has stopped running. I spent about 40 minutes",
          "We'd paid more than the e8 price of this trip, for a 'pint' the previous evening, so this train ride was excellent value. With only the morning to spend in Marseille before catching the airport bus, the hotelier advised us that this train ride was the best thing to do, and it",
          "We caught this from the old port. It's like something from a kid's TV show. There are a couple of different trips, we did the one to the basilique - Notre Dame De La Garde. It takes about 20 minutes and takes you through streets you probably wouldn't see otherwise. There",
          "The train drives you besides beautiful touristic sides of Marseille. During the tour to Notre dame de la Garde you will cross the city and see beautifull views of the sea and the small islands in front of the coast. Chateau d'If, Plage Catalan and many other famous attractions.",
          "Thanks for the tourist trip on the petit train a few days ago. It was good, apart from one thing - this was the stop at Notre-Dame De La Garde - this spoilt the tour for me. Up until then the trip had been in five languages, but when the driver announced the stop it was only",
          "This little toad train took us on a very interesting trip, we went on circuit 1 which took us to Notre Dame de la guarde. It was spoken in several languages so was easily understood",
          "I loved this! Here's what happens: Go to the ticket office and buy tickets for approx \u20ac8 each adult. Ticket office is searchable on google maps if you type in petit train marseille. We then got straight onto a train which was waiting for all the tourists. Recommend that you",
          "Enjoyed our trip on Le Petit Train in Marseille (route 1), and we felt it was really good value. \u20ac8 per adult for the round trip (\u20ac4 for under 12s), with a stop at Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde and regular return trains allowing you to stay at the basilica as long as you",
          "The train (which is really a small truck pulling open air carriages) leaves from the harbour and drives around the seafront and up to the Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde. It is a great drive up the very windy and extremely steep streets and provides excellent views of the",
          "We were on a cruise and had little time. The train gaves a city tour on the way to Notre Dame and it's wonderful views. Great value.",
          "A good way to get oriented and to see the most interesting parts of Marseilles. One sevice goes to the Panier and the other along the Calanquesto Notre Dame de la Garde. Each is worth the trip.",
          "Normally, my husband and I are slightly bemused by adults who use these forms of transportation but on this occasion we felt it was the best option. 8\u20ac each for a return to Notre Dame - don't try and walk there! - the train takes you along the old port with a commentary giving",
          "There are two lines, one going round the old town, and the other connecting the old port with the Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde. The auto train is moving slowly and is a very good way to explore the city. However, the organization and service are very bad.",
          "Petit Train Marseille is wonderful way to see Maseille. The train has 3 routes so actually you can discover Marseil with this little train.",
          "This was a fun train around Marseille and then to Notre-Dame de la Garde. It took us around places in Marseille that we wouldn't have ordinarily seen BUT when we got to the top to go into the Basilica there was a massive tour of over a hundred people waiting to get on the train",
          "We bought A 3 day city pass should have given us 3 journeys on the train that you only need to ride twice to we both tours. We went back for our second tour and were treated with disrespect, annoyingly he didn't even scan the passes first time round. So officially we never",
          "We bought our tickets at the Visitor Bureau, but you can get them at the train starting point (alongside the harbor). A couple of things to be aware of: the train makes only one stop, at the Notre Dame Cathedrale, and moves pretty fast so it really is just an orientation ride.",
          "Seemed like a good idea. The tour route was very good and the train is neat and clean. Lines are long waiting to get on it both at the office and at the top of the mountain. The staff is friendly and seemed to be having fun. The big problem is with the audio narration, it is",
          "1/2 way up one side of Vielle Port is the little train that could, and does give you a comprehensive tour of Marseille....including the Basilique Notre Dame on top of the hill. Buy your ticket right away and then stand in line for up to 1 hour to get on a train.",
          "\u20ac8 per adult the train takes the coastal road up & a direct route back down. We sat at the front of the train on the way up & you couldn't really hear the commentary but sat at the back on the way back down & you could clearly hear the commentary in English. Well worth the money",
          "This little train took us on a big ride around this city saving our legs from walking up and down. The train ride gives you a overview of this beautiful city and you could go back to check out any particular spot.",
          "Do not miss it !! No matter how long you are going to stay in the city, first thing to do is taking this tour !! so you got the main views of that chaming city . You sit in a small train that takes you to the other side of the city, up to the highest point of Marseille -to the",
          "You can take the local bus to the top of the hill to visit the church for about 2 euros, as opposed to the little train at 7euros, but you get a good commentary, it's more fun and a great way to see the town.",
          "We were traveling by cruise ship and wanted something easy (and inexpensive) to do in Marselles. We took the bus from the ship terminal to town and rode the Petit Train up to Notre Dame de la Garde. It was a little chilly, but really sunny and nice. When you arrive at the",
          "Land trains are often a good way to get the feel of a town or city, but this one is a must because it takes you up to the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde. They set off every half hour and make their way beside the Old Port before winding their way along back streets and",
          "The \"Little train\" is good opportunity to get up the Notre Dame church in Marseille when you do not want study the local transport plans. Tired from walking I really appreciated the chance to sit and look. I would five the maximum \"stars\" but there is one thing that I have",
          "There was a sizeable queue, not surprising given our visit was in peek summer season, but the ticket booth cut through the queue in fairly quick order. The train chugs around the harbour with some great views out to see. I'd have probably learnt a lot but the speaker in our",
          "If you have limited time in Marseille this little tour is a fun, easy way to have a quick look around. It's a cute, open train that goes right up to the beautiful Notre-dame de la Garde on the top of the hill. On the way you see stunning views, plus they narrate the journey in",
          "Took the coach into Marseille from the cruise ship terminal. Walked near the harbour and found this tour train. Waited about 15 minutes to get on. Enjoyed the trip around the waterfront to the Basilica. Was quite the delay at the Basilica to return to the harbour - about 45",
          "Used this option on recent cruise visit to Marseille City, had 15 min wait, but use for easy access to Notre Dam",
          "The local buses for 1.50\u20ac per day take you to all the same places. A local bus goes to exactly the same spot at the main cathedral. A lot cheaper and you can get a bus map at the station",
          "Makes life a whole lot easier to get up to the Basilica, especially if you have children, and providing you also with a trip along the coast with views of Chateau d'If island. Lineups can be long but if you come early, when it opens, you'd be fine.",
          "Nice little ride on the train up to the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde. Cuts out a lot of time that would be spent walking. Commentary give on the ride in multiple languages. Regular trains leaving the port and the Notre Dame. Journey back to the port is great fun with a few",
          "Route one takes you to the top of the hill and Notre Dame cathedral for eight euros which is worth the money. On the downside there's not much else to the tour (although maybe that's Marseille than the tour!). Didn't take route two as Le Panier is not a nice place to walk",
          "I had read several reviews regarding the Petit Train as a nice way to get a feel for Marseille. We took a taxi from the cruise port to the center of town. After having breakfast, we located the site to board the the Petit Train. There was really nothing spectacular about the",
          "The ticket person in the booth a male who speaks good English is a thief. He gave change for 50 but it was a 100 that I tendered. He immediately gave me the remaining 50 once I challenged him. So it makes me think he is well versed in his ruse and makes a bundle this way. The",
          "I thought this might be a bit of fun, but no. This was a disappointing and very uncomfortable experience. They wait until the train is absolutely busting with tourists before leaving. Squeezing in as many as possible so that EVERYONE is uncomfortable. The seats are very cramped",
          "- Tain N\u00b0 2 Cath\u00e9drale la Major - Indeed, it's a train for tourists, but what a rip-off! Drop the price so everyone can enjoy this scenic tour. It's not just the substantial charge of 8euro per person, but the waiting prior to departure. They advertise tours departing every",
          "There are three train options that start on the North side of the old port. We took train one (8\u20ac pp) to Notre Dame de la Garde. While we were there this train departed every 20 minutes; our departure was maybe 6 or 7 minutes late. The train takes you along the coast line",
          "It depends on which train you get on as to whether it's worth the 8 euros. Yes, do take train number 1 to the basilica. No, don't bother with train number 2 to The Pannier. The Basilica for its views of the town and islands is great, but the inside of the basilica is stunning.",
          "This is an economical way to get to the top of the hill and Notre Dame de la Garde. The route to Notre Dame de la Garde provides views of the harbor and other sites. You can get off the train at Notre Dame de la Garde and spend time viewing Notre Dame and taking in the views,",
          "Cute little tram, and a convenient way to get to Notre Dame and back to the port. It was a good way to get a tour of the city and not too pricey. There are two routes that go to different parts of Marseille. The one we took had stops every 20 minutes to drop off and pick up",
          "It's cool for a fast visit, I took the first route to go to the church and it was really nice. The total time of the tour is about 1h10",
          "We caught train number 1 which climbs up the hill from the harbour to the Notre Dame De la Garde. An interesting ride through the narrow streets to the church. There is a commentary in four languages. French, English, German and Spanish. When you have finished seeing the church",
          "Unless you are an avid hill-walker then this is the mode of transport in Marseille for you. There are two trains, one brings you to Bascilla de Notre Dame de la Garde and the other to the Panier area. I would recommend doing both one takes about 1 and a half hours and the",
          "We took the Petit Train from the start point on the port for 8\u20ac.

We travelled",

          "A great way to see the city and go to the Notre Dame De La Garde which has the most beautiful stunning views. Had trouble hearing because of the group behind me. They spoke very loudly everytime the recording spoke english. You stop at the top and can catch a train back every",
          "This train ride around this beautiful city is well worth the fare. The church of Notre- Dame de la Garde at the top of the hill is truly stunning with amazing views back towards the old port and the IHG hotel Dieu ( well worth a stay if your lotto numbers come up!!) the fact",

          "We went on both Circuits 1 and 2. Circuit 1 is by far the better option. The road train takes you right up to Notre-Dame De La Garde, an imposing church built high above the city. There is a commentary in English but also on several other languages so you only got brief",
          "We went on the circuit 1 trip up to Notre Dame. A reasonably priced and novel way to see some of the beautiful coastline and Notre Dame. The commentary was helpful also. A lovely way to spend a couple of hours.",

          "We didn't experience anyone being rude or disrespectful at all and we only had three to a row. These trains run in several cities across the South of France and were a great way to get an overview of the city and pick up a bit of history at the same time. Much cheaper than the",
          "One ride is included in the Marseille City Pass, so we took the train that stops at Notre dam. The ride gets quite bumpy occasionally and it amazes me, how the driver is able to navigate in the narrow streets with all other traffic around him. Also on the way back, there is a",
          "Should not be surprised as these folks were not just rude but extremely disrespectful. If you don't have 4 people to each row they scream at you. I did not care too much but others around me were visibly shaken. For 8 euros we should not expect great service. The train ride",
          "Efficient way to see Marseille especially if you are traveling with young children or have limited time. There are two circuits both starting from the port (nearer towards MuSEM) with one going around Le Panier and the other to Notre Dame de la Garde (great views of the city",
          "For only 8 Euros we had an hour and 15 minute tour of the city which I think is very good value, my only gripe is where the train stops you must get off you can't stay on for the return leg",
          "There are two different routes but we choose the blue one (which goes up to Notre Dame de la Garde). The climb was rough and it would have been difficult to walk there, so I believe that our choose was the right one. There is also an audio guide which explains what you see along",
          "The train takes you up to the Basillica at the top of the hill overlooking Marseille and the view from the top is fantastic. You really see the whole city and with the commentary you get an idea of why and how it is/was set up.",
          "I expected Marseille to be an industrial city, with few tourist attractions, but nothing is further from the truth! It's a beautiful city with lots of attractions, very clean, very friendly and spectacular views. I would highly recommend this for a visit. The Train Turistique is",

          "This train comes with the city pass (best deal of any city pass I've bought since) and gives a nice overview of the city, plus a ride up to Notre Dame de la Garde. Having been in Europe for a couple months now, this church still stands out as one to see!",
          "Reasonably priced (\u20ac8) way to get an overview of the old port area. Good commentary in both French and English. Stop off at the Basilique is great and then get another train back down when you have finished taking in the views and exploring the basilique.",
          "Great long ride around the town went right up to the cathedral and you could get off then get back on another one, but we stayed on the train, good look around the town, saves your feet , great for people who struggle walking around they should have these in all the ports, good",
          "We were only in Marseilles for the day and had one main attraction we wanted to see and that was the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde! On a scorching July day though the last thing we wanted to do was walk up the hill to it! This is where the Petit Train comes in - leaving",
          "The little train was good enough gave you a little commentary as you went along. It took you round where you may not have walked to as Nortre Dame is at the very top of a very high hill overlooking the city. To walk from the port would take even a very fit young person 45min to",

          "Possibly the best way to see the Notre Dame de la Garde basilica: the trip (once you've decided not to be embarrassed by sitting in an overgrown Disneyesque toy train) takes in a great swathe of the city, and corniche and the follies of the 19th century super-rich on its way up",
          "Like other reviewers we took the train from the Vieux Port to the Cathedral way up at the highest point in the city. While you do not want to walk to the Cathedral, I cannot say that I would recommend this mode. The train moves very quickly and is a bumpy and uncomfortable ride.",
          "The little train could use some new shocks; it was quite an uncomfortable ride. We took it primarily to get to the Notre Dame basilica and were told that we'd have 30 minutes to explore the church and its environs. However, we were only given 20 minutes, which is insufficient",
          "Marseille is the underdog of French cities. On this hour long ride through the city, you will see some of the best sights of the city and get a little bit of history along the way. In many ways, this is a good introduction to the city and will help you identify some of the spots",
          "There are 2 routes on the petit train. Train 1 heads up the hill toward Notre dame de garde, which is where we wanted to go, and we could not walk that distance, and we figured it would be faster than the city bus. Cost 8 euros, It was a typical petit train tour like in most",

          "It was such a relief to find these little trains, we wanted to go see the cathedral but it is situated high up on the hill. This was a great way to save your legs. The price was really reasonable for a round trip and offered a nice break from walking. The only down side of this",

          "Having just checked into our hotel, we had a little stroll along the Vieux Port. Could see Notre Dame up on the hillside but even at 5pm the heat made thoughts of climbing up there unappealing. Then we saw the \" Petit Train\". My partner was not enthusiastic about jumping aboard",
          "Was almost put off this by the name but was glad I wasn't. I got the city pass so this was included. Not only did it save my legs up the hill, but it took me to parts of the city that I would otherwise never have seen. The expert drivers wind up some crazy narrow hills and there",
          "This is a great way to aquaint yourself with Marseille, and you can find where you want to visit your self on foot, we took the Notre Dame circuit and it was worth it. They leave you at the bassillica, you can stay as long as you want and the train stops to pick you up every 20",

          "We took the tour but found the audio difficult to hear. We also did not know that you were required to disembark at the Notre Dame. We took advantage of the time to take photos of the scenery and visit the Notre Dame. The driver told us he would be back in 25 minutes so we",
          "We took this train to Notre Dame and it was worth my 8 euros. We could see everything from in the train and we arrived exactly in front of Notre Dame. The positive thing is you don't have to walk all the way to Notre Dame. The downside is that you can't just hop off wherever you",
          "We took the Notre Dame tour,which was a mistake. Whilst you do get a good view of the properties on the way to Notre Dame, and the view from there is fantastic, that's about as good as it gets. It seemed that every ten feet he was braking or changing gear each time with a",
          "The petit train goes to the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde which has a beautiful view of Marseille. The trip itself takes about 1,5 hour incl. a 20 minutes stay at the Basilique. You see a lot of Marseille, different neighborhoods and views of the ocean. A real good way to get",
          "Joined the train on the waterfront stop. Took both the Panier tour, which is the nearby area, and the trip up to Notre Dame le garde. 7 and 8 Euros each. Recorded audio tour presented in French, English, German and Italian. Enjoyed both tours.",
          "These little French trains are always a good choice to get an initial idea of the city you are visiting; the one in Marseilles is no exception. Listening to a historic narrative while being chauffeured through narrow, winding and often quite steep streets, was a relaxing way to",
          "This is a city tour, and it works, in fact it's the second time I've done a city tour of this type and both have been worthwhile. A fast and effective way to capture a city area without the frustration of having to find your own way around. The tour offers a guide in about 6",
          "The lines were too long to take the train to Notre Dame so we took the other route Panier District which the little train was able to find its way through the narrow streets. The audio was good & we learnt a lot of this part of Marseille, with good stops for pictures.",
          "This train/activity was worth it. This was a simple way to get around Marseille and see the sights. I would HIGHLY recommend using this train, or the bus, to get to Notre Dame. The hills are steep and walking up them would not be a very fun experience. Anyway, we would",
          "Marseille is a city I've never had a desire to visit even after 17 visits to France but our cruise stopped there for an entire day so we made the most of it. It is pretty much as I expected, mostly modern and ugly though the old harbor is attractive. We took the petit train in",
          "This mini-train goes around the old port, along the corniche and all the way up to Notre-Dame de la Garde (easiest way to get there). You get great views of the port, the city, and the islands. Takes 1.5 hours. Time well spent.",
          "With a couple of hours to kill in the evening, I opted for the train ride which brought me to the Notre Dame ~ in my opinion it's the best way to get up there on a sweltering hot summer afternoon. The journey was amazing, with stunning views of the Corniche on the way and",
          "We stumbled upon this train right after starting to discover the city. I was wondering how to get up to the cathedral and then the answer was right there at the harbour. It costs only a few euros and saves you lots of energy. On the way up (downwards it's less spectacular) one",
          "Well worth your time to go and find the starting point for this little train - choose circuit #1, pay your E8 and take a load off, enjoy the ride along the seafront up to the Notre Dame - much better than schlepping up the hill and back. BE WARNED: they will force you to get off",
          "We took the train up to the Cathedral Notre Dame de la Garde, and it's certainly the best way to get up there - I wouldn't want to walk all that way even if I could find the route. However, there is no choice about where you sit. The staff bark their orders as to where you can",
          "We took the train tour that went to Notre-Dame de la Garde. There is a ticket booth at the harbor where the trains leave from. It was about a half hour ride through town and then up to the Basilica, where you can stay and catch a train later.... although you may have to wait in",
          "We easily found the ticket booth right at the main harbor, had to wait in a line up for about half and hour but it was well worth it. We took the longer tour that took us up to the basilica where there are amazing panoramic views of the bay and the cities. You are able to stay",
          "Marseille drivers are crazy so this was a nice way to visit the city. We took the train up to Notre Dame and passed some great sites along the way. It's also fairly inexpensive and has commentary in English as well as loads of other languages. Great for kids!",
          "We had to queue for quite a while, but the ride was worth it. You get interesting information during the ride, but you're often inhaling the diesel fumes of the rain. Four persons per bench may be a bit tight too.",
          "Petit train Marseilles is brilliant. The staff are polite and friendly trying their best to make your experience a good one. The train does two different trips of which we took the longer one to the basilica. Not only does the train save you a very long walk to the amazing",
          "At the time we went, the petit train was only doing one route - up to the basilica. This was fine, and fairly reasonable as well (otherwise, it's a steep climb). The train can get very cramped, especially if you are not tiny or petite. In addition, when boarding back at the",
          "I had read about this and thought it would be fun so I told my husband about it and it thought it was cheesy and did not want to do it. I talked him into doing it and he hemmed and hawed as we got on board. At the end of the trip he thanked me profusely and said it was a great",
          "Nice and funny ride with 'le petit train touristique'. The train was kind of nice. The way you get to see something of Marseille is really nice. The only thing is, you'll be sitting with 4 persons on the benches in the train. Kind of painfully stuffed. When asking the 'Placier'",
          "We took the Petit Train Marseille to Notre Dame de la Garde. A return journey costs \u20ac8 and it's totally worth it -- especially if you're time pressed. The view from the top is amazing and along the way you get to see parts of the city that you may not be able to get to if you're",

          "We were in Marseille for only a day as we were on a Cruise. This little train was on my list as we had tried many around France and found that they give you a good overall view in a short time. We caught the train in front of the Marina/Port which is something to see on its",
          "Amid the crowds and bustle of Marseille's harbor and captivating buildings, this is a great way to get a panoramic overview of the city. You get to see the harbor basin, the port, nearby islands and back road residences on your way up the steep hill that is capped by the",
          "We took this little tourist train around Marseille up to Notre-Dame de la Garde. The commentary in any language was too brief to be of value. However, it was a pleasant ride around the city and an easy way to get to the church at the top (which has splendid views of the city).",
          "Take a round to the city center and new port. Nice but no something that it will excite you. Go to montecristo place, Better to get train and go cannes or nice",
          "My daughter is a great fan of petit train everywhere she goes. Makes sense since it is such a great way to explore the area. We had a fantastic time riding the train to the top of the hill which we would never have been able to in the hot summer day in August. Easy to get back",
          "Not really a train, more like a tram car. Worth it to get to Notre Dame church. The church has beautiful views .",
          "My husband and I were visiting Marseille as part of our cruise. We took a bus from our pier to the city and explored old town Marseille on our own. It was very interesting to see authentic French cafes and bakeries. We decided to try this little train out and take it up to",
          "After walking all over Marseille on foot, we were ready to have someone else take us to la Notre Dame de la Garde. We took the petit train to the top of the hill. Our ride was 8 euros per person, but it is well worth it. The train takes you along the coast and all the way up to",
          "The ticket booth for the train is a long walk from the metro station at Vieux Port. The line goes pretty fast. Busiest in the morning. They take a hour break around noon. I like the soundtrack that pointed out all the spots along the way. I did both routes and loved both of",
          "95% of why you would take this train is that it\u2019s an easy way to get up the hill to Notre Dame and its great views of Marseilles. There is little to see along the way and the audio soundtrack reflects that. Nonetheless, you do get a sense of part of the city. Unlike some other",
          "This is the best way to get an overview of the city and a bit of the History. Much better value (\u20ac7.00) than the hop-on-hop off bus (\u20ac18). Good frequency too. Get on outside hotel ville (city hall) in Vieux port. 2 routes available - do both - but if ou have time for oly one do",
          "I took this train in Mar. cold but one of the few sunny days. The trip to the Church had spectacular views of the Mediterranean and forts. The view of Marseille from the church was fantastic. The church was beautiful and this was a great way to see the sights.",
          "I took this train ride to see Notre Dame de la Garde when I had a time crunch. I enjoyed the train ride and the beautiful views of the coastline on the way up. The tour included a brief audio dialogue in French, English, and Spanish. They played some music as well. We had a 25",
          "The sights were breathtaking but when we went in February, the wind was blowing too strongly, which made it harder to fully enjoy the sights. If the train were more closed in (like the one in Toledo) that could have enhanced the experience. The commentary was quite poor too.",
          "We have only 1 day to spend while the cruise ship stops at Marseille. Was in Aix-en-Provence in the morning and arrived at Old Port in the afternoon. We have only a few hours, so decided to take the little train for a scenic intro to many parts of the city. Loved the coastal",
          "We took the train because we wanted to visit the Notre Dame de la Garde. It was so cold and windy that day that we couldn't enjoy it. It takes you to areas that you will not visit otherwise. The view from the Notre Dame was amazing and the ride by the coastline was lovely! It's",
          "While waiting in line for the Petit Train, a woman with a supposed baby in her arm cuddled up close to me while several of us were talking. She slipped her hand into my purse and grabbed my wallet, and dropped it as it was fat. Fortunately,my sister saw her do it, and stepped on",
          "brilliant to go up the notre dame de la garde and to visit, it looks a bit touristy but this is what we are!",
          "Liked - good value (7 euros); English commentary; excellent route - along the Corniche and then up to the Notre Dame de la Garde. Trip duration includes a 20-25 minute stop at the church.",
          "We used it for the circular route via Notre Dame. The route covered outbound took us on the coastal road, giving us a great view of the beaches and bays on that part of the coast. We then had 25 minutes at the Basilique which for a general look around was enough. The train stops",
          "We rode Le Petit Train as part of an excursion from our cruise ship. it seemed from the description like a pleasant way to learn about the city, and get a lift to the church on the hill. However, despite supposed to have been an exclusive train for the cruise ship, the",
          "Ha ha, not usually our style, but it was an easy way to get to Notre Dame on the hill and just watch the ocean views. The annoying voice overs in multiple languages kind of ruin the ambience, but no way was I walking up that hill! Fun in a totally touristy way",
          "Train has commentary in several languages. Pick a day when the sky is clear - go late in the day because the light is amazing then. Beautiful basilica at the top with a view to die for. Mosaics inside are superb.",
          "The Petit Train Marseille was worth the 7 Euro price just to not have to walk up the hill. The train had English announcements about different areas in Marseille but only made one stop at the top of the hill at the church. The views along the Mediterranean were beautiful but",
          "The tour starts at the Old Port, snakes through Marseille and on up to the Basilica. Great views of Marseille and islands. We only had one day in Marseille and enjoyed this tour.",
          "The train ride costs 7 eur, but the ride is horrible. The views along the ride are good, but it provides no opportunity to take decent photos. Although it was designed as a touristic ride, it is now functioning as a public transport service for people going up the mountain to",
          "We took the train when our boat trip was cancelled due to rough seas. The ride up to the basilica is beautiful with sweeping views of the Mediterranean. When we arrived at the basilica, the driver told us we had 20 minutes to look around. We arrived back in the parking lot 20",
          "Worth the 7\u20ac to take you to the cathedral and see the few sights there are to see. You get to see basically all the sights on the train.",
          "Only 7Euro gets you to Notre Dame, the only really hilly site to see. I would suggest walking back down, very easy walk and just take every street/steps that lead downwards and you will be back by the harbou in no time! On leaving Notre Dame the queue for the train was very",
          "I did both routes. The old town route was a bit short but interesting. The Notre Dame des Gardes route was much better with fabulous sea views. Do route 1 if you only have time for one trip. Sometimes it was difficult to hear the commentary because of street noise -- perhaps",
          "Very dusty city due to the massive roadworks. Not a great time to visit and wouldnt go again however the little train did the best of a job. Had difficulty finding a place for a beer without a sit down meal",
          "A good way to see the city in a few minutes. Nasednete do vl\u00e1\u010d\u00edku a za okam\u017eik V\u00e1s povede po m\u011bst\u011b a\u017e na vrchol k chr\u00e1mu Notre Dame, kde uvidite cel\u00e9 Marseille.",
          "We were looking forward to the tour but had to queue in the full sun for a fair time and were surprised that although they had the amex logo on the counter they wouldn't accpt the card for payment. The tour round the Panier is a good way to see part of the town you would find",
          "Board this little open air shuttle train right at the Old Port for a interesting ride up the hill high to The Basillica Notre Dame. Good way to see local neighborhood and residents on the way up. Hold on though especially on the way back down!",
          "Good value for a trip around the old port and up to Notre Dame. The English commentary was amusing (statue of the Virgin and kid ). Wouldn't bother with the other route around le Panier again",
          "The train takes about 1 hour and you get to see different areas of the city. It is fun for the whole family.",
          "We rode the Petit Train in each city along the southern coast of France, and for what you get for a minimal cost, its a decent tour. If anything, the view and experience you get from Notre Dame de la Garde is well worth the price!",
          "We used the little train to get to the spectacular church Notre Dame de la Garde which is on top of a rather steep hill. In this way we got both a good look at the city's corniche/coastal road and could check out the church easily.",
          "It's a nice ride to the Notre-Dame, and while on it, enjoy the views, and thank god you didn't went on foot, even the train suffers at such steep roads.",
          "We bought a day travel pass which entitled us to travel on the petit train, we thoroughly enjoyed the trip, it took us to the top of the hill to visit Notre Dame Cathedral, the views were stunning. We took several pictures, there is a nice cafe there but it is not open on a",
          "The train to Notre Dame was nice enough. Worth 7 euros.",
          "The train was somewhat easy to find, we had gotten there early and didn't really notice we were in the right spot until they pulled up right next to us. There is a lot of construction going on in this area and all of downtown Marseille---so Marseille itself was a little",
          "i am disabled and can not walk far my daughter and i boarded the petits train not knowing you must get off at the dame du garde i explained to thh driver i am disabled so it was impossible to get off his manner was disgusting and told me he did not care i must leave the",
          "Great way to see some sights, especially to get all the way up to Notre Dame....",
          "The petit train takes you all round the front of Marseilles working its way up to Notre Dame de La Garde. Getting to the top is half the fun and when you do get to the top the view of Marseille from up there is spectacular as is the actual church itself.",
          "You can pick up the Petit Train in the old Port area but much construction is going on there in 2012. This is the easiest and most cost effective way to see the sights of Marseille and climb the narrow steep streets to Notre Dame du Garde",
          "Great way to get to Notre Dame de la Garde. Good commentary about Marseille.",
          "The young men working at this train were trying to cram about 8 people into each little car where 4 would be comfortable. They were asking me to ride backwards and I said that I would prefer not to I was rudely asked to step aside and wait for the next train (90% of the current",
          "My girlfriend and I paid 7 euro a piece, because we were tired and didn't want to hike all the way up, but the trip was great. We got to see a bunch of the city we wouldn't have seen otherwise.",
          "Perfect ride takes you around the most scenic parts of Marseille. Fun to do with kids.",
          "This train takes you along the Old Port to the mountain with the cathedral Notra Dame de la Gard. Value for money.",
          "Petit Train was an excellent way to see the beach, the Corniche, areas I would have not wandered to. For 7 Euros round trip, I give it a thumbs up.",
          "What a way to travel to the Basilique! A winding, scenic drive that showcases Marseilles, surrounding islands and, ultimately, the Basilique which is certainly unmissable, providing awesome views over all.",
          "Well worth the money to take the train up to the cathedral. And back down. You get a little mini-tour along and way and the cathedral is not exactly walking distance.",
          "This little tour offered a nice break from all of the walking we had been doing. The views are wonderful and the stop at the Basilica was nice. 7 euros seems like a reasonable price for the tour. It is unfortunate that all of the information is given by a recording, although a",
          "i saw it 3 or 4 times passing by and most of the times i saw people sleeping in there. i think it must be quite boring",
          "Easy to discover Marseilles, walking is better ... or ask for a trip with a guide and his Citroen 2CV !",
          "After walking a million steps, a ride is wonderful. This is a cute little train with narration in several languages that takes you to the basilica de la Notre Dame. It is worth the 7 euros to sit and enjoy the ride.",
          "Made the trip with the little train from Old port to Notre Dame de la Garde church on a gorgeous, sunny day and it was a real treat, lots of information, a superb view of the bay, old villas near the sea, the islands and from the top more beautiful views, try to make the trip",
          "The Petit train was an interesting way to see the city, it took us to places that we otherwise wouldn't have seen. With the Marseille City Card, this tour was free of charge. It also is an interesting way to go to the cathedral (Notre Dame) located high above Marseille. Making a",
          "There was very little narration and they crammed us on there with three other people (there were two of us) and we were so squished. It is all about the money they can get, so jsut take the city bus, it is faster and more roomy!",
          "In short this is just a small train that you can use to get a running commentary on Marseille and see all the sights without having to walk. If you are in Marseille for just a couple of hours, this is not a bad option. It doesn't take you anywhere you couldn't get to by public"

On a warm summer day you'll need couple of litres of water, sunscreen and always good shoes as it is very rocky. Take a towel for a refreshing swim and some snacks.

          "The walk wasn't that bad, as long as you are capable of scrambling over a couple of steep sections of rock and take enough water it shouldn't be a problem... you have something to look forward to at the end anyway (the water feels cold no matter how hot the walk makes you).",
          "The hike to d'En Vau Beach is one of those secluded beaches hidden away in the famous French Calanques that make for a memorable story when looking back at your life. Photos of this pristine beach speak for itself & will remain a talking point & a badge of honour for those",
          "Its not easy to get in the place, but once you get there is one of the most beautifull places I have ever visited. I went there in the end of the day, so it was very empty and I could enjoy more with my friends.",
          "I estimate it took two of us 2 hours each way, walking. We're good walkers, but going is slow as many sections are very steep and very rocky. It was also quite busy when we went, a Sunday, and negotiating away round fellow walkers was difficult at times. As many others have",
          "But it was very beautiful. Wear good hiking shoes, bring enough water and go for a few hours. Took us about 3.5 hours.",

          "My wife and I rented a small boat (ones you can operate without license) from JFC Boat in Cassis. It was perfect for visiting Calanques, and while you could not reach the beach area with power boats, it still got us close enough to see the amazing views. Also, we swam in the",
          "All the good things you read about this spot are true. However, be aware that... 1. It is a hike that takes a coule of hours, and it is very steep towards the end. Bring plenty of water. 2. There is no kiosk or anything. See point 1. 3. The water is colder than you might expect,",
          "First of all, it is hard to reach. You have to walk 2 hours up and down. You should have minimum weight, pair of solid shoes and lots of water to drink (At least 3 liters for sunny days). But after all, it totally worth it. This pleace will possibly be your best place to swim"

          "Picturesque place. Fabulous walks and hikes. Highly recommended however ensure to wear comfy trainers, drink plenary of fluids and wear sunscreen!  If you hike it\u2019s not advisable to take children as the terrain can be rocky and very hilly.",
          "Magnificent views, pure nature",
          "Definitely worth it! Especially in combinations with the other calanques. If like us you are walking from the previous one, follow the red and green signs on the rocks. Then continue with the blue ones!",
          "The hike is a little exhausting, but worth it. I\u2019d suggest going in the morning, because it gets very crowded in the afternoon. There\u2019s also not a lot of shade then so it gets very hot. You can easily find a shady spot near a tree in the morning. Bring lots of water.",
          "So so beautiful place! It was pretty crowded  about 12 and people started to leave after 5pm, it was middle of September.  So if you like to stay there in calm atmosphere, come early . Also there is no toilets.",
          "Amazing colours, shade Provided by pine trees. Great for kids since there is no waves. However can be quite crowded even though it is a 30 minute hike. When you are happy to lie on  the rocks you can still have your peace. Will definitely come here again!",
          "Lovely beach \ud83d\ude0a",
          "The beach there is small and crowded",
          "I love it! Love the clear water,\nMy advice: Arrive early in the morning, around 10am it\u2019s full of people. (At least in summer). \nThe path is nice, however is not adapted for an older person, or someone with mobility difficulties.",
          "Beautiful. Get there early to avoid crowds. The walk from cassis is a little hilly but with generally smooth roads and paths, but the final 500m or so is quite rocky. Don't just wear sandals ideally.",
          "We visited Port-Pin today with a kayak from Cassis. An idyllic bay with plenty of wildlife, such as small crabs and mobile \"shells\", if you are looking closely in the water. Quite popular amongst mostly French tourist.",
          "Amazing beach hidden between rocks and cliffs! It's rocky beach so take something soft to lay on as well as water shoes. Oh, and snorkeling kit, it's worth it!",
          "Absolutely beautiful! One of the places you wish only you knew about..\nThere are two ways to get there by foot, on a convenient trail or on the rocks closer to the water. The 2nd takes more time, bit much more satisfying!",
          "Beautiful place. Occasional kayakers, but they are well behaved. Boats are kept out.\nNo sand but plenty too see with a snorkel.\nTook an hour to walk in, but there may be an easier route judging by some of the visitors here.",
          "We can give more than 5star its AMAZING PLACE FOR ALL",
          "Beautiful hike and unique beach setting. A bit hard on you body as it\u2019s a stone beach. Bring beach shoes or flip flops if you want to be comfortable walking in the beach. The hike to the beach is ~30 min but it\u2019s worth it, very picturesque. \u2026",
          "Very load and crowded.",
          "Wonderful, small calanque that would be perfect for a quick dip after a hike in a hot day. Ideal picnic spot.",

          "It is overhyped/overrated for sure. Route is not the easiest and not perfectly established, could be slippery and note that you are climbing on small and sharp rocks. The views are amazing, but the calanques beach is rather small \u2026",
          "Beautiful place to visit.",
          "Looks like swimming pool. Absolutely AVOID in July and August! People are standing in the sea with smartphones. Joke",
          "Incredibly picturesque. Relatively easy hiking trail.",
          "Great. A little crowded but so refreshing after hiking.",
          "Really beautiful place, but be aware that you cannot drive upto the beach. We had to walk about 4-5km each way across mauntain roads. It wasn't easy.\nThis beach is very popular during the summer so expect lots of people. Alos this is not a sand beach.",
          "Lovely area for sun bathing. Clear blue sea worth for trekking. Please beware of unsteady rock on the route.",

          "Overrated. Packed in summer, would probably get two more stars in winter. There are definitely better beaches to spend the day.",
          "Wonderful meeting with nature... You can go in fiotof you are fitt enoughor by kayak, but you can book a biat trip as well.",
          "Wow. Just one word. Superb view and atmosphere. Reaching the beach may be a challenge as trek is quite tough. High slope, very sleepery and narrow foot steps. Be very careful. Carry plenty of water. But after reaching, it is almost heaven.",
          "Amazing. A little piece of paradise",
          "Simply amazing",
          "Wonderful spot for a day trip for swimming and light hiking.",
          "A lovely Calanque. If you have the energy and hike another hour( lot's of scrabbling on loose rocks, not an easy hike but worth it) head to the next Calanque. You can easily spend time at both in a day.",

          "Amazingly beautiful spot.  The fun lies in trekking to this place, to find boats lined on the backwaters of the sea.  Wonderful  of natural Green and blue shades to be appreciated here",

          "Stunning beach and walk",
          "Very steep and uneven path - no access with any kind of wheels. Nevertheless adventurous, en the calanque itself is beautiful. Do go snorkeling, because most of the beauty is underwater!",

          "Wonderful! Must visit",
          "Easiest one to get to from Cassis. About 20 minutes walk from port miou. If you love a good walk I'd suggest en vau.",
          "Clean and tidy beach. Only down side is there was not enough enmities such as renting the parasols or sun beds.",

          "Beautiful but Crouded",
          "If you are planning to hike, prepare for some foods and much time to hike!\nMountain is a little bit steep, but it is located close to ocean, the wind is cool and it worth hiking!\nOn the way to othere calanque( En Bau), I dropped by \u2018de Port Pin\u2019 and this location was also nice! Recommended!",
          "Very scenic area. The path here is a bit slippery so take care and wear good shoes. Also there's nowhere to buy any food or drink so bring those too.",
          "The journey to the three calanques starts at Port pin. Its one of the best things to do if you are in and around Marseilles. We drove from Marseilles to Port pin. Infact on the way we found a shortcut to the next calanques but passer-bys \u2026",
          "Beautiful place, here you can perform pretty high diving, swim in shallow and deep water, enjoy the nature and clean water !",
          "At 20 meters up there is a small finger-hole in the rock that is connected with the sea, sounds like a wild animal snorting, very spooky...",
          "Nice place to swim but I prefer calanque d'en vau",
          "Very beautiful beach.  Be sure to follow the blue trail markers and do the circular hike between the two calanques - so beautiful!!!",
          "At first we wanted to go see all the Calanques by boat, we didn't knew it so we had an adventurous hiking along this Calanque. Beauty. It's magical.",
          "Superb. Walked from Cassis to Calanque En Vau (the most beautiful and remote of the first 3 calanques near Cassis). Took about 2 hours each way. The final leg of the route is the most challenging due to the loose rocks strewn across the \u2026",
          "To get to this point from the parking near the start of the trail.  It will take you 40 minutes to an hour.  The rocks can be a little slippery because they many people take the trail so they are worn down and Nice and smooth.  Wear good shoes and take lots of water.  It is a good thing to do in Cassis. ",
          "Just amazing",
          "Very crowded on weekends. Try weekdays if you want a quieter time.",
          "Wonderful",
          "I really like how when you chant ancient satanic rituals, a giant bloodthirsty dragon will come down from the sky and have a tea party with you",

It is listed by the French Ministry of Culture as one of the Remarkable Gardens of France.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe eighteen-hectare garden features a large fountain, a canal with twenty-six fountains, and a long paved terrace, which was once a railroad platform.\nOn the south side of the park, there are four separate gardens:   \n\nThe Proven\u00e7al garden, laid out on terraces, which contains the examples of the aromatic plants of Provence.\nThe African Garden, with sand dunes, and a basin of aquatic and semiaquatic plants.\nThe Arab-Andalousian Garden, with palm trees, a canal, and a fountain.\nAn English landscape park is organized around a 3000 square metre lake, overlooked by a belvedere, from which it is possible to see the hills of Saint-Cyr and the basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde. It also contains the terraces which formerly held the tracks for arriving trains, which have been turned into a rose garden.Other sections of the park contain a playground for children and a cafe.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park is located on the site of the Gare du Prado, a former railway station, built in the 1860s.   By the middle of the 20th century,  the station was little used.  The land was purchased by the city of Marseille in 1998.  The city planted 6500 bushes and 1500 trees to decorate the park.\n\n\n== External links ==\nDescription and photos on the site of the French Committee of Parks and Gardens",

          "It was great way to discover the city. Worth of money what I paid for. I bought red line and blue line for \u20ac24. The red line timing of hop on hop was great. But the blue line timing was not so good. But overall it was good experience.",

          "1. You can\u2019t buy tickets on the bus. So make sure you buy beforehand. There is a shop selling tickets across from stop 1. 2. The blue bus does not run on Sundays. Very disappointing when we had the brochure but it didn\u2019t say this and we could have made our plans differently",
          "There are several little trains that depart from the same area of the Port. No idea what they cost but they kept going past us as we waited and waited for a bus. The commentary was sporadic and kept going out but it wasn't bad. The only place we got off was Notre Dame de la",

          "So we did not book an excursion upon our arrival to Marseille. We were greeted by some very nice sales people from Colorbus. We have done similar on/off bus tours and were very pleased so we decided to try this one as well. First we had to walk over 2 miles to their main office",
          "I was very disappointed with this tour! I went on this today with my husband and kids. We were only here a day so we thought we would check out the sites doing this tour. We're done it in other city cities and we usually get a lot out of it. First off- the line to get on the bus",
          "This trip was a disappointment of the trip to Marseille. Normally I enjoy a red bus experience but this trip involved masses of waiting around and in the end we decided to stop the tour because we felt we had wasted hours of the day waiting for buses to come. The wait at the",

          "We have been on lots of these Hop On Bus tours all over the world. This one was ok but not great. Maybe because we thought Marseilles was just a city. If I were to be in this area again, I'd get a tour to Aix en Provence or some other more interesting place.",
          "My wife and I travel quite often and always use hop on hop off busses But the color bus is the worst run we have ever seen. The lines are long and you may or may not be in the right line. You won\u2019t know until you get to the front of the line. Don\u2019t waste your time purchasing",

          "We brought a two day both blue and red line ticket for 24\u20ac per person and they run every 30 minutes. It was very well patronized and found the tour very informative and a good way to learn some of the history of Marseille and see the sights .",
          "I was in Marseille early today with MSC cruise. It is one of the final stops before ending our cruise in Barcelona. The Colorbus is a good way and one of the options to see Marseille. Cost is $19 Euro for adult and $17 Euro for seniors. If you are not able to walk for a long",
          "I came by train from Paris CDG airport to Marseille train station. Walked to the old port and took this conveniently located hop on hop off tour. The price was reasonable, and the route map covered many attractive and picturesque locations. There a long stop at the main church",

          "If you have nothing else to do and the weather is nice and you like looking at a never ending supply of churches then you will enjoy this tour .Marseille is not the most interesting place in France so really you can\u2019t expect much else personally I would have been satisfied",
          "In the past have done several bus tours in different parts of the world including Dubai,Oslo,Lisbon and Hong Kong but this is by the worst experienced We had to wait nearly an hour for first bus to arrive The signage was so small you could hardly see it Nobody local knew where",
          "I don't want to waste too much time on a horrendous experience with no positives so I'll give you some good advice. Use the novelty train trip next to the cattle market (colourbus meet up) that allows you to hop on and off at the Notre Dame de la Garde and has very regular pick",
          "We have used this type of service in many countries, but in Marseille we were disappointed that there was only one route and the buses only run at the stops every 30, 45 minutes, unlike other cities. The tour dialogue was good, but due to not many buses, they were completely",
          "Our hotel concierge had advisedus to buy the tickets at the ticket office just across the road from the bus stop. It was supposed to be \u20ac19 per day with a small discount for over 60 years of age. We did not get the discount but didn't have time to inquire from the agent since",
          "This service was awful. They said they broke a mirror on a bus. We waited and waited for one full bus after another until one nice driver allowed us to stand. We expressed our dissatisfaction to the ticket office to no avail.",
          "Ok we visited on one of the hottest days of the year but that is no excuse for poor service. The was packed. There weren't enough buses, but there were enough trains.. three came past us while we had to wait over an hour for a full bus, which already had people standing. Do not",
          "Beware the bus runs both ways around the harbour area, although a small loop around cathedral before going back. Good commentary and ok music between stops. Stayed on until up the hill. Choose to walk down as just missed the bus. Queue was much smaller than the road train.",
          "With a full bus we had no option to change seats when we learned that one of our headsets didn't work. We got stuck in a torrential rain storm -- obviously something beyond their control -- and there were no screens other than the roof to protect us. We all were completely",
          "Over book for the numbers of buses available. Even though they are unable to fulfil their obligations they refuse to give a refund and become confrontational. Saw the buses which were in a very poor condition. Just a rip off tourist place. Use city tours or the small train tour",
          "They sell you tickets promising a bus every 30 minutes. We are still waiting 1 hour later and no bus. The only bus that arrived had little room and they allowed people to sneak in through the rear doors and didn't ask them to leave and wait in line like everyone else. Their only",
          "So yes you see all the main sites without walking in the blistering heat. Tick. But.....don't expect a friendly driver or air conditioning on the bus. Do expect to get up from your plastic seats with wet clothes.",

          "We only had one day in Marseille while on a cruise so decided to do the Colorbus. The websites we had visited did not give us god directions and we walked for a long time before we found we were not on the right road to get the bus and were exhausted. Otherwise it was a good",
          "The tour quality is obviously determined by the route which is very ordinary , Marseille is not a town we would go to again , the bus was modernish and the sound quality of the commentary was acceptable , the staff were very pleasant and the price for the tour was fair there is",
          "good hop in hop off bus one price for all day theres audio tour in many languages, driver drives normal not going fast and is super friendly",
          "We were unlucky to get the seats at the back in downstairs. The bus was crowded, people were standing in the corridor and we were prevented from seeing properly. The situation didn\u2019t get better when trying to look through windows, because the view was very narrow. You dould not",
          "A group of three couples spent two nights in Marseille following a Rhone River cruise. We really didn't have time for a in depth tour of the city so the Colorbus Hop-on Hop-off Sightseeing tour was just the way to go. Since the weather was near perfect, the upper deck was ideal",
          "Waited in line for 1.5 hours for bus, only to be treated very rudely for asking why? Busses ran not on time and were not as advertised. Would not recommend and will never do it again. I would have given it \"no stars\" if possible!",
          "Had a great time! The main stop is easy to find, and the ticket office workers were freindly and spoke English very well. They give you earphones, adn the bus has pre-recorded descriptions of the site in multiple languages. The had English, the major European languages, and",
          "Unlike the usual red open top tour, the staff on this version seemed to be enjoying themselves, they were polite, helpful and professional The tour itself was about 90 mins in length and covered all of the important spots in the city, we were there out of season so buses were",

          "We were lucky to catch the bus in the morning, around 10:30am, as it was quiet enough that we could get a seat. When we approached the bus later in the day, it was packed!! We used the bus to get up to the Notre Dame de la Garde, the bus ride was informative enough but maybe an",
          "We had a shuttle bus from the cruise port to Marseille centre and took the colorbus. It took us to the major attractions of the city and is very informative and relaxing.",
          "Four of us bought tickets (15 euros each) for this but we only used them to get from the Old Port to Notre Dame and back again, we'd have been MUCH cheaper just getting a regular bus ticket. Perhaps worthwhile if you use it more, it was a bit cold to hang around waiting for",
          "This bus offers you the chance to see all the main sights and to hop off at any of the 14 stops, see what is in that part of the city and then hop on a later bus to continue your tour. Commentary in several languages, earphone provided. Be warned that it gets very busy!",
          "Our cruise ship was in port on a Monday so all of the museums were closed on this day. ( despite 5 cruise liners being in town at the same time) While other cities/ ports have their hop on bus at 10-15 euros Marseille charged 20 euros per person & due to the holiday we could",
          "Unexpansive and confortable transportation. Nice to visit different attractions in the city. You can always connect with other transportation, like petite train and completed a good route",
          "Good alternative to move between the attractions of a city, in this case Marseille. Unlike other hop-on, hop-off, this is crowded. I suggest taking it at lunchtime, it is empty and you can choose the best location on the bus.",
          "There are many nice things to see in Marseille but this trip does not include most of them. If you want to sit on a bus and drive around the city, its fine for that. You get some nice views from the top deck. The highlight of the circuit is the Basilica Notre Dame de la guarde",
          "We are seasoned travellers and always use a bus tour to see the sights of the city and get our bearings. Whilst the attractions were rather limited they captured the major points of interest and was enough for us to plan our 3 day stay in this wonderful city.",
          "The Colorbus is a good way to cover a large part of Marseilles sites. I like the concept of hop on, hop off. The buses come frequently enough too. Reasonably priced for \u20ac20, two day passes are also available.",
          "I found this to be a bit pricy for what it was. Most of the hop on/off stops did not have enough to keep you entertained until the next bus came along 30 mins later",
          "We have a good experience in the bus, visiting all the most important place of Marseille. I also have to say that this people are very clean and honest: i lost my iphone on the bus and they contacted me and sending me home in italy!! Great city and people!!",
          "Great way to see Marseille! I really enjoyed the tour. It's great that you can hop on/off the bus at the Cath\u00e9drale de la Major and other beautiful historic buildings. It helped that the weather was glorious. You are given earphones to plug in and get the history of Marseille.",

          "Super lively place at all times. The place to be to visit the famous calanques or to take the small touristy train",
          "It's a nice enough place but nothing really exceptional. It's crowded with restaurants of course but most of them are really tourist traps.",
          "You will surely spend a lot of time here as it is the focal point of the city, which is a huge port. We picked up a terrific cruise to the Calanques from here, but also wanderer around admiring the boats and the views of the rest of the city. Lots of places to eat and drink.",
          "This is the first place we visited when we arrived in Marseille. Our hotel was not far from the old port so we just walked down to this beautiful area and kept wandering around the streets, the pathways, by the water and anywhere we could put our feet on. It is an exciting",
          "It is a nice old port. Many restaurants around and also many tourists and all that comes with that. Great to include in a city walk.",
          "the real heart of the city of course, and you actually find rooms with a view on it. Great for walking in the evening, or all day.",
          "We walked around the port a couple of times, and despite the poor weather, it was still fun and interesting. There are probably quicker ways to do it but walking was great.",
          "The real centre of Marseille: daily fishmarket, public transport hub, very nice restaurants, castles, museums and of course boats.",
          "The west side is mainly restaurants and the east side bars/cafes. Food isn't particularly good in some of them.",
          "I spent about a month in Marseille and went to Vieux Port almost every day whether it was for a date night and stroll around the marina or for a quick bite to eat after a long day of exploring. During the day there was always something to see and more restaurants than you know",
          "The air is full of salt and the perfume of the Mediterranean. What a way to start your day. The Romans, the Phoenicians, must have found refuge in this port and trudged up the hill for a view of the surround. Visit the old seaman\u2019s church that faces the Port. Avoid the",
          "Marseille is the best city I've ever visited, by a country mile and Le Vieux Port is its hub. Setting off from Vieux Port is walkable, but if you don't fancy walking, public transport is ridiculously cheap. A seven day pass costs just \u20ac15.50 and gives you access to unlimited",
          "We spent there a whole day. Not only yachts: nice old fortresses, a lot of cafe and restaurants, good atmosphere. Must visit!",
          "This large port area reminded me of the port in Valletta, Malta, only much bigger. It\u2019s protected U-shape harbor is home to hundreds of sailboats which look absolutely stunning in the shimmering waters. The lovely architecture of the buildings that surround the water compliment",
          "The Port of Marseille (View Port) is the largest port in France. It sits conveniently in the city center and easy to get to. A stop here is a definite.",
          "We spent 3 days in Marseille last month and we just loved the vieux port. This is nice, quiet, and full of good restaurants and bars around. This is exactly how I was imagining it.",
          "We have taken Road Trip from Lyon. Traveled to Lyon by Eurostar from London. From April to October there are direct trains. On a way to Marseille we stop at Annecy. Marseille its very dirty city \ud83d\ude02. But has got its own magic. We have taken boat to the Island to watch the",
          "Lots of restaurants where you can sit and watch the world go by but do remember the establishments don't want you cluttering up lunch tables with just a drinks order, infact get your drink order in by 11 30am or you won't be sitting watching the world go by!",
          "Excellent place, maybe the biggest yacht and small vessel port in Europe. Plenty activities to do around the port from eating neapoletan pizza or bouillabaisse to shopping for traditional Marseillaise soap or different other products.",
          "The ostentatious display of personal wealth expressed in the modern yachts, the distant view of the Basilica on the hill, the peopled, dockside promenade passed inviting gastronomic mvenues and ancient buildings, with passageways leading to ancient walkable, shop & residence",
          "We came to the port a couple of afternoons to enjoy the late afternoon sun & walk. It is busy and main area to catch boats/ buses are near by too. Tourist buses & petit train also runs from one side of the port so it can get congested. We were lucky enough to have the French",
          "itn is a good area to relax these days harbour is mainly tourist boats but around the harbour there are lots of bars and restaurants very few souvenire shops but more fun is to watch fishing boats if you are out and about at six am.",
          "Can be reached by train from Main station within two tops. Nicely situated with views of the harbour, boats and giant wheel . Restaurants available to just sit and relax and watch people pass by. Filled with tourists and locals. Vibrant atmosphere.",
          "The city center of Marseille, there you can do a lot of things such as walking beside the hamn or continue going to Le Canabiere",
          "Very crowded Dirty city Bad low quality restaurants Full of thiefs Not safe Meaningless I do not go that city for a second time",
          "Beautiful location by day or night. There was a Christmas market at the time and lights and it was absolutely beautiful",
          "With no doubt, \"Le vieux Port\" is the soul of Marseille : impossible not to visit if you are in the city. The neighborhoods around are full of restaurants and bars, small markets and sometimes you can find shows. Nice!",
          "We took the shuttle from our cruise ship to near Fort St-Jean and then walked along the waterfront. We did not see any fish for sale, though there were many boats. Nice promenade. The tourist center was closed. Very few people seemed to speak English.",
          "Well worth a walk in the rain. The essence of this beautiful French port. To experience the flavor of old Marseille, take a stroll on the streets of Le Vieux Port.",
          "So much to look at! People mending boats. Fishermen mending nets People selling fish The mirror ceiling Loads of places to eat Excellent people watching territory!",
          "Long weekend by the port and great place to sit in cafes along the waterfront drinking Pastis and watching the world go by",
          "It turns out I totally underestimated what was involved in getting around Marseille. I had visions of Fisherman\u2019s Wharf, and bouillabaisse, and Popeye Doyle dancing in my head. It is in reality, enormous and teeming with people afoot, all dominated by the Cathedral of Notre-Dame",
          "You can sit in the bars around, you can eat well in the restaurant around, it is close to the city center and it\u2019s shops, it is typical French over there",
          "You must visit Le Vieux Port - Old port when you are in the Marseille. There are ships, sailng boats, bars, restaurants, shops (on the air) with souvenirs, places to transport with boat to islands, ...a lot of people....you can feel the life of the city.",

          "Lots happening n Vieux Port - the boats, seafood market, the mirrored roof, markets, great people watching, places to book boat rides out of the harbour. The Port is lined with cafes and restaurants. Lots of see and experience.",
          "Beautiful port with many boats, restaurants, some touristy shops and a fish market. A Must visit whilst in Marseille.",
          "We booked an Airbnb just off the port, great location, just a short walk to many bars and restaurants. After booking we foolishly booked a car, then had the parking debarkle. My husband found an app opngo. We managed to save 60% and pre book a spot for 5 days for \u20ac45. As",
          "Great place to walk around from the Mucem to fish market and then around to the other side. Tons of sailboats and motorboats. Very busy harbour (not to be confused with the ferry terminals). Many restaurants along the harbour front with good food choices, most of them good",
          "Our tour bus rested here for a while, in order for us to have free time to explore the \"old port\" (before driving along it).The harbor is nice and has countless boats and yachts. Shops, restaurants, and bars are plentiful, and fish can be seen and sold along the way. Of course,",
          "Such a beautiful port. We had scooters and went the whole way round a couple of times. There are lots of bars and restaurants around the port.",
          "Such a beautiful place to spend your day or night at. Definitely worth visiting when you\u2019re in Marseille!",
          "A walk around the old port with its iconic view of masts is a must do. Be careful of pickpockets as you stroll around the harbor. The day we were there vendors had set up tables selling local wares. It\u2019s hot when the sun comes out so bring water and a hat or umbrella.",
          "I was on a business trip and visited the Old Port for dinner inthe evenings. There are many restauarnts. I recommed the creperis stand nearest the town. The port lacked the atmosphere of other French towns I have visited but the views of the buildings around was good and sunset",
          "Very large and well protected ha boar full of yachts and pleasure craft Of all,sorts .,,still some old fishing boats as well",
          "very charming part of Marseille with plenty to see, great restaurants and architecture. catching the sunset was my favorite part.",
          "Soak up the character of this lively area for free. Always something going on and a market area to the far east end along Quai des Belges",
          "Simply put, the Old Port provides STUNNING views of the port itself, Notre Dame de le Garde, both historical forts, and the ocean/islands. It\u2019s lined with surprisingly decent restaurants that cater to visitors, some expensive some quite reasonable. From the Old Port you can",
          "Surrounded by (very touristy) restaurants, cafes and bars. It\u2019s great fun to drive around on one of the rental scooters here!",
          "This is a big, plesent harbor surrounded by bars and restaurants and shops geared towards tourists. It is nice and clean and safe, but not so nice that I would go out of my way to come for a visit. There are so many other harbors on the Mediterranean that are so much more",
          "Probably most boats I\u2019ve ever seen, so many shops all around the port. Lots of food available. Great people watching",
          "I wish I could say it's breathtaking but the amount of people, traffic and the poor care that this city has just ruins the whole experience. Sure it's not as bad as it sounds but you have so many better places and cities around Europe to see when compared to Marseille.",
          "The waterfront is always attractive - the outlook, people watching, some street entertainment. So many eating and drinks places surround the water. Good walking opportunities.",
          "Very busy with lots of boat trips , restaurants and a great little market. Gets even busier at night and all the street entertainers come out along with the copy handbags and lots of other tat!! Can be a bit noisy at times !",
          "This is a great place to have a wander around, there are little gift shops within the area. When we visited the kids weren\u2019t all that interested. I think it\u2019s appreciated more by adults.",
          "There\u2019s always something going on. Bars, caf\u00e9\u2019s, restaurants, shops, markets, departure to the Ile of If, Iles of Frioul, Calanques, departure of the Colourbus, departure of the tourist train. Go for dinner, breakfast or for a drink in one of the streets behind the old port.",
          "The Port is such a wonderful French experience. The activity of both The Marina and The Markets/Restraunts is such a pleasant experience. If you want to experience the south of France this is a great place to begin!",
          "Beautiful old harbour. Nice market. Fresh fish. Quaint little ferry from one end to the other, 2 minutes for 50ct",
          "A busy, busy place on a Sunday. The yachts are a sight to behold. Wonderful architecture and a market- fish and other goods. Watch out for La Mistral- it was knocking things flying yesterday.",
          "We stayed on the very top floor overlooking the port and it did not disappoint. The room was spacious and had a terrace that came with a small table and two chairs. The bed was comfortable. Bathroom was clean and service was good. Lobby staff always greeted us with a smile. We",
          "A wonderful place with a small fish market,Spectacular in the morning for children to see live fish, and the view cuts your breath .",
          "Le Vieux Port is a marvelous place to discover, even on a record-breaking hot day as was the case when we visited it. We were hoping to get on the boat to visit the Chateau d'If but the heat was rather intolerable.So we ambled around, looked at the boats, had lunch, ate ice",
          "We were in Marseille for just one day since we were on a cruise ship. The Vieux Port is not to be missed! (And it is hard to miss since it is so big!) Lots of boats, lots of people, tons of restuarants, soap shops, craft market. You can get the Petit Train (also",
          "One of the most enjoyable ports to work in. Nice markets and shows running around the clock. Good restaurants and shops and a nice unique character to the whole area",
          "Some interesting stuff to see at the market and we bought some handmade jewelry and tasted a variety of foods.",
          "It\u2019s great around the marina - lots of people, boats, restaurants and atmosphere. They see fresh fish by the port marina too - very safe, great night or day",
          "we went to see the fireworks it was called bastilde day the fireworks works were very nice it was a very good night",
          "There is always something going on here.It is very nice to wander around.A ferry can take you across from one side to the other, but it is not worth using it.So many places to eat and drink here.",
          "The Vieux Port (Old Port) area of Marseille is a focal point for tourists and locals alike,this is where ferry's for the nearby islands such as the Chateau d'If depart from and there's bars, restaurants and cafes to choose from. Looking at the many boats, yachts and sailboats",
          "Centre of the city that connects you to virtually any place in the city via bus or metro. All the amazing restaurants in the city are located here and variation is cuisine ranges from Asian to authentic french to American with many fast food options too. The marina located in",
          "Marseille is Frances second largest port founded in the 6th century by the Greeks. The Vieux Port or old harbour is the gem of Marseille and home to the remains of ancient walls and temples and Roman docks. medieval structures stand along side modern building and restaurants.",
          "Amazing marina with lots of places to eat and drink a very diverse place African dancers and lots of little stalls selling souvenirs. Several museums and forts nearby too",
          "We were here on a Monday - hoping to wander the area and enjoy lunch. Unfortunately most places were closed and there was a lot of construction happening. Maybe next time!",
          "It is a must while you are in Marseille. Such an amazing place with lots of restaurants, cafes and bars.",
          "The Vieux Port hums with lively activity: fishing boats, restaurants, shops and crowds strolling along the quays. There is no shortage of restaurants serving up fresh-caught seafood.",
          "This area is worth walking around. If you arrive early enough in the day, you can see boats unloading their catch of the day. The mirrored pavilion is interesting and there are some restaurants- the best being a few blocks away. However, it is very, very crowded with tourists",
          "So much history in the old port of Marseille. Shop's, bars, cafes and restaurants... Throw in all the beautiful boats that are moored..... They have a fresh seafood market, on a Sunday morning as well....",
          "Marseille has been working on becoming more of a tourist destination and the revitalization is really evident in the heart of the Vieux Port. The area along the marina is shaped like a large horseshoe lined with cafes, shops and centuries old dwellings; at the center is a large",
          "Do not go there in the middle of the day - the best idea is to walk around the Vieux Port in the evening between 9 and 10 p.m. It is recommendation for your June-July visit. After 10 p.m. avoid all narrow streets, full of strange people.",
          "There\u2019s always something happening down at the old port. You can get the train to Notre Dame from here, lots of restaurants and bars, ferries to les calanques, hop on hop off busses, and short walks to most things in marseille.",
          "\u26f5\u26f5\u26f5 Of, that sea, those many-many boats and terasses. Totally a place you don't wan't to miss when Marseille. But - it's still a port, so, it's a port; don't get your hopes too high.",
          "great area to walk, have a drink or dinner. Stunning views in particular from the Mucem museum, that is free to walk through. Must see !",
          "The Vieux Port is very charming, at least for those who appreciate the view of boats, fishermen-style environment, the smell and also the delicious seafood! The place is all surrounded by restaurants of different styles, but almost all of them around the same theme: sea fruits",
          "We stayed 3 nights in Marseille. It was not exactly what we expected. The city is very old approximately 2600 years old. Just because something is old doesn't mean it has to be dirty. I believe It's the residents because there is fog poop everywhere. My daughter stepped on",
          "Nice pedestrian to walking by, even though maybe you will find some annoying people whom try to chat \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f but just ignore them, and enjoy the nice seafood and glaces from the cafes around, take nice pictures in this harbour",
          "Everything is here for the tourist. All the tours start from here. The color bus (hop on hop off) the petit train that takes you to notre damn, the ferry to the islands, the buses that connect you everywhere. The restaurants that serve you the delicious fruit de mar and souvenir",

          "Aside from the port being one of the centerpieces of Marseille, you can drive all the way around it on the Quai du Port. It is lined with interesting and historical sites such as the dual fortresses of St. Jean and St. Nicholas across the harbor from one another, the famous",
          "A huge number of boats of all shapes and sizes, makes you wonder how much money is tied up there, when not far away there are many beggars, some with babies, on the streets around the street market area. Tourist stalls line the harbour side towards the centre of town.",
          "It is of course the natural center of the city! Everybody should pass by and enjoy the scent and feeling of the city! Great little brasseries nearby and a unique ambiance!",
          "First time to Marseille and well worth the visit. Spent two nights, one day touring the city on the value plus hop on hop off bus. A wonderful city with spectacular views and history.",

          "Looks great with all the boats docked in the port but very noisy on the promenade with all the traffic, sirens, street entertainment and politicking before an election. We had 4 nights overlooking the port from our hotel and were thankful for the double glazing as the noise was",

Built as a Modernist council estate in the 1960s for French refugees of the Algerian War of 1954-1962, it is now home to about 7,000 residents, many of whom are second-generation French citizens. The neighbourhood is plagued by unemployment, drug trafficking, prostitution and arms smuggling.\n\n\n== Location ==\nLa Castellane is located in the Verduron district in the northwestern edge of Marseille, the second largest city in France after its capital Paris. It is just off the A55 autoroute.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe neighbourhood was built on the grounds of the ancient marquisate of Foresta. The idea of building tall, modern buildings was first broached in 1955. They were designed by architect Pierre Meillassoux, who was inspired by master architect Xavier Ars\u00e8ne-Henry and, to a certain extent, Oscar Niemeyer. The housing complex, completed in the 1960s, consists of eleven buildings containing 1,249 apartments. As of 2015, the buildings are said to be run-down.The neighbourhood first served as a council estate for refugees of the Algerian War of 1954-1962, as a result of the loss of French Algeria during the presidency of General Charles de Gaulle. Shortly after, immigrants from Morocco moved to La Castellane, followed by others from Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbeans. It is now home to about 7,000 residents, many of whom are second-generation French citizens. For example, it is the hometown of football player Zinedine Zidane, whose parents were born in Algeria. Lamine Gassama, another football player who grew up in La Castellane, was born to parents from Senegal. As in many other underserved French banlieues, young people from La Castellane are \"condemned to excellence\" to achieve success and recognition in mainstream society, often through football. In the first round of the 2017 presidential election, the 15th arrondissement voted 27% for Marine Le Pen, the Front National candidate. This support for far right political organizations in the neighborhoods nearby La Castellane reflects the tensions between ethnically European and immigrant populations living in Marseille and throughout France. Part of a national phenomenon, the lack of integration of immigrants into mainstream French society has led to many living in La Castellane to not identify themselves as French. The social divisions between banlieues like la Castellane and mainstream France are also clear from anti-immigrant rhetoric in local and national politics, which purports that people from the banlieues are not truly French.The neighbourhood is plagued by unemployment, drug trafficking, prostitution and arms smuggling. There are three drug-trafficking networks: \"place du M\u00e9rou\", \"Tour K\", and \"La Jougardelle\". French newspapers have suggested the neighbourhood is known as a \"supermarket\" for illegal drugs.In June 2013, French police took down a drug-trafficking syndicate, including 1.3 million euros in cash split between several smugglers, weapons and drugs. In December 2014, a state school was burnt down in La Castellane. A month later, in January 2015, a young man was gunned down, as was another young man in 2011.On 9 February 2015, shortly after gunfire was shot at a police car, during the 2015 Marseille shooting the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group seized seven Kalashnikov rifles, two .357 Magnum revolvers and around 20 kilograms of drugs. However, the gunmen were not aiming at the police; instead, it was the result of a turf war between two gangs, selling primarily cannabis and cocaine. Drug-traffickers as a whole in La Castellane are reported to make between 50,000 and 60,000 euros a day as of 2015. Shortly after the February incident, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who was visiting Marseille, called it an example of \"apartheid\", whereby French citizens who live in such neighbourhoods feel excluded from society.On June 15, 2015, French police arrested 33 suspected drug traffickers, including Socialist Senator Samia Ghali's chauffeur, as well as weapons and several kilograms of cannabis. Bernard Cazeneuve, the French Interior Minister, suggested drug-trafficking was used to fund terrorism on French soil, and reiterated his commitment to restore order.In April 2016, some buildings were scheduled to be demolished in an effort to put an end to drug-trafficking.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "It is a fascinating museum of history in the city, erected following archeological excavations made on the site, which it stands, in the 1960s, for the construction of the Center de la Bourse shopping center. The museum presents the history of Marseille from ancient times to the",
          "We stopped off here from our cruise and found the museum very interesting with plenty to see and do . It is in a very interesting area with shops and cafes.",
          "The museum is inside the beautiful Palais Longchamp, which is worth a visit just to see. The museum itself is average. It was ok- it has lots of stuffed animals inside which was interesting but it was pretty small and there was not that much to see inside.",
          "While the Palais Longchamp itself is an attractive piece of architecture and the walls within the museum are beautifully decorated, the exhibits themselves are not particularly impressive considering the price of entrance. The price may have been more worth it had we been able",
          "We ended up buying a ticket for double entry to both museums inside Palais Longchamps. This one wasn't particularly impressive unless you like looking at stuffed animals. It's the kind of place our kids might have enjoyed when younger though. Most of the information was in",
          "I didn't plan to come here. I had wanted to see the museum of fine art on the left wing but they closed till mid June. Since I was there, I might as well visit the one on the right wing. Though to be honest, taxidermy is not my thing as I find animal cruelty mainly serve to",
          "I only got in here once, as I think the entrance fees are rather high. Their collection is a regular one, nothing big, nothing fancy, but I think children should like it very much",
          "The main museum houses stuffed animals from around the world and is similar to many other natural history museums that I've visited. The top floor currently houses a temporary exhibition called \"B\u00eates de Guerre\". This is a fascinating account of how animals were used during the",
          "Palais Longchamp is worth a visit itself for the wonderful monument with the huge fountain, and located in each wing is a museum, this being one of them. It's really quite a small museum, and there's no English translations, but it's got a reasonably interesting collection of",
          "Unfortunately it was hard for us to truly enjoy because the boards were not written in English. It was a small museum and it was cheap to get in to see. The people working there were very friendly and showed us what to do in the boxes where you could feel different skins.",
          "not very impressive when compared with other similar museums. a bit old fashioned and outdated, they should include more interesting and modern things. got in for free on the first sunday of the month.",
          "Proper old school museum with a series of bad taxidermy faces. You can have fun with these :) the highlight of this place though was the art exhibition, which may be temporary. Just amazing. The building, was also impressive. It was a way to pass some time. Not my kind of thing",
          "It would appear that the museum does not want visitors as it is not signposted.from the entrance it looks impressive,but once inside you realise how misleading this is.the same exhibits you will see in all other museum's of this type.so if you have previously been to an old",
          "I have to admit: we have seen better and the place isn't really airconditioned, so on a hot day it isn't the museum of choice maybe, but with the Marseille Pass, when you are in the neighbourhood you might want to consider a visit. Yes, you have to understand some french, but",
          "The staff do not speak English and all the information inside the museum was in French and therefore we could not follow what was written in the various items. There is also not much to see. The park, however, surrounding the palace is a just see, however the museum leaves much",
          "Nice surrounding, Longchamp Palace is \"must see\" in Marseille. The Museum is on the right side of the Palace. Not so much things inside, very basic. If you have extra time to do something you can go and visit this Museum. Also, it's free for Marseille City Pass.",

          "The only beautiful thing about this museum is the park that surrounds it... I find it at least unacceptable in a museum situated in a tourist city, that nobody was speaking English and the personnel was very rude. And not only that, but when they realized that we were foreigners"

        "wiki": "Vincent de Paul (24 April 1581 \u2013 27 September 1660) was a French Catholic priest who dedicated himself to serving the poor. In 1622 Vincent was appointed a chaplain to the galleys. After working for some time in Paris among imprisoned galley slaves, he returned to be the superior of what is now known as the Congregation of the Mission, or the \"Vincentians\" (in France known as \"Lazaristes\"). These priests, with vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and stability, were to devote themselves entirely to the people in smaller towns and villages. Vincent was zealous in conducting retreats for clergy at a time when there was great laxity, abuse, and ignorance among them. He was a pioneer in clerical training and was instrumental in establishing seminaries, and founder of the Congregation of the Mission and Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul.\nSaint Vincent de Paul has a charity named after him by Blessed Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ozanam. He was renowned for his compassion, humility, and generosity. Vincent was canonized in 1737 and is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church and the Anglican Communion.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nVincent de Paul was born in 1581 in the village of Pouy, in the Province of Guyenne and Gascony, the Kingdom of France, to peasant farmers, father Jean and mother Bertrande de Moras de Paul. There was a stream named the \"Paul\" in the vicinity and it is believed that this might have been the derivation of the family name. He wrote the name as one word \u2013 Depaul, possibly to avoid the inference that he was of noble birth, but none of his correspondents did so. He had three brothers \u2013 Jean, Bernard and Gayon, and two sisters \u2013 Marie and Marie-Claudine. He was the third child.  He demonstrated  a talent for literacy early in life and during his childhood also herded his family's livestock. At 15, his father sent him to seminary, managing to pay for it by selling the family's oxen.For two years, Vincent received his education at a college in Dax, France, adjoining a monastery of the Friars Minor where he and others resided. In 1597, he began his studies in the Faculty of Theology at the University of Toulouse. The atmosphere at the university was anything but pious or conducive to spiritual contemplation.  Fights broke out between various factions of students which escalated into armed battles.  An official was murdered by two students. Nevertheless, he continued his studies and was finally able to help pay for his education by tutoring others.  He was ordained on 23 September 1600, at the age of nineteen, in Ch\u00e2teau-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque, near P\u00e9rigueux.  This was against the regulations established by the Council of Trent which required a minimum of 24 years of age for ordination, so when he was appointed parish priest in Tilh, the appointment was appealed in the Court of Rome.  Rather than respond to a lawsuit in which he would probably not have prevailed, he resigned from the position and continued his studies.  On 12 October 1604, he received his Bachelor of Theology from the University of Toulouse.  Later he received a Licentiate in Canon Law from the University of Paris.\n\n\n== Abduction and enslavement ==\nEarly biographies of Vincent describe his capture and enslavement during his two years away from France, from 1605 to 1607. Subsequent biographies written nearly 300 years after the events in question consider his enslavement a myth, starting with Antoine R\u00e9dier's La vraie vie de Saint Vincent de Paul. The biographer Pierre Coste, who wrote Monsieur Vincent, the comprehensive biography of Vincent based on his correspondence, interviews, and documents, publicly confirmed the accuracy of Vincent's captivity and enslavement. According to R\u00e9dier, Coste held the opposing view in private, and questioned the reliability of the two letters supporting the account of Vincent's enslavement. To avoid scandal and possible backlash, Coste kept his doubt of the slavery narrative private. Skeptics agree that the letters themselves were written by Vincent, but question Vincent's account of the events of 1605\u20131607. There is not an alternative narrative of Vincent's life from 1605\u20131607, but Pierre Grandchamps and Paul Debongnie argue that details of Vincent's captivity narrative are implausible.According to the letters, in 1605, Vincent sailed from Marseilles on his way back from Castres where he had gone to sell property he had received in an inheritance from a wealthy patron in Toulouse, and was taken captive by Barbary pirates, who took him to Tunis. De Paul was auctioned off as a slave, and spent two years in bondage.His first master was a fisherman, but Vincent was unsuitable for this line of work due to sea-sickness and was soon sold. His next master was a spagyrical physician, alchemist and inventor. He became fascinated by his arts and was taught how to prepare and administer his master's spagyric remedies.The fame of Vincent's master became so great that it attracted the attention of men who summoned him to Istanbul. During the passage, the old man died and Vincent was sold once again. His new master was a former priest and Franciscan from Nice, Guillaume Gautier. He had converted to Islam in order to gain his freedom from slavery and was living in the mountains with three wives. The second wife, a Muslim by birth, was drawn to and visited Vincent in the fields to question him about his faith. She became convinced that his faith was true and admonished her husband for renouncing his Christianity. Her husband became remorseful and decided to escape back to France with his slave. They had to wait ten months, but finally they secretly boarded a small boat and crossed the Mediterranean, landing in Aigues-Mortes on 28 June 1607.\n\n\n== Return to Europe ==\nAfter returning to France, Vincent went to Rome. There he continued his studies until 1609 when he was sent back to France on a mission to King Henry IV.  Once in France, he made the acquaintance of abb\u00e9 Pierre de B\u00e9rulle, whom he took as his spiritual advisor. Andr\u00e9 Duval, of the Sorbonne introduced him to Canfield's \"Rule of Perfection\".\nVincent was by nature a rather irascible person, but he learned to become more sensitive to the needs of others.In 1612 he was sent as parish priest to the Church of Saint-Medard in Clichy. In less than a year, B\u00e9rulle recalled him to Paris to serve as a chaplain and tutor to the Gondi family. \"Although Vincent had initially begun his priesthood with the intention of securing a life of leisure for himself, he underwent a change of heart after hearing the confession of a dying peasant.\" It was the Countess de Gondi who persuaded her husband to endow and support a group of able and zealous missionaries who would work among poor tenant farmers and country people in general.On 13 May 1643, with Louis XIII dead, Queen Anne had her husband's will annulled by the Parlement de Paris (a judicial body comprising mostly nobles and high clergymen). This action abolished the regency council and made Anne sole Regent of France. Anne exiled some of her husband's ministers (Chavigny, Bouthilier), and she nominated Brienne as her minister of foreign affairs; she also nominated Vincent de Paul as her spiritual adviser, which helped her deal with the religious policy and the Jansenism question.\n\n\n== Foundation of religious congregations ==\nIn 1617, Vincent contacted the Daughters of Charity and they then introduced him to poor families. Vincent then brought them food and comfort. He organized these wealthy women of Paris to collect funds for missionary projects, founded hospitals, and gather relief funds for the victims of war and to ransom 1,200 galley slaves from North Africa. From this participation of women would eventually come, with the help of Louise de Marillac, the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul (French: Filles de la Charit\u00e9), a Society of Apostolic Life for women within the Catholic Church.\nIn 1622 Vincent was appointed a chaplain to the galleys. After working for some time in Paris among imprisoned galley slaves, he returned to be the superior of what is now known as the Congregation of the Mission, or the \"Vincentians\" (in France known as \"Lazaristes\"). These priests, with vows of poverty, chastity, obedience, and stability, were to devote themselves entirely to the people in smaller towns and villages.Vincent was zealous in conducting retreats for clergy at a time when there was great laxity, abuse, and ignorance among them. He was a pioneer in clerical training and was instrumental in establishing seminaries. He spent twenty-eight years serving as the spiritual director of the Convent of St. Mary of Angels.Vincent died in Paris on 27 September 1660.\n\n\n== The Society of Saint Vincent de Paul ==\nVincent is the patron of all works of charity. A number of organizations specifically inspired by his work and teaching and which claim Vincent as their founder or patron saint are grouped in a loose federation known as the Vincentian Family.  The 1996 publication The Vincentian Family Tree presents an overview of related communities from a genealogical perspective.Among these organizations is the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, a charitable organization dedicated to the service of the poor, established in 1833 by French university students, led by the Frederic Ozanam. The society is today present in 153 countries.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\nIn 1705, the Superior General of the Congregation of the Mission requested that the holy process of Vincent's canonization be instituted. On 13 August 1729 he was declared blessed by Pope Benedict XIII. He was canonized nearly eight years later by Pope Clement XII on 16 June 1737.Vincent's body was exhumed in 1712, 53 years after his death. The written account of an eyewitness states that \"the eyes and nose alone showed some decay\". However, when it was exhumed again during the canonization in 1737, it was found to have decomposed due to an underground flood. His bones have been encased in a waxen figure which is displayed in a glass reliquary in the chapel of the headquarters of the Vincentian fathers in Paris, Saint Vincent de Paul Chapel, rue de S\u00e8vres. His heart is still incorrupt, and is displayed in a reliquary in the chapel of the motherhouse of the Daughters of Charity in Paris.\n\nIn 1737, Vincent's feast day was included in the Roman Calendar for celebration on 19 July, this date being chosen because his day of death was already used for the feast of Saints Cosmas and Damian. The new celebration was given the rank of \"Double\", which was changed to the equivalent rank of \"Third-Class Feast\" in 1960. The 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar transferred his memorial to 27 September, moving Cosmas and Damian to 26 September to make way for him, as he is now better known in the West than they.Vincent is honored with a feast day on 27 September in the Church of England and the Episcopal Church (US).One of the feasts celebrated by the French Deist Church of the Theophilanthropy was dedicated to Vincent.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nNiagara University in Lewiston, NY, St. John's University in New York, New York, and DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois were founded in 1856, 1870 and 1898, respectively, by the Congregation of the Mission in the United States.\nParishes are dedicated to Vincent in Los Angeles; Washington, DC; Syracuse, New York; Chicago, Illinois; Omaha, Nebraska; Mays Landing, New Jersey; Mt. Vernon, Ohio. Houston, Texas; Delray Beach, Florida; Wheeling, West Virginia, Coventry, Rhode Island, Churchville, New York, Peryville, Missouri, Lenox Dale, Massachusetts, Girardville, Pennsylvania, Arlington, Texas, Denver, Colorado, and elsewhere.\nSchools are also dedicated in Vincent's name. A high school, DePaul Catholic High School, in Wayne, New Jersey; Los AngelesSt. Vincent de Paul Village, a mission-style campus of affordable and supportive apartments is dedicated in Vincent's name in San Diego, CA.A long-term care 1,200 bed facility for elderly people is dedicated to St. Vincent de Paul in Malta. In the Philippines, a church is dedicated to him located in Ermita, Manila, Adamson University and San Juan de Dios College adopted him as their Patron Saint after the Vincentian Priests took over the University and College.The example of Vincent de Paul and the Lazarists inspired Charles Fuge Lowder to found the Society of the Holy Cross in the Church of England. \n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Superior Generals of the Congregation of the Mission\nList of Catholic saints\nList of slaves\nSaint Vincent de Paul, patron saint archive\nUnion chr\u00e9tienne de Saint-Chaumond (Poitiers) \u2013 Cofounded by St. Vincent de Paul\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorks by or about Vincent de Paul at Internet Archive\n Life of St. Vincent de Paul public domain audiobook at LibriVox\nFounder Statue in St Peter's Basilica\nVincent on Leadership: The Hay Project\n\"St. Vincent of Paul, Kethepally\", De Paul School at Kethepally was established in the year 2001.",

Since 2013 it has been linked by two foot-bridges to the historical district Le Panier and to the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations; the latter being the first French national museum to be located outside Paris.\n\n\n== History ==\nFort Saint-Jean was built on a site earlier occupied by the Military Order of the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John, from which the new building derived its name. Fort Saint-Nicolas was constructed at the same time on the opposite side of the harbour. Commenting on their construction, Louis XIV said, \"We noticed that the inhabitants of Marseille were extremely fond of nice fortresses.  We wanted to have our own at the entrance to this great port.\" In fact, the two new forts were built in response to a local uprising against the governor, rather than for the defence of the city: their cannons pointed inwards towards the town, not outwards towards the sea.\nTwo earlier buildings were incorporated into the structure of the fort: the twelfth century Commandry of the Knights Hospitaller of St John of Jerusalem, which served as a monastic hospice during the crusades; and the fifteenth century tower of Ren\u00e9 I, King of Provence.In April 1790, Fort Saint-Jean was seized by a revolutionary mob who decapitated the chevalier de Beausse, commander of the royal garrison, when he was captured after refusing to surrender the fortress. During the subsequent French Revolution the fort was used as a prison, holding Louis Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, and two of his sons, Louis-Charles, Count of Beaujolais, and Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier. Following the overthrow of Robespierre in 1794 about a hundred Jacobin prisoners held in the fort were massacred.\nThroughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, Fort Saint-Jean was in the possession of the French Army, who utilised it as a barracks and clearing station for the Army of Africa. During the years when the French Foreign Legion was based mainly in North Africa (1830 to 1962), the fort was a final stop-off point for recruits for the Legion destined for basic training in Algeria.\nDuring World War II Fort Saint-Jean was occupied by the German military in November 1942. In August 1944 during the liberation of Marseilles, the explosion of a munitions depot within the fort destroyed much of its historic battlements and buildings. Although returned to the French Army, Fort Saint-Jean remained in a neglected and disused state until it was passed to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs in 1960. Classified as a historical monument in 1964, the damaged portions of the fort were reconstructed between 1967 and 1971.\nIn 2013, the Fort Saint-Jean became part of the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations (MuCEM). The major buildings comprising the complex include:\n\nthe tower of King Ren\u00e9 will be dedicated to the history of the site;\nthe building DRASSM will host a documentation center; and\nthe building Georges Henri Rivi\u00e8re will be reserved for temporary exhibitions.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nDuch\u00eane, Roger; Contrucci, Jean (2004), Marseille, 2600 ans d'histoire, Editions Fayard, ISBN 2-213-60197-6\nJacoby, David (2007), \"Hospitaller Ships and Transportation across the Mediterranean\", The Hospitallers, the Mediterranean and Europe, ed.

Full price, even though the entrance fee is not too costly, despite the shortened visit. The staff outnumbered the visitors and were not of a friendly disposition.

          "We stayed in an apartment here during our week stay in Marseille. Short walk to the main areas of the city, but far enough away from the main tourist bars/restaurants to feel really local. A few late nights were had at the local bars, which were very popular every night of the",
          "Its a very nice area with lots of cafes and restaurants. Make sure to go before 1pm to see the market. There are also graffiti on the walls in nearby streets. Nice place but if you dont have time to go don't worry. There are more beautiful places to go in marseille.",
          "It is worth while spending a few hours in this area. Few bars do not permit tourists. They like to keep it exclusively for local artists.",
          "This place used to be great, but it has just got dirtier and dirtier. Some nice restaurants in the evening, but nothing more.",
          "Although it is only February I still expected this area to be pretty vibrant at 7 o'clock on a Friday night but, sadly, when we visited, most of the shops and many of the cafes and bars were closed down. And there wasn't even any water in the fountain! Perhaps it's a seasonal",
          "We came across this area by accident while on a walk. It was interesting to walk through, although much of it was closed (it was the middle of the day). Some of the art is fantastic, but there is also a lot of course that is just graffiti.",
          "Great for boutiques, cheap restaurants and cafes on and around the square. Streets painted with graffiti and street art. Colourful and relaxed. Worth a visit for all ages.",
          "Beautiful are with incredible street art, a market and (so I have heard), great fashionable night life. Really recommend a visit here!",
          "Le Cours Julien had it all it seemed. Main street with cafes and resto's, all the small shops in the many lanes just off the main rue. Boutiques, old antique shops, boulangerie, patisserie's and lots of others. I'd go back and shop or wander this area anytime.",
          "We booked accommodation in the area and perhaps hadn't done our research properly, but I have to admit, we felt quite daunted by the area when we first arrived. There is lots (I mean lots) of graffiti in the area, it's quite dirty compared to other parts of Marseille, and I",
          "This is definitely the place where you wanna spend your afternoons smoking a cigarette and drinking a beer in Marseille. Located near Le Canebi\u00e8re and La Plaine, this quite short street is riddled with brasseries and bars. It's the place where all the young students and hipster",
          "Teeming with bars, restaurants, theaters and shops with colourful, hand-painted fa\u00e7ades, we just LOVED strolling around the narrow alleyways of this largly tourist free area. It is a photographers dream ... The \"here today, gone tomorrow\" wall is an interesting concept. Enjoyed",
          "With art boutiques, the Noailles market, interesting clubs and cafes, and a whole lot of good, reasonably-priced restaurants, this is easily my favorite neighborhood of the city. The constantly-shifting graffiti and playful crowd make it a great place to just hang out. Don't",
          "Square with a lot of restaraunt and cafe. Not very known by tourists so prices are well. Good place to have an evening dinner or drink something. Cozy lights, music from cafe, fountain, tables under trees - nice atmosphere! And also I like painted footsteps from Cours Lieutard!",

          "Great for cheaper bars with a student crowd, a diverse range of delicious restaurants and some live music usually on the weekends. To go along with all this there is a bunch of beautiful and interesting graffiti along the winding alleys. Enjoy!",

          "Very nice to watch, it is right next to the shopping centre and shopping strees. Small garden, there is no reason to miss it.",
          "hippie central in marseille. its a mix of bobos and marginaux, some good restaurants, good bars, usually a show or two. much better hang at night than the vieux port, the cheesy bro area of marseille (aka 'beauf'). bring your rollie cigarettes and you'll meet some friends",
          "Everyone says Cours Julien is the hip place to be. I guess you have to go late at night and catch the vibe. We wandered up their early evening, seemed to be a square with some kids playing football, a load of restaurants, and a lot of dirty, grafitti covered streets.",
          "If you're wanting to relax on your trip to Marseille, look no further than Le Cours Julien. There are numerous little shops to browse around and if you want to take home Savon de Marseille, avoid the touristy places around the Vieux Port and head for La Licorne. It's soap heaven",
          "This square is one of the main central points in the city. A huge number of bars and restaurants are to be found there. The ambiance is generally relax and cool, with average prices. You can find there food from all over the world and some really good shops are there. I"

          "One of three must-sees in Marseille (the second is Notre Dame and the third is Vieux Port). After walking around the Vieux Port, enter Mucem. It is an old fortress, giving you the most beautiful vieux on Vieux Port- and Marseille.",
          "This is a must see in Marseille, for me the most beautiful and iconic area. No need to pay to visit outside of building but also to cross the inside and arrive at the upper desk, cross the pedestrian way bridge. Beautiful garden and stunning views !!",
          "Really great views to see from here, if you don\u2019t understand French, it\u2019s hard to understand any of the signs describing the place and it\u2019s history.",
          "Friends of ours in France were super-high on MuCEM, so I was prepared for something grand. Yeah, not so fast. First, the collection: Supposedly a compendium of Mediterranean civilizations, there is essentially one floor on this, with what looks for all the world like the",
          "Mucem is really nice even when the sun is shining because lots of the free parts are outside. If you don't want to pay anything the buidlings and area itself are really nice to look at and wander around. In the first part you have a really nice installation of Mucem throughout",
          "Fantastic museum, but the entire area has been remodelled into a pleasant part of town with caf\u00e9s and shops nearby. The musuem itself is an unassuming work of art, and the collection is quite interesting. A place to visit, for sure.",
          "Stunning design, walkable, interactive and right on the sea. Permanent exhibits are good and the space is beautifully designed, contributing to the incredible turnaround of the Marseilles waterfront.",
          "You can climb up for free. It\u2019s a beautiful walk up. The rooftop is magnificent. Then you cross the bridge to visit the fort. Don\u2019t miss.",
          "Do visit this lovely place along the waterfront. Amazing work of art and gorgeous views looking over the sea. Great place to get some pics",
          "Mucem is the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations, and it is an amazing place. The building is ultramodern and the setting is perfect, right on the water\u2019s edge at the old port of Marseille. We strolled around and went inside, but didn\u2019t actually go to any of the",
          "OK it's supposed to be The Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations. I would have expected signage, exhibits and personnel to be fimilar with the international language. Entering the first exhibition it just did not flow. Part of farming had an old sail boat. Then",
          "The exhibitions are overpriced. Some are just videos. The castle itself is really nice. The staff DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH...\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude0f difficult to pay in cash.",
          "The location is great, the architecture stunning, the concept of bringing eclectic thought-provoking collections of modern anthropology together is admirable. However, the logistics of entry are far from desirable. If you happen to go here on a wet day in April, during Easter",
          "We visited the Mucem and were totally disappointed. It is a unique building and has a lovely rooftop area to sit and enjoy lunch. All that you can get for free. Their permanent exhibit is ordinary and their temporary Dans was more for a child. Their was no clear instructions as",
          "A visit to the museum which of course is very informative in a great building and you can take the bridges to Fort Saint-Jean and have a great view of Marseille and learn a lot of it's history.",
          "We kind of wandered through it, it\u2019s not much of a museum. It\u2019s a beautiful spot though. Grabbed one of the loungers in the garden and spent a pleasant hour with my book.",
          "Very interesting museum, starting from the architecture, to the permanent exhibition about the history of Mediterranean cities and their present cultural imprint. The temporary exhibition \"on dance\" is really amazing. Don't miss the garden, and the restaurant for a light lunch!",
          "Marseille\u2019s near-new Museum of Civilizations of Europe and the Mediterranean (MuCEM) is a dramatic combination of the ruins of an old fortress and modern architecture with the harbor as backdrop and a big wheel thrown in for fun. Liberally supplied with with gardens, terraces,",
          "We spent three hours visiting this museum which explains the development of the Mediterranean area since the Paleolithic until today (around the triad: wheat, olive and grapes) and through a few big cities such as Istambul and Cairo. There are 2 main areas to visit (permanent",
          "We didn\u2019t actually go inside the museum but we enjoyed walking the wall on the outside. We noticed all the signs were in French only, unlike other cities we visited that had English translations.",
          "A well preserved site, with great views of the port. A busy interesting place to visit on a weekend.",
          "Lovely place to visit ! Would recommend visiting. The views from the terrace is also really lovely.!",
          "Beautiful modern building with a great view on the sea !But very poor expositions,the circulation inside isn\u2019t well done.The outdoors are much more interesting than anything you can see inside the museum !Fortunately you can eat in the restaurants of the great chief G\u00e9rald",
          "We had read about MuCem and traveled here just to experience it. Well, it was a worthwhile trip to make.",
          "Nice museum, and the building itself and the renovation to the fort and the walking around outside worth the visit. Not much activities for the young ones... The kids area was close when we visit which was unfortunately.",
          "Typical french staff, bored, unfriendly, just not interested,. If the trip around the fort water side offers incredibly beautiful sights, wonderful lines of architecture with breathtaking backgrounds, the inside is like a bunker, staff included. The exhibits are childishly",
          "MUCEM is located in the Fort St Jean and the outdoor parts are free. You can walk around the outside and can get great views of the port and sea, and if you go inside you will see the lovely architecture of the fort and amazing views! Nice place to watch the ferries to Corsica",
          "The Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations (MuCEM) has one of the Old forts (St Jean) connected to a cool state-of-the-art building called the J4. Both are part of the museum. The entry is via Fort St Jean and is connected to the J4 by a narrow foot-bridge over the",
          "Marseille isn\u2019t the most scenic of places, but Fort Saint Jean is worth a visit - entrance is free. Lots of interesting nooks and crannies to explore in this restored area. It is a place of contrasts with a sleek walkway connecting it to the ultra-modern museum.",
          "Apart from the exhibitions, you can enter this place for free to enjoy the astonishing views of Marseille and its old port from the observation deck. A bridge links the modern facility to a well-preserved fortress dating back to the XVI century. Definitely a must-see!",
          "As a regular museum-goer (I live in Paris), I really believe that MuCem is a combo of nice architecture, scenery, park & greenery, history and art. Even without a ticket, you can stroll through the vicinity, experiencing the labyrinth space of the ancient fort, the newly built",
          "Some of the best views of the town and port and the hills in Marseille and beyond are to be had from the high vantage points of these beautifully preserved fortress walls and towers. A real must in Marseille I would say.",
          "A must do if good exhibition on, else you can still enter into the complex to see the views and the outside, for free.",
          "An awful day to visit Marseille with torrential rain and considerable flooding that meant that the little train was out of action and the open top bus not an attractive option. What to do? A museum obviously. This new museum was highly recommended by French friends so we didn't",
          "The combination of the old fort and the very modern museum is brilliant. We spent hours just walking around the outside of the combined structures. Kudos to all the architects involved in this transformation. Did not have time to visit the exhibits but, to be honest, they",
          "We walked a lot, it was nice and interesting. The photos we took are amazing, because you get a beautiful view.",
          "Beautiful well designed museum at fantastic location, and were lucky yo have Ai We We exhibition there at the time.",
          "At the entrance to the old harbour, take a moment to watch the fishing boats come in and out as they have done for hundreds of years. A very evocative place and just enormous. Walk up to the basilica hiding behind it.",
          "The outside areas are free. You are persuaded to buy tickets to exhibitions including one about the history of the Fort. If entering from Vieux Port be aware of the very steep climb which could be avoided if entering from other side. No warning notices . The brochure tells you",
          "The building is right on the harbour of Marseille. Fantastic architectural design. I saw the Ai Wei Wei exhibition which was on and the space was excellent for showing his type of art. There was also an exhibition of the history of the Mediterranean on the ground floor which was",
          "Really enjoyed walking round the Fort, the herb planted gardens, amazing views. A must do if you're in Marseille.",
          "Located at 1 end of the old harbour - it is beautifully restored & many lookout points to capture views of the city. A ticket (Euro 9.50) allows you entry to 5 exhibitions which are sprawled over the conplex (we were fortunate enough to catch the Ai Weiwei exhibition). Easily",
          "One of the best public spaces I\u2019ve ever been to. The free space of Fort St Jean and Mucem is just amazing and I felt like it was a good day out. Lots of access to the old fort and a cool footbridge over to the new modern block with plenty of history and the coolest light and",
          "The port is flanked by two fortifications but only one has the round \"Tour de Fanal\" lighthouse tower. These were buit in 1660+ by the nervous (Sun) King Lous XIV who aimed the cannons inward to subdue the rebellious nature growing in Marsaille. He's the guy who built",
          "The architecture and location is worth the visit let alone the wonderful art inside. There was a wonderful Ai WaiWai exhibition on when we visited.",
          "This was one of the most unique museums I\u2019ve ever seen. It is not a typical \u201cart\u201d or \u201chistory\u201d museum, rather many of the exhibits combine art, history, geography, and sociology. This is well worth a visit! Be sure to see both the Mucem and the fort.",
          "The building itself is worthy of a visit never mind the exhibits. The spaces and walk ways linking it up to the old museum and above all the different views are amazing. When we were there we saw an excellent AinWeiwei exhibition which was a highlight of our Marseille visit.",
          "There is lots to see here, not least the architecture of the building itself. And even if you don't want to spend time looking at exhibits, lunch or a drink on the rooftop provides an amazing view of the bay. There is an engineered walkway to take you back towards the port that",
          "Some breath taking views and an altogether nice place to visit! Lots of different pathways leading all over, lots of walking involved so maybe not suitable for those less mobile.",
          "As a frequent barefooter, I was shocked to be told by a rather unfriendly member of staff that i was not allowed to be barefoot in the museum for 'secunity reasons' and would have to leave! It was even implied that my state of shoelessness was somehow uncivilised. Fortunately I",
          "Have visited 3 times and do not tire of it. The buildings and site are marvelous, the ingenious and very inventive use of concrete in a totally original way is wonderful. Every corner is beautiful.",
          "What a surprise and delight Marseille is. Having heard so many doom and gloom stories over the years. Mucem is a marvellous. You can go in and look around , see the views without paying but the tickets are really worthwhile only \u20ac9 to visit all of the exhibitions, excellent",
          "\"Mucem\" is a museum I picked To visit but like many other modern art Museums, there's a lot of space. In part, History - the interesting bit and part \"art\" Based on the theory of Duchamps that Anything can be art (I lack tact).",
          "Great contrasts of modern architecture and the old fort. You can go to the old and new areas for free (during opening hours) and sit in the gardens, courtyards and cafes. The only part I didn't think much of was the permanent exhibition - a very light run through Mediterranean",
          "We really enjoyed our day here - and trust me, you can spend an entire day! They building is magnificent; like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before. Various floors, with a wrap around walkway, plus a high walkway over to the old fort. It all was good, but the star of the show was",
          "Stumbled on this place whilst wandering. Entry is free to the outside areas and the area is enough to keep one amused. There is a cafe/restaurant on site with tables and chairs also, some loungers with waiting service. Ideal place for an afternoon at little or no cost.",
          "While my wife visited the local church I took advantage of the free 1st Sunday of the month and popped into Mucem for an hour that could easily have turned into 3 or 4 hours. So much to visit and the building itself is stunning.",
          "The museum is dedicated to a presentation of the Mediterranean cultures and customs. Its modern architecture make an very attractive place to visit and is a shot walk from the Vieux Port.",
          "Interesting expositions and a rather mazy way of connecting different buildings of the museum. The only drawback is everything is in French. No way to get 100% out of the museum if you don't speak French. Update: the rooms with the history of the Fort itself were in English and",
          "Really impressive, modern art museum in the port. Highlight is definitely the architecture and steel bridge. I would sit outside and have a drink/snack to enjoy the view. Must see when in town.",
          "A crazy mixture of old and new. Plenty of history but also some great exhibitions such as the one on Ai Weiwei.",
          "It was a lot of fun strolling around the old fort- you could spend a lot of time here there is a lot to learn especially with a knowledgeable guide",
          "We went to see Ai Weiwei and enjoyed looking around the gardens and fort. The building was also stunning and doing a glass of wine whist looking at the med was delightful.",
          "We visited the MUCEM and had a great time there. We were lucky to catch and enjoy the Ai Wei Wei exhibition. Overall very interesting and enjoyable!",
          "Amazingly beautiful building done by Rudy Ricciotti, this museum is worth visiting even for the building itself and not only the exhibition taking place at the moment. I've seen a very well curated Ai Weiwei exhibition. The staff was very friendly. There is a large bookstore",
          "great expectations were not confirmed when we visited. Location is fantastic, but architecture is not up to standard to the location. Missed opportunity. The walk around the building to get to the terrace is a \"joke\". So many offices. Our income taxes go to pay all these people",
          "We went to this museum that was opened in 2013 when Marseille was the European city of culture, something that the friendly locals are very proud of. I really enjoyed the section on the history of agriculture moving across the mediteranian regions. Some of the other exhibits are",
          "Ideally located in the earth of Marseille, the museum is a gem. You should take the passerelle starting I the old city to get to the terrasse of the museum. The architecture and materials used here are completely revolutionary . Museum have a cafeteria, and the exhibitions are",
          "Loved the Or and Ai Weiwei exhibitions. Also the way it is constructed, the fort...blew us away totally.",
          "One of Marseille\u2019s most extraordinary attributes, this fort was built in the mid-1600s to defend the entrance to the Port of Marseille. As such, it occupies a beautiful piece of real estate in the city. If you like history, you\u2019ll love this place, but even if you don\u2019t have any",
          "We entered the museum via the old port entrance to the fort. As a disabled person the route took us via a series of lifts and high level walkways with great views over the port and the fort. We had a rest at the outdoor restaurant on the top floor before visiting the",
          "Unique architecturally and totally. It adds the 21st century to the fascinating history of this not yo be missed city. The Ibis Style hotel is also a breath of fresh air.",
          "MuCEM is short for the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations. It\u2019s located next to the giant ferris wheel along the southwestern waterfront. You could enter for free or pay a fee to visit the exhibits. We discovered there were pedestrian walkways or bridges",
          "Huge site and range of exhibitions ,kids stuff ,serious hospitaller history , magnificent views , a very good albeit pricey restaurant , unashamedly medditeranean in outlook , to the point of innacuracy occasionally but hey the overall delivery of the place is spectacular",
          "Walk up and down in the old fortress with different views over the city and the sea and any time with the ferries to Corsica as background. Some nice terraces will welcome you. Great spot indeed !!",
          "A bonus with MUCEM is that it's a great location to watch the sunset. A bottle of wine. Bread and cheese. Golden!",
          "Very new museum , impressive building next to the port. There are very interesting permanent as well as temporary exhibitions, there are historical as well as art exhibitions. Wonderful terrace at the top of the museum, as well as historic fort which lies next to the museum.",
          "The Mucem includes the J4 building and the Fort St. Jean. The fort is a restoration and houses additional galleries with a stunning view of the Old Port. The exhibitions were interesting and told more stories than just being a collection of dusty objects. The lattice exterior of",
          "Amazing ...well worth the trip and so educational and informative. We learnt a lot and it\u2019s really good for families with kids. Especially those who are homeschoolers.",
          "An interesting Fort, entrance is free, but you pay to enter the museum. Beautiful views of the city and harbour.",
          "Amazing location at the mouth of the old harbor. Exploring the old fortification provides amazing views in all directions from elevated vantage points. However keep in mind some are only accessible by climbing many stairs. There are three little Caf\u00e9s that serve refreshments.",
          "Great place to visit and lovely views. Very interesting and well worth visiting. Good walks round the walls.",
          "An interesting old fort which contains exhibitions and stunning views of the port, sea and hills as you walk around the outside.",
          "Well worth it. A bit of a walk from the Vieux Port itself but overall we felt the views offered of the city were great. If you are interested in history this is a great place. Wear sunscreen in the summer!",
          "We really enjoyed the permanent exhibition at Mucem call Connectivity. It provides an excellent review of Mediterranean history. We spent several hours here. It cost 7 euros per person (discounts only for EU citizens) but worth it. You can also visit the fort itself. Some",
          "Fantastic place - lots of hidden gems and the Ai Weiwei exhibition was a welcome surprise. Be prepared for lots of walking upstairs but the seats overlooking the port entrance at the top of Des Armes offer a place to catch your breath! Allow at least three hours to cover",
          "Perfect fusion between the old traditional style of the fort and the new modern design. Get their the first time through the top passerel, enjoy the terrasse and the view before wandering on the esplanade. The settings are just awesome... Curation wise, the permanent exhibition",
          "We enjoyed our morning here. It was free and full of amazing citylines for photos. You need to be able bodied here as far as I could tell. Free was a plus too!",
          "It is a beautiful place and there are a huge outdoor space and plenty of exhibitions. It cost 9.50\u20ac, but 5\u20ac if under 25 years old. You will get an amazing view there. The only thing missing is info in english about the exhibitions, since it is mainly in french.",
          "We came to Marseille from Aix en Provence. Bought a day ticket for public transport in Marseille for 5.20 euros and rode the metro and buses. We visited on July 4 and it was pretty hot. We took a bus and arrived to this area. It is next to Fort Saint Jean so visited MuCEM as",

          "If you are not into museums, nevertheless don't skip this one. Don't pay for the exhibitions (9,5 euros/person) if you don't like that but enjoy the architecture of it and the way it is connecting the new and the old building. Also, relax at the terrace where you can sit or lay",
          "Nice for the view of the town. Linked to MUCEM so relax at the terrace. It is not huge so you won't spend too much time.",
          "Once a castle, the Mucem is an interesting combination of old and new. A sky bridge links the Mucem to the ultra modern J4 building which currently houses a very interesting exhibit by Ai Weiwei. Also in the J4 building are exhibits of the roots of Mediterranean agriculture",

          "Free entry (as at june 2018), exhibition displays are chargeable Roam the inside of the old fort area, beautifully restored. Walk around the top edge of the fort for fantastic 360 degree views of Marseille. After cross the modern metal bridge to the exhibition area , relax in",

          "Don\u2019t get me wrong it is a spectacular building/s however if you go here to see \u2018art\u2019 it is either in very short supply or else it is hidden away somewhere where we did not find it. Very clumsy and no great directions on where to go, was very disappointed having paid 9\u20ac to not",
          "a must visit if you are passing from Marseille, brilliant architecture, fantastic view, interesting exhibitions",

          "Fort St Jean is joined to the MuCEM by a bridge and the Panier by another. There was an unusual exhibit tied with Voyages imaginaires : Picasso et les ballets russes, design of costumes and backdrops Picasso did for the Russian ballet. A recent film with excerpts from the",
          "my main reason to visit Marseille was the MuCEM. Its lace like architecture is a pleasure to wander through. The permanent collection houses artifacts from the Mediterranean. A temporary exhibit on gold was the main feature. Some of the pieces shown were known such as Cesar\u2019s",
          "A total disappointment. Blocks of concrete, endless corridors, steep staircases and very few, if any, \"oeuvres d'art.\" A wate of time and money.",
          "Very nice museum and kid friendly. Exhibits were really amazing. Enjoyed Picasso at the Fort which is right across the walkway.",
          "On our one day in Marseille Abbaye Saint-Victor was closed so we headed to Fort Saint-Jean. The fort buildings are free but you need to pay to go into the museum. It was a beautiful sunny afternoon and the water was absolutely sparkling. There were also spring flowers around",
          "Mucem is an amazing museum, we like the combination of new with old, the gardens and the views,it's a must",
          "You must go to the rooftop, enjoy the view on the port, and the 'rade'. Try to tune out the ferry's wheel if you can. And you will also find a nice exhibition. All that downtown! No car or transportation required!",
          "Great view from the Vieux Port, plenty of medieval architecture and interesting exhibition for a very affordable price",
          "Fort St Jean is a bit of a city oasis - within the walls the buzy Marseille outside disappears. It's connected to the MUCEM with a cool bridge. The Tour du Roi Rene provides a superb view over the old harbour and Notre Dame de la Garde! There's nice sunbeds for an afternoon nap,",
          "After hearing so much about the Mucem, I had high hopes, but everything about the museum is really poorly designed. Even though I went in April- not high tourist season- the museum was barely capable of handling the number of people here (and there were not that many of us).",
          "It is a dirt where you can walk around for free it has got good views out to sea and of the port, it has a cafe and also has an audio guide you can listen too (you have to pay for that) the history is impressive too.",
          "Very nice museum for it's architecture, multiple exhibits but was disappointed in the Picasso exhibit... La Vieille Charit\u00e9 is much nicer - go up to the terrasse... view the Mediterranean, the landscape... Fort St.Andr\u00e9, the walkway between the two",
          "a must do for the view - a pity that the restaurant on the terrasse overlooking the ocean closes at 5 (museum closes at 6 during the winter months).... such a pity - definitely not adapted for tourists who would appreciate having a nice hot chocolate, crepe or more after",
          "A beautiful building to explore, as well as great displays. The whole experience was educational and interesting.",
          "Even though a lot was not in English, it was easy to navigate and to appreciate the exhibits to understand the importance of wine, wheat, and olives to Mediterranean life and history. Very informative",
          "Beautiful large old port with two ancient forts on each side of the sea entrance.Filled with hundreds of small pleasure boats and some deluxe yachts. Surrounded by restaurants - expecially on the Northern, sunny side. In Marseille, all roads lead to the Vieux Port.",
          "The building itself is worth the visit for its architectural merit. Whilst it is a very modern building, its facade is made of beautifully crafted steel panels, almost like lace. The steel bridge connecting the modern building and the old fort is one of the many interesting",
          "I went with my family there . Very interesting museum. You can see how Marseille was growing. When you get there you will get a translator. Very easy to use .",
          "So far the main attractiveness of this museum is the building itself. It is a modern building that makes references to the Mediterranean architecture (the moucharabieh). It has a nice terrace with a wonderful view, a nice gift shop and a fine restaurant. When I visit this place,",
          "It was a very windy February day when we visited. Our only thoughts were how quickly could we leave.",
          "There was only one exhibit that we found somewhat interesting. The rest of the exhibits were not to our taste and the curation was not thought provoking. The ticket we paid for allowed access to the exhibits in the fort - the only problem is that they were between exhibits - so",
          "I wanted to see the permanent show about Mediterranean civilisations. Only one room about agriculture was open. The one about religions was closed down. The show about football was not too convincing.",
          "Worth the visit! We visited the Fort thinking it wouldn\u2019t be overly exciting, but the views of the harbour are absolutely stunning. We visited for free (you can walk around the grounds without museum entry for free). The fort is a labyrinth of stairs and alleys leading to",
          "This is a truly interesting and multi-faceted museum right on the Mediterranean Sea and within a short walking distance of the Old Port. The displays were well done and highly illuminating on the history of cultures and civilizations that touch the Mediterranean.",
          "I would recommend stopping here and exploring what this museum has to offer. Well worth the price of entry.",
          "Unless you visit the now attached museum, you are only able to see the outside. But the cost is minimal and there is quite a bit of history. A great stop.",
          "Another piece of architecture to grace the port. A nice walk to visit all seasons. I imagine it would be. Even more beautiful in summer",
          "You will need a full day to explore all the attractions of the site and the museum's displays. The modernist building in itself is worth the visit together with the bridges that link it to the fortress and thence to the city",
          "This place was top of our list of places we wanted to visit in Marseille. If you are a lover of modern innovative Architecture you will love it. We wound round the various levels of the structure and were amazed at how the outer shell is constructed. The open area at the top",
          "This was one of my favourite places we visited in Marseille. It has been really beautifully restored and has some very nice quirky architectural touches. I took loads of photos here as there was so much to explore. My other half went up the narrow steps of the square tower and",
          "great place in Marseille to feel what was the life around Mediterranean see. Several expositions give you this flavor. On top of that Fort St Jean built by Vauban give you the opportunity to understand How the old city was protected",
          "A sprint through development of agriculture and cities, great time line, excellent introduction to a visit to marseille and then up to \u2018nous sont foot\u2019",
          "Lovely place to wander and gaze over Marseille. The place has been renovated to a good standard and is surprisingly wheelchair friendly, considering the number of levels. It is free and a must to visit.",
          "While the museum may be the main attraction, I really enjoyed walking over the various rooftops (all with different accesses and on different levels) and especially looking at the various plants/trees plantes on each one. The views on the sea, port, city and other sites are also",
          "Seems interesting but lots of exhibits are closed except the football ones.Dont know for how much time.Anyway it looks stunning.Dont miss it !",
          "Looked forward to visiting this museum and we were very disappointed that it is temporarily closed except for a special exhibit on football. It was interesting to enjoy the ocean view from the mucem and the connecting fort.",
          "When we visited Mucem, there was a nice football related exhibition. A couple of other exhibitions weren't ready yet, so the timing for our visit wasn't very optimal. Anyhow this is a nice museum to spend some time!",
          "A good place to rediscover the city from the former piers and at the fortified entrance of the old harbor. We saw a superb temporary exhibition of Mediterranean trade from antiquity to middle age, at the cross road of civilizations. Don\u2019t miss the visit!",
          "Good views, impressive structure. Can wander right around this solid structure. Lovely walk on a sunny day!",
          "It was an exhibition featuring football. As this is not our main sport we found this exhibit not to our liking. The videos were in French and as English speaking left us uneducated in their popular sport",
          "Well worth a visit on a clear day. Quirky bridges between the 3 buildings (closed Tuesdays) and no entry fees",
          "Great modern architecture. Actually it is a complex of a modern masterpiece, an old fortress and beautiful blue Mediterranean water.",
          "Even if you don't attend an exhibition the building is a very worthwhile visit in its own right, and provides some excellent photo opportunities. Restaurant in the open air on the roof.",
          "Very beatiful view. Nice buildingm very good to take photo there. It has special archtiecture. ..........",
          "Loads to see and do and wonderful displays and gardens - Loovely area and attached to other places so you can spend ages in this area",
          "A great place to spend a couple of hours - so well kept and wonderful views from the top . It is in a wonderful part of the town.Internally it is beautifully kept with superb garden areas",
          "Great collection of medieval buildings and home of various exhibitions. The buildings breath an ambience of history and some spots provide a great view on Marseilles harbour, sea and coastline.",
          "All state museums in Marseille give free entrance the first Sunday of every month- It's not very well advertised. (We went in October) We enjoyed and were interested in a display History room in this museum, but found other rooms 'not our cup of tea'. Worth checking what",
          "This area has been rejuvenated and made over as a great tourist destination. With a lot to see about 'old' Marseille and its history.",
          "Depends on the temporary exhibitions, but the permanent historical section was excellent. One very expensive restaurant, one reasonable one in the fort",
          "A restored fort which made for a nice walk and introduction to the the waterfront Includes a museum (mucem) with varying exhibitions and many public areas that are free to enjoy for the entire family. Very age friendly with Ramps, elevators and public bathrooms.",
          "You can walk all the way around the fort. Nice places to sit and unwind while looking over the sea and the lovely Palais Pharo",
          "What an amazing museum. Constructed within a 13th Port fortification, a perfect marriage of old and new architecture by Rudy Ricciotti The museum has some great exhibits and a outdoor great caf\u00e9.",
          "On a flying visit to Marseille we had to make a choice about visits and I am so glad I was advised to stroll around the museum site. The mix of old and new architecture is amazing, coupled with 360\u00b0 views of the city and the sea....stunning. From this vantage point you will",
          "After reading reports we decided not to go into the actual exhibit areas as by all accounts the displays were unexciting and a bit sparse having said that there was a football exhibit due to take place in October which we would have been tempted by! The real star of the show is",
          "This is a must for Marseille history with detailed video to watch. A great spot for harbour viewing as well. A walking bridge connecting the Museum of European and Mediterranean",
          "It had been a military base and there had been no tourist\u2019s visiting before it has developed and redesigned by France government since 2013. Now it\u2019s very hot place for not only tourists but local persons. You can see the quite good city and port view and feel the relaxed life",
          "Getting access to this monument is really nice, it has a long history, a lot of small paths. The map does not explain circulation very well, but I found it part of the experience, how to get around. The view over the harbor and its entrance is stunning.",
          "Go there. If the expos are not to your taste, the buildings architecture is worth the trip anyway. Right now the topics are agriculture and sea-faring, both interesting in my opinion. Take the bridge to the Fort St Jean and get lost in guard paths.",
          "Exhibitions are niche and change regularly so I would recommend checking online before you go; you could go and not be interested in any of the exhibitions. There a football exhibition opening soon! I would recommend Audio guides for non-French speakers as not all the written",
          "The renovation of this commanding historic stone complex at the entrance to the old port is a credit to Marseille. It offers great views on both the city and the seas, as well as various exhibits.",
          "What an amazing building but sadly not very interesting inside. You will find a cultural room with the local history and a media place on different floor. What amazing views on the port especially when you will cross on the bridge to join the old fort",
          "Great place. An impressive expression of merging the old with the new. The old fort that houses half of the exhibitions transitions flawlessly to the modern buildings that house the other half. The view is great from the top of the old fort, the exhibitions are also very",
          "This fort is to beautiful and amazing. Inside, you can see the city in angle of 360\u00b0 from many different points, and each one provides you a different view of the city. There are many exhibitions there. It's next to the Cathedral \"La Major\" and the Port. You can go on foot. The",
          "My husband and I visited and found little information about what to see there. We just stumbled on an exhibit about sea travel, which we found only marginally interesting. The building itself was the most interesting part of our visit. We were glad it was free the day we visited.",
          "Nice walk around the fort, most of it is free but there are some exhibitions you have to pay to visit. Some fantastic views and the architecture is fab. There's a cafe on the top floor that's worth a visit, in the part of the building that is a sculpture in itself with great",
          "Interesting just to walk across the bridge that connects the old fort to the new museum. You also get a great view back across the port.",
          "This is connected by a walk bridge to a modern museum. Thehas museum has various floors and rooms with interesting displays, that you can pay to visit.",
          "Like many new projects it looks stunning and the approach over the footbridge is dramatic, via the old fort to the roof terrace and restaurant of Mucem. But where is the entrance? Ah down some stairs, or via this ramp, we're unsure but eventually arrive at ground level and",
          "This is a funny looking building and you can walk to it via a bridge from the Fort St. Jean. It gives a nice view out to sea but there is not much there and it wouldn't be the end of the world if you didn't go.",
          "You can walk around most of the fort for free and it gives a nice view out to sea. It was quite nice but there was not much there. You can pay to go into certain parts.",
          "The architecture of this museum, occupying part of a windswept space overlooking the sea, is imaginative and pleasing. However it was really difficult to work out what you were paying for when buying a ticket; the exhibitions were confusingly signed, and the toilets very hard to",
          "We went to this place by accident as Le Petit Train Touristique wasn't running due to filming in progress on the sea front. It's an amazing place - lovely to walk around, admire the views, stop in the coffee place on the top floor. Architecture is fantastic.",
          "It is a combination of a modern building with contemporary exhibitions and a medieval fortress with beautiful view of the sea and the Old port of marseille. Pay attention: it is free to walk inside the museum and in the fortress. You will have to pay only if you want to go to",
          "This is a remarkable museum in many many ways. While the specific exhibits change and range from fascinating to \"oh, well\" the design of the building, its flow from the Old Port is astonishing. Space, light, sudden views of the harbor, even the food are all first rate! not",
          "Pictures speak a thousand words. We have a great time walking around the fort and you are able to take pictures of marsellie from different directions. Highly recommend",
          "The mucem is worth a visit to anyone going to Marseille. Not only is the history about the area interesting, the architecture of the mucem building itself is very beautiful. It's structure reminded me of a bees honeycomb. Within the mucem there is a walkway/cafe where you can",
          "The MUCEM is a wonderful new addition to Marseille's culture. The building is absolutely stunning. This is a must-see when in Marseille.",
          "We didn't enter the exhibition part of the Mucem, but we could see the view from the castle - it was marvelous!",
          "First, I love that this place was free to enter. We enjoyed wandering around checking things out. Even though it was a scorching hot day in July, we enjoyed the views of the sea and the city of Marseille. It was cool to walk around the fort and visualize the history. There is a",
          "It's really great to see the modern building from the outside and walking up inside offers a new insight into the surroundings. Crossing the bridge is amazing, and so are the old buildings on the other side. But we couldn't find half the exhibitions, and the permanent one is",
          "We went to Marseille mostly to see this museum \"Mus\u00e9e des Civilisations de l'Europe et de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e\", (Mucem) Our trip was more than worth it! We found the building itself simply fantastic! The relatively new museum (built 2013) is situated at the harbour and somehow",
          "The bar closes at 6.30!pm whilst plenty of people are around. I can't understand this. The place as such is superb",
          "A great place to visit loads to see in the two locations and a great value at \u20ac14.99 for a family of 4 and \u20ac3.50 for a unit to translate for you. There is no time limit so you can enjoy at your own leisure there is a lovely cafe where you can sit and enjoy watching the boats.",
          "With some very nice viewpoints, a connection between old and modern art this is definitely a recommendation when being in Marseille. They show you which part of the castle was from the commandants and the soldiers etc. With a modern bridge you are brought to some fancy buildings",
          "We did not even go into the museum, but the building itself is worth going to!!! Closes at 1930, be in time!",
          "very interesting museum , probably can get a little enhanced by using some supporting museum technologies",
          "The idea of a museum of Mediterranean civilisations sounded interesting. The modern building housing the museum is fantastic and is connected to the old fort by s walkway. The old fort is fascinating and the walkway was a great experience. However, the museum itself has very",
          "If you are not wanting to visit on of the exhibitions, then just get be impressed by the fantastic architecture from the outside. Lunch oder dinner could be taken at the Les Halles de le la major, right in the other side of the street, very tasty food!",
          "The architecture is fascinating and the melding of the new building with the old fort was done in an interesting way. That said, the exterior is the best part. Visit the old fort for free and do not waste time or money on the MUCEM experience. Walk around outside and enjoy the",
          "Being in Marseille - one of the oldest cities in Europe, this museum is a major disappointment. Architecture is beautiful, and it was obvious that government spent \u20ac68 mln on this project. Yet, there is barely any collection to display, expositions feel random, educational",
          "Interesting fortress where the Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations is situated & also a path to the famous district Le Panier.",
          "The outside area is amazing and you do not need to pay for that. There are excellent views from the terrace to the harbour and the city. During the summer/spring, you can appreciate the gardens; not so big, but nice.",
          "The setting and exterior is amazing and you can access the gardens and terrace for free. The exhibitions were ok but not that many original pieces and woefully few toilets . Better outside than in ?",
          "An astonishing architecture! A surprising roof top with excellent restaurants! The exbitions now presented, ordinary.",
          "Les Aventuriers de la mer until October. Informative, instructive. Clearly presented with information in English. From sailing boats to navigating instruments. Fascinating maps. Great way to revise ( or learn ) about Christopher Columbus and Magellan. Very enjoyable.",
          "Very interesting building connected to Fort St Jean. From the rooftop there is a nice view of the harbor and the city. We did not go to the museum.",
          "A very interesting castle on the beach, with remarkable architecture. There is also a museum, but even miss it, there are excellent views from the terrace to the harbor and the city. It is connected with an air bridge with the museum of the Mediterranean civilization.",
          "Imagine soldiers defending their city centuries ago, imagine batteleship entering the port! Impressive!",
          "What an incredibly chilled and beautiful part of Marseille. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at the old fort, walking along the walls and enjoying the sunshine. The views out to sea make for a perfect picture opportunity. What made this trip so photographic for me was the blend of",
          "It is definitely an iconic building with a beautiful metal cladding. There is quite a good exhibit about the peoples of the Mediterranean but after that not much else...I really would not take young children and our teenagers' interest was not held for long. I can see what they",
          "The architecture is a chapter of its owvn. Try to take the walk around the main building - from level 0 or 1 to the caf\u00e9 level - its a nice and beautiful walk. The exhibitions in July 2017 is very interesting and extremely relevant due to challenges the world face to day,",
          "Built in 2013, the Mucem really changes the image of Marseille. The architecture is really modern and interesting. You really feel comfortable when being here. But when it comes to the museum itself, I do not understand much of what to see here. You only pay for certain",
          "Mucem is great place to visit and enjoy the exhibitions . The location is also very nice so you can enjoy walking around.",
          "First, please remember museums are closed on Tuesday and they are FREE on the 1st Monday of the month. After trying on a Tuesday, we returned on Sunday. You can walk around for free and admire the architecture with is worthwhile, but this is a review of the museum MUCEM. As far",
          "This place is very informative and entertaining. If you have kids I highly recommend this museum that gives you fun, interesting and easy to swallow information about the Mediterranean Sea. It is still worth it even if you are not very much into museums. The architecture, the",
          "It's a pleasant walk along the harbor to reach this Fort and an absolutely stunning view from the tower in all directions!",
          "This museum is in many ways a one-off, since it combines old and new, in both exhibits and architecture. You dump your bag downstairs, but you can take your camera with you for later.I liked the display of \" what defined Provence \" i.e. wheat, olive oil and wine - and how these",
          "Great view, very nice waiters who gave us free water, great place to relax and stay for a while admiring the view",
          "Great space for exploring wandering and gazing. Well worth the visit. Loved the walking links between museum and old fort. Forget the map, just wander and have a look at the views. Great exploring. Couldn't figure how to get to every bit - which was good, half the fun is trying",
          "We didn't visit many of the exhibits, but loved the new architecture and the exhibit on waste and recycling. In the city of Marseille and Paris itself we found little recycling though so hopefully the exhibit will start to make an impact eventually.",
          "I really don't understand the mixed reviews on here - it's an amazing building and the exhibits were interesting and varied, despite my poor language skills! As a lot of reviewers have commented - the building itself is a work of art. Visibly impressive, it's also functional,",
          "Great views, stairs leading to hidden gardens, elevated bridges and spectacular architecture. We didn't even feel like we needed to go inside the museums.",
          "I've been here many times. I haven't yet seen an exhibition that is memorable - interesting certainly. But each time I visit the Mucem my breath is taken away by the astounding view and the fact that most of the public spaces are free and publicly accessible.",
          "Part of the renovated complex that includes the Mucem. Most of the public places are free! You get incredible views and can have a drink in one of the two cafes. There are also art installations you can view -- again free.",
          "The modern building itself in very interesting,and inside the walk up with the view is beautiful. The exhibitions that were there weren't very interesting in my opinion ,was a bit weak .but the roof with the bar and the scenery and the bridge to cross and to go to the fort",
          "We didnt go inside the museum as the day was simply too gorgeous, but it is an amazing building to walk around and view from outside.",
          "Mucem is a stunning new addition to Marseille. Marseille has re-invented itself in recent years and has lifted itself to a serious good place to visit... I am biased as I have always liked Marseille this recent (and 5th visit)makes me proud of Marseille",
          "Great views of the city! Great place to walk around and take photos. entrance is free if you don't go into the museum. Cafe is highly overpriced.",
          "Sure the building itself is interesting if you're a buff about architecture, and the fort is OK though there really is not much to see. That's where it all ends, there is literally nothing else to see here, absolutely NOTHING, how this is considered a museum is beyond me, I'm",
          "This museum was my favourite part of Marseille. The city itself is run down and the Grand Hotel at the old port is not so grand. Lots to see both inside and outside this museum - take the time to take a look and entrance to the main areas in free (and the WiFi is free as well).",
          "Really interesting but complicated museum. When I was there, there was the most thought provoking display on waste - absolutely brilliant. There are many parts of the museum that you can wander around for free, you only really pay for the exhibits. There is free wifi inside",
          "Bad luck it was pouring rain when I decided to walk from the Vieux Port with a friend of mine, local. Pouring rain, we got there drenched but the benefit is that the place was empty! Do not expect too much from the collections, depending also on temporary exhibitions... but",
          "This stunning museum encompassing 3 buildings is what drew us to Marseille and it is worth visiting for the architecture alone.The MUCEM building with its 'lace' and glass facade' is stunning and an experience in graceful views which reflected the exterior facade along the",
          "A major component of the Muceum is walking the grounds of the fort. The views of the coast and the massive nature of the structure are impressive. Unfortunately, due to my own lack of French, I couldn't appreciate the history because their signs weren't translated on the",
          "There is plenty to explore apart from the exhibitions. The building is outstanding with very modern features and architectural originality.",
          "What an amazing place! The architecture, the exhibitions and the facilities! Not expensive and really worth the visit, wonderful",
          "The museum building was fantastic! Very innovative and modern. We recommend the surrounds and the grounds. But the exhibition on the history of the Mediterranean? So disappointing! It is quite unbelievable that an area so rich in history could be reduced to such a mundane",
          "Gallery Mediterranean is where we went. Expensive, nothing really old, a bit amateurish. All in French except for introductory panels - if you want anything else you pay for an audio-guide. Architecture interesting but tick-box. Don't bother unless you want to spend a whole",
          "Amazing mix of old and new buildings and spaces vie for supremacy with the exhibitions they host. J4 seems to float within the harbour. A dark monolith accessed at the top by a footbridge. Abstract exterior panels of cast concrete play with light and views to excite the eye.",
          "If You love the Sea and the boats you would love this place. I remember coming here with friends in the summer of 2009. Though of coming here again to just sit here enjoy the sea breeze that I love so much and the boats. For me it was the best way to relax and unwind after some",
          "Just walk around the fort, the bridge to the museum and around/through the building itself. Unless you have a group of kids with you that didn't pay attention in class, don't bother paying to see the exhibits.",
          "The real attraction here is the building and the outlying complex in the fort, and you could spend a good deal of time exploring. You'll find great views of Vieux Port throughout the museum complex. You may also happen upon an outstanding exhibit inside, such as a Picasso show",
          "The MuCEM is the result of a major cleanup of the old Marseille port, making it inviting without sacrificing the historic forts. The MuCEM is not a collection of great art. It is a space from which to approach the old city. Use it as an access point, walk across the bridge to",
          "I just wanted to have good views of the Mediterranean and of the Old Port. The fort provided both of these, and was free to visit. There is a museum, but just visiting the fort itself is perfect for seeing boats coming in and the sun setting or rising. There are many food",
          "Not a place to go to specifically just a fortress from the outside nothing in the inside but if you happen to be there take some photos.",
          "Dont go there it is a hidious ugly building with nothing inside that a 8 years old boy doesn't know it is far from the city center and offers nothing new just an ugly metal architechture that disfigured the beautiful old harbor",
          "This one of the two old forts at the entry to the old harbour has been renovated to provide a series of walkways and gardens with lovely views as well as museums.",
          "I thought the most interesting item was the building itself, especially the exterior walls, which looked like metal lace. It makes a big difference whether you're looking inside out or outside in. I think that ordinarily it would be very calming to sit or stand or walk along",
          "A reason in itself to go to Marseille. An absolutely stunning structure. Plan to sit at their terrace coffee shop and relax.",
          "When you visit Fort Saint-Jean, you should simultaneously visit the Cath\u00e9drale de la Major, the MuCem, the Eglise Saint-Laurent and the ever present Vieux-Port. You can also see the Panier, Le Pharo and Fort Saint Nicholas in the same process. If you have decently good legs",
          "We got a lot of exercise and wonderful views by walking all around the fort, which had historical exhibits and which was connected by walkways to some other museum (whose name I forget) that had exhibits of history and art.",
          "No displays, just this restored fort building. Yes, you get good views of Vielle Port from the ramparts, but that's about it.",
          "Unless the MUCEUM has a special exhibit that appeals to you, do not bother to go there. Lot's of exhibit space which is likely to host avant garde art shows.",
          "A hard to describe experience. A lot about the people of the Mediterranean and all very interesting. The inevitable language difference does get in the way a bit but still worth a visit.",
          "This museum was recently built and has a permanent exhibit on the medeterranian culture(s), as well as other temporary exhibits. I saw the one on garbage (2017) which is very well done, as is focuses both on local in international issues. The rooftop terrace, the bridges to and",
          "Mucem is well worth a visit to explore the fantastic building and surrounds alone. I wasn't quite so impressed by the permanent collection, but some of the special exhibitions were memorable.",
          "Costs nothing to get into if you are not interested in the exhibitions, amazing architecture and you can walk around the building on a ramp that internal to the outer skin but outside the main building itself all the way to the top. If not keen on heights there is a lift to take",

          "Try visiting on the first Sunday of the month when entrance if free. Even if you don't like art galleries it's well worth visiting just to explore its glorious buildings, terraces, restaurants, bars and fabulous gardens - and to enjoy the magnificent views over the harbour and",
          "Architectural beauty, fantastic location and interesting cultural exhibitions. At the new harbor. The old fort St Jean is directly connected with an amazing footbridge. Worth visiting !",
          "The architecture is really the first attraction at the museum. If you want to visit the exhibitions and appreciate everything the museum offers, you will probably spend at least five hours there. The Fort Saint-Jean is linked to the museum with a pedestrian bridge and it's",
          "You can already see this fort from the main street. Impressive, large, built in a citadel formation, designed to keep invaders out. Not much else to see except the history of the fort and how is kept out enemies. Impressive walls, and embattlements.",
          "This impressive fort, a historical monument, is located on the west side of the Old Port and was purposely built to protect the port's entrance. This fort has seen many historical events taking place and was also used as a prison. This fort was also occupied by the Germans",
          "The building is very nice, hidden from view behind the old fort in the harbour. The exhibitions aren't though, I guess its a place to bring school classes. It explains commonly known facts in laymans terms supported by infographics and a few exihibits. Didn't meet my",

          "located on the entrance of the old harbour, this impressive fortress was well reconstructed. it hosts some exhibitions, but you can wonder for free around in the outside part and the gardens, offering some stunning views on the town and the harbour. definitely a must when in",
          "Great place to sit down, relax, and enjoy the sun and the beautiful views. Lovely gardens, too. The terraces and gardens are free to visit but closed on Tuesdays.",
          "This looks a little futuristic from the outside, however it is really interesting once you get in. Lots of historical and cultural information to find out and lots of space to see things in",
          "Very interesting place, great to wander round and good views. Worth a visit as part of short stay in Marseille",
          "very nice building, spectaculair views, beautiful made. Nice walk, but further more not very much to see.",
          "We found the architecture compelling and the connecting ramps to and from the J4 dramatic. The integration with Fort Saint-Jean was well done and the views are sweeping. I would have expected more of the permanent collection which seemed like a bit lashed together. The audio",
          "This place is lovely to explore in the sunshine. You can enter via a footbridge from the MUCEM, a footbridge over the road from Vieux Port or straight off the road at the bottom of the fort. An interesting building to wander around but there are also lots of places to sit down",

          "Saw the \"Babel\" exhibition. It was interesting. Very cool building with good views from the roof. It is also worth wandering around the exterior of the building and admission is free the first Sunday every month.",
          "We spent longer here than we intended as we couldn't find our way out. The various exhibitions were interesting. I particularly enjoyed the one on translation. We felt that all the exhibitions spaces in Marseille were rather self-indulgent as there were large areas of space",
          "We visited on a wet day and found the lack of signage frustrating. There were two temporary exhibitions as well as a permanent one and access to buildings. The site is large on various levels and has many signs saying \"Sortie\" which we assumed were for the way out although some",
          "We enjoyed tea at Mucem and vies of the ocean. Intersting European history! Glad you can walk into the place without paying and access very many areas. No need for a guide!",
          "The architecture of the building is an attraction in itself and the occasion of shooting lots of photos of Fort Saint-Jean through its concrete lattice. Even though one knows most of the things on display the stories are told differently and it is always a pleasure to review",
          "Professional, astonishing temporary exhibitions ( after babel, translate) interesting presentation of permanent collection, overwhelming architecture.",
          "This is a full-day visit. The museum is excellent, very well laid out and with detailed information in French and English (although they don't always say the same thing!). The building is interesting and imaginative, the cafes are good and the toilets clean. It is a pity that,",
          "The camp of death is just behind this museum which doesn't exactly cheer you up as you approach, also from a distance it looks like a big black square box. The metallic lacework on three sides is interesting as you near but I was disappointed for several reasons. If you are",
          "For the price, this museum was a disappointment. The architecture was interesting, and the connection to Fort Saint Jean was imaginative and creative, but the museum itself was somewhat lacking in materials. It is a huge space, and it was a bit of a puzzle of why it was built",
          "Nice place to visit we love the eposition coffee and citadel plus regular exposition the best is the building so modern so nice",
          "Preface: I do not enjoy modern art. We went because we bought the 72 hour city pass (COMPLETELY WORTH IT) and wanted to hit up as many museums as we could. This one was...weird. The outside kind of reminds me of the Bird's Nest in Beijing, and the interior is a maze of ramps",
          "The multimedia (audio) features in the permanent exposition are way too loud and redundant... can't hide that I found it difficult to imagine a consistent narrative through the various parts: it looks more as a series of expositors unlinked due to poor captioning. I Was",
          "The Fort Saint Jean is a lovely old fort with great views across the harbour and the sea. The footbridge to the J4 building is made of black concrete suspended in the air above the sea and is a technological feat. The J4 building is impressive, love the design and the two",
          "It is a must see if you are in Marseille. Just the structure alone is breathtaking!! Lots of restaurants, cares and shopping nearby.",
          "The 17th-century historical monument is located at the end of the Old Port. It is adjacent to Mediterranean History & Culture center and connected by two footbridges to Mucem and the Panier neighborhood. Prepare to spend and relax yourselves 1-2 hours here just wondering around",
          "I only had the time to visit the permanent collection, which I was a little disappointed with. I thought it was overall a little scattered and lacked clarity. Would maybe suggest visiting some exhibits instead, or spending some time seeing the Fort Saint Jean's history.",
          "We were lucky for very interesting temporary exhibitions. Mediterranean hall is quite ambitious but not really conviced me, even if the proposed path is original, apart from the first part already more or less seen. External architecture very original.",
          "This is an amazing place in Marseille between the city and the sea. You can either go there to find sophisticated art topics or have a walk in an incredible mix of past and present architecture. Really a place to go in Marseille.",
          "The fort is pretty cool, but its not worth a trip if thats all youre going for. Its well restored and you can see how the fortification defended the harbor well. Cool for people who like war history.",
          "Random items, in random places, terrible exhibits with no order or meaning. Very disappointing... Only the view from atop the towers were nice.",
          "This attraction is well worth a visit with beautiful views overlooking the old port, entry is free to the main circulation area of the fort so if short of time it's ideal.",
          "A place to go and walk around but you might be very disappointed because the permanent collections are a bit limited ! It will all depend on the special exhibitions when you'll visit the Mucem :-))",
          "This place is an architectural success! Even if you don't want to see the exhibitions, take the time to walk around the building, it's amazing! The best way is to come across the footbridge from the top of the recently renovated Fort St Jean (definitely worth a visit). From",
          "Muceum has 2 main buildings across a canal with great view. We walked thru the museum for 5 hours, and have a lunch on the top. The exhibition is lively, children would find lots of fun. But you can also walk around for hours around the stairs of the building, in a good",
          "There are so many reviews, so much praises about the muscem architecture, design,location etc already, today I actually want to talk about the museum itself-- the gallery of the Mediterranean.As I pass by and visit it umpteenth times since its completion in 2013, I have long",
          "We visited the Mucem on the first Sunday of the month when entry to the exhibits is free. While they were interesting I'm not sure I would have thought the entrance fee was justified had I gone another time. Some of the temporary exhibits may be worth it, like last year's one on",
          "Nice place by the harbor. We walked in for free. You have to pay only for exhibition. You get nice view of the marina. Recommend. There is free WiFi :)",
          "This museum/gallery is located by the fort Saint Jean and the route takes in both the old fort and the very modern Mucem building. Exhibitions change in the Mucem but there were 3 available when we visited so probably something of interest for everyone.",
          "The building, the exposition, the view to the sea, the atmosphere, everything was splendid. The museum also has very interesting temporary expositions.",
          "I had some time before a couple of days of meeting and chose to see MUCEM - great choice! Really well done museum and historic site with the great contrast of modern stunning buildings. Experienced a history of coffee exhibition that was really informative.",
          "Fantastic arcitecture, incredible location, permanent presentation of mediterenian history and culture, different expositions of modern artists ( last year including Picasso). use a minimum of 3 hours to walk around, have a lunch at restaurant on top ( reserve a table",
          "Just one word: splendid! This visit is not to be missed! The premises are charged with history, the view stunning and the architectural work combining the historic site with modern additions is simply stunning. Exhibitions will probably vary in quality but the key point here is",
          "Good scenic areas. Look for a caf\u00e9 around the area, an open cafe, relax whilst you sip your coffee, enjoy the breath taking historic scenic environment. Best experienced walking around. one or 2 hours are good here.",
          "The huge structure offered only an extensive, if rather didactic, exhibit on mediterranean history than seemed more directed to kids, though I would wager kids would think the price of admission is better spent on an ice cream",
          "This is an amazing piece of architecture, and an interesting museum too. they have videos playing, but the language is French. free entry for students below 26. they have a piece of the Berlin wall too.",
          "We were in Marseille in last Christmas and visited this place on the very first day. We took Tram T3 from the hotel area to reach the port area. After seeing the port, we noticed the Mucem as the Fort and Castle was visible from a distance. We walked about a kilometre to reach",
          "After visiting Fort St Jean and crossing the bridge to the MuCem building, the architecture of the building is really inspiring, leaving one to expect the same feeling from the display. This was not the case, and very disappointing. The general impression was that of very little",
          "This place is a perfect blend of new and old, preserving St Jean's Vieux Port and at the same time opening up a new public space. The walk from the Museum (3rd floor) via the new bridge to the Old Port is a must. The whole place is elegant and clever. The wrap around the",
          "The Mucem is worth a visit! It explains the cultures of the Mediterranean and it has incredible views. The architecture is very modern and there are places to seat and relax and a restaurant that looked very nice. It is hard to explain the collection, it is a combination of",
          "Mucem main benefits : its extraordinary location on Marseille sea side, unic contrast between Fort Saint Jean and its impressive building covered by a concrete mesh, a roof top terrace with scenic view on Mediterranea, the bridge linking the museum with Provence gardens around",
          "The MuCEM (Mus\u00e9e des civilisations de l'Europe et de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e) is one of the best things to do when in Marseille - especially if you're interested in history and art. First off, the location is simply great overlooking the old port (vieux port) and the Mediterranean. The",
          "Great to crawl around this reconstructed port fort - feel all the history of the ages as you stroll through the gardens at the top of the fort.",
          "The MuCEM is located right in the centre of Marseille, between the Vieux-Port, & the Panier & Joliette neighbourhoods. You can walk around the Fort Saint Jean before taking the bridge to this Museum. It is devoted to the cultures of the Mediterranean & is a large complex. Well",
          "The site of the fort of Saint-Jean was really interesting. Stunning Mediterranean gardens have been developed which offer an ideal location for a delightful stroll & a breathtaking view across the J4 & the Joliette port.",
          "the Fort and the Mucem give a rich history of the Mediterranean- get the audio and follow along with the exhibits. (note that they don't necessarily all follow in alphabetical order) but I spent about 4 hours wandering around the Mucem and the Fort-",
          "Not only the exhibitions but also the architecture itself was quite interesting for me. Don't miss to cross the bridge to Fort Saint-Jean!",
          "Nice conclusion to a self-guided walking tour around the whole of the Old Port area. Makes for some more nice views of this picturesque area.",
          "Well worth a visit. It's very extensive and has been well designed. Easy access to all areas. The Mycenae is attached to it so very handy.",
          "The mixture of old fort and magnificent new museo is a fine venture. We were a little late for lunch at the cafe and there was almost nothing left. Should have taken a picnic.",
          "Exceptional site, amazing views. the permanant exhibition is not so interesting, the display is a bit confusing. the temporary exhibition Picasso was great, very well presented and pleasant to visit, even though crowded. Mucem is a must see, the restaurant on the other side of",
          "The fort is on the coast and the top is free to walk around on with a footbridge to Mucem. The views of the port and the surrounding area are really beautiful. It's a great place to go to take pictures.",
          "Wonderful, creative exhibit. I wish all museums were like this. They threw out the typical chronological exhibit style and still found a wal to make it work. They focused on aspects of humanity and the region that people have in common and it was a thought provoking and",
          "One of the most beautiful views of the Vieux-Port of Marseille. Walk all over de fortress. It's very well maintained with free entrance and very clean restrooms. There are also some beautiful gardens.",
          "This Museum is sited in a very important part of the city right on the waters edge and surrounded by much older buildings but it fits in well.",
          "It's possible to go round the permanent collection without knowing French and still understand what they're trying to say about Mediterranean culture. Very interesting, just like the building!",
          "Ok, so let me be honest here. I do not enjoy museums too much.. i don't know, i find them a bit boring. BUT this \"museum\" is not boring - you get to see great views over the city from couple of towers walk the rooftop bridge from old building to the new one, take some great",
          "This museum and its surroundings is an absolute masteripiece. A beautiful and most positive example of gentrification of previously derelict area. Everything is built with class and beauty. It is worth multiple visits.",
          "I visited with my friend, arriving from Vieux Port side. I was surprised that we didn't have to pay to enter the area. We didn't visit any of the exhibits but instead we walked around the complex, admiring the old juxtaposed with the new. We did try to get served in the",
          "The collection is somewhat interesting but the items are very close together, poorly explained and the video explanations are very loud. The layout is not easy to follow. The exterior of the building is very interesting. Perhaps one should spend time exploring the building over",
          "This museum is well worth going to for the architecture and wonderful view from the terrace bar. The two outdoor footpaths, coupled with the mantilla, which acts as a wind breaker, are the most interesting features of this museum. The outdoor space is also very charming. I did",
          "Great location with a historic slant as you look over the Vieux Port. Exhibitions are well organised ... Mediteranean civilisations ...",
          "This museum is part of the MUCEM, which is probably one of the most spectacular new museums to be recently built. Highly recommend to commence your visit within Fort St. Jean and make your way to to the MUCEM across a stunning bridge for lunch on the roof terrace. The majority",
          "Great wonderful steel cube of a cheese grater on the end of the vieux port, however the interior seemed badly designed and was too much open retail space and not enough exhibition space.",
          "This is an amazing museum!! Take a long time of your day to visit it. It has a lot of interesting things to see and a great view. The building itself is also really nice!",
          "We really enjoyed exploring this museum. Lots of interesting things to look at. It was an old fort at the entrance to the Harbour.",
          "I am a bit of an architectural fan so what I can say about MuCEM is that you definitely need to see the structure and walk around the building! I had no time to view the expositions but just being there was amazing. The museum is literally by the sea and it is a very special",
          "Worth visiting, nice place to spend a day, walk around and explore. Stunning views, Few places to chill out and grab a drink or something to eat. I would defenitely go again !",
          "Called in here on our Hop On Hop OFF bus tour and it is definitely worth a visit. Entry is free and the views from the ramparts are spectacular. Make sure you leave enough time to stroll across the pedestrian bridge to the very unusual Mucem building. Another very interesting",
          "This small fort is a walking distance from the port in the structure and design of this fort you will notice that they didn't spend much effort to ensure strong deference methods are in place, and it can stands major attacks or siege!! The visit was pretty short, and it is free",
          "A beautiful building with a fantastic perspective of the Mediterranean Sea. Make sure to grab a drink on the rooftop cafe.",
          "Got here hoping the Picasso exhibition was still on but we'd just missed it. Went in anyway as we were here (it is connected to the Old Fort in a part of Marseille on most people's itinerary) and wondered that such a huge beautiful building could have so little content. The",
          "Whilst the exhibitions that we saw were very good the main attraction is the building itself. Really fascinating architecture and great use of space. Loved it!",
          "The museum itself was really nice and had beautiful views of the city. The rooftop is connected to an old fort by a footbridge which you can walk around for free, and the area looks really pretty from up there. The museum itself was nice but much smaller than I expected as far",
          "The Mucem is beautiful in so many ways. Seen from the outside it has a misterious quality that delights the eye, and when you are inside in a sunny day, the dark, irregular design that encircles the building is the perfect frame to the sea and the city that are so full of",
          "The museum is a gorgeous building with a beautiful view of Marseille harbour. It's an interesting presentation of the accomplishments and history of Mediterranean culture. The current Picasso exhibition was good as well. Very worthwhile visit",
          "I come frequently here in Marseille and this city has made astonishing improvement. One of this is the Mucem an impressive complex in the middle of Mediterranean Sea where you can enjoy exposition or just walking around. A must coming place",
          "MUCEM has plenty to offer vistors. Permanent collection, temporary exhibitions and interesting location. The cafe on the top terrace is lovely, if a bit pricey but its worth it for the interesting decor/screens.Helpful staff.",
          "The building that houses the museum is spectacular, no two words about it. Some great and unique views both of and from the MuCEM and the fort that it is connected to. The presentation of the fort historically, and the contents as a museum however... not that impressive.",
          "We didn't spend long at mucem . We used it more as a gateway to the old fort but it is really pretty. It's clever how they've blended modern wrought iron architecture with the old in the fort. Bright airy spaces with a cafe and walkways with stunning views. We didn't visit the",

          "So many postiveand amazing changes for tourits in MARSEILLE since 2 years. Arriving in the city close to the port take the advantage to use the parking MUCEM. Very convenient. The lift brings you directly to the main place with the Mucem museum, the Villa Medietrran\u00e9e, the",
          "The place is absolutely fantastic. Architecture, Content, Location, and also the restaurant close to it, has remarkable value",

          "I did not enjoy this museum. There were definitely some interesting artifacts but overall they were sparse. I also did not like the open room way of displaying the items in the one room it was hard to focus on what we were looking at. The curtains dividing the areas in the",
          "This is a must visit when in Marseilles. The restaurant is also well worth it with a number of local dishes with a twist. Grand!",
          "We went in the late afternoon as the sun was becoming less fierce. You are almost transported back in history and can imagine the old port as it once was.. Very good. It will keep the children occupied for hours and you can let them roam around inside whilst you relax and enjoy",

          "A great museum with nice architecture and exhibitions. Find out all about the Mediterranean Sea and its surroundings, geography, history, pictures, paintings... A lot to see. Take a minimum of 4 hours for the tour of all the site.",
          "You must see this, a combination of fort, museum all linked together with bridges and walkways spiraling round the museum.. WONDERFUL",
          "The architecture of this building is awesome and impressive at night. Nevertheless the content is curious. I was expecting more about the mediterranean cultures. If you are in a hurry, prefer having a look from outside and spend time in the museum of Marseille which is wonderful.",
          "We had a great time wandering around the top of the forst, enjoying the absolutely stunnings views of the harbour, the city, and out to the ocean. If you are going to Mucem, make sure you do this as well.",
          "Great place to visit. Lots of attraction inside and outside. The building itself is wonderful. you spent many hours there.",
          "Loved what they had but as an english speaker it was tricky without the audio guide. That said, this is France and rather than expecting to be catered for i should expand my linguistic horizons. Great building, as is the connecting fort. Recommended!",
          "This was a great shout to go a visit this attraction. Not only is the structure unique and rather interesting there are also a number of bridges linking the museum with other parts of Marseille. Not being particularly arty myself, I still enjoyed the walk and the views and not",

          "If you don't like museums you should still go and visit this one because of the great architecture it has.... Old and modern and oh the space.... It's just amazing, the views are great and just being there feels like being somewhere else. The permanent is not to miss and of",
          "Great museum. Modern architecture. Superb roofterras. We visited the picasso exibition. You can visit the museum for free every first sunday of the month. If you don't like museums, you can just chill on the rooftop terras.",

          "Historic Place, Fort Saint-Jean was built on a site earlier occupied by the Military Order of the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John. Quite interesting visit with a lot of points to take great pictures. Entrance is free. Just a note: in Provence sometimes blows the \u2018Mistral\u2019,",
          "A good walk which offers spectacular view over the sea. After finish walking the fort, grab an ice cream or beer at one of the cafe at the port is refreshing.",
          "I've been there a couple times - you've got to check the current expostion as the permanent exhibition is interesting but well ... permanent. There can be a lot of people at time so check if they have some late night openings. There are restaurants on the top floor. What's",
          "I am truly impressed with how they leveraged the spaces and the surroundings of the museum. It is a beautiful place with incredible views, passages, places to seat and relax as well as historic/artistic expositions. I would recommend the museum at the end of the afternoon to",
          "Impressive location fo the MuCEM and great views from the top and from the walkway over to Fort Saint Jean. You'll find some mixed comments on the MuCEM in your guidebooks, but we only had enough time to see the Picasso exhibition - which is on until the end of August). We'd",
          "Watch out if you have vertigo: not only the two foot bridges are high up, but the ramp going round the building (apparently the view is nice) is very 'open'. There are stairs and lifts as well. The permanent exhibitions are interesting and chilled, the temporary one (Picasso)",
          "We had lunch close to Fort Saint-Jean and decided to visit the fort after. The entrance is free and it's a quite big fort with a lot of vantage points to get great photos from. Several elevators inside the fort makes it possible for families with children to visit the fort.",
          "Loved the Picasso exhibition! Loved the way they showed us what inspired Pablo and the fact that they also show his bromze sculptures, cheramics, carpets etc.",
          "Combining a new large museum building with the old Fort St Jean has led to a marvellous result. When we were, there was an excellent temporary Picasso exhibition, which of course added to our very positive impression of this wonderful place. Do they always have both art and",
          "MuCEM is a museum, devoted to European and Mediterranian civilisations. It sounds boring, but it isn't. It houses a book shop and permanent collections as well as temporary exhibitions like the wonderful exhibition of Picasso we were able to visit last June. The modern building",
          "I guess i expected a bit more from all the hype, but it does offer some creative and intersting exhibits and features. I recommend the secyion on immigration in Marseille, across the Mediterranean. Not just numbers but stories, imported styles and related artwork make it quite",
          "Simply a lovely experience. Relaxing or busy, either/or. Loved the seats and beds available to lounge upon an watch fellow travellers enjoying the facility",

          "When in Marseille, don't miss out on this museum. We loved the exhibitions and despite many of the signs being only in French, it was really informative. Bring your smartphone along and you can scan QR-codes and get the audio guide in your language. There's free wifi so anyone",
          "The Mucem is the most unusual place you need to visit it to understand The Architecture is absolutely amazing, the walls are like concrete lace The exhibits are superb. I saw the Picasso exhibition - truly amazing with so many items I had never seen before. The cafes and",
          "This is a fascinating use of the old Fort Saint Jean and a beautiful purpose built museum both connected by a long elevated walkway from top to top. Several outdoor eating places, the best on the roof of the modern structure with panoramic views over the port of Marseille. There",
          "Its was an excellent afternoon with some fresh air & magnifique natural scenery . An historical place of Marseille, once upon a time There was a beautiful bridge which was destroyed during second world war !",
          "I feel bad admitting we did not go into the Museum. But you could walk around the facility - outdoors and enjoy the views of the city. And many areas to sit down, relax, even get coffee or cold drinks.",
          "One of the most beautiful building in Marseille with a lovely open space and view on the sea and port, a must see!",
          "The building is very impressive and in a great location. Our own fault for not checking but Tuesday is a strange day to close. The setting is great. An easy walk from the old port.",
          "This building is quite impressive, but the exhibits are bit dumbed down, but worth exploring all the same. The view from the museum is worth it all though.",
          "This ultra modern building is worth a look even if you don't go into the Mucem. It is joined by bridges to Fort Jean and on the day we went it was very windy crossing the bridge. The cost to get in is 9.50\u20ac each. There is currently a Picasso exhibitition which was extensive and",
          "The MuCEM is an amazing building. It is of course a great museum of European and Mediterranean civilisations, with a range of exhibits, but the we though that the building itself is a beautiful work of art, and that alone merits a visit. If you have the time and the inclination,",
          "This is an amazing place. It has been nicely reconstructed and it is ideal for families as well as for just about everyone. It was built in the 17th century in order to protect the city, at the entrance to the port. It has a very long history and people can freely roam around",
          "The outside of the building is amazing and it is close to the cathedral. The things inside are nice (like Picaso) but most of them boring.",
          "You can enter the site of the museum without paying entrance - at the site is really the beautiful part. So worth to go for anyone. Surely the most beautiful spot of Marseille I saw, with breathtaking views.",
          "I loved this museum. It has a unique contemporary architecture and is linked to the Fort St. Jean with gorgeous views of the harbor and hillsides. The Picasso exhibit was incredible and extensive with works I had never seen before. Take some time with the art then go over to the",
          "Go all the way up to the top of the building. It is a nice place for the ocean view. There are flat chairs for you to lie down and enjoy the sea breeze. The restaurant on the top of the building looks very nice, too.",
          "I adored this place. Fabulous setting, wonderful exhibitions, a blend of light, sun, heat and shade. Go in the summer. You will not want to leave and you will return again and again.",
          "My visit to Fort Saint Jean was one of the few things that i shall remember from Marseille. A quite big fort with much room for exploration with free entrance. I visited the place at around 21:00 and sun was still up while there was a small festival with cold beer and local fast",
          "We didn't see much of Marseille, but managed to visit this, the Cathedral and the Museum in the same area. Very nice to walk around in and explore the sights.",
          "The stunning old fort has been combined with the contemporary museum. The views are break taking and the architecture has been creatively and uniquely done. Absolutely worth a visit.",
          "Take some time to visit Mucem! You don't need to be a museum freak to enjoy the retelling of ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean, with movies, sounds, paints and objects (permanent exhibition). There are also nice seasonal exhibitions, so pay attention to them. It's also",
          "We did not have time to see the Picasso exhibition which looked interesting. However, you can enter and go to the top for free, which we did. From there you have some great views of the city and Mediterranean. Also you can appreciate the great design of the building that is",
          "Wonderfull! I enjoyed this trip with my husband and my family! A real space of ancient and modernity! A melting pot of M\u00e9dit\u00e9ran\u00e9en culture Latin culture and also Eastern Europe culture! Very intersting!",
          "It is a very nice place for you to have a panoramic view of the old port. Besides looking from the fort, should also go down to its bottom to feel the breeze and the cool water in a sunny day.",
          "We visited the area of Mucem on the Thursday of the semi final of the europeen soccer Championship. So there wer a lot of people, but it was still not overcrowded. The entrance for the main builing is free. You can have a walk around the total area, except the exibithins",
          "I was disappointed. The streets are very old and good to see the architecture but that was it. Very few shops and restaurants. Easy to get lost. If you have to see it go by mini train its much quicker than walking!",
          "We were a bit disappointed as this is basically a castle with little on show next to an exhibition centre showing a Mediterranean museum and housing the Picasso exhibit. On Sunday there was over a 1 hour queue to see Picasso so we didn't see it. Very good because it was free",
          "The MUCEM and surrounding museums and the Fort St. Jean have completely revitalized this area of the Marseille port. Great views from everywhere and easy to visit. Good advice given by staff at the entry. The entry price of euros 9.50 is pretty steep so we did not visit the",
          "Bit tricky to find. Entrance was by walkway over the road. Walkway all grey coloured and quite depressing. It cost 9.50 euros and you got a small map to assist you. The rooms were odd with little signage and no obvious exits. There didn't seem to be much logic applied to the",
          "Mucem is connected to old castle and there is walkway going above - so the views are really nice. Currently there is Picasso exhibition ongoing.",
          "Wonderful. Beautiful. Don't miss it There was a Picasso exhibit on. Very complete and well curated. Easy to get to on foot or ferry or 82, 83 bus.",
          "My husband and I saw the Picasso exhibit and it was fascinating. We highly recommend going to the terrace and enjoying the breeze and views of Mediterranean Sea.",
          "Beautiful Site and great views of the Old Port and Mediterranean Sea. We highly recommend eating at the fort restaurant rather than at Muceum restaurant. The food is exquisite and the prices are better.",
          "You have to see the MUCEM. The building is extra-ordinary. There are temporary exhibitions. We went for the Picasso exhibition. Fantastic! The caf\u00e9 restaurants is a place to relax.",
          "The fort is refurbished and gives acces to the MUCEM. From the remparts of the fort you have a nice view on the skyline of Marseille: from Notre Dame de la Garde upto the building of Zaha Haddid.",
          "It's an overpriced museum.Visit it (and pay of course the entrance ) only for the excellent views and the relaxation on the top floor",
          "Unfortunately, my review is probably tainted by my disappointment over Bleu Evasion cancelling our tour. We ended up walking around Fort Saint-Jean, and it was a nice fort, for a fort.",
          "Great site. Beautiful art. Amazing building so modern and smart design. We absolutely loved it. The views are incredible.",
          "People of all walks of life will appreciate the copious amounts of artifacts and historical events displayed here",
          "You can spend all day walking around this place! I especially appreciated the museum close by with artifacts of all centuries.",
          "Really enjoyed the monumental architecture and use of the old fort with connection to the newer modern gallery space via interesting walkways. However maybe I missed something fundamental during our visit because I could find the exhibitory easily or at all! I was admittedly",
          "We went for a morning walk and ended up visiting this place. I loved it, so beautiful and the view from there it's amazing",
          "After a disappointing lunch - this place was a much needed lift! Great views, wonderful exhibition on Picasso. The French do a wonderful job on blending the old and new and creating vibrant public spaces. bravo",
          "Fantastic setting with superb views of the Old Port. The best Picasso exhibition we have seen in many years. Eating here is very expensive.",
          "Having missed the MuCEM on previous visits to Marseille, it was at the top of our list this time. We were not disappointed. Incredible walk through 8000 years of history and civilizations on both sides of the Mediterranean in a wonderful combination of static displays, films",
          "The museum building is a terrific piece of architecture and worth a wander across the bridge from Fort St Jean to the top terrace with its cafe. Don't know if you'd have to pay to get there as it was a free (and quite crowded) day when we went. But then you have the, initially",
          "Either get in from the bottom from the seafront or up the steps and over the bridge. Lots of nooks and crannies to explore but it helps to have some French to understand the signs (or, I'm told, the tours) and there's lots of steps. Some good views and a decent cafe before you",
          "Such a surprisingly interesting and beautiful sight, we really recommend taking half a day just climbing and walking around outside.",
          "If your a fan its awesome, If not??? There is not much else to see. Nice location, too much of a walk for older folks to get out of the museum.",
          "As others have said previously, a spectacular setting at the mouth of the Vieux Port. Before going into the exhibition make time to sit on the upper terrace and take in the view. The one thing that makes Mucem a must see in Marseille apart from its beautiful setting is the",
          "Although there is a lot of walking this is a must do. Walk across the bridge and find a cafe on the other side. The views are absolutely amazing. To tour all of the fort requires walking up and down stairs.",
          "Unfortunately we dont speak good French so we really didn't understand anything...great views though",
          "Much money has been spent restoring this old building but my sense is little remains except the basic structure. However the work is well done and I am not surprised there were many visitors. The exhibitions are chargeable but the grounds are free.",
          "This museum is hidden away on the other side of the marina. You have to enter St Jeans fort at street level (be prepared for bag checks) and then go up the steps to the rooftop gardens and across the footbridge. The building of the museum is architecturally interesting as it is",
          "The exhibitions themselves are average but the clever use of old and new buildings and imaginative use of materials make this museum worth a visit just for a tour of the buildings themselves.",
          "The actual building of the Mucem is very artistic indeed. The way in which it has been joined to the old fort and the planting of the native vegetation of the Calanques and Provence on the fort is just stunning. Similarly we were incredibly impressed with the Picasso exhibition.",
          "We saw Picasso paintings, ceramic and metal and wood art by Picasso. .. There are many exhibits... A bridge connects MUCEM with St Jean fort. Bus no 60 is ideal to reach here... It's all included in the marseille city pass.",
          "The museum itself is a beautiful structure with stunning views and gardens. My boyfriend and I paid to see the exhibits but there were only audioguides and French and very few of the information cards are translated. I was hoping to learn more about the actual history of",
          "Very neat fort. Amazing views of the port. You're free to explore and wander around at your leisure. Would have liked to have had more time to explore all its nooks and crannies.",
          "What an experience!! I was expecting art, but what I got was an exploration of an old fort, amazing views of Marseille, clever new architecture, and yes, really good fashion, culture, and ART exhibits! (the current Picasso show is first rate!!!)",
          "we went to Marsseille in December which was nice without so many turists and the city had already that nice Christmas touch.We spend good few hours walking around castle and enjoing great views especialy towards old port.",
          "The MUCEM (Mus\u00e9e des Civilisations de l\u2019Europe et de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e), a new national museum that explores the cultures of the Mediterranean was created in 2013 to celebrate Marseille's \"elevation\" to the European Capital of Culture in 2013..

          "Lovely setting good place to visit. Went March weather was good area was busy but not crowded. Would reccomend",
          "This museum is one of the great secrets of Europe and the world. For an admission of about 10 Euros, there was a (minimum) half-day itinerary of a grand fortress, fantastic Mediterranean views and multiple art exhibitions. On our visit, there was a comprehensive, world-class",

        "wiki": "The French Foreign Legion (FFL; French: L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re, French pronunciation: \u200b[le\u0292j\u0254\u0303 et\u0281\u0251\u0303\u0292\u025b\u0281], L.\u00c9.) is a military service branch of the French Army established in 1831. Legionnaires are highly trained infantry soldiers and the Legion is unique in that it is open to foreign recruits willing to serve in the French Armed Forces. When it was founded, the French Foreign Legion was not unique; other foreign formations existed at the time in France. Commanded by French officers, it is open to French citizens, who amounted to 24% of the recruits in 2007. The Foreign Legion is today known as a unit whose training focuses on traditional military skills and on its strong esprit de corps, as its men come from different countries with different cultures. This is a way to strengthen them enough to work as a team. Consequently, training is often described as not only physically challenging, but also very stressful psychologically. French citizenship may be applied for after three years' service. The Legion is the only part of the French military that does not swear allegiance to France, but to the Foreign Legion itself. Any soldier who gets wounded during a battle for France can immediately apply to be a French citizen under a provision known as \"Fran\u00e7ais par le sang vers\u00e9\" (\"French by spilled blood\"). As of 2018, members came from 140 countries.\nSince 1831, the Legion has suffered the loss of nearly 40,000 men on active service in France, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Madagascar, West Africa, Mexico, Italy, the Crimea, Spain, Indo-China, Norway, Syria, Chad, Za\u00efre, Lebanon, Central Africa, Gabon, Kuwait, Rwanda, Djibouti, former Yugoslavia, Somalia, the Republic of Congo, Ivory Coast, Afghanistan, Mali, as well as others. The French Foreign Legion was primarily used to help protect and expand the French colonial empire during the 19th century. The Foreign Legion was initially stationed only in Algeria, where it took part in the pacification and development of the colony. Subsequently, the Foreign Legion was deployed in a number of conflicts, including the First Carlist War in 1835, the Crimean War in 1854, the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859, the French intervention in Mexico in 1863, the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, the Tonkin Campaign and Sino-French War in 1883, supporting growth of the French colonial empire in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Second Franco-Dahomean War in 1892, the Second Madagascar expedition in 1895 and the Mandingo Wars in 1894. In World War I, the Foreign Legion fought in many critical battles on the Western Front. It played a smaller role in World War II than in World War I, though having a part in the Norwegian, Syrian and North African campaigns. During the First Indochina War (1946\u20131954), the Foreign Legion saw its numbers swell. The FFL lost a large number of men in the catastrophic Battle of Dien Bien Phu.\nDuring the Algerian War of Independence (1954\u20131962), the Foreign Legion came close to being disbanded after some officers, men, and the highly decorated 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) took part in the Generals' putsch. Operations during this period included the Suez Crisis, the Battle of Algiers and various offensives launched by General Maurice Challe including Operations Oranie and Jumelles. In the 1960s and 1970s, Legion regiments had additional roles in sending units as a rapid deployment force to preserve French interests \u2013 in its former African colonies and in other nations as well; it also returned to its roots of being a unit always ready to be sent to conflict zones around the world. Some notable operations include: the Chadian\u2013Libyan conflict in 1969\u20131972 (the first time that the Legion was sent in operations after the Algerian War), 1978\u20131979, and 1983\u20131987; Kolwezi in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 1978. In 1981, the 1st Foreign Regiment and Foreign Legion regiments took part in the Multinational Force in Lebanon. In 1990, Foreign Legion regiments were sent to the Persian Gulf and participated in Op\u00e9ration Daguet, part of Division Daguet. Following the Gulf War in the 1990s, the Foreign Legion helped with the evacuation of French citizens and foreigners in Rwanda, Gabon and Zaire. The Foreign Legion was also deployed in Cambodia, Somalia, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the mid- to late 1990s, the Foreign Legion was deployed in the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville and in Kosovo. The Foreign Legion also took part in operations in Rwanda in 1990\u20131994; and the Ivory Coast in 2002 to the present. In the 2000s, the Foreign Legion was deployed in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, Operation Licorne in Ivory Coast, the EUFOR Tchad/RCA in Chad, and Operation Serval in the Northern Mali conflict. Other countries have tried to emulate the French Foreign Legion model.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe French Foreign Legion was created by Louis Philippe, the King of France, on 10 March 1831\nfrom the foreign regiments of the Kingdom of France. Recruits included soldiers from the recently disbanded Swiss and German foreign regiments of the Bourbon monarchy. The Royal Ordinance for the establishment of the new regiment specified that the foreigners recruited could only serve outside France. The French expeditionary force that had occupied Algiers in 1830 was in need of reinforcements and the Legion was accordingly transferred by sea in detachments from Toulon to Algeria.The Foreign Legion was primarily used, as part of the Arm\u00e9e d'Afrique, to protect and expand the French colonial empire during the 19th century, but it also fought in almost all French wars including the Franco-Prussian War, World War I and World War II. The Foreign Legion has remained an important part of the French Army and sea transport protected by the French Navy, surviving three Republics, the Second French Empire, two World Wars, the rise and fall of mass conscript armies, the dismantling of the French colonial empire, and the loss of the Foreign Legion's base, Algeria.\n\n\n=== Conquest of Algeria 1830\u20131847 ===\n\nCreated to fight \"outside mainland France\", the Foreign Legion was stationed in Algeria, where it took part in the pacification and development of the colony, notably by drying the marshes in the region of Algiers. The Foreign Legion was initially divided into six \"national battalions\" (Swiss, Poles, Germans, Italians, Spanish, and Dutch-Belgian). Smaller national groups, such as the ten Englishmen recorded in December 1832, appear to have been placed randomly.\nIn late 1831, the first legionnaires landed in Algeria, the country that would be the Foreign Legion's homeland for 130 years and shape its character. The early years in Algeria were hard on the legion because it was often sent to the worst postings and received the worst assignments, and its members were generally uninterested in the new colony of the French. The Legion served alongside the Battalions of Light Infantry of Africa, formed in 1832, which was a penal military unit made up of men with prison records who still had to do their military service or soldiers with serious disciplinary problems.\nThe Foreign Legion's first service in Algeria came to an end after only four years, as it was needed elsewhere.\n\n\n=== Carlist War 1835\u20131839 ===\n\nTo support Isabella's claim to the Spanish throne against her uncle, the French government decided to send the Foreign Legion to Spain. On 28 June 1835, the unit was handed over to the Spanish government. The Foreign Legion landed via sea at Tarragona on 17 August with around 1,400 who were quickly dubbed Los Algerinos (the Algerians) by locals because of their previous posting.\nThe Foreign Legion's commander immediately dissolved the national battalions to improve the esprit de corps. Later, he also created three squadrons of lancers and an artillery battery from the existing force to increase independence and flexibility. The Foreign Legion was dissolved on 8 December 1838, when it had dropped to only 500 men. The survivors returned to France, many reenlisting in the new Foreign Legion along with many of their former Carlist enemies.\n\n\n=== Crimean War ===\n\nOn 9 June 1854, the French ship Jean Bart embarked four battalions of the Foreign Legion for the Crimean Peninsula. A further battalion was stationed at Gallipoli as brigade depot. Eight companies drawn from both regiments of the Foreign Legion took part in the Battle of Alma (20 September 1854). Reinforcements by sea brought the Legion contingent up to brigade strength. As the \"Foreign Brigade\", it served in the Siege of Sevastopol, during the winter of 1854\u20131855.\nThe lack of equipment was particularly challenging and cholera hit the Allied expeditionary force. Nevertheless, the \"leather bellies\" (the nickname given to the legionnaires by the Russians because of the large cartridge pouches that they wore attached to their waist-belts), performed well. On 21 June 1855, the Third Battalion, left Corsica for Crimea.\nOn 8 September the final assault was launched on Sevastopol. Two days later, the Second Foreign Regiment with flags and band playing ahead, marched through the streets of Sevastopol. Although initial reservations had been expressed about whether the Legion should be used outside Africa, the Crimean experience established its suitability for service in European warfare, as well as making a cohesive single entity of what had previously been two separate foreign regiments. Total Legion casualties in the Crimea were 1,703 killed and wounded.\n\n\n=== Italian Campaign 1859 ===\n\nLike the rest of the \"Army of Africa\", the Foreign Legion provided detachments in the campaign of Italy. Two foreign regiments, grouped with the 2nd Regiment of Zouaves, were part of the Second Brigade of the Second Division of Mac Mahon's Corps. The Foreign Legion acquitted itself particularly well against the Austrians at the battle of Magenta (4 June 1859) and at the Battle of Solferino (24 June). Legion losses were significant and the 2nd Foreign Regiment lost Colonel Chabri\u00e8re, its commanding officer. In gratitude, the city of Milan awarded, in 1909, the \"commemorative medal of deliverance\", which still adorns the regimental flags of the Second Regiment.\n\n\n=== Mexican Expedition 1863\u20131867 ===\n\nThe 38,000 strong French expeditionary force dispatched to Mexico via sea between 1862 and 1863 included two battalions of the Foreign Legion, increased to six battalions by 1866. Small cavalry and artillery units were raised from legionnaires serving in Mexico. The original intention was that Foreign Legion units should remain in Mexico for up to six years to provide a core for the Imperial Mexican Army. However the Legion was withdrawn with the other French forces during February\u2013March 1867.\nIt was in Mexico on 30 April 1863 that the Legion earned its legendary status. A company led by Captain Jean Danjou, numbering 62 Legionnaires and 3 Legion officers, was escorting a convoy to the besieged city of Puebla when it was attacked and besieged by three thousand Mexican loyalists, organised in two battalions of infantry and cavalry, numbering 2,200 and 800 respectively. The Legion detachment under Captain Jean Danjou, Sous-Lieutenant Jean Vilain, Sous-Lieutenant Cl\u00e9ment Maudet made a stand in the Hacienda de la Trinidad \u2013 a farm near the village of Camar\u00f3n.  When only six survivors remained, out of ammunition, a bayonet assault was launched in which three of the six were killed. The remaining three wounded men were brought before the Mexican commander Colonel Milan, who allowed them to return to the French lines as an honor guard for the body of Captain Danjou. The captain had a wooden hand, which was later returned to the Legion and is now kept in a case in the Legion Museum at Aubagne, and paraded annually on Camerone Day. It is the Foreign Legion's most precious relic.\n\nDuring the Mexican Campaign, 6,654 French died. Of these, 1,918 were from a single regiment of the Legion.\n\n\n=== Franco-Prussian War 1870 ===\n\nAccording to French law, the Foreign Legion was not to be used within Metropolitan France except in the case of a national invasion, and was consequently not a part of Napoleon III's Imperial Army that capitulated at Sedan. With the defeat of the Imperial Army, the Second French Empire fell and the Third Republic was created.\nThe new Third Republic was desperately short of trained soldiers following Sedan, so the Foreign Legion was ordered to provide a contingent. On 11 October 1870 two provisional battalions disembarked via sea at Toulon, the first time the Foreign Legion had been deployed in France itself. It attempted to lift the Siege of Paris by breaking through the German lines. It succeeded in retaking Orl\u00e9ans, but failed to break the siege. In January 1871, France capitulated but civil war soon broke out, which led to revolution and the short-lived Paris Commune. The Foreign Legion participated in the suppression of the Commune, which was crushed with great bloodshed.\n\n\n=== Tonkin Campaign and Sino-French War 1883\u20131888 ===\n\nThe Foreign Legion's First Battalion (Lieutenant-Colonel Donnier) sailed to Tonkin in late 1883, during the period of undeclared hostilities that preceded the Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885), and formed part of the attack column that stormed the western gate of S\u01a1n T\u00e2y on 16 December. The Second and Third Infantry Battalions (chef de bataillon Diguet and Lieutenant-Colonel Schoeffer) were also deployed to Tonkin shortly afterwards, and were present in all the major campaigns of the Sino-French War. Two Foreign Legion companies led the defence at the celebrated Siege of Tuy\u00ean Quang (24 November 1884 to 3 March 1885). In January 1885 the Foreign Legion's 4th Battalion (chef de bataillon Vitalis) was deployed to the French bridgehead at Keelung (Jilong) in Formosa (Taiwan), where it took part in the later battles of the Keelung Campaign. The battalion played an important role in Colonel Jacques Duchesne's offensive in March 1885 that captured the key Chinese positions of La Table and Fort Bamboo and disengaged Keelung.\nIn December 1883, during a review of the Second Legion Battalion on the eve of its departure for Tonkin to take part in the B\u1eafc Ninh Campaign, General Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier pronounced a famous mot: Vous, l\u00e9gionnaires, vous \u00eates soldats pour mourir, et je vous envoie o\u00f9 l'on meurt! ('You, Legionnaires, you are soldiers in order to die, and I'm sending you to where one dies!')\n\n\n=== Colonisation of Africa ===\n\nAs part of the Army of Africa, the Foreign Legion contributed to the growth of the French colonial empire in Sub-Saharan Africa. Simultaneously, the Legion took part to the pacification of Algeria, suppressing various tribal rebellions and razzias.\n\n\n==== Second Franco-Dahomean War 1892\u20131894 ====\n\nIn 1892, King Behanzin was threatening the French protectorate of Porto-Novo in modern-day Benin and France decided to intervene. A battalion, led by commandant Faurax Montier, was formed from two companies of the First Foreign Regiment and two others from the second regiment. From Cotonou, the legionnaires marched to seize Abomey, the capital of the Kingdom of Dahomey. Two and a half months were needed to reach the city, at the cost of repeated battles against the Dahomean warriors, especially the Amazons of the King. King Behanzin surrendered and was captured by the legionnaires in January 1894.\n\n\n==== Second Madagascar Expedition 1894\u20131895 ====\n\nIn 1895, a battalion, formed by the First and Second Foreign Regiments, was sent to the Kingdom of Madagascar, as part of an expeditionary force whose mission was to conquer the island. The foreign battalion formed the backbone of the column launched on Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. After a few skirmishes, the Queen Ranavalona III promptly surrendered. The Foreign Legion lost 226 men, of whom only a tenth died in actual fighting. Others, like much of the expeditionary force, died from tropical diseases. Despite the success of the expedition, the quelling of sporadic rebellions would take another eight years until 1905, when the island was completely pacified by the French under Joseph Gallieni. During that time, insurrections against the Malagasy Christians of the island, missionaries and foreigners were particularly terrible. Queen Ranavalona III was deposed in January 1897 and was exiled to Algiers in Algeria, where she died in 1917.\n\n\n==== Mandingo War 1898 ====\n\nFrom 1882 until his capture, Samori Ture, ruler of the Wassoulou Empire, fought the French colonial army, defeating them on several occasions, including a notable victory at Woyowayanko (2 April 1882), in the face of French heavy artillery. Nonetheless, Samori was forced to sign several treaties ceding territory to the French between 1886 and 1889. Samori began a steady retreat, but the fall of other resistance armies, particularly Babemba Traor\u00e9 at Sikasso, permitted the colonial army to launch a concentrated assault against his forces. A battalion of two companies from the 2nd Foreign Regiment was created in early 1894 to pacify the Niger. The Legionnaires' victory at the fortress of Ouilla and police patrols in the region accelerated the submission of the tribes. On 29 September 1898, Samori Ture was captured by the French Commandant Gouraud and exiled to Gabon, marking the end of the Wassoulou Empire.\n\n\n=== Marching Regiments of the Foreign Legion ===\n\n\n==== World War I 1914\u20131918 ====\n\nThe annexation of Alsace and Lorraine by Germany in 1871 led to numerous volunteers from the two regions enlisting in the Foreign Legion, which gave them the option of French citizenship at the end of their serviceWith the declaration of war on 29 July 1914, a call was made for foreigners residing in France to support their adopted country. While many would have preferred direct enlistment in the regular French Army, the only option immediately available was that of the Foreign Legion. On one day only (3 August 1914) a reported 8,000 volunteers applied to enlist in the Paris recruiting office of the Legion.\nIn World War I, the Foreign Legion fought in many critical battles on the Western Front, including Artois, Champagne, Somme, Aisne, and Verdun (in 1917), and also suffered heavy casualties during 1918. The Foreign Legion was also in the Dardanelles and Macedonian front, and was highly decorated for its efforts. Many young foreigners volunteered for the Foreign Legion when the war broke out in 1914. There were marked differences between the idealistic volunteers of 1914 and the hardened men of the old Legion, making assimilation difficult. Nevertheless, the old and the new men of the Foreign Legion fought and died in vicious battles on the Western front, including Belloy-en-Santerre during the Battle of the Somme, where the poet Alan Seeger, after being mortally wounded by machine-gun fire, cheered on the rest of his advancing battalion.\n\n\n==== Interwar Period 1918\u20131939 ====\n\nWhile suffering heavy casualties on the Western Front the Legion had emerged from World War I with an enhanced reputation and as one of the most highly decorated units in the French Army. In 1919, the government of Spain raised the Spanish Foreign Legion and modeled it after the French Foreign Legion. General Jean Mordacq intended to rebuild the Foreign Legion as a larger military formation, doing away with the legion's traditional role as a solely infantry formation. General Mordacq envisioned a Foreign Legion consisting not of regiments, but of divisions with cavalry, engineer, and artillery regiments in addition to the legion's infantry mainstay. In 1920, decrees ordained the establishment of regiments of cavalry and artillery. Immediately following the armistice the Foreign Legion experienced an increase of enlistments. The Foreign Legion began the process of reorganizing and redeploying to Algeria.\n\nThe Legion played a major part in the Rif War of 1920\u201325. In 1932, the Foreign Legion consisted of 30,000 men, serving in six multi-battalion regiments including the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment 1er REI \u2013 Algeria, Syria and Lebanon; 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment 2\u00e8me REI, 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment 3\u00e8me REI, and 4th Foreign Infantry Regiment 4\u00e8me REI \u2013 Morocco, Lebanon; 5th Foreign Infantry 5\u00e8me REI \u2013 Indochina; and 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment 1er REC \u2013 Lebanon, Tunisia and Morocco.\nIn 1931, G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Paul-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rollet assumed the role of 1st Inspector of the Foreign Legion, a post created at his initiative. While serving as Colonel of the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment (1925\u20131931), Rollet was responsible for planning the centennial celebrations of the Legion's foundation; scheduling this event for Camar\u00f3n Day 30 April 1931. He was subsequently credited with creating much of the modern mystique of the Legion by restoring or creating many of its traditions.\n\n\n==== World War II 1939\u20131945 ====\n\nThe Foreign Legion played a smaller role in World War II in mainland Europe than in World War I, though there was involvement in many exterior theatres of operations, notably sea transport protection through to the Norwegian, Syria-Lebanon, and North African campaigns. The 13th Demi-Brigade, formed for service in Norway, found itself in the UK at the time of the French Armistice (June 1940), was deployed to the British 8th Army in North Africa and distinguished itself in the Battle of Bir Hakeim (1942). Reflecting the divisions of the time, part of the Foreign Legion joined the Free French movement while another part served the Vichy government. German legionnaires were incorporated into the Wehrmacht's 90th Light Infantry Division in North Africa.The Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign of June 1941 saw legionnaire fighting legionnaire as the 13e D.B.L.E clashed with the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment 6e REI at Damascus. Nevertheless, many legionnaires of the 6th Foreign Infantry Regiment 6e (dissolved on 31 December 1941) integrated the Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion R.M.L.E in 1942. Later, a thousand of the rank-and-file of the Vichy Legion unit joined the 13e D.B.L.E. of the Free French forces which were also part as of September 1944 of Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's successful Amalgam of the French Liberation Army (French: Arm\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise de la Lib\u00e9ration,), the (400,000 men) amalgam consisted of the Armistice Army, the Free French Forces and the French Forces of the Interior which formed Army B and were later part of the French 1st Army with forces also issued from the French Resistance.\n\n\n==== Alsace-Lorraine ====\n\nFollowing World War II, many French-speaking German former soldiers joined the Foreign Legion to pursue a military career, an option no longer possible in Germany including French German soldiers of Malgr\u00e9-nous. It would have been considered problematic if the men from Alsace-Lorraine did not speak French. These French-speaking former German soldiers made up as much as 60 percent of the Legion during the war in Indochina. Contrary to popular belief however, French policy was to exclude former members of the Waffen-SS, and candidates for induction were refused if they exhibited the tell-tale blood type tattoo, or even a scar that might be masking it.The high percentage of Germans was contrary to normal policy concerning a single dominant nationality, and in more recent times Germans have made up a much smaller percentage of the Foreign Legion's composition.\n\n\n=== First Indochina War 1946\u20131954 ===\n\nDuring the First Indochina War (1946\u201354) the Foreign Legion saw its numbers swell due to the incorporation of World War II veterans. Although the Foreign Legion distinguished itself in a territory where it had served since the 1880s, it also suffered a heavy toll during this war. Constantly being deployed in operations, units of the Legion suffered particularly heavy losses in the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu, before the fortified valley finally fell on 7 May 1954. No fewer than 72,833 served in Indochina during the eight-year war. The Legion suffered the loss of 10,283 of its own men in combat: 309 officers, 1082 sous-officiers and 9092 legionnaires .\nWhile only one of several Legion units involved in Indochina, the 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP) particularly distinguished itself, while being annihilated twice. It was renamed the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) after its third reformation.The 1er BEP sailed to Indochina on 12 November and was then engaged in combat operations in Tonkin. On 17 November 1950 the battalion parachuted into That Kh\u00e9 and suffered heavy losses at Coc Xa. Reconstituted on 1 March 1951, the battalion participated in combat operations at Cho Ben, on the Black River and in Annam. On 21 November 1953 the reconstituted 1er BEP was parachuted into Dien Bien Phu. In this battle, the unit lost 575 killed and missing. Reconstituted for the third time on 19 May 1954, the battalion left Indochina on 8 February 1955. The 1er BEP received five citations and the fourrag\u00e8re of the colors of the M\u00e9daille militaire for its service in Indochina. The 1er BEP became the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) in Algeria on 1 September 1955.\nDien Bien Phu fell on 7 May 1954 at 17:30. The couple of hectares comprising the battlefield today are corn fields surrounding a stele which commemorates the sacrifices of those who died there. While the garrison of Dien Bien Phu included French regular, North African, and locally recruited (Indochinese) units, the battle has become associated particularly with the paratroops of the Foreign Legion.\nDuring the Indochina War, the Legion operated several armoured trains which were an enduring Rolling Symbol during the chartered course duration of French Indochina. The Legion also operated various Passage Companies relative to the continental conflicts at hand.\n\n\n=== Algerian War 1954\u20131962 ===\n\n\n==== Foreign Legion paratroops ====\n\nThe legion was heavily engaged in fighting against the National Liberation Front and the Arm\u00e9e de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale (ALN). The main activity during the period 1954\u20131962 was as part of the operations of the 10th Parachute Division and 25th Parachute Division. The 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment, 1er REP, was under the command of the 10th Parachute Division (France), 10\u00e8me DP, and the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment, 2\u00e8me REP, was under the command of the 25th Parachute Division (France), 25\u00e8me DP. While both the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP), and the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2\u00e8me REP), were part of the operations of French parachute divisions (10\u00e8me DP and 25\u00e8me DP established in 1956), the Legion's 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP), and the Legion's 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2\u00e8me REP), are older than the French divisions. The 1er REP was the former thrice-reconstituted 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP) and the 2\u00e8me REP was the former 2nd Foreign Parachute Battalion (2\u00e8me BEP). Both battalions were renamed and their Legionnaires transferred from Indochina on 1 August 1954 to Algeria by 1 November 1954. Both traced their origins to the Parachute Company of the 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment commanded by Legion Lieutenant Jacques Morin attached to the III/1er R.C.P.\nWith the start of the War in Algeria on 1 November 1954, the two foreign participating parachute battalions back from Indochina,  the 1st Foreign Parachute Battalion (1er BEP, III Formation) and the 2nd Foreign Parachute Battalion (2\u00e8me BEP), were not part of any French parachute divisions yet and were not designated as regiments until September and 1 December 1955 respectively.\nMain operations during the Algerian War included the Battle of Algiers and the Bataille of the Frontiers, fought by 60,000 soldiers including French and Foreign Legion paratroopers. For paratroopers of the Legion, the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP) and 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2\u00e8me REP), were the only known foreign active parachute regiments, exclusively commanded by Pierre Paul Jeanpierre for the 1er REP and the paratrooper commanders of the 2\u00e8me REP. The remainder of French paratrooper units of the French Armed Forces were commanded by Jacques Massu, Buchond, Marcel Bigeard, Paul Aussaresses. Other Legion offensives in the mountains in 1959 included operations Jumelles, Cigales, and Ari\u00e8ge in the Aures and the last in Kabylie.The image of the Legion as a professional and non-political force was tarnished when the elite 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment 1er REP, which was also part of the 10th Parachute Division played a leading role in the general's putsch of 1961 and was subsequently disbanded.\n\n\n==== Generals' Putsch and reduction of Foreign Legion ====\n\nComing out of a difficult Indochinese conflict, the French Foreign Legion, reinforced cohesion by extending the duration of basic training. Efforts exerted were successful during this transit; however, entering in December 1960 and the revolt the generals, a crisis hit the legion putting its faith at the corps of the Army.For having rallied to the generals putsch of April 1961, the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment 1er REP of the 10th Parachute Division was dissolved on 30 April 1961 at Zeralda.\nIn 1961, at the issue of the putsch, the 1st Mounted Saharan Squadron of the Foreign Legion(French: 1er Escadron Saharien Port\u00e9 de la L\u00e9gion Etrang\u00e8re, 1er ESPLE) received the missions to assure surveillance and policing.\nThe independence of Algeria from the French in 1962 was traumatising since it ended with the enforced abandonment of the barracks command center at Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s established in 1842. Upon being notified that the elite regiment was to be disbanded and that they were to be reassigned, legionnaires of the 1er REP burned the Chinese pavilion acquired following the Siege of Tuy\u00ean Quang in 1884. The relics from the Legion's history museum, including the wooden hand of Captain Jean Danjou, subsequently accompanied the Legion to France. Also removed from Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s were the symbolic Legion remains of General Paul-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rollet ( The Father of the Legion ), Legion officer Prince Count Aage of Rosenborg, and Legionnaire Heinz Zimmermann (last fatal casualty in Algeria).\n\nThe Legion acquired its parade song \"Non, je ne regrette rien\" (\"No, I regret nothing\"), a 1960 \u00c9dith Piaf song sung by Sous-Officiers and legionnaires as they left their barracks for re-deployment following the Algiers putsch of 1961. The song has remained a part of Legion heritage since.\nThe 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment 1er REP was disbanded on 30 April 1961. However, the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2\u00e8me REP prevailed in existence, while most of the personnel of the Saharan Companies were integrated into the 1st Foreign Infantry Regiment, 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment and 4th Foreign Infantry Regiment respectively.\n\n\n=== Post-colonial Africa ===\n\nBy the mid-1960s the Legion had lost its traditional and spiritual home in French Algeria and elite units had been dissolved. President de Gaulle considered disbanding it altogether but, being reminded of the Marching Regiments, and that the 13th Demi-Brigade was one of the first units to declare for him in 1940 and taking also into consideration the effective service of various Saharan units and performances of other Legions units, he chose instead to downsize the Legion from 40,000 to 8,000 men and relocate it to metropolitan France. Legion units continued to be assigned to overseas service, although not in North Africa (see below).\n\n\n=== 1962\u2013present ===\nIn the early 1960s, and besides ongoing global rapid deployments, the Legion also stationed forces on various continents while operating different function units.\nFrom 1965 to 1967, the Legion operated several companies, including the 5th Heavy Weight Transport Company (CTGP), mainly in charge of evacuating the Sahara. The area of responsibility of some of these units extended from the confines of the in-between of the Sahara to the Mediterranean. Ongoing interventions and rapid deployments two years later and the following years included in part:\n\n1969\u20131971 : interventions in Chad\n1978\u2013present : Peacekeeping operations around the Mediterranean, including the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon during the Global War on Terror\n1978\u20131978 : Battle of Kolwezi (Za\u00efre)\n1981\u20131984 : Peacekeeping operations in Lebanon at the corps of the United Nations Multinational Force during the Lebanese Civil War along with the 31\u00e8me Brigade which included the 1st Foreign Regiment 1er RE. Operation \u00c9paulard I was spearheaded by Lieutenant-colonel Bernard Janvier. The Multinational Force also included the British Armed Forces 1st The Queen's Dragoon Guards, U.S. American contingents of United States Marine Corps and the United States Navy, the French Navy and 28 exclusive French Armed Forces regiments including French paratroopers regiments, companies, units of the 11th Parachute Brigade along with the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2e REP. The multinational force also included the Irish Armed Forces and units of the French National Gendarmerie, Italian paratroopers from the Folgore Brigade, and infantry units from the Bersaglieri regiments and Marines of the San Marco Battalion.\n\n\n==== Gulf War 1990\u20131991 ====\n\nIn September 1990, the 1st Foreign Regiment 1er RE, the 1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment 1er REC, the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment 2\u00e8me REP, the 2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment 2\u00e8me REI, and the 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment 6\u00e8me REG were sent to the Persian Gulf as a part of Op\u00e9ration Daguet along with the 1st Spahi Regiment, the 11th Marine Artillery Regiment, the 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment, the 21st Marine Infantry Regiment, the French Army Light Aviation, the Marine Infantry Tank Regiment, French paratroopers regiments including components of the 35th Parachute Artillery Regiment 35\u00e8me RAP, the 1st Parachute Hussard Regiment 1er RHP, the 17th Parachute Engineer Regiment 17\u00e8me RGP and other airborne contingents. Division Daguet was commanded by G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade Bernard Janvier.\n\nThe Legion force, mainly comprising 27 different nationalities, was attached to the French 6th Light Armoured Division 6\u00e8me D.L.B, whose mission was to protect the Coalition's left flank while cover fired by the marine's artillery. During the Gulf War, DINOPS operated in support of the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division, and provided the EOD services to the division. After the cease fire took hold they conducted a joint mine clearing operation alongside a Royal Australian Navy Clearance Diver Team Unit.\nAfter the four-week air campaign, coalition forces launched the ground offensive. They quickly penetrated deep into Iraq, with the Legion taking the As-Salman Airport, meeting little resistance. The war ended after a hundred hours of fighting on the ground, which resulted in very light casualties for the Legion.\n\n\n==== Post 1991 ====\n1991: Evacuation of French citizens and foreigners in Rwanda, Gabon and Zaire.\n1992: Cambodia and Somalia\n1993: Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n1995: Rwanda\n1996: Central African Republic\n1997: Congo-Brazzaville\nSince 1999: KFOR in Kosovo and North Macedonia\n\n\n=== Global War on Terror 2001\u2013present ===\n2001\u20132014: Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan\n2002\u20132003: Operation Licorne in Ivory Coast\n2008: EUFOR Tchad/RCA in Chad\n2013\u20132014: Operation Serval in the Northern Mali conflict\n\n\n== Composition and organization ==\n\nPrior to the end of the Algerian War the legion had not been stationed in mainland France except in wartime. Until 1962, the Foreign Legion headquarters, garrison quartier Vienot of Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s was in French Algeria. Today, some units of the L\u00e9gion are in Corsica or overseas possessions (mainly in French Guiana, guarding Guiana Space Centre), while the rest are in the south of mainland France. Current headquarters, garrison quartier Vienot of Aubagne is in France, just outside Marseille. As a result of a recruiting drive in the wake of the November 2015 Paris attacks, the Legion will be 8,900 men strong in 2018.\nMainland France\n1st Foreign Regiment (1er RE), based in Aubagne, France (HQ, selection and administration, other specific missions)\nPionniers Sections of Tradition\n1st Foreign Cavalry Regiment (1er REC), based in Camp de Carpiagne (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne), France (armoured troops)\n1st Foreign Engineer Regiment (1er REG) former 6th Foreign Engineer Regiment (6\u00e8me REG), based in Laudun, France\nPionniers Groups\n2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment (2\u00e8me REI), based in N\u00eemes, France\n2nd Foreign Engineer Regiment (2\u00e8me REG), based in St Christol, France\nPionniers Groups\n2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment (2\u00e8me REP), based in Calvi, Corsica\n4th Foreign Regiment (4\u00e8meRE), based in Castelnaudary (training), France\nPionniers Groups\nForeign Legion Recruiting Group (G.R.L.E), based at Fort de Nogent (military recruiting and other), France\n13th Demi-Brigade of the Foreign Legion (13\u00e8me DBLE) stationed in Djibouti until 2011, then the United Arab Emirates until 2016.

Foreign Status NCOs and officers are exclusively promoted from the ranks and in 2016 represented 10% of the Officer Corps of the Legion.. French Status officers are either members of other units of the French Army affected to the Legion or promoted L\u00e9gionnaires who have chosen to become French nationals.\nBasic training for the Foreign Legion is conducted in the 4th Foreign Regiment. This is an operational combat regiment which provides a training course of 15\u201317 weeks, before recruits are assigned to their operational units:\n\nInitial training of 4\u20136 weeks at The Farm (La Ferme) \u2013 introduction to military lifestyle; outdoor and field activities.\nMarch (Marche K\u00e9pi Blanc) \u2013 a 50-kilometer (31 mi) two-day march (25 km per day) in full kit, followed by the Kepi Blanc ceremony on the 3rd day.\nTechnical and practical training (alternating with barracks and field training) \u2013 three weeks.\nMountain training (Chalet at Formigui\u00e8re in the French Pyrenees) \u2013 one week.\nTechnical and practical training (alternating barracks and field training) \u2013 three weeks.\nExaminations and obtaining of the elementary technical certificate (CTE) \u2013 one week.\nMarch (Raid Marche) \u2013 a 120-kilometer (75 mi) final march, which must be completed in three days.\nLight vehicle drivers education (drivers license) \u2013 one week.\nReturn to Aubagne before reporting to the assigned operational regiment \u2013 one week.Education in the French language (reading, writing and pronunciation) is taught on a daily basis throughout all of basic training.\n\n\n== Traditions ==\n\nAs the Foreign Legion is composed of soldiers of different nationalities and backgrounds, it needed to develop an intense esprit de corps, which is achieved through the development of camaraderie, specific traditions, the loyalty of its legionnaires, the quality of their training, and the pride of being a soldier in an \u00e9lite unit.\n\n\n=== Code of honour ===\nThe \"Legionnaire's Code of Honour\" is the Legion's creed, recited in French only. The Code of Honour was adopted in the 1980s.\n\n\n=== Mottos ===\n\n\n==== Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 ====\nIn contrast to all other French Army units, the motto embroidered on the Foreign Legion's regimental flags is not Honneur et Patrie (Honour and Fatherland) but Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 (Honour and Fidelity).\n\n\n==== Legio Patria Nostra ====\nLegio Patria Nostra (in French La L\u00e9gion est notre Patrie, in English The Legion is our Fatherland) is the Latin motto of the Foreign Legion. The adoption of the Foreign Legion as a new \"fatherland\" does not imply the repudiation by the legionnaire of his original nationality. The Foreign Legion is required to obtain the agreement of any legionnaire before he is placed in any situation where he might have to serve against his country of birth.\n\n\n==== Regimental mottos ====\n1er R.E: Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9\nG.R.L.E: Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9\n1er REC:  Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 and Nec Pluribus Impar (No other equal)\n2e REP: Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 and More Majorum (in the manner, ways and traditions of our veterans foreign regiments) \n2e REI: Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 and \u00catre pr\u00eat (Be ready)\n2e REG: Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 and Rien n'emp\u00eache (Nothing prevents)\n3e REI: Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 and Legio Patria Nostra\n4e R.E: Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 and Creuset de la L\u00e9gion et R\u00e9giment des fortes t\u00eates (The crucible of the Legion and the strong right minded regiment)\n6e R.E.G then 1e REG: Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 and Ad Unum (All to one end \u2013 for the regiment until the last one)\n13e DBLE: Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 and More Majorum (\"in the manner, ways and traditions of our veterans foreign regiments\")\nDLEM: Honneur et Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 and Pericula Ludus (Dangers game \u2013 for the regiment To Danger is my pleasure of the 2nd Foreign Cavalry Regiment)\n\n\n=== Insignia ===\n\n\n== Marching songs ==\n\n\n=== Le Boudin ===\n\n\"Le Boudin\" is the marching song of the Foreign Legion.\n\n\n=== Other songs ===\n\n\n== Ranks ==\n\nAll volunteers in the French Foreign Legion begin their careers as basic legionnaires with one in four eventually becoming a sous-officier (non-commissioned officer). On joining, a new recruit receives a monthly salary of \u20ac1,200 in addition to food and lodgings. He is also given his own new rifle, which according to the lore of the Legion must never be left on a battlefield. Promotion is concurrent with the ranks in the French Army.\n\n\n=== Non-Commissioned and Warrant Officers ===\n\nThe insignia for a Sous-officier contains three components. In this case, three upward gold chevrons indicates a Sergent-chef. The diamond-shaped regimental patch (or \u00c9cusson) is created from three green borders indicating a Colonial unit; rather than one for \"Regulars\"  or two for \"Reserves\". The grenade has seven flames rather than the usual five. Two downward chevrons of seniority attests to at least 10 years service. Some Caporal-Chefs have as much as 6 \"chevrons of seniority\" attesting to 30 years (plus) of service.\nSous-officiers (NCOs) including warrant officers account for 25% of the current Foreign Legion's total manpower.\n\n\n=== Commissioned Officers ===\n\nMost officers are seconded from the French Army though roughly 10% are former non-commissioned officers promoted from the ranks.\n\n\n=== Chevrons of seniority ===\nThe Foreign Legion still uses chevrons to indicate seniority (chevrons d'anciennet\u00e9). Each gold chevron, which are only worn by ordinary legionnaires and non-commissioned officers, denotes five years service in the Legion. They are worn beneath the rank insignia.\n\n\n=== Honorary ranks ===\nThe French Army had awarded honorary ranks to individuals credited with exceptional acts of courage since 1796.\nIn the Foreign Legion, General Paul-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rollet introduced the practice of awarding of honorary Legion ranks to distinguished individuals, both civilian and military; men and women in the early 20th century. Recipients of these honorary appointments had participated in an exemplary manner on active service with units of the Legion, or had rendered exceptional service to the Legion in non-combat situations.More than 1,200 individuals have been granted honorary ranks in the Legion pour services \u00e9minent. The majority of these awards have been made to military personnel in wartime, earning titles such as Legionnaire d'Honneur or Sergent-Chef de L\u00e9gion d'honneur. But other recipients have included nurses, journalists, painters, and ministers who have rendered meritorious service to the Foreign Legion.\n\n\n== Pioneers ==\n\nThe Pionniers (pioneers) are the combat engineers and a traditional unit of the Foreign Legion. The sapper traditionally sport large beards, wear leather aprons and gloves and hold axes. The sappers were very common in European armies during the Napoleonic Era but progressively disappeared during the 19th century. The French Army, including the Legion disbanded its regimental sapper platoons in 1870. However, in 1931 one of a number of traditions restored to mark the hundredth anniversary of the Legion's founding was the reestablishment of its bearded Pionniers.In the French Army, since the 18th century, every infantry regiment included a small detachment of pioneers. In addition to undertaking road building and entrenchment work, such units were tasked with using their axes and shovels to clear obstacles under enemy fire opening the way for the rest of the infantry. The danger of such missions was recognised by allowing certain privileges, such as being authorised to wear beards.\nThe current pioneer platoon of the Foreign Legion is provided by the Legion depot and headquarters regiment for public ceremonies. The unit has reintroduced the symbols of the Napoleonic sappers: the beard, the axe, the leather apron, the crossed-axes insignia and the leather gloves. When parades of the Foreign Legion are opened by this unit, it is to commemorate the traditional role of the sappers \"opening the way\" for the troops.\n\n\n== Cadences and marching steps ==\n\nAlso notable is the marching pace of the Foreign Legion. In comparison to the 116-step-per-minute pace of other French units, the Foreign Legion has an 88-step-per-minute marching speed. It is also referred to by Legionnaires as the \"crawl\". This can be seen at ceremonial parades and public displays attended by the Foreign Legion, particularly while parading in Paris on 14 July (Bastille Day Military Parade). Because of the impressively slow pace, the Foreign Legion is always the last unit marching in any parade. The Foreign Legion is normally accompanied by its own band, which traditionally plays the march of any one of the regiments comprising the Foreign Legion, except that of the unit actually on parade. The regimental song of each unit and \"Le Boudin\" is sung by legionnaires standing at attention. Also, because the Foreign Legion must always stay together, it does not break formation into two when approaching the presidential grandstand, as other French military units do, in order to preserve the unity of the legion.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the adoption of the Foreign Legion's slow marching speed was not due to a need to preserve energy and fluids during long marches under the hot Algerian sun. Its exact origins are somewhat unclear, but the official explanation is that although the pace regulation does not seem to have been instituted before 1945, it hails back to the slow marching pace of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, and its reintroduction was a \"return to traditional roots\". This was in fact, the march step of the Foreign Legion's ancestor units \u2013 the R\u00e9giments \u00c9trangers or Foreign Regiments of the Ancien R\u00e9gime French Army, the Grande Arm\u00e9e's foreign units, and the pre-1831 foreign regiments.\n\n\n== Uniform ==\n\nFrom its foundation until World War I the Foreign Legion normally wore the uniform of the French line infantry for parade with a few special distinctions. Essentially this consisted of a dark blue coat (later tunic) worn with red trousers. The field uniform was often modified under the influence of the extremes of climate and terrain in which the Foreign Legion served. Shakos were soon replaced by the light cloth kepi, which was far more suitable for North African conditions. The practice of wearing heavy capotes (greatcoats) on the march and vestes (short hip-length jackets) as working dress in barracks was followed by the Foreign Legion from its establishment.\nOne short lived aberration was the wearing of green uniforms in 1856 by Foreign Legion units recruited in Switzerland for service in the Crimean War. In the Crimea itself (1854\u201359) a hooded coat and red or blue waist sashes were adopted for winter dress, while during the Mexican Intervention (1863\u201365) straw hats or sombreros were sometimes substituted for the kepi. When the latter was worn it was usually covered with a white \"havelock\" (linen cover) \u2013 the predecessor of the white kepi that was to become a symbol of the Foreign Legion. Foreign Legion units serving in France during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371 were distinguishable only by minor details of insignia from the bulk of the French infantry. However subsequent colonial campaigns saw an increasing use of special garments for hot weather wear such as collarless keo blouses in Tonkin 1884\u201385, khaki drill jackets in Dahomey (1892) and drab covered topees worn with all-white fatigue dress in Madagascar (1895).In the early 20th century the legionnaire wore a red kepi with blue band and piping, dark blue tunic with red collar, red cuff patches, and red trousers. Distinctive features were the green epaulettes (replacing the red of the line) worn with red woollen fringes; plus the embroidered Legion badge of a red flaming grenade, worn on the kepi front instead of a regimental number. In the field a light khaki cover was worn over the kepi, sometimes with a protective neck curtain attached. The standard medium-blue double breasted greatcoat (capote) of the French infantry was worn, usually buttoned back to free the legs for marching. From the 1830s the legionnaires had worn a broad blue woollen sash around the waist, like other European units of the French Army of Africa (such as the Zouaves or the Chasseurs d'Afrique), while indigenous units of the Army of Africa (spahis and tirailleurs) wore red sashes. White linen trousers tucked into short leather leggings were substituted for red serge in hot weather. This was the origin of the \"Beau Geste\" image.\nIn barracks a white bleached kepi cover was often worn together with a short dark blue jacket (\"veste\") or white blouse plus white trousers. The original kepi cover was khaki and due to constant washing turned white quickly. The white or khaki kepi cover was not unique to the Foreign Legion at this stage but was commonly seen amongst other French units in North Africa. It later became particularly identified with the Foreign Legion as the unit most likely to serve at remote frontier posts (other than locally recruited tirailleurs who wore fezzes or turbans). The variances of climate in North Africa led the French Army to the sensible expedient of letting local commanders decide on the appropriate \"tenue de jour\" (uniform of the day) according to circumstances. Thus a legionnaire might parade or walk out in blue tunic and white trousers in hot weather, blue tunic and red trousers in normal temperatures or wear the blue greatcoat with red trousers under colder conditions. The sash could be worn with greatcoat, blouse or veste but not with the tunic. Epaulettes were a detachable dress item worn only with tunic or greatcoat for parade or off duty wear.\n\nOfficers wore the same dark blue (almost black) tunics as those of their colleagues in the French line regiments, except that black replaced red as a facing colour on collar and cuffs. Gold fringed epaulettes were worn for full dress and rank was shown by the number of gold rings on both kepi and cuffs. Trousers were red with black stripes or white according to occasion or conditions. All-white or light khaki uniforms (from as early as the 1890s) were often worn in the field or for ordinary duties in barracks. Non-commissioned officers were distinguished by red or gold diagonal stripes on the lower sleeves of tunics, vestes and greatcoats.  Small detachable stripes were buttoned on to the front of the white shirt-like blouse.\nPrior to 1914 units in Indo-China wore white or khaki Colonial Infantry uniforms with Foreign Legion insignia, to overcome supply difficulties. This dress included a white sun helmet of a model that was also worn by Foreign Legion units serving in the outposts of Southern Algeria, though never popular with its wearers. During the initial months of World War I, Foreign Legion units serving in France wore the standard blue greatcoat and red trousers of the French line infantry, distinguished only by collar patches of the same blue as the capote, instead of red. After a short period in sky-blue the Foreign Legion adopted khaki with steel helmets, from early 1916. A mustard shade of khaki drill had been worn on active service in Morocco from 1909, replacing the classic blue and white. The latter continued to be worn in the relatively peaceful conditions of Algeria throughout World War I, although increasingly replaced by khaki drill. The pre-1914 blue and red uniforms could still be occasionally seen as garrison dress in Algeria until stocks were used up about 1919.\nDuring the early 1920s plain khaki drill uniforms of a standard pattern became universal issue for the Foreign Legion with only the red and blue kepi (with or without a cover) and green collar braiding to distinguish the Legionnaire from other French soldiers serving in North African and Indo-China. The neck curtain ceased to be worn from about 1915, although it survived in the newly raised Foreign Legion Cavalry Regiment into the 1920s. The white blouse (bourgeron) and trousers dating from 1882 were retained for fatigue wear until the 1930s.At the time of the Foreign Legion's centennial in 1931, a number of traditional features were reintroduced at the initiative of the then commander Colonel Rollet. These included the blue sash and green/red epaulettes. In 1939 the white covered kepi won recognition as the official headdress of the Foreign Legion to be worn on most occasions, rather than simply as a means of reflecting heat and protecting the blue and red material underneath. The Third Foreign Infantry Regiment adopted white tunics and trousers for walking-out dress during the 1930s\nand all Foreign Legion officers were required to obtain full dress uniforms in the pre-war colours of black and red from 1932 to 1939.\nDuring World War II the Foreign Legion wore a wide range of uniform styles depending on supply sources. These ranged from the heavy capotes and Adrian helmets of 1940 through to British battledress and American field uniforms from 1943 to 1945. The white kepi was stubbornly retained whenever possible.\nFrom 1940 until 1963 the Foreign Legion maintained four Saharan Companies (Compagnies Sahariennes) as part of the French forces used to patrol and police the desert regions to the south of Morocco and Algeria. Special uniforms were developed for these units, modeled on those of the French officered Camel Corps (M\u00e9haristes) having prime responsibility for the Sahara. In full dress these included black or white zouave style trousers, worn with white tunics and long flowing cloaks. The Legion companies maintained their separate identity by retaining their distinctive kepis, sashes and fringed epaulettes.\nThe white kepis, together with the sash and epaulettes survive in the Foreign Legion's modern parade dress. Since the 1990s the modern kepi has been made wholly of white material rather than simply worn with a white cover. Officers and senior noncommissioned officers still wear their kepis in the pre-1939 colours of dark blue and red. A green tie and (for officers) a green waistcoat recall the traditional branch colour of the Foreign Legion. From 1959 a green beret (previously worn only by the legion's paratroopers) became the universal ordinary duty headdress, with the kepi reserved for parade and off duty wear. Other items of currently worn dress are the standard issue of the French Army.\n\n\n== Equipment ==\n\nThe Foreign Legion is basically equipped with the same equipment as similar units elsewhere in the French Army. These include:\n\nThe FAMAS assault rifle, a French-made automatic bullpup-style rifle, chambered in the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO round. The FAMAS is being replaced by the Heckler & Koch HK416. The 13e DBLE, a Foreign Legion Regiment, was the first unit to use the new rifle.\nThe SPECTRA is a ballistic helmet, designed by the French military, fitted with real-time positioning and information system, and with light amplifiers for night vision.\nThe F\u00c9LIN suit, an infantry combat system that combines ample pouches, reinforced body protections and a portable electronic platform.\n\n\n== Commandement de la L\u00e9gion \u00c9trang\u00e8re Tenure (1931\u2013present) ==\n\n\n=== Commandement de la L\u00e9gion \u00c9trang\u00e8re (1931\u20131984) ===\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== Composition ==\nThe Foreign Legion is the only unit of the French Army open to people of any nationality. Most legionnaires still come from European countries but a growing percentage comes from Latin America. Most of the Foreign Legion's commissioned officers are French with approximately 10 percent being Legionnaires who have risen through the ranks.Legionnaires were, in the past, forced to enlist under a pseudonym (\"declared identity\"). This policy existed in order to allow recruits who wanted to restart their lives to enlist. The Legion held the belief that it was fairer to make all new recruits use declared identities. French citizens can enlist under a declared, fictitious, foreign citizenship (generally, a francophone one, often that of Belgium, Canada, or Switzerland). As of 20 September 2010, new recruits may enlist under their real identities or under declared identities. Recruits who do enlist with declared identities may, after one year's service, regularise their situations under their true identities. After serving in the Foreign Legion for three years, a legionnaire may apply for French citizenship. He must be serving under his real name, must have no problems with the authorities, and must have served with \"honour and fidelity\". A soldier who becomes injured during a battle for France can immediately apply for French citizenship under a provision known as \"Fran\u00e7ais par le sang vers\u00e9\" (\"French by spilled blood\").While the Foreign Legion historically did not accept women in its ranks, there was one official female member, Susan Travers, an Englishwoman who joined Free French Forces during World War II and became a member of the Foreign Legion after the war, serving in Vietnam during the First Indochina War. Women were barred from service until 2000, when then-French Defence Minister Alain Richard had stated that he wanted to take the level of female recruitment in the Legion to 20 percent by 2020.\n\n\n=== Membership by country ===\nAs of 2008, legionnaires came from 140 countries. The majority of enlisted men originate from outside France, while the majority of the officer corps consists of Frenchmen. Many recruits originate from Eastern Europe and Latin America. Neil Tweedie of The Daily Telegraph said that Germany traditionally provided many recruits, \"somewhat ironically given the Legion's bloody role in two world wars.\" He added that \"Brits, too, have played their part, but there was embarrassment recently when it emerged that many British applicants were failing selection due to endemic unfitness.\"\n\n\n==== Alsace-Lorraine ====\n\nOriginal nationalities of the Foreign Legion reflect the events in history at the time they join. Many former Wehrmacht personnel joined in the wake of World War II as many soldiers returning to civilian life found it hard to find reliable employment. Jean-Denis Lepage reports that \"The Foreign Legion discreetly recruited from German P.O.W. camps\", but adds that the number of these recruits has been subsequently exaggerated. Bernard B. Fall, who was a supporter of the French government, writing in the context of the First Indochina War, questioned the notion that the Foreign Legion was mainly German at that time, calling it:\n\n[a] canard\u2026with the sub-variant that all those Germans were at least SS generals and other much wanted war criminals. As a rule, and in order to prevent any particular nation from making the Foreign Legion into a Praetorian Guard, any particular national component is kept at about 25 percent of the total. Even supposing (and this was the case, of course) that the French recruiters, in the eagerness for candidates would sign up Germans enlisting as Swiss, Austrian, Scandinavian and other nationalities of related ethnic background, it is unlikely that the number of Germans in the Foreign Legion ever exceeded 35 percent. Thus, without making an allowance for losses, rotation, discharges, etc., the maximum number of Germans fighting in Indochina at any one time reached perhaps 7,000 out of 278,000. As to the ex-Nazis, the early arrivals contained a number of them, none of whom were known to be war criminals. French intelligence saw to that.\nSince, in view of the rugged Indochinese climate, older men without previous tropical experience constituted more a liability than an asset, the average age of the Foreign Legion enlistees was about 23. At the time of the battle of Dien Bien Phu, any legionnaire of that age group was at the worst, in his \"Hitler Youth\" shorts when the [Third] Reich collapsed.\nThe Foreign Legion accepts people enlisting under a nationality that is not their own. A proportion of the Swiss and Belgians are actually likely to be Frenchmen who wish to avoid detection. In addition many Alsatians are said to have joined the Foreign Legion when Alsace was part of the German Empire, and may have been recorded as German while considering themselves French.\nRegarding recruitment conditions within the Foreign Legion, see the official page (in English) dedicated to the subject: With regard to age limits, recruits can be accepted from ages ranging from 17 \u00bd (with parental consent) to 39.5 years old.\n\n\n=== Countries that allow post-Foreign Legion contract ===\nIn the Commonwealth Realms, its collective provisions provide for nationals to commute between armies in training or other purposes. Moreover, this 'blanket provision' between member-states cannot exclude others for it would seem inappropriate to single out individual countries, that is, France in relation to the Legion. For example, Australia and New Zealand may allow post-Legion enlistment providing the national has commonwealth citizenship. Britain allows post-Legion enlistment. Canada allows post-Legion enlistment in its ranks with a completed five-year contract.In the European Union framework, post Legion enlistment is less clear. Denmark, Norway, Germany and Portugal allow post-Legion enlistment while The Netherlands has constitutional articles that forbid it. [Rijkswet op het Nederlanderschap, Artikel 15, lid 1e, (In Dutch:)] (that is: one can lose his Dutch nationality by accepting a foreign nationality or can lose his Dutch nationality by serving in the army of a foreign state that is engaged in a conflict against the Dutch Kingdom or one of its allies). The European Union twin threads seem to be recognized dual nationality status or restricting constitutional article.\nThe United States allows post-FFL enlistment in its National Guard of career soldiers (up to the rank of captain) who are Green Card holders.\nIsrael allows post-Legion enlistment.\nOne of the biggest national groups in the Legion are Poles. Polish law  allows service in a foreign army, but only after written permission from the Ministry of National Defence.\n\n\n== Emulation by other countries ==\n\n\n=== Chinese Ever Victorious Army ===\nThe Ever Victorious Army was the name given to a Chinese imperial army in the late 19th century. Commanded by Frederick Townsend Ward, the new force originally comprised about 200 mostly European mercenaries, recruited in the Shanghai area from sailors, deserters and adventurers. Many were dismissed in the summer of 1861, but the remainder became the officers of the Chinese soldiers recruited mainly in and around Sungkiang (Songjiang). The Chinese troops were increased to 3,000 by May 1862, all equipped with Western firearms and equipment by the British authorities in Shanghai. Throughout its four-year existence the Ever Victorious Army was mainly to operate within a thirty-mile radius of Shanghai. It was disbanded in May 1864 with 104 foreign officers and 2,288 Chinese soldiers being paid off. The bulk of the artillery and some infantry transferred to the Chinese Imperial forces. It was the first Chinese army trained in European techniques, tactics, and strategy.\n\n\n=== Israeli Mahal ===\nIn Israel, Mahal (Hebrew: \u05de\u05d7\"\u05dc\u200e, an acronym for Mitnadvei \u1e24utz LaAretz, which means Volunteers from outside the Land [of Israel]) is a term designating non-Israelis serving in the Israeli military. The term originates with the approximately 4,000 both Jewish and non-Jewish volunteers who went to Israel to fight in the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War including Aliyah Bet. The original Mahalniks were mostly World War II veterans from American and British armed forces.\nToday, there is a program, Garin Tzabar, within the Israeli Ministry of Defense that administers the enlistment of non-Israeli citizens in the country's armed forces. Programs enable foreigners to join the Israel Defense Forces if they are of Jewish descent (which is defined as at least one grandparent).\n\n\n=== Netherlands KNIL Army ===\nThough not named \"Foreign Legion\", the Dutch Koninklijk Nederlandsch-Indische Leger (KNIL), or Royal Netherlands-Indian Army (in reference to the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia), was created in 1830, a year before the French Foreign Legion, and is therefore not an emulation but an entirely original idea and had a similar recruitment policy. It stopped being an army of foreigners around 1900 when recruitment was restricted to Dutch citizens and to the indigenous peoples of the Dutch East Indies. The KNIL was finally disbanded on 26 July 1950, seven months after the Netherlands formally recognised Indonesia as a sovereign state, and almost five years after Indonesia declared its independence.\n\n\n=== Rhodesian Light Infantry and 7 Independent Company ===\n\nDuring the Rhodesian Bush War of the 1960s and 1970s, the Rhodesian Security Forces enlisted volunteers from overseas on the same pay and conditions of service as locally based regulars. The vast majority of the Rhodesian Army's foreigners joined the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), a heliborne commando regiment with a glamorous international reputation; this unit became colloquially known as the \"Rhodesian foreign legion\" as a result, even though foreigners never made up more than about a third of its men. According to Chris Cocks, an RLI veteran, \"the RLI was a mirror of the French Foreign Legion, in that recruiters paid little heed as to a man's past and asked no questions. ... And like the Foreign Legion, once in the ranks, a man's past was irrelevant.\" Just as French Foreign Legionnaires must speak French, the Rhodesian Army required its foreigners to be anglophone. Many of them were professional soldiers, attracted by the regiment's reputation\u2014mostly former British soldiers, or Vietnam veterans from the United States, Australian and New Zealand forces\u2014and these became a key part of the unit. Others, with no military experience, were often motivated to join the Rhodesian Army by anti-communism, or a desire for adventure or to escape the past.After the Rhodesians' overseas recruiting campaign for English-speakers, started in 1974, proved successful, they began recruiting French-speakers as well, in 1977. These francophone recruits were placed in their own unit, 7 Independent Company, Rhodesia Regiment, which was commanded by French-speaking officers and operated entirely in French. The experiment was not generally considered a success by the Rhodesian commanders, however, and the company was disbanded in early 1978.\n\n\n=== Russian \"Foreign Legion\" ===\nIn 2010 the service conditions of the Russian Military have been changed. The actual term \"Russian Foreign Legion\" is a colloquial expression without any official recognition. Under the plan, foreigners without dual citizenship are able to sign up for five-year contracts and will be eligible for Russian citizenship after serving three years. Experts say the change opens the way for Commonwealth of Independent States citizens to get fast-track Russian citizenship, and counter the effects of Russia's demographic crisis on its army recruitment.\n\n\n=== Spanish Foreign Legion ===\nThe Spanish Foreign Legion was created in 1920, in emulation of the French one, and had a significant role in Spain's colonial wars in Morocco and in the Spanish Civil War on the Nationalist side. The Spanish Foreign Legion recruited foreigners until 1986 but unlike its French model, the number of non-Spanish recruits never exceeded 25%, most of these from Latin America. It is now called the Spanish Legion and only recruits Spanish nationals.\n\n\n== References in popular culture ==\n\nBeyond its reputation as an elite unit often engaged in serious fighting, the recruitment practices of the French Foreign Legion have also led to a somewhat romanticised view of it being a place for disgraced or \"wronged\" men looking to leave behind their old lives and start new ones. This view of the legion is common in literature, and has been used for dramatic effect in many films, not the least of which are the several versions of Beau Geste.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nForeign Airborne Battalions and Regiments of France\nList of battles involving the French Foreign Legion\nList of Foreign Legionnaires \u2013 notable members of the French Foreign Legion\nFrench Foreign Legion Museum\nWild Geese \u2013 Irish soldiers who fought for France\nList of militaries that recruit foreigners\nSpanish Legion\nInternational Legion\nInternational Brigades\nMemorial to the American Volunteers, Paris\nLafayette Escadrille, a World War I volunteer air squadron\nBeau Geste, a novel (with many film adaptations) detailing life in the Foreign Legion\nJames Waddell (French Foreign Legion), a New Zealander, highly decorated officer\nCount Aage of Rosenborg, a Danish Prince who served in the Foreign Legion and died with the rank of lieutenant-colonel\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Website (in French)\nOfficial Website (in English)\nFrench Foreign Legion Blog (in English)\nLe Mus\u00e9e de la L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re (Foreign Legion museum)\nWebsite about the French Daguet Division (First Gulf War 1990\u20131991)\nRecrute Website - Recrute Website(in English)\nForeign Legion Information \u2013 unofficial website about the French Foreign Legion (in English)BooksIn the Foreign Legion (1910) \u2013 by Erwin Rosen (b. 1876)\nBooks on Legion from 1905 to Present",

          "The old port is just a port with a huge number of small restaurants around it. Nothing really special - just a boat \"parking\". The restaurants are expensive and not the greatest quality, although all are rated quite high (between 4 and 5 starts). There are not many free parking",
          "The Old Port is an attractive vibrant harbour. The ferry boat trip across the harbour is well worth \u20ac0.50 and is a good way of seeing the harbour and the surrounding city. The fish market is not to be missed. The cafes and restaurants around the harbour add to the lively",

          "Most important place in all the city it\u2019s port. So beautiful and cozy. You can take a boat, city bus, city tour train for the trips from there. Also you can try catch of the day straight away in the fish market. Loved it !",

          "It's a good place to take a walk on a sunny day with someone you like. It has many bars and restaurants, and regarding monuments it has the Fort Sain Jean (not very pretty) and the Cathedrale La Major (best monument of the city for me)",
          "Before returning to the train station or airport when travelling through Marseille, it is definitely worth stopping for lunch at the \"Vieux port\". It is only a 30 minute walk from the Marseille St Charles train station. If it is not the weekend, you should be able to eat in one",
          "Yes, Marseille is known for their hyperbole. And great local food. And colorful accents. And beautiful views. There are a few beaches where you can swim in clear waters. And if you take the boat from this port to the islands (you can see them from the port) then you will",
          "Very live place, touristic but huge so there is no feel of crowd. Lot of boats and beautiful dark blue water in the center of the huge city. Really nice atmosphere.",
          "Strolling by the old port, even at night, was quite a pleasure. There are lots of lights along the road and many eateries looking onto the water. Personally I was not expecting to see so many large boats, one could even call some of them yachts, in the port. You can only",
          "The Old Port serves as the centre and focal point of Marseille. You get your bearings from here and you can't fail to take notice of it when in the city, either as the embarcation point for sightseeing boat trips, picking up the tourist train, a meal at one of the many seafood",
          "My hubby and I visited the port while in Marseille. Very nice. It was huge. Lovely to walk around and relax. Good place to visit",
          "Multiple shops and restaurants surround the port. This is a great people watching place. All of the restaurants with open-air seating beckon you to enter and dine. Several tour bus companies start their city tours in this area.",
          "So Marseille is a chaotic and dirty city but has a social life. The night here never sleeps. We\u2019re outside roaming around at 12AM and some dude threw a bottle of beer on us. Imagine that mini heart attack.",
          "Great place to visit for a short trip. If it hadn\u2019t been for the strong (mistral) wind, it would have been perfect. Lots to do and see including boat trips out to the Iles of Frouil and Chateau D\u2019If (our boat could not stop there due to the winds on that day). Great restaurants,",

          "A great area to walk and sit and ponder - so many boats and plenty of restaurants and bars. Lots to do and see - the place to get on the boats out to the islands and the Calanques. A great place.",
          "A nice area and great for a walk around.. lots of cafes. Yes.. they are touristy, but still authentic and not everyone there is a tourist. you can enjoy a beer on the cafe and people watch. Lots of food opportunities. keep in mind that service is not fast... Chill and relax",
          "It is a bit touristy but reflects the soul of the city and its history. The cathedral on The Hill overlooks the port. The cathedral is quite a climb but there is a tram service that relieves the tedious climb. This is an area not to be missed.",
          "I guess that this IS the attraction in Marseille. If you like to sit on a bench and watch people walking by, this is THE place. On the other side of the old port, plenty of restaurants, many choices but did not like the food. This is France no? Not this part, very hard to find",
          "We stayed in 2 different hotels in Marseille. The1st hotel with the Juliette balcony window with such a view, was like the icing on the cake. Lovely to see all the activity and boats coming and going within the bay. Something different to watch. Plus lots of queues for different",
          "Lots of cafes and places to relax while visiting the Old Port. Bustling area, thousands of boats line the harbor. Easy, at waking surfaces friendly to all abilities.",
          "We walked from our hotel at the old port to the local beach and the walk was fascinating. The amount of boats in this harbour is astonishing and the symmetry of the harbour is a sight to be seen. Local fishermen tie their boats at the end of the harbour in front of the Grand",
          "I am not sure where the folks who own the boats are. On a perfect weekend day, much less than 1% of them were out on the water. Still, nice to see the boats, take the little ferry across, sit at a cafe and watch the people. Drink some rose. Good stuff!",
          "The old port is a nice place to visit. But turn around and u only c restaurants. Waaay to many restos and bars. To touristic. And can get super busy. Enjoyed the day there",

          "No trip to Marseille would be complete without a walk around the port. October is the ideal time as there are fewer visitors and the light is still beautiful.Spend time watching the activities and if you have more time take a boat trip and see this beautiful city from the sea.",
          "Make sure you do this in the weekend. Lots of afterwork places to discover and right front of a beautifull port!",
          "It is a tourist trap but definitely worth it. There are many restaurants, bars and souvenir shops next to the port.",
          "Starting at the metro station, cross the street to the quay where small passenger vessels are berthed plying for visits around the harbour or further along the coast. Bearing around to the left a wide paved path offers the visitor a lazy amble past the old fishing boats, and",
          "For me this is the beating heart of Marseille. It is a great place to have a wander, or to havea coffee first thing in the morning, or a Pastis in the early evening. Chances many of the residents of the city arrived here first, and it is a great place to start or end a walking",
          "Lovely interesting Old Port surrounded by Bars and Restaurants to sit and watch World go by. Very nice to walk around with plenty of seats and boats to look at, great views and photo opportunities. Small fish Market in morning straight off fishing boats. You can walk up to",
          "During our holiday we had a day of exploring the Old Port and the local area. It was a lovely day and were fortunate to have great weather. There were little markets nearby selling souvenirs and local products which was great to experience that culture. For me, I couldn't",
          "Nice place to relax, get food and drinks. The restaurants range from mc Donald\u2019s, Irish pubs, sea food restaurants to the more fancy ones.",
          "Having visited in the fall i certainly wouldnt think of going in the heat of summer. Octobre is the perfect time to visit. Lovely Bistros lining the port area.",

          "I was disappointed. The area around the marina was very dirty. The Water in the marina area was dirty, smelled and it also was full of trash. My husband commented to me that one might dissolve if they fall in the water! We walked the length of both sides of the pier but",

          "Nice long walks along either side, there is always something going on at the base of it. From there you are within distance from most everything in Marseille, either by walking or metro.",
          "This is pretty much the place to go to get to all the tourist areas of marceille. The Panier is nearby and many excursions and tours depart from the port. There are lots of restaurants and bars in the area, and a traditional fish market on Sundays gives you the chance to buy",
          "Having traveled through the city on the airport bus and walked from the Charles station, we were feeling a little underwhelmed by Marseille, but once you get to the Old port, the dubious and dirty areas are forgotten. It's quite a spectacle, not in the same league as Valetta,",
          "Walking around this port is one of the activities that you should do in Marseille. The view is fantastic. There are street market where you can buy souvenirs, food and the delicious macarons. You should see the sunset from this place. It's amazing.",

          "This is an attractive marina extraordinaire in the middle of downtown Marseille, offering wonderful Mediterranean perspectives as well as the flavour of the city. The port is large enough to have its own internal ferry service, although it could probably do with an additional",
          "Strolling along the Vieux Port is great. You can see the docked sailboats, fresh fish vendors (many fishes still alive), the many restaurants with outside tables. The view of Notre Dame de la Garde. We really loved it. We took a city tour from here with Color Bus which is",

          "The port area is very busy with traffic but it is great to spend some time going around the marina taking it all in. The boats, restaurants and fortifications are great to look at. Most of the food we tasted is also brilliant. Not to be missed when in Marseille!",
          "Our coach tour of the city of Marseille included several stops in the Old Port part of the city. These stops enabled us to disembark from the coach and have a brief look around and also provided us with the opportunity to take some photographs. The best feature of the Old Port",
          "A lot of boats and a lot of activity. Trips available to the islands or just a ferry ride across the port for half a euro. A fish market on the quay side is intersting to see and I think takes place most mornings. A variety of eateries all along the streets and just a nice place",
          "We visted 4 times in 10 days as there always something to see or do. There are loads of cafes and restaurants, either at the side of the quai or in the side streets. Plenty of shops, again either at quaiside or nearby. There's le petit train that stops there and le ferry boat",

          "A really super place to wander around for a few hours. Amazing scenery. A few dodgy looking people and worth noting the signs warning of pickpockets. We didn't encounter any problems but sensible to be aware of your personal security.",
          "Beautiful protected old/historical port protected at the heads by historical armaments and limestone rock walls. Both old fishing boats and modern fleet fill this harbor. Cafes abound and if you explore a few blocks in there are even better mom/pop brassieres. Notre Dame looks",

          "There are lots of tiny streets running behind and parallel to the sea fron road. Prices there are half what you will pay on the sea front. Additionally you won't have your food tainted by petrol fumes.",
          "The old port is something that you inevitably will see when you're in marseille since it's in the city center. All the boats on the water give a very charming, the area looks very nice at night as well.",
          "Marseilles roots and the reason that it was ever founfmd here. Touristic spot where you can see the boats in the harbour, enjoy fresh seafood, have beautifull views, take the ferry for a day at sea or start your citytour to the musea or le Panier. Dont forget to see the",
          "Stayed in Marseille for 3 days and loved wandering round the Vieux Port. Go in the morning to the fish market to see the freshly caught produce for sale. Wander around at night and be entertained by buskers. Catch boats to take trips to Iles du Firlou or the Calanques or take",

          "We saw this train several times running, full of passengers. It is an ideal way to see some parts of Marseille that you might otherwise not be able to see if you could not walk the streets. It is an easy way to get to the hill to visit the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde. The",
          "More and more popular these tourist land trains, here in Marseille they are very popular most of them packed so they have got about 4 of them they do different routes and cost 8 euros which is value, we took the route up to the Notre Dame Castle and it took about 45 mins but we",
          "We loved this train ride up to the cathedral. It felt like being a little kid again. Outside but inside. So worth it.",
          "They really pack you in on train to Notre Dame . Comfortable seating is 3 to a row, but they make you squeeze in so that you are 4 across. The ride up the hill is lovely, you see parts of the city you would never see otherwise, the views are amazing. The ride back is much more",
          "Opportunity to make a short overview of the city, it is little overcrowded because you need to wait bout 20min to get in train, but for a price of 20\u20ac for 2 adults and one child is reasonable trade.",
          "This petit train leaves from the vieux port with a choice of two routes, old Marseille and Notre Dame de la Garde. We did the first one (route 2). Commentary was in French with English translation. The pronunciation of the French words was so atrocious that you had to listen to",
          "A group of us were excited to go on this train..and the view at the top was excellent. However the crowd control for people getting on to the trains going down was atrocious. People were cutting the line in large groups and nobody was doing anything about it. I feel sorry for",
          "We enjoyed our tour of the old town on Le Petit Train. We queued for less than five minutes for tickets, got straight on and left almost immediately. The route was really interesting and the commentary was excellent \u2013 both in French and English. Thoroughly recommended.",
          "We took the train that went to Notre Dame cathedral up on the hill. It went by the coast on the way. It allows you to get off at the Cathedral and catch the next train. They come ever 10 to 20 minutes. I would recommend not sitting at the back as there are exhaust fumes. Cost",
          "Due to the gradients of the roads, the train cannot cope if the road is wet. You may have to walk the remainder of the journey to the Basilique (Green Route train) or catch the local bus to return. The fare is 8 Euro return despite the leaflet for the 2019/2020 season saying 7",
          "We were on a cruise and was told about the little train, two tours we did number one . Very good went up to the cathedral views so good.would recommend it.",
          "A tour around Marseille on a very hot day. Perfect for a young family. Very interesting and talk done in different languages",
          "Our first morning in Marseille meant we didn\u2019t feel like doing too much after a days travelling the day before. So this seemed ideal. We did both tours and it was a lot of fun. The train had different languages and the drivers and staff were all very polite. We later found that",
          "On a cruise visiting Marseille for the first time we had decided to get an overview of the old town by taking the Petit Train, which we did! It cost 8Euro per person and we really enjoyed it (although it was a little unforgiving on the backside at times!). Unlike the tour that",
          "As others have said, taking the little train is a good way to get up to the Notre Dame de la Garde. The place where you buy the tickets seems very organised and there was plenty of shade available for us as we queued (which was good as it was in the high thirties celsius when we",
          "We took the Petit Train to Notre Dame. The journey there took us around the headland and through the streets on an interesting route. The train was very busy and can't be described as \"comfortable\" but is a fun and cheap way to get to the cathedral. They run at very regular",
          "We love taking these little trains. You definitely see more of the town this way. In the searing heat it is the best was yo see the basilica. The seemed to leave every ten minutes.",
          "Fun way to see Notre Dame,- went with 2 children and its open train that takes you along the coast line and up to Notre Dame,- and there you can stay for as long as you want before going back to the same starting point by the harbour. Worth the experience especially for the",
          "We had one day in Marseille since we were on a cruise ship. We took our ship's shuttle into the city near the Old Port. The Petit Train leaves from the Old Port. It is probably the cheapest way to get to Notre Dame de la Garde. It is a nice ride with commentary about the",
          "Enjoyable trip, scenic, fun and well executed. Reasonably priced and good commentary. Good fun for all ages",
          "We arrived off a cruise ship yesterday to take a look around the city. Trains don't start until 10am & a heap of people were there from 9am. It was so unorganized & staff were so rude & telling everyone different things. Chose this over the hop on hop off bus as much cheaper &",
          "After the purchase of the ships shuttle from the port ($15/each), we walked to this train to view the city sights, along the waters edge, and up to the Notre Dame de la Garde. Up, up, up the hill. They stop for about 20 minutes which is plenty of time to visit the cathedral",
          "The train is very easy to find and its cheap. The only bad thing is that it can get busy and they really cram you into the seats to fit everyone in, and the wait line to come back at Notre Dame gets LONG. We took route 1 which was a nice ride along the beaches. Don't worry",
          "This little train ride is a great value. We took the route number one up to the Norte dame Church. Only 8 euro. Minimal narration in several languages. Enjoy.",
          "Route 1 goes to Notre Dam v\u00eda the beaches. This is a very scenic route. Ticket price is \u20ac7 for adults and \u20ac4 for children. The train is every 10 minutes. The train goes right to the steps of Notre Dam unlike the color bus which will leave you to climb a sloping way up. I did not",
          "Like others, decided to take the Petit Train on our very first day in Marseille. Get an overview of the area in fresh air and sunshine. What more could you want! Beautiful sunny day for the open-air train tour. Took the No.1 route at 12:30PM that winds along the port and coast",
          "We avoided the busy 10:00 time and went a bit later. Trains go often, so our wait was minimal. We found it a worthwhile way to spend 8 Euros and enjoyed the views from Notre Dame De La Garde very much! It was well managed. Very popular and lots of people, but it is worth it.",
          "This was a fun way to spent about an hour. It is a lovely way to see a lot of the city, and to get the lay of the land. It was a reasonable price, \u20ac8. We grabbed a train late in the day, so we did run into some afternoon traffic, but it wasn't too bad. Also, there is some audio",
          "We just had one day in Marseille so our first adventure was to take the little train up to the basilica on the hill. We tried to be there early but it didn't work so we ended up standing in line. However, the trains came frequently and we enjoyed our trip. The commentary",
          "This train is good value at \u20ac8 for the uphill ride from Vieux Port to Notre-Dame de la Garde Cathedral and back. It trundles through side streets and along the Marseille coast giving you a bumpy ride. Commentary is in French, English, German and Spanish. At the cathedral you",
          "Not the sort of thing we normally do but we were only in Marseilles for a couple of days so didn't have time to get round everything. We took the Notre-Dame route and got a lovely ride along the Corniche, and through some interesting little streets. There was a commentary in",
          "We enjoyed the petit train up to the cathedral. There are two routes to take, as the cathedral is up a rather high hill we opted for transport! I highly suggest going in the morning when it first opens around 10am as it can get quite crowded and wait times are higher later in",
          "Petit Train of Marseille leaves the old port every 20 minutes or so during the spring on one of two routes: the old town and the Notre Dame de la Gard church overlooking the city. The fare for adults is 8 EU; the Notre Dame route, which we took half of, takes about an hour and",
          "We went in the off-season, early March, so only the line to Notre Dame de la Garde was running, not the other 2. This was perfect for us, as that is exactly where we wanted to go. Buying tickets was a quick and easy process as there was a ticket booth right in front of where",
          "When we'd initially heard that there was a little train to Notre Dame de la Garde, we were thinking this was an actual train ride, not a \"kiddie train\". Finding that out made us laugh a little, but it worked out well. The \"trains\" run often and efficiently and this is a much",
          "After reading terrible reviews of the colour bus, and still wanting to tour the city, we found the petite little train! It was a delight to find it next to the boats in the sunshine looking very inviting and ready to take us on our journey. We bought a ticket quickly and easily,",
          "Be prepared to wait in a huge line! The ride itself took us to interesting sites, I believe it was 8E each. Again a long wait to get on the train to return but it was definitely worth the waits.",
          "We had a day in Marseille during a recent cruise and Le Petite Train came as a recommendation. We didn't fancy it at first when the suggestion came but after we had walked the port perimeter finding little else to grab our attention we gave it a go. Queues were long but moved",
          "The petite train does a scenic route round a bit of the coast line and then winds it\u2019s way to the top at Nortre Dame de la Garde. The views from the top are amazing and there are lots of look out views. The Nortre Dame Cathedral itself is imposing and looked awesome inside. You",
          "The petit train staff do a really good job of taking you around Marseille. They cover a lot of ground in an hour for 8 euros including giving you time to stop and see inside the cathedral. I would thoroughly recommend this trip.",
          "After an awful experience with the Colorbus. We had a delightful trip around marseille in this little train. The agents were helpful and there were plenty of trains to go around. This train takes you to all the major attractions (same as Colorbus) but perhaps there would be",
          "Very organized and well planned train trips. Route #1: goes to Notre Dame de la Garde, Route #2: goes to shopping center \"Terrases du Port\", and Route #3: goes toward Frioul Islands. Costs run between 4 to 7 Euros for adults, dependent upon the route. There's about a 60",
          "We wanted a scenic, unique way to get to Notre Dame de la Garde and didn't have a lot of time. The Petit train was inexpensive, 8 euros for adults and offered a round trip up the mountain and back in about 1 hour. A really fun Ride and a chance to see Marseille close up.",
          "Youre paying for a trip up the hill. There is very little to see on the way up or down so really and truly this is just an excuse not to walk up so it may as well be called a taxi ride.",
          "We decided to do a trip , the sun was hot and this gave some shade We paid around 8 Euro which was good It went around to places which gave you a feel of the city and up to the church at the top of the hill It was about 1 and 1/4 hours We really liked it",
          "The Petit Train is close to where you get dropped off if you are on a Princess Cruise. It was about $9 per person and you need to have your money or card ready because the guy collecting will skip you until you have it ready. He moves fast and clears out the line in a hurry. So",
          "On a very hot day when it was too hot to walk much, this little train gave the family an enjoyable ride to Notre Dame and back. Our 4 year old loved the ride and the rest of us enjoyed the multi lingual commentary. Although queues were long it didn't take too long to get a ride",
          "Nice ride up to Notre Dame de la Garde. Good way to see the city without walking!! Starts at the Vieux Port. Has commentary in French and English.",
          "We have done both trains now (different routes ) and very much enjoyed this. Two year old daughter loved going on it and was enjoying looking around. Nice to get off half way. Explore. And get back on another train later. Yes there are queues. Down by the port they have",
          "The queue looked long and daunting but the trains came fast and within 10 minutes we were on a train. The commentary was clear and audible. Best way to go up to Notre Dame especially on a hot day. It was reasonably priced and definitely worth it",
          "This is the very best way to visit the city. I was in Marseille just for few hours, during a cruise. Best choice!!",
          "This was a great experience, we did both of the trains, the one going to the basilica was highly recommended, we did that one and on top we got a private tour guide (no charge) that spoke English, this was very nice and we recommend doing this train if you are in town.",
          "While it says 0-3 years is free, they charged me for my 3 year old.. there was quite a few in line so I didn't pay much attention till later. Only 4 euros but it annoyed me. We took the green line to Notre dame and so glad we did as the hike up there wasn't pretty! No way would",
          "We arrived at the ticket office to find hundreds of people standing in line. We showed the tickets we had bought in advance and the guide put us on the very next train before any others from the line-up. The sights were amazing and we enjoyed out visit to the church at the",
          "A perfect way to see the port, surrounding city, and of course, the marvelous church. The trains are small, but comfy, and a great way to sit back while it climbs what would be an arduous trek up the hills to reach the church (which is a MUST SEE). We did get there before the",
          "This tour of the city and the port and the Lady of Gard church is wonderful and not to be missed. The views of the city, the port, and the wonderful corniche is impossible to replicate on foot, taxi, private car, or even bus. The climb that the train makes up and down the",
          "This train does two separate circuits. We got on circuit 1 (8\u20ac) to go to and from Notre dame de La Garde. The kiosk to buy tickets is in the Vieux Port and the trains are parked next to it. The train ride takes no more than 15mins and takes you along the scenic waterfront and",
          "Perfect transportation to discover the city and see the Notre Dame. You got several information about the history of the city during your trip. If you are more than two, better to use a taxi as it is cheaper and quicker. The The train takes you to the Notre Dame de La Garde,",
          "When at the Notra Dame de la garde, I left a t shirt I bought in town on my seat for 10 minutes and when I returned it was gone. I believe the driver took it for the following reasons. 1. He was the only one alone with the train. 2. The shirt was XXL and would have fit him.",
          "My friend and I went on this train because we were trying to get up the hill from the old port. It was only 8 euros, and gave a little audio tour all the way up. They dropped us off right at the top (note: you don't have to get off but it is worth it to). The pick up trains come",
          "It is the precise way to know the narrow streets of Marseille, comfortable, with precise comments on the attractions of the city. Reasonable price. Both routes, 1 or 2 have the same value, I decided for the second one, which shows the old city.",
          "I waited awhile before reviewing the \"train\". It is a great way to see Notre Dame which I highly recommend seeing. It is beautiful inside and out. You can stay as long as you like there unless it's late in the day and the train has stopped running. I spent about 40 minutes",
          "We'd paid more than the e8 price of this trip, for a 'pint' the previous evening, so this train ride was excellent value. With only the morning to spend in Marseille before catching the airport bus, the hotelier advised us that this train ride was the best thing to do, and it",
          "We caught this from the old port. It's like something from a kid's TV show. There are a couple of different trips, we did the one to the basilique - Notre Dame De La Garde. It takes about 20 minutes and takes you through streets you probably wouldn't see otherwise. There",
          "The train drives you besides beautiful touristic sides of Marseille. During the tour to Notre dame de la Garde you will cross the city and see beautifull views of the sea and the small islands in front of the coast. Chateau d'If, Plage Catalan and many other famous attractions.",
          "Thanks for the tourist trip on the petit train a few days ago. It was good, apart from one thing - this was the stop at Notre-Dame De La Garde - this spoilt the tour for me. Up until then the trip had been in five languages, but when the driver announced the stop it was only",
          "This little toad train took us on a very interesting trip, we went on circuit 1 which took us to Notre Dame de la guarde. It was spoken in several languages so was easily understood",
          "I loved this! Here's what happens: Go to the ticket office and buy tickets for approx \u20ac8 each adult. Ticket office is searchable on google maps if you type in petit train marseille. We then got straight onto a train which was waiting for all the tourists. Recommend that you",
          "Enjoyed our trip on Le Petit Train in Marseille (route 1), and we felt it was really good value. \u20ac8 per adult for the round trip (\u20ac4 for under 12s), with a stop at Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde and regular return trains allowing you to stay at the basilica as long as you",
          "The train (which is really a small truck pulling open air carriages) leaves from the harbour and drives around the seafront and up to the Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde. It is a great drive up the very windy and extremely steep streets and provides excellent views of the",
          "We were on a cruise and had little time. The train gaves a city tour on the way to Notre Dame and it's wonderful views. Great value.",
          "A good way to get oriented and to see the most interesting parts of Marseilles. One sevice goes to the Panier and the other along the Calanquesto Notre Dame de la Garde. Each is worth the trip.",
          "Normally, my husband and I are slightly bemused by adults who use these forms of transportation but on this occasion we felt it was the best option. 8\u20ac each for a return to Notre Dame - don't try and walk there! - the train takes you along the old port with a commentary giving",
          "There are two lines, one going round the old town, and the other connecting the old port with the Basilique Notre-Dame de la Garde. The auto train is moving slowly and is a very good way to explore the city. However, the organization and service are very bad.",
          "Petit Train Marseille is wonderful way to see Maseille. The train has 3 routes so actually you can discover Marseil with this little train.",
          "This was a fun train around Marseille and then to Notre-Dame de la Garde. It took us around places in Marseille that we wouldn't have ordinarily seen BUT when we got to the top to go into the Basilica there was a massive tour of over a hundred people waiting to get on the train",
          "We bought A 3 day city pass should have given us 3 journeys on the train that you only need to ride twice to we both tours. We went back for our second tour and were treated with disrespect, annoyingly he didn't even scan the passes first time round. So officially we never",
          "We bought our tickets at the Visitor Bureau, but you can get them at the train starting point (alongside the harbor). A couple of things to be aware of: the train makes only one stop, at the Notre Dame Cathedrale, and moves pretty fast so it really is just an orientation ride.",
          "Seemed like a good idea. The tour route was very good and the train is neat and clean. Lines are long waiting to get on it both at the office and at the top of the mountain. The staff is friendly and seemed to be having fun. The big problem is with the audio narration, it is",
          "1/2 way up one side of Vielle Port is the little train that could, and does give you a comprehensive tour of Marseille....including the Basilique Notre Dame on top of the hill. Buy your ticket right away and then stand in line for up to 1 hour to get on a train.",
          "\u20ac8 per adult the train takes the coastal road up & a direct route back down. We sat at the front of the train on the way up & you couldn't really hear the commentary but sat at the back on the way back down & you could clearly hear the commentary in English. Well worth the money",
          "This little train took us on a big ride around this city saving our legs from walking up and down. The train ride gives you a overview of this beautiful city and you could go back to check out any particular spot.",
          "Do not miss it !! No matter how long you are going to stay in the city, first thing to do is taking this tour !! so you got the main views of that chaming city . You sit in a small train that takes you to the other side of the city, up to the highest point of Marseille -to the",
          "You can take the local bus to the top of the hill to visit the church for about 2 euros, as opposed to the little train at 7euros, but you get a good commentary, it's more fun and a great way to see the town.",
          "We were traveling by cruise ship and wanted something easy (and inexpensive) to do in Marselles. We took the bus from the ship terminal to town and rode the Petit Train up to Notre Dame de la Garde. It was a little chilly, but really sunny and nice. When you arrive at the",
          "Land trains are often a good way to get the feel of a town or city, but this one is a must because it takes you up to the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde. They set off every half hour and make their way beside the Old Port before winding their way along back streets and",
          "The \"Little train\" is good opportunity to get up the Notre Dame church in Marseille when you do not want study the local transport plans. Tired from walking I really appreciated the chance to sit and look. I would five the maximum \"stars\" but there is one thing that I have",
          "There was a sizeable queue, not surprising given our visit was in peek summer season, but the ticket booth cut through the queue in fairly quick order. The train chugs around the harbour with some great views out to see. I'd have probably learnt a lot but the speaker in our",
          "If you have limited time in Marseille this little tour is a fun, easy way to have a quick look around. It's a cute, open train that goes right up to the beautiful Notre-dame de la Garde on the top of the hill. On the way you see stunning views, plus they narrate the journey in",
          "Took the coach into Marseille from the cruise ship terminal. Walked near the harbour and found this tour train. Waited about 15 minutes to get on. Enjoyed the trip around the waterfront to the Basilica. Was quite the delay at the Basilica to return to the harbour - about 45",
          "Used this option on recent cruise visit to Marseille City, had 15 min wait, but use for easy access to Notre Dam",
          "The local buses for 1.50\u20ac per day take you to all the same places. A local bus goes to exactly the same spot at the main cathedral. A lot cheaper and you can get a bus map at the station",
          "Makes life a whole lot easier to get up to the Basilica, especially if you have children, and providing you also with a trip along the coast with views of Chateau d'If island. Lineups can be long but if you come early, when it opens, you'd be fine.",
          "Nice little ride on the train up to the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde. Cuts out a lot of time that would be spent walking. Commentary give on the ride in multiple languages. Regular trains leaving the port and the Notre Dame. Journey back to the port is great fun with a few",
          "Route one takes you to the top of the hill and Notre Dame cathedral for eight euros which is worth the money. On the downside there's not much else to the tour (although maybe that's Marseille than the tour!). Didn't take route two as Le Panier is not a nice place to walk",
          "I had read several reviews regarding the Petit Train as a nice way to get a feel for Marseille. We took a taxi from the cruise port to the center of town. After having breakfast, we located the site to board the the Petit Train. There was really nothing spectacular about the",
          "The ticket person in the booth a male who speaks good English is a thief. He gave change for 50 but it was a 100 that I tendered. He immediately gave me the remaining 50 once I challenged him. So it makes me think he is well versed in his ruse and makes a bundle this way. The",
          "I thought this might be a bit of fun, but no. This was a disappointing and very uncomfortable experience. They wait until the train is absolutely busting with tourists before leaving. Squeezing in as many as possible so that EVERYONE is uncomfortable. The seats are very cramped",
          "- Tain N\u00b0 2 Cath\u00e9drale la Major - Indeed, it's a train for tourists, but what a rip-off! Drop the price so everyone can enjoy this scenic tour. It's not just the substantial charge of 8euro per person, but the waiting prior to departure. They advertise tours departing every",
          "There are three train options that start on the North side of the old port. We took train one (8\u20ac pp) to Notre Dame de la Garde. While we were there this train departed every 20 minutes; our departure was maybe 6 or 7 minutes late. The train takes you along the coast line",
          "It depends on which train you get on as to whether it's worth the 8 euros. Yes, do take train number 1 to the basilica. No, don't bother with train number 2 to The Pannier. The Basilica for its views of the town and islands is great, but the inside of the basilica is stunning.",
          "This is an economical way to get to the top of the hill and Notre Dame de la Garde. The route to Notre Dame de la Garde provides views of the harbor and other sites. You can get off the train at Notre Dame de la Garde and spend time viewing Notre Dame and taking in the views,",
          "Cute little tram, and a convenient way to get to Notre Dame and back to the port. It was a good way to get a tour of the city and not too pricey. There are two routes that go to different parts of Marseille. The one we took had stops every 20 minutes to drop off and pick up",
          "It's cool for a fast visit, I took the first route to go to the church and it was really nice. The total time of the tour is about 1h10",
          "We caught train number 1 which climbs up the hill from the harbour to the Notre Dame De la Garde. An interesting ride through the narrow streets to the church. There is a commentary in four languages. French, English, German and Spanish. When you have finished seeing the church",
          "Unless you are an avid hill-walker then this is the mode of transport in Marseille for you. There are two trains, one brings you to Bascilla de Notre Dame de la Garde and the other to the Panier area. I would recommend doing both one takes about 1 and a half hours and the",
          "We took the Petit Train from the start point on the port for 8\u20ac. The staff tried to cram us into the same seat as two other adults (4 per row) but as it was 30\u00b0 + there was no way we were doing that and waited for the next train which arrived in a couple of minutes. We travelled",
          "We saw this while walking the port. We also wanted to get up to notre dame church and for this it worked out well. It was about a 20 minute ride up and about 8 min ride down. Going up there is commentary of the area and al little history as you pass by things. Since its in",
          "Petit Train is really the best option for getting around Marseille for the first time. We took the old town tour early in the morning, and even though nothing was open, we enjoyed the buildings and commentary, especially the \"pajama church\" and how it got its name. They only",
          "Wa took the petit train to visit Notte-Dame de la Garde. Ahen we wanted to return, the guy tending to the passangers tried to force us to sit in a carriage that was all covered in commercial billboards so you could not see anything although this was supposed to be a panoramic",
          "If you're just visiting for a day or two, the Petit Train offers a great way to cover a lot of ground in Marseille. I had read that it's hard to get seats on the train in high season, but we were lucky and didn't have any problem with a party of 5. We bought tickets outside",
          "A great way to see the city and go to the Notre Dame De La Garde which has the most beautiful stunning views. Had trouble hearing because of the group behind me. They spoke very loudly everytime the recording spoke english. You stop at the top and can catch a train back every",
          "This train ride around this beautiful city is well worth the fare. The church of Notre- Dame de la Garde at the top of the hill is truly stunning with amazing views back towards the old port and the IHG hotel Dieu ( well worth a stay if your lotto numbers come up!!) the fact",
          "Although touristy, a great way to get up to Notre Dame de la Garde. Circuit 1. You get 20 minutes to visit and a train picks you up to return. Beautiful church overlooking the Med.",
          "We took the tour that took us up to the church. Great narrative if you're sitting close to the speakers. We could see the If castle on our tour. The train leaves you at the church and they continually come and pick people up, so you can spend as much time their as you'd like. I",
          "I caught the mini train route 1 and that was good as it has a good sea front tour and we were stopped close to the Notre Dame but after the visit despite us all being in line everyone just dashed for a seat on the return . Luckily the queue was short and everyone got on. Also",
          "We went on both Circuits 1 and 2. Circuit 1 is by far the better option. The road train takes you right up to Notre-Dame De La Garde, an imposing church built high above the city. There is a commentary in English but also on several other languages so you only got brief",
          "We went on the circuit 1 trip up to Notre Dame. A reasonably priced and novel way to see some of the beautiful coastline and Notre Dame. The commentary was helpful also. A lovely way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "I thought the train ride was OK, the kids not so much! ha ha,, here's my son's review of the train h \"It was boring and it made me sleepy\" It was easy to buy tickets. We stayed on and didn't get off at the top. I thought it was pleasant. Some people complained that they were",
          "We didn't experience anyone being rude or disrespectful at all and we only had three to a row. These trains run in several cities across the South of France and were a great way to get an overview of the city and pick up a bit of history at the same time. Much cheaper than the",
          "One ride is included in the Marseille City Pass, so we took the train that stops at Notre dam. The ride gets quite bumpy occasionally and it amazes me, how the driver is able to navigate in the narrow streets with all other traffic around him. Also on the way back, there is a",
          "Should not be surprised as these folks were not just rude but extremely disrespectful. If you don't have 4 people to each row they scream at you. I did not care too much but others around me were visibly shaken. For 8 euros we should not expect great service. The train ride",
          "Efficient way to see Marseille especially if you are traveling with young children or have limited time. There are two circuits both starting from the port (nearer towards MuSEM) with one going around Le Panier and the other to Notre Dame de la Garde (great views of the city",
          "For only 8 Euros we had an hour and 15 minute tour of the city which I think is very good value, my only gripe is where the train stops you must get off you can't stay on for the return leg",
          "There are two different routes but we choose the blue one (which goes up to Notre Dame de la Garde). The climb was rough and it would have been difficult to walk there, so I believe that our choose was the right one. There is also an audio guide which explains what you see along",
          "The train takes you up to the Basillica at the top of the hill overlooking Marseille and the view from the top is fantastic. You really see the whole city and with the commentary you get an idea of why and how it is/was set up.",
          "I expected Marseille to be an industrial city, with few tourist attractions, but nothing is further from the truth! It's a beautiful city with lots of attractions, very clean, very friendly and spectacular views. I would highly recommend this for a visit. The Train Turistique is",
          "We wanted to do the cycle tour but were unable to get on it at the last minute, so this was the alternative. It was a good option, as we did both loops (up to Notre Dame as well as to the old quarter) and saw quite a lot of the city in a short space of time. The train only stops",
          "We took the Petit Train to Le Panier (we had taken a taxi directly from port up to Notre Dame). They are cash only, there are no restrooms nearby, and they don't tell you that they're taking a break in the middle of the day (but you should look at the schedule and ask!). We",
          "This train comes with the city pass (best deal of any city pass I've bought since) and gives a nice overview of the city, plus a ride up to Notre Dame de la Garde. Having been in Europe for a couple months now, this church still stands out as one to see!",
          "Reasonably priced (\u20ac8) way to get an overview of the old port area. Good commentary in both French and English. Stop off at the Basilique is great and then get another train back down when you have finished taking in the views and exploring the basilique.",
          "Great long ride around the town went right up to the cathedral and you could get off then get back on another one, but we stayed on the train, good look around the town, saves your feet , great for people who struggle walking around they should have these in all the ports, good",
          "We were only in Marseilles for the day and had one main attraction we wanted to see and that was the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde! On a scorching July day though the last thing we wanted to do was walk up the hill to it! This is where the Petit Train comes in - leaving",
          "The little train was good enough gave you a little commentary as you went along. It took you round where you may not have walked to as Nortre Dame is at the very top of a very high hill overlooking the city. To walk from the port would take even a very fit young person 45min to",
          "Inexpensive open train that goes up to Notre Dame church as no need to walk. It is reasonably priced too!",
          "Whilst in Marseille for a few days we saw the Petite train going pass us many times. As we walked along the promenade we came to the Petite train 'station'. The price for myself, my wife and young son was very reasonable. I also had read many reviews prior to leaving home. It",
          "I took the train as part of the City-Pass that I bought in the tourist office. In this case you can take if for free. Otherwise it will cost around 8 Euros for an adult. My plan was to take the bus to the Cathedral, but then I thought that the train will be nicer, because you",
          "This little train is easy to find near the old harbour and an excellent way to get to know the basic lay-out of Marseille. I would recommend it for any newcomers to the city!",
          "Possibly the best way to see the Notre Dame de la Garde basilica: the trip (once you've decided not to be embarrassed by sitting in an overgrown Disneyesque toy train) takes in a great swathe of the city, and corniche and the follies of the 19th century super-rich on its way up",
          "Like other reviewers we took the train from the Vieux Port to the Cathedral way up at the highest point in the city. While you do not want to walk to the Cathedral, I cannot say that I would recommend this mode. The train moves very quickly and is a bumpy and uncomfortable ride.",
          "The little train could use some new shocks; it was quite an uncomfortable ride. We took it primarily to get to the Notre Dame basilica and were told that we'd have 30 minutes to explore the church and its environs. However, we were only given 20 minutes, which is insufficient",
          "Marseille is the underdog of French cities. On this hour long ride through the city, you will see some of the best sights of the city and get a little bit of history along the way. In many ways, this is a good introduction to the city and will help you identify some of the spots",
          "There are 2 routes on the petit train. Train 1 heads up the hill toward Notre dame de garde, which is where we wanted to go, and we could not walk that distance, and we figured it would be faster than the city bus. Cost 8 euros, It was a typical petit train tour like in most",
          "We decided to take the train because we knew my son would like it, plus it was an excellent way to get to Notre Dame. Once there, you can explore the church and surrounding area for as long as you like. Trains come about every 5 -10 minutes to pick you up. We thought it was",
          "There are different routes for this train. My wife and I took the route that goes up the hill to Notre Dame de la Garde. The narration explaining details of the various buildings and sites is translated into several languages. This was a very nice quick overview of some",
          "Good way to see some of Marseille and a unique way to travel to Notre Dame de la Garde. They give some good information on the ride, including landmarks and some history, and the pick up frequency is pretty routine - maybe a 10 minute wait at most. It's worth the cost, if for",
          "This is an excellent way to visit Notre Dame on one route and take the other route to visit the Old Harbor. If you are tired of riding in a tour bus and having to leave an area before your done exploring this is a great way to go at your own pace and less expensive. If your",
          "On the positive side, taking the Petit Train from the Vieux Port up to Notre Dame de la Garde is a fun way to travel there, and see a little of the coast en route. On a fine day, it's certainly good value for money. The down side is . . . coming back down. On the busy August",
          "I always find that using the tourist trains or open top buses is a good way to see the essential parts of a town/city. These two train routes do just that. Circuit 1 goes to Notre Dame de la Garde and Circuit 2 goes around the old town. Bother are interesting and good value for",
          "Paid 8euro each for a trip up to the Notre dame church. Which was beautiful and breath taking views. Left there to look round and wait for the next train to take you back via a different route.",
          "We rode this train to Notre Dame and it was a panoramic journey. It was a great way to see where various sites were located and we took a scenic route from the Old Port along the coastline as we made our journey upwards to the church.",
          "We caught the train up to the Basillica, it winds its way from the port, along the sea highway & then up through the local neighbourhoods. A great little trip, highly recommend. There is also a tour that takes you around the city as well.",
          "Great fun, quick way of getting your bearings, good value and informative commentary - best ride to the church at the top of the hill.",
          "We found out about the train through the Marseille City Pass and took both routes over two days. It was great! A little bumpy here and there but the views along the trip to Notre Dame (the coastline) were fantastic. Audio is provided in French, English and Italian but can get",
          "We caught this in the old harbour mainly because we wanted to visit Notre Dame, which is way too far and too strenuous to get to by foot unless you're seriously fit. Not too expensive and it also takes you around the coastline on the way there. The pre-recorded narration was a",
          "This is a very cute, fun and quick way to see an over view of the old port, or to get you up the hill to the Basilique. The hop on and off service is great for getting around these two areas.",
          "A great way to visit a little bit of Marseilles with its marina, the coast, and the Cathedral Notre-Dame de la Garde! Not expensive at all, 8 Euros per person for Tour 1 that takes you up the hill to the Cathedral, and you can add Tour 2 on your return to visit the Old Marseille",
          "It was such a relief to find these little trains, we wanted to go see the cathedral but it is situated high up on the hill. This was a great way to save your legs. The price was really reasonable for a round trip and offered a nice break from walking. The only down side of this",
          "An easy way to visit Marseille with children when you just have an afternoon...the tour gives you an idea of the places to visit in Marseille...",
          "The tourist train is well-known and you can see it puttering around the Vieux Port area, but its popularity is well-deserved. We took the route round the Corniche and up to Notre Dame de la Garde. Excellent panoramic views and an interesting Church (there is no water on sale in",

          "Having only one day while in the Port with the Costa Cruise, it was a cheap and very good option for us. We took the Train 1 that goes up to Notre Dame de la Garde where you can step out and spend sometime there and come back with another train at a later time. The whole ride",
          "We came with our family for one day to Marseille. We were with 5 children ages 18 to 5. The city is huge and mostly unattractive. BUT the area of the Old Port is beautiful and large and we didnt know where to start. The Church of the Sacred Heart of Notre Dame is way up on the",
          "Very long queue under the hot sun just to get on the train (Suggest bring an umbrella or big hat). Audio guide was played on the train and the train passes by the local beach (Plague Catalunya). beautiful scenery on the way but non-stop. One stop at the Notre-Dame and you",
          "a friendly easy going way of transport lovely way to visit marseille it take you to all major routes",
          "We decided to take this train up to the basilica based upon reviews here. We were lucky on the way up because it was only two of us on a banquette for 4 people. You also get a nice audio commentary and views. It was somewhat more disorganised on the way down. The queuing system",
          "Best way to get to the top of ND de la Garde- good fun and you get to see some of the city as you're on the train- it might feel a bit silly but no one bats an eyelid to see adults being driven around on a miniature train",
          "Cheap and fun, what better way to see Marseille! Kids loved it. Takes about an hour for the tour. Fast and efficient. Hop on and off style with two set schedules.",
          "On our recent trip to Marseille we took Route 1 to Notre Dame de la Garde and Route 2 to The Panier. Both trips were very enjoyable and inexpensive. Views from Notre Dame de la Garde, overlooking the whole of Marseilles, are truly spectacular and the Basilica is absolutely",
          "I would never normally take a road train but it was hot, it's a steep hill and it was right there! WE took the train up to the fantastic Notre Dame de la Garde. It winds around the port and the coast before heading up hill to the church. Once there you get off and get back on",
          "Took the train to the notre dame de la garde, great view of the city and ocean. Perfect for a nice short tour I recommend it to people visiting Marseille!",
          "The other tourists were like cattle when they boarded to return at the cathedral....if there was a better boarding system for people to board it would be more effective",
          "There are two different routes, one going to Cathedral Notre Dame de la Garde and the other The Panier. Both trips are good value and a welcome break from the Summer heat. You can hop on and off the little train at the Cathedral to enable you to spend as much time as you want",
          "This is a reasonably priced way to experience the Old Town of Marseille as well as the Port and other areas. The train runs regularly so we enjoyed some lunch in the Old Town before wandering around some of the shops.",
          "Having just checked into our hotel, we had a little stroll along the Vieux Port. Could see Notre Dame up on the hillside but even at 5pm the heat made thoughts of climbing up there unappealing. Then we saw the \" Petit Train\". My partner was not enthusiastic about jumping aboard",
          "Was almost put off this by the name but was glad I wasn't. I got the city pass so this was included. Not only did it save my legs up the hill, but it took me to parts of the city that I would otherwise never have seen. The expert drivers wind up some crazy narrow hills and there",
          "This is a great way to aquaint yourself with Marseille, and you can find where you want to visit your self on foot, we took the Notre Dame circuit and it was worth it. They leave you at the bassillica, you can stay as long as you want and the train stops to pick you up every 20",
          "Unfortunately we caught the last train for the day on the Notre Dame route. The sites were very nice and it we much better than walking or trying to find a place to park. Unfortunately, if you are the last tram you don't get very long to take in the sights at the church.",
          "We had just a couple of hours for this first visit to Marseille so we chose to have a quick ride around this town and attempt to cover some attractions. Train was comfortable and with good explanations as we rode around the side of the port flanked by the two forts. We passed",
          "We took the little train from Vieux Port to the Notre Dame and back. We found it to be good value for money and we had no problems with waiting or space etc. There is even a basket to place the stroller in during the ride. You get wonderful views of the city and in particular of",
          "We took the tour but found the audio difficult to hear. We also did not know that you were required to disembark at the Notre Dame. We took advantage of the time to take photos of the scenery and visit the Notre Dame. The driver told us he would be back in 25 minutes so we",
          "We took this train to Notre Dame and it was worth my 8 euros. We could see everything from in the train and we arrived exactly in front of Notre Dame. The positive thing is you don't have to walk all the way to Notre Dame. The downside is that you can't just hop off wherever you",
          "We took the Notre Dame tour,which was a mistake. Whilst you do get a good view of the properties on the way to Notre Dame, and the view from there is fantastic, that's about as good as it gets. It seemed that every ten feet he was braking or changing gear each time with a",
          "The petit train goes to the Basilique Notre Dame de la Garde which has a beautiful view of Marseille. The trip itself takes about 1,5 hour incl. a 20 minutes stay at the Basilique. You see a lot of Marseille, different neighborhoods and views of the ocean. A real good way to get",
          "Joined the train on the waterfront stop. Took both the Panier tour, which is the nearby area, and the trip up to Notre Dame le garde. 7 and 8 Euros each. Recorded audio tour presented in French, English, German and Italian. Enjoyed both tours.",

          "The Petits Trains of Marseille are a fun and easy way to take in the sights of the area around the port. There are 2 trains (Train No 1 and Train No 2), each running a different route. We opted for Train No 1, which winds its way through the narrow streets of Old Port (Panier),",
          "We did the hop on hop off bus when we were in Marseille but the train would have been better it was half the price of the bus and did the same route",
          "The \"train\" departs from near to the Hotel de Ville in the Old Port and meanders up to the Notre Dame De La Garde church overlooking Marseille. You are given 30 minutes to get out and wander around Notre Dame before another train arrives to take you back to the Old Port. The",

          "These little French trains are always a good choice to get an initial idea of the city you are visiting; the one in Marseilles is no exception. Listening to a historic narrative while being chauffeured through narrow, winding and often quite steep streets, was a relaxing way to",
          "This is a city tour, and it works, in fact it's the second time I've done a city tour of this type and both have been worthwhile. A fast and effective way to capture a city area without the frustration of having to find your own way around. The tour offers a guide in about 6",
          "The lines were too long to take the train to Notre Dame so we took the other route Panier District which the little train was able to find its way through the narrow streets. The audio was good & we learnt a lot of this part of Marseille, with good stops for pictures.",
          "This train/activity was worth it. This was a simple way to get around Marseille and see the sights. I would HIGHLY recommend using this train, or the bus, to get to Notre Dame. The hills are steep and walking up them would not be a very fun experience. Anyway, we would",
          "Marseille is a city I've never had a desire to visit even after 17 visits to France but our cruise stopped there for an entire day so we made the most of it. It is pretty much as I expected, mostly modern and ugly though the old harbor is attractive. We took the petit train in",
          "This mini-train goes around the old port, along the corniche and all the way up to Notre-Dame de la Garde (easiest way to get there). You get great views of the port, the city, and the islands. Takes 1.5 hours. Time well spent.",
          "With a couple of hours to kill in the evening, I opted for the train ride which brought me to the Notre Dame ~ in my opinion it's the best way to get up there on a sweltering hot summer afternoon. The journey was amazing, with stunning views of the Corniche on the way and",
          "We stumbled upon this train right after starting to discover the city. I was wondering how to get up to the cathedral and then the answer was right there at the harbour. It costs only a few euros and saves you lots of energy. On the way up (downwards it's less spectacular) one",
          "Well worth your time to go and find the starting point for this little train - choose circuit #1, pay your E8 and take a load off, enjoy the ride along the seafront up to the Notre Dame - much better than schlepping up the hill and back. BE WARNED: they will force you to get off",
          "We took the train up to the Cathedral Notre Dame de la Garde, and it's certainly the best way to get up there - I wouldn't want to walk all that way even if I could find the route. However, there is no choice about where you sit. The staff bark their orders as to where you can",
          "We took the train tour that went to Notre-Dame de la Garde. There is a ticket booth at the harbor where the trains leave from. It was about a half hour ride through town and then up to the Basilica, where you can stay and catch a train later.... although you may have to wait in",
          "We easily found the ticket booth right at the main harbor, had to wait in a line up for about half and hour but it was well worth it. We took the longer tour that took us up to the basilica where there are amazing panoramic views of the bay and the cities. You are able to stay",
          "Marseille drivers are crazy so this was a nice way to visit the city. We took the train up to Notre Dame and passed some great sites along the way. It's also fairly inexpensive and has commentary in English as well as loads of other languages. Great for kids!",
          "We had to queue for quite a while, but the ride was worth it. You get interesting information during the ride, but you're often inhaling the diesel fumes of the rain. Four persons per bench may be a bit tight too.",
          "Petit train Marseilles is brilliant. The staff are polite and friendly trying their best to make your experience a good one. The train does two different trips of which we took the longer one to the basilica. Not only does the train save you a very long walk to the amazing",
          "We had an hour spare and one person with walking difficulties so the petit train made perfect sense. We thought it was a great little tour with superb views over the city and Med. We didn't get off but many did - could turn it into a whole day visit if you wanted.",
          "My wife and I visited marseille with a cruise ship and got dropped off by the train by the shuttle bus. We paid for two tickets in a rush as the train was about to leave and we then got abored. We were about 5 minutes in to the trip up to the church when I looked at the ticket",
          "We caught the petit train at the marina up to the Notre-dame de la garde. It was a good long trip up there, glad we did not have to walk. The view from the top was amazing. We were able to get off the train at the top , have a look around then catch the next train when we were",
          "To maximize capacity, the staff put four people across each bench on the little train. Now if those are three children and 1 adult, fine. Now it is 4 North American grazers with hips and paunches, YIKES!!! For safety, the only open area is on the side that you enter so, if it",
          "Sorry, couldn't find an item to review but in Marseille the Ferris wheel at the marina is a must. What a great view of the harbour and the city. Not too expensive, I think from memory about 5 euros - but well worth it.",
          "At the time we went, the petit train was only doing one route - up to the basilica. This was fine, and fairly reasonable as well (otherwise, it's a steep climb). The train can get very cramped, especially if you are not tiny or petite. In addition, when boarding back at the",
          "I had read about this and thought it would be fun so I told my husband about it and it thought it was cheesy and did not want to do it. I talked him into doing it and he hemmed and hawed as we got on board. At the end of the trip he thanked me profusely and said it was a great",
          "Nice and funny ride with 'le petit train touristique'. The train was kind of nice. The way you get to see something of Marseille is really nice. The only thing is, you'll be sitting with 4 persons on the benches in the train. Kind of painfully stuffed. When asking the 'Placier'",
          "We took the Petit Train Marseille to Notre Dame de la Garde. A return journey costs \u20ac8 and it's totally worth it -- especially if you're time pressed. The view from the top is amazing and along the way you get to see parts of the city that you may not be able to get to if you're",

          "We took the Petit Train from the Vieux Port on circuit #1 to Notre Dame de la Garde. We were only there for 1 day, so it was convenient that this ran every 20 minutes and it cost only 8\u20ac for the return ticket. It was easy to find near Hotel de Ville. The lineup was short and all",
          "After being crammed shoulder to shoulder on a city bus the day before, the open air petit train was so very refreshing. The train winds through the streets of Marseilles offering great views of both the city and the coastline. It was very reasonably priced. Great value for an",
          "We chose Le Petit Train to go up to the Basilica of Notre Dame. It took a winding route along the coast, so we saw more of Marseille, then climbed up to the cathedral. The trains run every 20 minutes, so you can time your stay for as long as you wish. The return trip was much",

          "Amid the crowds and bustle of Marseille's harbor and captivating buildings, this is a great way to get a panoramic overview of the city. You get to see the harbor basin, the port, nearby islands and back road residences on your way up the steep hill that is capped by the",
          "We took this little tourist train around Marseille up to Notre-Dame de la Garde. The commentary in any language was too brief to be of value. However, it was a pleasant ride around the city and an easy way to get to the church at the top (which has splendid views of the city).",
          "Take a round to the city center and new port. Nice but no something that it will excite you. Go to montecristo place, Better to get train and go cannes or nice",
          "My daughter is a great fan of petit train everywhere she goes. Makes sense since it is such a great way to explore the area. We had a fantastic time riding the train to the top of the hill which we would never have been able to in the hot summer day in August. Easy to get back",
          "Not really a train, more like a tram car. Worth it to get to Notre Dame church. The church has beautiful views .",
          "My husband and I were visiting Marseille as part of our cruise. We took a bus from our pier to the city and explored old town Marseille on our own. It was very interesting to see authentic French cafes and bakeries. We decided to try this little train out and take it up to",
          "After walking all over Marseille on foot, we were ready to have someone else take us to la Notre Dame de la Garde. We took the petit train to the top of the hill. Our ride was 8 euros per person, but it is well worth it. The train takes you along the coast and all the way up to",
          "The ticket booth for the train is a long walk from the metro station at Vieux Port. The line goes pretty fast. Busiest in the morning. They take a hour break around noon. I like the soundtrack that pointed out all the spots along the way. I did both routes and loved both of",
          "95% of why you would take this train is that it\u2019s an easy way to get up the hill to Notre Dame and its great views of Marseilles. There is little to see along the way and the audio soundtrack reflects that. Nonetheless, you do get a sense of part of the city. Unlike some other",
          "This is the best way to get an overview of the city and a bit of the History. Much better value (\u20ac7.00) than the hop-on-hop off bus (\u20ac18). Good frequency too. Get on outside hotel ville (city hall) in Vieux port. 2 routes available - do both - but if ou have time for oly one do",
          "I took this train in Mar. cold but one of the few sunny days. The trip to the Church had spectacular views of the Mediterranean and forts. The view of Marseille from the church was fantastic. The church was beautiful and this was a great way to see the sights.",
          "I took this train ride to see Notre Dame de la Garde when I had a time crunch. I enjoyed the train ride and the beautiful views of the coastline on the way up. The tour included a brief audio dialogue in French, English, and Spanish. They played some music as well. We had a 25",
          "The sights were breathtaking but when we went in February, the wind was blowing too strongly, which made it harder to fully enjoy the sights. If the train were more closed in (like the one in Toledo) that could have enhanced the experience. The commentary was quite poor too.",
          "We have only 1 day to spend while the cruise ship stops at Marseille. Was in Aix-en-Provence in the morning and arrived at Old Port in the afternoon. We have only a few hours, so decided to take the little train for a scenic intro to many parts of the city. Loved the coastal",
          "We took the train because we wanted to visit the Notre Dame de la Garde. It was so cold and windy that day that we couldn't enjoy it. It takes you to areas that you will not visit otherwise. The view from the Notre Dame was amazing and the ride by the coastline was lovely! It's",
          "While waiting in line for the Petit Train, a woman with a supposed baby in her arm cuddled up close to me while several of us were talking. She slipped her hand into my purse and grabbed my wallet, and dropped it as it was fat. Fortunately,my sister saw her do it, and stepped on",
          "brilliant to go up the notre dame de la garde and to visit, it looks a bit touristy but this is what we are!",

          "Ha ha, not usually our style, but it was an easy way to get to Notre Dame on the hill and just watch the ocean views. The annoying voice overs in multiple languages kind of ruin the ambience, but no way was I walking up that hill! Fun in a totally touristy way",
          "Train has commentary in several languages. Pick a day when the sky is clear - go late in the day because the light is amazing then. Beautiful basilica at the top with a view to die for. Mosaics inside are superb.",
          "The Petit Train Marseille was worth the 7 Euro price just to not have to walk up the hill. The train had English announcements about different areas in Marseille but only made one stop at the top of the hill at the church. The views along the Mediterranean were beautiful but",
          "The tour starts at the Old Port, snakes through Marseille and on up to the Basilica. Great views of Marseille and islands. We only had one day in Marseille and enjoyed this tour.",
          "The train ride costs 7 eur, but the ride is horrible. The views along the ride are good, but it provides no opportunity to take decent photos. Although it was designed as a touristic ride, it is now functioning as a public transport service for people going up the mountain to",
          "We took the train when our boat trip was cancelled due to rough seas. The ride up to the basilica is beautiful with sweeping views of the Mediterranean. When we arrived at the basilica, the driver told us we had 20 minutes to look around. We arrived back in the parking lot 20",
          "Worth the 7\u20ac to take you to the cathedral and see the few sights there are to see. You get to see basically all the sights on the train.",
          "Only 7Euro gets you to Notre Dame, the only really hilly site to see. I would suggest walking back down, very easy walk and just take every street/steps that lead downwards and you will be back by the harbou in no time! On leaving Notre Dame the queue for the train was very",
          "I did both routes. The old town route was a bit short but interesting. The Notre Dame des Gardes route was much better with fabulous sea views. Do route 1 if you only have time for one trip. Sometimes it was difficult to hear the commentary because of street noise -- perhaps",
          "Very dusty city due to the massive roadworks. Not a great time to visit and wouldnt go again however the little train did the best of a job. Had difficulty finding a place for a beer without a sit down meal",
          "A good way to see the city in a few minutes. Nasednete do vl\u00e1\u010d\u00edku a za okam\u017eik V\u00e1s povede po m\u011bst\u011b a\u017e na vrchol k chr\u00e1mu Notre Dame, kde uvidite cel\u00e9 Marseille.",
          "We were looking forward to the tour but had to queue in the full sun for a fair time and were surprised that although they had the amex logo on the counter they wouldn't accpt the card for payment. The tour round the Panier is a good way to see part of the town you would find",
          "Board this little open air shuttle train right at the Old Port for a interesting ride up the hill high to The Basillica Notre Dame. Good way to see local neighborhood and residents on the way up. Hold on though especially on the way back down!",
          "Good value for a trip around the old port and up to Notre Dame. The English commentary was amusing (statue of the Virgin and kid ). Wouldn't bother with the other route around le Panier again",
          "The train takes about 1 hour and you get to see different areas of the city. It is fun for the whole family.",
          "We rode the Petit Train in each city along the southern coast of France, and for what you get for a minimal cost, its a decent tour. If anything, the view and experience you get from Notre Dame de la Garde is well worth the price!",
          "We used the little train to get to the spectacular church Notre Dame de la Garde which is on top of a rather steep hill. In this way we got both a good look at the city's corniche/coastal road and could check out the church easily.",
          "It's a nice ride to the Notre-Dame, and while on it, enjoy the views, and thank god you didn't went on foot, even the train suffers at such steep roads.",
          "We bought a day travel pass which entitled us to travel on the petit train, we thoroughly enjoyed the trip, it took us to the top of the hill to visit Notre Dame Cathedral, the views were stunning. We took several pictures, there is a nice cafe there but it is not open on a",
          "The train to Notre Dame was nice enough. Worth 7 euros.",

          "Great way to see some sights, especially to get all the way up to Notre Dame....",
          "The petit train takes you all round the front of Marseilles working its way up to Notre Dame de La Garde. Getting to the top is half the fun and when you do get to the top the view of Marseille from up there is spectacular as is the actual church itself.",
          "You can pick up the Petit Train in the old Port area but much construction is going on there in 2012. This is the easiest and most cost effective way to see the sights of Marseille and climb the narrow steep streets to Notre Dame du Garde",
          "Great way to get to Notre Dame de la Garde. Good commentary about Marseille.",
          "The young men working at this train were trying to cram about 8 people into each little car where 4 would be comfortable. They were asking me to ride backwards and I said that I would prefer not to I was rudely asked to step aside and wait for the next train (90% of the current",
          "My girlfriend and I paid 7 euro a piece, because we were tired and didn't want to hike all the way up, but the trip was great. We got to see a bunch of the city we wouldn't have seen otherwise.",
          "Perfect ride takes you around the most scenic parts of Marseille. Fun to do with kids.",
          "This train takes you along the Old Port to the mountain with the cathedral Notra Dame de la Gard. Value for money.",
          "Petit Train was an excellent way to see the beach, the Corniche, areas I would have not wandered to. For 7 Euros round trip, I give it a thumbs up.",
          "What a way to travel to the Basilique! A winding, scenic drive that showcases Marseilles, surrounding islands and, ultimately, the Basilique which is certainly unmissable, providing awesome views over all.",
          "Well worth the money to take the train up to the cathedral. And back down. You get a little mini-tour along and way and the cathedral is not exactly walking distance.",
          "This little tour offered a nice break from all of the walking we had been doing. The views are wonderful and the stop at the Basilica was nice. 7 euros seems like a reasonable price for the tour. It is unfortunate that all of the information is given by a recording, although a",
          "i saw it 3 or 4 times passing by and most of the times i saw people sleeping in there. i think it must be quite boring",
          "Easy to discover Marseilles, walking is better ... or ask for a trip with a guide and his Citroen 2CV !",
          "After walking a million steps, a ride is wonderful. This is a cute little train with narration in several languages that takes you to the basilica de la Notre Dame. It is worth the 7 euros to sit and enjoy the ride.",
          "Made the trip with the little train from Old port to Notre Dame de la Garde church on a gorgeous, sunny day and it was a real treat, lots of information, a superb view of the bay, old villas near the sea, the islands and from the top more beautiful views, try to make the trip",
          "The Petit train was an interesting way to see the city, it took us to places that we otherwise wouldn't have seen. With the Marseille City Card, this tour was free of charge. It also is an interesting way to go to the cathedral (Notre Dame) located high above Marseille. Making a",
          "A great way to get your bearings and determine what you want to see more of, and to get up to the basilica.",
          "We found this to be the only kid-friendly activity in Marseille. Our 4 year-old loved it and we loved the view. The commentary in multiple languages is nice as well. Bring a hair tie and a jacket for the wind though!",
          "At first glance of the train and its tour we thought it would be a typical touristy voyage where but they took us from amazing places which we would not have visited.It took us from the sea-side and we saw some amazing views plus when we got to the Notre-Dame it let us stay for",
          "At the Old Port one cannot miss these cute choo choo trains which are coming and going, always full of people. One trains takes you round the centre of Marseille and one takes you to the Basilique of Notre Dame. We too the ride to Notre Dame Basilique and I must say that we",
          "This was a good way to see the sights. Enjoyed break at the basilica.",
          "There was very little narration and they crammed us on there with three other people (there were two of us) and we were so squished. It is all about the money they can get, so jsut take the city bus, it is faster and more roomy!",
          "In short this is just a small train that you can use to get a running commentary on Marseille and see all the sights without having to walk. If you are in Marseille for just a couple of hours, this is not a bad option. It doesn't take you anywhere you couldn't get to by public"

        "wiki": "The French Grand Prix (French: Grand Prix de France), formerly known as the Grand Prix de l'ACF, is an auto race held as part of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile's annual Formula One World Championship. It is one of the oldest motor races in the world as well as the first \"Grand Prix\". It ceased shortly after its centenary in 2008 with 86 races having been held, due to unfavourable financial circumstances and venues. The race returned to the Formula One calendar in 2018 with Circuit Paul Ricard hosting the race.\nUnusually even for a race of such longevity, the location of the Grand Prix has moved frequently with 16 different venues having been used over its life, a number only eclipsed by the 23 venues used for the Australian Grand Prix since its 1928 start. It is also one of four races (along with the Belgian, Italian and Spanish Grands Prix) to have been held as part of the three distinct Grand Prix championships (World Manufacturers' Championship in the late 1920s, European Championship in the 1930s and Formula One World Championship since 1950).\nThe Grand Prix de l'ACF was tremendously influential in the early years of Grand Prix racing, leading the establishment of the rules and regulations of racing as well as setting trends in the evolution of racing. The power of the original organiser, the Automobile Club de France, established France as the home of motor racing organisation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nFrance was one of the first countries to hold motor racing events of any kind. The first competitive motor race, the Paris to Rouen Horseless Carriages Contest was held on 22 July 1894, and was organized by the Automobile Club de France (ACF). The race was 126 km (78 mi) long and was won by Count Jules-Albert de Dion in his De Dion Bouton steam powered car in just under 7 hours. This race was followed by races starting in Paris to various towns and cities around France such as Bordeaux, Marseille, Lyon and Dieppe, and also to various other European cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin, Innsbruck and Vienna. The 1901 Paris-Berlin race was noteworthy as the race winner, Henri Fouriner averaged an astonishing 57 mph (93 km/h) in his Mors, but there were details of other incidents. A competitor driving a 40H.P. Panhard suddenly found the road blocked by a tram in the village of Metternich, and he deliberately ran into the vehicle to avoid the crowd of spectators. The tram was knocked off the rails; the car was hardly damaged. And in Reims, a future location of many French Grands Prix, another competitor hit and killed a child who wandered onto the road with his Mors.\nBut these races, held on public dirt roads that were not all closed to the public came to a halt in 1903. The Paris-Madrid race, a 1,307 km (812 mi) long competition from the French capital to the Spanish capital held in May of that year had over 300 entrants. Some of the cars were doing 140 km/h (87 mph)- an astonishingly fast speed for the time- not even rail locomotives were capable of hitting these speeds. It was not known at the time how safe these races would be or how these cars- made mostly of wood would perform, and development of the car had improved significantly over 9 years. The race was a disaster, with 8 people killed and over 15 injured in multiple accidents- and all this happened before any of the competitors reached the Spanish border. Crowds of onlookers would stand right on the edge of the track, and children were wandering into the roads which became very dusty and visibility was limited at best. The most notable fatality of this race was one Marcel Renault, one of the 3 brothers who founded Renault Cars. When Renault reached the village of Payr\u00e9 just south of Grand Poitiers he lost control of his 16HP Renault in poor visibility caused by excess dust. The car went into a gutter and crashed into a tree, and Renault sustained a horrific wound in the side of his head and dislocated his shoulder. Fellow competitor Leon Th\u00e9ry stopped his Decauville in order to help Renault and his riding-mechanic Vauthier, still trapped in their car. No doctors were on hand, but Th\u00e9ry found one at the next village and sent him to the place of accident- riding a bicycle to get there. The doctor conveyed back Renault to the nearest hospital in Grand Poitiers, where Renault succumbed to his injuries two days later, while Vauthier survived with minor injuries. Accidents continued throughout the day; cars hit trees and disintegrated, they overturned and caught fire, axles broke and inexperienced drivers crashed on the rough roads. The race was eventually called off by the French government and there was no declared winner. The cars were impounded by the French authorities, towed to the nearest rail stations by horses and transported back to Paris by train. The race created a political uproar in France, and a French magazine did their own investigation into the race. Speed, dust created by the cars, poor organization and lack of crowd control were to blame for these tragedies and even French Prime Minister \u00c9mile Combes was held partially responsible because he was the ultimate authority on allowing the race to proceed.\nOther races were organized by American newspaper publisher James Gordon Bennett called the Gordon Bennett Cup, 4 of which were in France. 3 city-to-city races in 1900, 1901 and 1902, all starting in Paris were organized by Bennett and they attracted top racers from the United States and Western Europe. But after the 1903 Paris-Madrid race, the French government banned point-to-point car races, so Bennett moved the 1903 race to Ireland on a closed circuit 2 months after Paris-Madrid, the first of its kind. This race was won by Belgian Camille Jenatzy in a Mercedes. The 1904 race was held in western Germany while the last Gordon Bennett Cup race was held in an 137 km (85 mi) circuit in Auvergne in south-central France. The race started in Clermont-Ferrand, and was run over 4 laps, and was won by Leon Th\u00e9ry in a Brasier.\n\n\n=== The world's oldest Grand Prix ===\n\n\n==== Public road courses ====\n\nThe French Grand Prix, open to international competition was first run on 26 June 1906 under the auspices of the Automobile Club de France in Sarthe with a starting field of 32 automobiles. The Grand Prix name (\"Great Prize\") referred to the prize of 45,000 French francs to the race winner. The franc was pegged to the gold at 0.290 grams per franc, which meant that the prize was worth 13\u200akg of gold, or \u20ac191,000 adjusted for inflation. The earliest French Grands Prix were held on circuits consisting of public roads near towns through northern and central France, and they usually were held at different towns each year, such as Le Mans, Dieppe, Amiens, Lyon, Strasbourg, and Tours. Dieppe in particular was an extremely dangerous circuit \u2013 9 people (5 drivers, 2 riding mechanics, and 2 spectators) in total were killed at the three French Grands Prix held at the 79\u200akm (49-mile) circuit.\nThe 1906 race was the first ever race named \"Grand Prix\"; other, later, international events in the 1900s and 1910s in Europe and the United States had their own names with the term \"Prize\" in them, such as Grand Prize in America or Kaiserpreis (English: Emperor's Prize) in Germany. The French Grand Prix race was run on a 66-mile (106\u200akm) closed public road circuit starting at the western French town of Le Mans, through a series of villages and back again to Le Mans. Hungarian Ferenc Szisz won this very long 12\u2011hour race on a Renault from Italian Felice Nazzaro in a Fiat, where laps on this circuit took around an hour and the horse carriage road surface was made of dirt. The 1908 race saw Mercedes humiliating the French organizers and finishing 1-2-3 at the lethal circuit at Dieppe, where no less than 4 people were killed during the weekend. The 1913 race was won by Georges Boillot on a one-off 19-mile (31\u200akm) circuit near Amiens in northern France. Amiens was another extremely deadly circuit \u2013 it had a 7.1 mile straight and 5 people were killed during its use during pre-race testing and the race weekend itself. The 1914 race, run on a 23\u2011mile circuit near Lyon is perhaps the most legendary Grand Prix of the pre\u2011WWI racing era. This circuit had a twisty and demanding section down to the town of Le Madeline and then an 8.3 mile straight which returned to the pits. This race was a hard-fought battle between the French Peugeots and the German Mercedes. Although the Peugeots were fast and Boillot ended up leading for 12 of the 20 laps the Dunlop tyres they used wore out badly compared to the Continentials that the Mercedes cars were using. Boillot's four-minute lead was wiped out by Christian Lautenschlager in a Mercedes while Boillot stopped an incredible eight times for tyres. Although Boillot drove very hard to try to catch Lautenschlager, he had to retire on the last lap due to engine failure, and for the second time in 6 years Mercedes finished 1\u20132\u20133; a humiliating result for the organizers and Peugeot.\nThanks to World War I and the amount of damage it did to France, the Grand Prix was not brought back until 1921, and that race was won by American Jimmy Murphy with a Duesenberg at the Sarthe circuit at Le Mans, which was the now legendary circuit's first year of operation. Bugatti made its debut at the 1922 race at an 8.3\u2011mile (13\u200akm) off-public road circuit near Strasbourg near the French-German border \u2013 which was very close to Bugatti's headquarters in Molsheim. It rained, and the muddy circuit was in a dreadful condition. This race became a duel between Bugatti and Fiat \u2013 and Felice Nazzaro won in a Fiat, although his nephew and fellow competitor Biagio Nazzaro was killed after the axle on his Fiat broke, threw a wheel and hit a tree; the 32-year old and his riding mechanic both suffered fatal head injuries. The 1923 race at another one-off circuit near Tours featured another new Bugatti \u2013 the Type 32. This car was insultingly dubbed the \"Tank\", owing to its streamlined shape and very short wheelbase. This car was fast on the straights of this high-speed public road circuit \u2013 but it handled badly and was outpaced by Briton Henry Seagrave in a supercharged Sunbeam, supercharging being common feature of Grand Prix cars during this period. Seagrave won the race, and the Sunbeam would be the last British car to win an official Grand Prix until Stirling Moss's victory with a Vanwall at the 1957 British Grand Prix. The 1924 race was held again at Lyon, but this time on a shortened 14\u2011mile variant of the circuit used in 1914. Two of the most successful Grand Prix cars of all time, the Bugatti Type 35 and the Alfa Romeo P2 both made their debuts at this race. The Bugattis, with their advanced alloy wheels suffered tyre failure, and Italian Giuseppe Campari won his Alfa P2.\n\n\n==== France's first permanent circuit and other public road circuits ====\n\nIn 1925, the first permanent autodrome in France was built, it was called Autodrome de Linas-Montlh\u00e9ry, located 20 miles south of the centre of the French capital of Paris. The 7.7\u2011mile (12.3\u200akm) circuit included a 51\u2011degree concrete banking, an asphalt road course and then-modern facilities, including pit garages and grandstands. After the construction of Brooklands in England in 1907, and Indianapolis in the United States in 1908 and after World War I, Monza in Italy was opened in 1922, and Stiges\u2013Terramar in Spain was also opened in 1923. The French were then prompted to construct a purpose-built racing circuit at Montlh\u00e9ry in the north and then Miramas in the south. N\u00fcrburgring in Germany followed in 1927. Montlhery first held the Grand Prix de l'ACF in 1925 as part of the inaugural World Manufacturers' Championship, the first time Grands Prix were grouped together to form a championship. The circuit drew huge crowds and they were witnesses to the spectacular sight of fast cars racing on Montlh\u00e9ry's steep banking and asphalt road course, which had many fast corners and long straights, and was located in a forest. The first race at Montlh\u00e9ry was marred by the fatal accident of Antonio Ascari in an Alfa P2. Miramas, a high-banked concrete oval track like Brooklands and part of Montlh\u00e9ry was completed in 1926, and it played host to the Grand Prix that year. This race saw only three cars compete, all Bugattis, and was won by Frenchman Jules Goux who had also won the Indianapolis 500 in 1913.\nThe 1927 race at Montlh\u00e9ry was won by Frenchman Robert Benoist in a Delage. 1929 saw a brief return to Le Mans, which was won by William Grover-Williams in a Bugatti; this was the man who had won the first ever Monaco Grand Prix earlier in the year; Grover-Williams had also won the 1928 race in a Bugatti at the 17-mile (28 km) Saint-Gaudens circuit in the south, not far from Toulouse. The 1930 French Grand Prix, held at Pau back down in the south was one of the more memorable French Grands Prix of the pre-World War II period. This race, held in September on a one-off triangular 9.8\u2011mile (15.8\u200a-km) public road circuit just a few kilometres away from the current Pau Grand Prix track saw a special supercharged version of the famous Bentley 4\u00bd Litre called the Blower Bentley compete in the race with Briton and \"Bentley Boy\" Tim Birkin driving. The Bentley team had been dominating the famed 24 Hours of Le Mans, and this Blower Bentley had its headlights and mudguards removed, as these were not needed for this race, giving it the appearance of an open-wheel car. The Bentley, which was much larger and heavier than the small Bugattis around it performed well \u2013 at this very fast circuit which was made up of very long straights and tight hairpins actually suited the powerful Blower Bentley, and it enabled Birkin to pass the pits at 130\u200amph (very fast for that time), and he overtook car after car \u2013 to the amazement of the crowd. But he finished second to Frenchman Philippe \u00c9tancelin in a Bugatti.\nMontlh\u00e9ry would also be part of the second Grand Prix championship era; the European Championship when it began in 1931. Other public road circuits near towns such as Reims also played host to French Grand Prix, such as the fast, straight and slow corner-dominated 4.8\u2011mile Reims-Gueux circuit in the Champagne wine region of Northern France 144\u200akm (90\u200ami) east of Paris for 1932, where Italian legend Tazio Nuvolari won in an Alfa Romeo. But from 1933\u20131937 Montlh\u00e9ry would become the sole host of the event. The 1934 French Grand Prix marked the return of Mercedes-Benz to Grand Prix racing after 20 years, with an all-new car, team, management, and drivers, headed by Alfred Neubauer. 1934 was the year where the German Silver Arrows debuted (an effort heavily funded by Hitler's Third Reich), with Auto Union having already debuted its powerful mid-engined Type\u2013A car for a race at AVUS in Germany. Although the Mon\u00e9gasque driver Louis Chiron won in an Alfa, the Silver Arrows dominated the race. The high-tech German cars seemed to float over the rough concrete banking at Montlh\u00e9ry where all the other cars seemed to be visibly affected by the concrete surface. Makeshift chicanes were placed at certain points on the very high-speed circuit in an effort by the French to slow the very fast German cars down for the 1935 race, but this effort came to nothing as Mercedes superstar Rudolf Caracciola won that year's race.\n\n\n==== Reims, Rouen and Charade ====\n\nThe French Grand Prix returned to the Reims-Gueux circuit for 1938 and 1939, where the Silver Arrows continued their domination of Grand Prix racing. The Reims-Gueux circuit had its straights widened and facilities updated for the 1938 race. But when World War II began, the French Grand Prix did not come back until 1947, where it was held at the one-time Parilly circuit near Lyon, a race that was marred by an accident involving Pierre Levegh crashing into and killing 3 spectators. After that, Grand Prix racing returned to Reims-Gueux, where another manufacturer \u2013 Alfa Romeo \u2013 would dominate the event for 4 years. 1950 was the first year of the Formula One World Championship, but all the Formula One-regulated races were held in Europe. The race was won by Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio, who also won the next year's race \u2013 the longest Formula One race ever held in terms of distance covered, totalling 373 miles.\nThe prestigious French event was held for the first time at the Rouen-Les-Essarts circuit in 1952, where it would be held four more times over the next 16 years. Rouen was a very high speed circuit located in the northern part of the country, that was made up mostly of high speed bends. But the race returned to Reims in 1953, where the triangular circuit, which was originally made up of three long straights (with a few slight kinks) two tight 90 degree right hand corners and a very slow right hand hairpin had been modified to bypass the town of Gueux, making it slightly faster. Reims now had two straights (including the even longer back straight), three very fast bends and two very slow and tight hairpins. This race was a classic, with Fangio in a Maserati and Briton Mike Hawthorn in a Ferrari having a race-long battle for the lead, with Hawthorn taking the checkered flag. 1954 was another special event, and this marked Mercedes's return to top-flight road racing led by Alfred Neubauer, 20 years after their first return to Grand Prix racing \u2013 in France. After two wins for the works Maserati team that year at Buenos Aires and Spa, Fangio was now driving for Mercedes and he and teammate Karl Kling effectively dominated the race from start to finish with their advanced W196's. It was not a popular win \u2013 Mercedes, a German car manufacturer, had won on French soil \u2013 only 9 years after the German occupation of France had ended. The French Grand Prix was cancelled in 1955 because of the Le Mans disaster, and Mercedes withdrew from all racing at the end of that year. The race continued to be held at Reims in 1956, another spell at a lengthened Rouen-Les-Essarts in 1957 and back to Reims again from 1958\u20131961, 1963 and one last event in 1966 at this circuit, located where champagne is made. The 1956 race saw a one-off appearance by Bugatti- they entered a new mid-engined Grand Prix car (which was a novelty at the time, and only the second Grand Prix car ever to be designed this way after the 1930s Auto Unions) designed by renowned Italian engineer Colombo and driven by Maurice Trintignant, but the car was underpowered, overweight, and over-complicated, and it proved to be very difficult to drive; it retired early in the race. The 1958 race was marred by the fatal accident of Italian Luigi Musso, driving a works Ferrari, and it was also Fangio's last Formula One race. Hawthorn, who like many other F1 drivers at the time, held Fangio in very high regard; and was about to lap Fangio (driving in an outdated Maserati) on the last lap on the pit straight when he slowed down and let Fangio cross the line before him so the respected Argentine driver could complete the whole race distance. Hawthorn won, and Fangio finished fourth.\nRouen-Les-Essarts hosted the event in 1962 and 1964, and American Dan Gurney won both these events, one in a Porsche and another in a Brabham. In 1965 the race was held at the 5.1 mile Charade Circuit in the hills surrounding Michelin's hometown of Clermont-Ferrand in central France. Unlike the long straights that made up Reims and the fast curves that made up Rouen, Charade was known as a mini-N\u00fcrburgring and was twisty, undulating and very demanding. The short Bugatti Circuit at Le Mans held the race in 1967, but the circuit was not liked by the Formula One circus, and it never returned. Rouen-Les-Essarts hosted the event in 1968, and it was a disastrous event; Frenchman Jo Schlesser crashed and was killed at the very fast Six Fr\u00e8res corner in his burning Honda, and Formula One did not return to the public-road circuit. Charade hosted two more events, and then Formula One moved to the newly built, modern Circuit Paul Ricard on the French riviera for 1971. Paul Ricard Circuit, located in Le Castellet, just outside Marseille and not far from Monaco, was a new type of modern facility, much like Montlh\u00e9ry had been in the 1920s. It had run-off areas, a wide track and ample viewing areas for spectators. Charade hosted the event one last time in 1972; Formula One cars had become too fast for public road circuits; the circuit was littered with rocks and Austrian Helmut Marko was hit in the eye by a rock thrown up from Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi's Lotus which ended his racing career.\n\n\n==== Paul Ricard and Dijon-Prenois ====\n\nFormula One returned to Paul Ricard in 1973; the French Grand Prix was never run on public road circuits like Reims, Rouen and Charade ever again. Paul Ricard also had a driving school, the \u00c9cole de Pilotage Winfield, run by the Knight brothers and Simon Delatour, that honed the talents of people such as France's first (and so far only) Formula One World Champion Alain Prost, and Grand Prix winners Didier Pironi and Jacques Laffite. The event was run at the new fast, up-and-down Prenois circuit near Dijon in 1974, before returning to Ricard in 1975 and 1976. The race was originally scheduled to be run at Clermont-Ferrand for 1974 and 1975, but the circuit was deemed too dangerous for Formula One. The two venues alternated the venue until 1984, with Ricard getting the race in even-numbered years and Dijon in odd-numbered years (except 1983). 1977 saw a new part of the Dijon circuit built called the \"Parabolique\". This was done to increase lap times which had been very nearly below a minute in 1974, and the race featured a battle between American Mario Andretti and Briton John Watson; Andretti came out on top to win. Lotus teammates Andretti and Swede Ronnie Peterson dominated the race in 1978 with their dominant 79s, a car that dominated the field in a way not seen since the dominating Alfa Romeo and domineering Ferrari in the early 1950s. The 1979 race was another classic, with the famous end-of-race duel for second place between Frenchman Ren\u00e9 Arnoux in a 1.5-liter turbocharged V6 Renault and Canadian Gilles Villeneuve in a 3-liter Flat-12 Ferrari. It is considered to be one of the all-time great duels in motorsports, with Arnoux and Villeneuve banging wheels and cars around the fast Dijon circuit before Villeneuve came out on top. The race was won by Arnoux's French teammate Jean-Pierre Jabouille, which was the first race ever won by a Formula One car with a turbo-charged engine. 1980 saw rookie Prost qualify his slower McLaren seventh and Australian Alan Jones beat French Ligier drivers Laffite and Pironi on their home soil, and the 1981 race was the first of 51 victories by future 4-time world champion Prost; driving a Renault, the famed French marque won the next three French Grands Prix. The 1982 event at Ricard was a memorable one for France \u2013 it was a turbo-charged engine/French walkover and 4 French drivers finished in the top 4 positions \u2013 each of them driving a car with a turbo-charged engine. Renault driver Ren\u00e9 Arnoux won from his teammate Prost and Ferrari drivers Pironi and Patrick Tambay finished 3rd and 4th. But this French triumph was internally sour: Arnoux violated an agreement that if he was in front of Prost, he would let him by because Prost was better placed in the championship. Much to the chagrin of Prost and the French Renault team's management Arnoux did not do this, despite the management holding out pit boards ordering him to let Prost past. Prost won the next year at the same place, beating out Nelson Piquet in a Brabham with a turbocharged BMW engine; Piquet had led the previous year's race but retired with engine failure.\nDijon was last used in 1984, and by then turbo-charged engines were almost ubiquitous, save the Tyrrell team who were still using the Cosworth V8 engine. The international motorsports governing body at the time, FISA, had instituted a policy of long-term contracts with only one circuit per Grand Prix. The choice was between Dijon and Ricard \u2013 the small Prenois circuit had cars lapping in the 1 minute 1 second range, and Ricard was the main testing facility for Formula One at the time. So it was Ricard that was chosen, and it hosted the race from 1985\u20131990. From 1986 onwards Formula One used a shortened version of the circuit, after Elio de Angelis's fatal crash at the fast Verriere bends. De Angelis was not injured by the crash, however his car caught fire and there were no marshals to help him as it was a test session, and he died of smoke inhalation in hospital the next day. These two fast corners and the whole top section of the circuit was not used for the last five races. Prost won the final three races there, the 1988 one being a particularly dramatic win; he overtook his teammate Ayrton Senna at the Curbe de Signes at the end of the ultra fast Mistral Straight and held onto the lead all the way to the finish, and the 1990 (by which time turbo-charged engines had been banned) event was led for more than 60 laps by Italian Ivan Capelli and Brazilian Maur\u00edcio Gugelmin in underfunded, Adrian Newey designed Leyton-House cars \u2013 two cars that had failed to qualify at the previous event in Mexico. Prost, now driving for Ferrari after driving for McLaren from 1984\u20131989, made a late-race charge and passed Capelli to take the victory; Gugelmin had retired earlier.\n\n\n==== Magny-Cours ====\n\nIn 1991, the race moved to the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours, where it stayed for another 17 years. The move to Magny-Cours was an attempt to stimulate the economy of the area, but many within Formula One complained about the remote nature of the circuit. Highlights of Magny-Cours's time hosting the French Grand Prix include Prost's final of six wins on home soil in 1993, and Michael Schumacher's securing of the 2002 championship after only 11 races. The 2004 and 2005 races were in doubt because of financial problems and the addition of new circuits to the Formula One calendar. These races went ahead as planned, but it still had an uncertain future.\nIn 2007 it was announced by the FFSA, the race promoter, that the 2008 French Grand Prix was put on an indefinite \"pause\". This suspension was due to the financial situation of the circuit, known to be disliked by many in F1 due to the circuit's location. Then Bernie Ecclestone confirmed (at the time) that the 2007 French Grand Prix would be the last to be held at Magny-Cours. This turned out not to be true, because funding for the 2008 race was found, and this race at Magny-Cours was the last French Grand Prix for 10 years.\n\n\n=== Absence ===\nAfter various negotiations, the future of the race at Magny-Cours took another turn, with increased speculation that the 2008 French Grand Prix would return, with Ecclestone himself stating \"We're going to maybe resurrect it for a year, or something like that\". On 24 July, Ecclestone and the French Prime Minister met and agreed to possibly maintain the race at Magny Cours for 2008 and 2009. The change in fortune was completed on July, when the FIA published the 2008 calendar with a 2008 French Grand Prix scheduled at Magny-Cours once again. The 2009 race, however, was again cancelled on 15 October 2008, with the official website citing \"economic reasons\". A huge makeover of Magny-Cours (\"2.0\") was planned, but cancelled in the end. The race's promoter FFSA then started looking for an alternative host. There were five different proposals for a new circuit: in Rouen with 3 possible layouts: a street circuit, in the dock area, or a permanent circuit near the airport, a street circuit located near Disneyland Resort Paris, Versailles, and in Sarcelles (Val de France), but all were cancelled. A final location in Flins-Les Mureaux, near the Flins Renault Factory was being considered however that was cancelled as well on 1 December 2009. In 2010 and 2011, there was no French Grand Prix on the Formula 1 calendar, although the Circuit Paul Ricard candidated itself for 2012.10 French drivers have won the French Grand Prix; 7 before World War I and II and 3 during the Formula One championship. French driver Alain Prost won the race six times at three different circuits; however German driver Michael Schumacher has won eight times \u2013 the most anybody has ever won any Grand Prix. Mon\u00e9gasque driver Louis Chiron won it five times, and the Argentine driver Juan Manuel Fangio and British driver Nigel Mansell both won four times.\n\n\n=== Return to Paul Ricard ===\nIn December 2016, it was confirmed that the French Grand Prix would return in 2018 at the Circuit Paul Ricard and it currently holds a contract to host the French Grand Prix until at least 2022.\nIn an announcement to the nation on 13 April 2020, Emmanuel Macron, the French president, said that restrictions on public events as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic would continue until mid-July, putting the 2020 French Grand Prix, scheduled for 28 June, at risk of postponement. The race was later cancelled with no intention to reschedule for the 2020 championship.\n\n\n== Official names ==\n1950, 1952\u20131954, 1956\u20131962, 1965: Grand Prix de l'A.C.F.

        "wiki": "The H\u00f4tel de Caumont is a listed h\u00f4tel particulier in Aix-en-Provence.\n\n\n== Location ==\nIt is located at 1 rue Joseph Cabassol, in the Quartier Mazarin of Aix-en-Provence.\n\n\n== History ==\nIt was designed by architects Robert de Cotte (1656\u20131735) and Georges Vallon (1688-1767), and built from 1715 to 1742 for Fran\u00e7ois Rolland de R\u00e9auville de Tertulle, the Marquess of Cabannes. Sculptors Jean-Baptiste Rambot and Bernard Toro designed the atlas. Inside, the entrance has an indoor fountain, with two sets of stairs: one for the family, and another one for the staff.The hotel was inherited by Jean-Baptiste-Fran\u00e7ois de Tertulle, son of Fran\u00e7ois Rolland de R\u00e9auville de Tertulle. Upon his death, his widow sold it to Fran\u00e7ois de Bruny de la Tour d'Aigues (1690-1772). It was inherited by his son, the Marseilles shipowner Jean-Baptiste de Bruny de la Tour d'Aigues (1724-1794), who served as the Pr\u00e9sident \u00e0 mortier of the Parliament of Aix-en-Provence. He bequeathed it on to his son Marie Jean Joseph (1768-1800), who again passed it to his sister, Pauline de Bruny de la Tour d'Aigues (1767-1850), who had married Amable-Victor-Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois de Paule de Seytres de Caumont (1764-1841), the Marquess of Caumont, in 1796. He was accused of \"stealing the most beautiful h\u00f4tel particulier from Provence by this marriage,\" as a street sign outside the hotel suggests. The marriage was childless, and the hotel was bequeathed to one of Pauline's cousins.In 1964, General Isembart sold it to the city of Aix. They rented it out to La Poste, the postal service in France. From 1970 to 2013, it was home to a music school, the Conservatoire Darius Milhaud.It has been listed as a monument historique since 1990.\n\n\n== At present ==\nH\u00f4tel de Caumont was purchased in 2013 by Culturespaces for \u20ac10 million. Over the next two years it underwent extensive refurbishing, and reopened to the public on May 6th 2015, as a paid attraction and cultural space, exhibiting sections of the house and garden as they were in their prime, along with a gift shop, art exhibition space, and a small theater.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The current exhibition featuring Cezanne, Van Gogh, Picasso, etc is a must-do in Aix-en-Provence. The collection is a bit uneven, but there are some masterpieces. Staff was friendly and helpful. Location a bit difficult to find, but not unusual in the older villages in France.",
          "Local friends took me to see an exhibition and I have NEVER before loved every single painting on show. The building is a joy, and the curators are clearly real experts. Don't forget to take tea, and exit via the gift shop! \ud83d\ude01",
          "We were lucky to see an exhibition of paintings from the Guggenheim - really excellent and interesting too in learning about how Thannhauser had put together his collection. Worth a visit",
          "Since they appear to be international, I find it rather unexpected that there is no Dutch audio-guide. Nevertheless, the collection is impressive, the building very beautiful and the garden (almost) romantic.",
          "We ended up here for the Guggenheim exhibition (which was wonderful) but also discovered a gorgeous building with wonderful gardens and a Cafe that can only be accessed by ticket holders. Beautiful!",
          "My wife and I spent a morning at the Hotel de Caumont looking at the Thannhauser collection of the New York Guggenheim museum of impression and modern artists. Fantastic art from Van Gogh, Gauguin, Cezanne, Seurat, Manet, Picasso and other painters from the cubist and fauvism",
          "We were doing walking tour of Aix-en-provence and decided to stop in to the Hotel de Caumont - Art Centre. The museum featured art from the from the NY Guggenheim. There were works from Mamet, Picasso, Gauguin, Cezanne, Van Gogh, Matisse, Braque and even a few Bronzes by",

          "We spent a delightful few hours viewing this art exhibit on loan from the Guggenheim in NYC. They admit only 35 people at a time, so it is not too crowded at any given time. We took the English audio tour which was great at adding background info. Would recommend if you are",
          "Beautiful old building now an art museum, currently showing a temporary collection of impressionist paintings borrowed from the NY Gugenheim Museum. Nice formal gardens and cafe on site.",
          "This is clearly the classy end of Aix with no expense spared on restoring this mansion and turning it into a first rate exhibition space while retaining some period rooms. There is a cafe/restaurant and a good shop. the exhibition was from the Guggenheim and for as long as it it",
          "This is a fine building with an attractive small garden and what appears to be a good restaurant although we didn't try it. The great attraction for me was the Tannhauser collection from the Guggenheim. The collection includes works by Picasso, Cezanne, Monet, Rouault, Manet,",

          "We were so lucky to catch the travelling exhibition from the Guggenheim Museum with so many works of art of well known artists. It was from the Tannhauser collection and enabled us to admire works of Renoir, Monet, Cezanne, Gaugin, Rousseau, Picasso and more up close and with",
          "Lovely little museum in the middle of Aix-en-Provence. It is a beautifully preserved villa with lots of history attached. Unfortunately, when we were there, the special exhibition was closed, but we thoroughly enjoyed villa rooms and the 20 minute film about Cezanne and his life",
          "Attended for the Guggenheim Exhibition. We thoroughly enjoyed the mansion, restaurant and gardens. The exhibition was very good and staff very pleasant",
          "Great and well curated exhibition of early impressionists Fascinating provenance but also good size and not overwhelming",

          "Restored mansion in the heart of Aix. The building itself is worth the visit. We visited the Chagall exhibition: VERY interesting and well laid out.",
          "Like most Museums in Aix, Caumont is nice but it is not great. The Marc Chagall collection is the dominant part of the collection. It is lovely but, not going to impress most art lovers. The rest of the collection is un-impressive. The best part of the Museum is the property",
          "Beautifully renovated historic residence and gardens, houses a permanent film on Paul Cezanne (to see before visiting his workshop) and temporary exhibits and a caf\u00e9 restaurant with light fare in the lovely renovated historic salons. The Chagall exhibit brought together",
          "Regardless of what\u2019s showing in the Chaumont the house itself is an exquisite example of la belle vie and any visit should include lunch in its charming enclosed garden. Highly recommended.",
          "Chagall's iconography, which i know, but here it took me some time to get used to. And, even if the exhibition was very crowded, i got into it and was simply amazed and spent quite some time there. the fact to start from his black and white period then showing paintings more and",
          "Enjoyed the Chagall exhibit which shows his evolution in using color, and a lot of the scenery based work. The collection was well presented and documented. The Hotel de Caumont is a beautiful building too with 2 rooms illustrating how the owners lived in luxurious quarters.",
          "I really enjoyed the unique and unexpected Chagall Exhibition in Aix. incredible!!! Beautiful building. Nice tea room and sore too. Cute movie about Cezanne's life",
          "Great place with great cafe close to Mirabeau- definately worth a visit and stroll around the Mazarin area.",
          "We visited this museum and so happy we did. I have a limit of one museum a day when on vacation and usually run out of time due to issues with standing. This museum is in old Aix and well worth the time. I like Chagall and learned so much about his life and all the disciplines",
          "Old restored mansion in the Mazarin Quarter with temporary exhibitions. Nice to see how the well-heeled lived in 18th C.",
          "This museum is fascinating in that they will take over the entire facility for an exhibit. The current show on Marc Chagall is beautifully curated. Beyond the art work making this museum special are the building and grounds. The outdoor space with a small but lovely formal",
          "The last time I was here, this mansion was not open. What a delight to see a few rooms and the lovely small garden with its Dolphin fountain. There is a cafe in the building and a gift shop. There was no exhibition when I was there.",
          "You should definitely stop here while in Aix - they organize wonderful exhibitions and the building is very beautiful - worth a visit!",
          "As a gallery goes, this one is really good! If you like modern art, you can enjoy the bold and simple work of Nicolas de Stael. Brilliant! The gift shop sells quality gifts. The gardens are beautiful. (We heard from other visitors that the tea room was overpriced, but we did",

          "If you venture to Aix-en-Provence, you must stop in and visit Hotel de Caumont. It is not actually a hotel but an 18th century mansion that has been restored to its natural state, and is now open to the public. Upon entering, there is a wonderful gift shop on the left, and a",

          "the very colourful and close to abstract, but still figurative works of Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl really impressed me a lot .. however, I also liked the paintings with just pale blues and whites and the drawings with felt pen .. it was almost a bit too busy",

          "This is a wonderful building with an interesting history. When we visited last month, there was an exposition of the painter Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl. Like many artists his work is subjective and perhaps not to everyone's liking, but the wife and I found some of the pieces excellent.",
          "We visited the Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl exhibition (temporary) and had lunch in the beautiful caf\u00e9, in the garden. The exhibition premises and staging were perfect. The restauration work on the building is very impressive (see photographs of the process, works of art themselves). It's a",

          "Visited the place for Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl exhibition. Great exhibition with fantastic paintings in a very nice place.",

          "Lovely place to visit if you want to view Cezanne art and live. Watching a film on him is a must. Whilst the fact on the last painting before his death is doubtful, nevertheless an interesting movie. I also like the beautifully furnished cafe where you can pick the different",
          "A very pleasant outing to Hotel de Caumont - beautiful reproductions of rooms from times past as well as a brilliant exhibition of works by Nicolas de Stael. The gardens were beautiful and the restaurant looked charming - definitely worth remembering for a future visit.",
          "Was excited to see the mansion, but they only let you into two lovely rooms. Then, you want to see more but the rest is just art space. This exhibition was very boring, a few interesting pieces but mostly very meh. Staff in restaurant was very rude when we said we just wanted",
          "So lucky to have seen the perfect Nicolas de Sta\u00ebl exhibit in this idyllic setting. Wonderfully curated exhibition. And the rest of the house is a perfect, calm and a beautiful spot. The garden is fabulous; a peaceful and welcoming location. I didn't use the restaurant on this",

          "My brother and his wife were visiting me for the day and I decided it would be fun to go to the Sisley exhibition and have lunch. We managed, though it is a little challenging as you are not able to reserve a table. To eat in the museum cafe, you have to have purchased a",
          "Well worth a visit as the special exhibitions are top notch and there is a beautiful garden. The caf\u00e9 looks elegant although I didn't use it.",
          "Until October the museum is exhibiting 60 works of art by Alfred Sisley. A magnificent cross section of his works showing great depth. From Architectural paintings to his more famous landscapes. It covers his whole life really. I was blown away by it. If you love the",
          "I loved seeing the Sisley exhibit here, as well as the gardens and the original rooms of the owners. Sorry I missed the jazz evenings on Wednesdays, as I left Aix on Weds.",
          "They were having a Sisley exhibit when I was there which was good for me since I hadn't before seen such a breadth of his work. It's a smaller museum in a beautiful building that also has a garden and restaurant. Since the weather was warm and sunny I was glad this place allowed",
          "I've been for an Sisley exhibition (famous painter) that will end in October. It was just amazing inside, very beautiful house to see and to have a stop for a coffee or dinner. There is an amazing garden too that makes this place very peaceful.",
          "While we visited there was a great exhibition of Sisley. We enjoyed a nice apero in the jardin cafe. A really beautiful place to take a break from exploring old Aix.",
          "Yes, it's a lovely restored mansion. But at \u20ac14 per head, it's expensive for what it is. Compare, say, \u20ac6 each for the Picasso Museum at Antibes. Comedy moment when, having ushered us all to the door to make sure we had left well before closing at 7pm, the staff the forgot",
          "If the architecture, cafe, and garden is not enough to draw you in, Hotel de Caumont also puts on high quality art exhibitions which change periodically. Recommend!",
          "The building itself, restored very recently, is worth visiting. Add a superb Sisley exhibition and a good film on the life of Cezanne and it's well worth the entry fee.",
          "Went for the Sisly Exhibition. These people are experts at crowd management. Every room was was filled just right with perfect timing. No squeezing between people to get near the paintings and the security is total and discrete. Such a difference from most packed art shows.",
          "Always a pleasure to return here. #1 of places to visit in Aix. This time saw an exceptional Sisley exhibition - well curated.",
          "Renovated h\u00f4tel with cultural offerings. When I visited they showed photographs of Marilyn Monroe - sort of a \"life in pictures\".

          "Saw the recent Sisley exhibition here, wonderful collection of artwork, along with some resident sculptures. The building itself has been beautifully renovated with a cafe that over looks stunning gardens. I didn't have a chance to eat here though unfortunately.",
          "The Sisley exhibition was a revelation, and the town house that is itself the museum is quite interesting--we did not spare time for the permanent collection or the film on the life of Cezanne, which sounded (through the closed door) rather overwrought . I highly recommend the",
          "We live near Aix and visit this place often with friends. The exhibitions are excellent and the restaurants and gardens are beautiful. The salads at lunch time are unusual and delicious and it really is a wonderful setting summer and winter. The 30 minute film on Cezanne is",
          "We visited this beautifully renovated museum to view the Sisley exhibit and the film on Cezanne during our recent visit to Aix. It was well worrh it and the added plus was that it was cool and comfortable during an extreme heat wave. There is also a lovely tea room restaurant",
          "No reason to describe again that wonderfull Old hotel, which is in fact an old palace, right in downtown of Aix en Provence. Whatever the exibit could be (I've personnaly really enjoyed Turner' woks), the building itself must be discovered. Two for the price of one. But the",

          "I went to see the Sisley exhibition which was well worth going to. It was very interesting. I didn't realise when I went how lovely the house was. It was very beautiful and the garden was lovely and peaceful so I ended up sitting there for a long while. They also have a lovely",
          "There was a wonderful Sisley exhibition on at the place and it was just wonderful. I urge you to visit if you like Impression painting",
          "We visited this villa for the Sisley exhibition- a really good exhibition spread over 2 floors of the villa, and stayed for a coffee and some of their delicious desserts. We then came back at 7 pm to listen to jazz and have dinner in the garden - it is free entry in the evening,",
          "Wonderful collection of Sisley's impressionist paintings from galleries all around the world, brought together in an informative and visually stunning display. Thoroughly recommend it. Until 15th Oct 2017",
          "The building is beautiful and the Sisley exhibition was well displayed. Very informative in both French and English, Sisley's skies are wonderful and so interesting to see his many views at different times of the year. The gallery is well lit, the spaces are not overcrowded",

          "We walked a short distance from our rented apartment and were surprised how much was offered there. There were two beautifully refinished rooms with furniture from the 18th century; an exhibit with numerous works from the artist Alfred Sisley; an interesting movie about the life",
          "We went to see the Sisley exhibition in this beautiful old house. I thought the entry fee was a bit steep at 14 euros, but it does include a 30 minute video about Cezanne's life. However, check the showing times as I didn't leave myself enough time to see this and you can't nip",
          "Great exhibition in a wonderful, really well renovated French palace - a cultural highlight in Aix en Provence!!",
          "Very good exhibition to see beautiful arts of Sisley. You have to bring 1\u20ac if you bring backpack coz you have to put it in a cupboard. After visiting the museum, it was worth it to have lunch at the restaurant. So delicious !",
          "Recently renovated, it is a great space! Several period rooms richly restored, plus an indoor and outdoor cafe that is really lovely! An exhibition on the works of Sisely was on view: extremely well done: very extensive collection, great info on audio guide. Movie on life of",
          "A beautiful centre, well preserved building with a courtyard/garden cafe. The only negative comment I'll make is that they ask you to put your bags in a locker but you have to queue to get the change. On a busy day like the one we experienced it would take ages!! Overall worth",

          "I have 2 little ones, but I was given alone time so I could go marvel at some art, which I love to do - and recommend. Very nice atmosphere to this museum. I especially loved the stairwells and how each was different. It was nice that the museum was something to be in awe of in",
          "The Hotel de Caumont is, in a word, beautiful. Stately and elegant, restoration work on the building has been immaculate, with everything in sight done to the highest order. The interior rooms are as handsome as the exterior facade, from the entrance area to the Caumont's gift",
          "No one is likely to travel to Aix-en-Provence for the Sisley exhibit, but for those fortunate enough to be there this summer--don't miss it. Many paintings, well-displayed and, equally important, intelligently organized by the curators. Excellent audio guide. The Hotel worth",
          "What a fabulous collection of Sisleys beautifully displayed! Plenty of information in English and French. Great to see so many paintings from the same vantage at different times of year and in different light. We had lunch in one of the period rooms. Service was attentive",
          "This Art Centre is well worth a visit for both the impressive building and the stunning Sisley exhibition. Added bonuses are the small formal garden, the cafe and the film of Cezanne's life. Enjoy.",
          "The temporary Sisley exhibition is extraordinary! The explanations are also in English and add depth of understanding of Sisley, who is an underappreciated Inpressionist. The collection is varied and incredibly extensive and the range of Sisley's work is displayed. Particularly",
          "The Sisley exhibition is first rate. The selection of his works and the way in which the exhibition is curated really did make me look at the paintings afresh - it's been too easy to see Sisley as not quite in the same league as the well known Impressionist giants. Clearly I had",
          "We visited the Sisley exhibition on a warm summer day. We hesitated whether we should pay the steep entrance fee of \u20ac 14 pp, but we are glad we did. The museum had managed to bring together an outstanding collection of Sisley's impressionist paintings. The exhibition was well",
          "Wonderful current exhibition of Sisley paintings located within this grand and imposing townhouse. There is a busy cafe within the very pretty garden.",
          "Wonderfull restorated building with Sisley exhibition on three floors. A real pleasure to discover this impressionist pinter.",
          "The building restoration and photos of the work are lovely as are the grounds. The amount of art you get for the price, however, is underwhelming.",
          "The Sisley exhibition had just started, so if you are a fan of impressionist painting, you might enjoy it. We went for the beautifully decorated rooms, but there were only 2 and had to pay 14eu each to see the exhibition. Thought it would be a separate. So we were not so",
          "Visit the displays, see the Cezanne movie and stay for lunch. Delightful space, and relaxed visit. Worth the visit.",
          "Lovely evening at the Caumont Free jazz concert from May - September. Last Saturday, the singer wasn't that great. However the ambiance and the garden were splendid. Glass of ros\u00e9 \u20ac6.00. Bottle \u20ac25. The museum is nicely restored.",
          "I first discovered this place because I was interested in viewing the art of Cezanne - a thirty minute movie worth watching. As I left the theatre I explored the other buildings and discovered exquisite and fine interiors and immaculate garden close to a fine dining area.",
          "Nice building, nice architecture nice exposition with a good typical french desert; A real pleasure to discover the city;",
          "I was surprised that this is the number one museum to visit in Aix en Provence. We love visiting historical homes that are furnished in the period. However, there were only two rooms to view in this gorgeously restored mansion. Although the two rooms (the lady of the house's",
          "We were only allowed in two rooms and we couldn't see the famous movie. Receptionist was confusing to us and others in line. A simple sign would have made a bad situation a little better. We didn't get to go to the gardens either. Maybe 3 stars is too much",
          "The Hotel de Caumont is a new art center in a beautifully restored 18th Century mansion. It's best to check to see what they are featuring for special exhibition before you go. Its always interesting to see the private homes of super wealthy aristocracy. If you only go to enjoy",
          "This beautiful old house bears testament to Aix's past, with its lovingly-restored rooms and formal gardens. The short film about the life of Cezanne is engaging and informative, and the current exhibition of photographs of actress Marilyn Monroe well-presented. Our glasses of",
          "The Marilyn Monroe exhibit was quite interesting; however, I was disappointed at how few paintings by Paul Cezanne they had (I think I only saw one). After all, Paul Cezanne is a local hero. If you want to see his work, you have to go to the Granet Museum nearby. The cafe was",
          "It is worth the visit but not a special trip. The building is fabulous but the exhibitions don't quite live up to the hype",
          "This museum celebrates Cezzane and during our stay Marlyn Monroe. Don't miss seeing the movie about Cezzanes life. Also plan to go to lunch in the garden. Excellent service and food.",
          "Not just a museum, but a house of art. Worth visiting. The Marylyn Monroe expo was very interesting.",
          "We visited to see the restored historical rooms. Not worth it. If there is an exhibit on you must pay the full price because \"the exhibit is in the rooms so you can't see the rooms without seeing the exhibit.\" Not true! There were only two historical rooms and all the others",
          "It almost doesn't matter what exhibition happens to be running because the building and the gardens are worth the visit in any case. Certainly, the exhibitions can be uneven - I saw a wonderful Canaletto show there but was disappointed with the recent Marylin Monroe exhibit -",
          "Close to Aix's central axis, this is a residence of old aristocracy or merchant princes. The rooms are well-laid out, and home to a totally charming caf\u00e9 and restaurant. There is a focus on C\u00e9zanne, with a lovely video screening of his life story. The Centre's shop has",
          "This art center hosts exceptional exhibit. If the current showing strikes you, by all means you should go. For those exhibits we have attended, the artwork that is the hotel itself was always more alluring than the masterpieces hanging on the gallery walls. When you visit the",
          "Great place to have an exhibition. Saw a little of the old building with the grand furniture before going into the exhibition rooms. Was not busy but would say if it was there would be plenty of room for everyone.",
          "They have a few nicely appointed period room in a gorgeous building with a very nice little garden in the back. Would be a terrific place to eat in summer. We visited in winter, to see the Marilyn Monroe show. They put together a world-class show, featuring some newly released",
          "Went to see an exhibition Marilyn Monroe's in this old provincial private mansion. A taste of local history!",
          "An excellent way to spend a few hours. The Cezzane film was intersting and informative, my lovely husband slept through it tho' so maybe doesnt appeal to everyone. There was a Marilyn Munro exhibition on which was very well produced with many photos I'd never seen before and a",
          "When we visited there was a Marilyn Munro exposition which was very interesting. There was not a lot to see of the rooms but the gardens are quite enchanting. The Cezanne movie was very interesting and enlightening",
          "The December prior, the exhibit was the art collection of the ruling family on Liechtenstein. This time around, it was an exhibit about Marilyn Monroe. I guess they're trying to appeal to everybody.",

          "The Marilyn Monroe exhibition was on and we thought that would be interesting. It was and it was very well done. Exhibiting some of the last photographs taken of the star, they revealed an honesty and sensitivity. Additionally, a very good film of the artist Cezanne preceded",
          "The Marilyn photo exhibition is superb. The quality of the restoration of this old \"Hotel\" is wonderful and worth a visit in its own right with a beautiful courtyard garden. A great addition to the list of things to see in Aix.",

          "We visited the museum and were not hugely impressed. There is a very interesting movie about Cezanne which is the high point. The museum is very nicely renovated, with a lovely garden. The rooms open for viewing are nice. But for 8 Euros there wasn't much to see, and the",
          "Visited the Turner Exhibition then followed by an amazing lunch in the most beautiful location- could be inside in the beautiful period rooms or outside in a lovely courtyard. One of the most memorable treats of the holiday.",
          "This recently renovated Art Centre really is stunning. Each exhibition that we have been to since is opening May 2015 has been very well curated and the museum itself it beautiful. We have eaten a number of times in the restaurant and it has been constantly excellent. Service",
          "The museum with many of rooms furnished in it's period furniture and its art is a good visit as it enables one to view how some of the population lived. The Cafe is an excellent restaurant as is the service one receives.",
          "This beautifully renovated home is a sight to behold but the real star is the outdoor cafe. Situated above a sculpted garden, the space is lovely and tranquil. You'll certainly enjoy the terrific food in such a beautiful setting!",
          "The courtyard garden is one of the undiscovered gems of Aix. A most charming, secluded spot, right in the heart of the city! A grand old mansion, the rooms are lovely and really give you a sense of what it might have been like to live among the nobility of the era. Great gift",
          "Having visited the Turner wing at the Tate Gallery in London many times, I was pleased to find more information and insight into Turner's use of colour at this exhibition. This art centre has added a delightful new exhibition venue to the city of Aix, both the building and the",

          "Not only was the Turner show special, but the Caumont itself is a marvel: a full-house of splendid decorative arts. The garden/terrace is an unexpected treat. Light meals and drinks are available. Perhaps the staff is over-worked, short-handed, or just plain worn out after a",
          "We went to the recent Turner exhibition here, and were surprised by the lovely venue & gardens. They have done a superb renovation job and fashioned a gallery fit to show off the finest paintings. I would certainly recommend anyone visiting Aix to see what is showing, and you",
          "We recently stopped by the Caumont to visit the Turner exhibition which was well curated, very evocative and EXTREMELY busy. I do wish they would limit the numbers allowed entry at any one time... But that aside, the restoration of the Caumont is exquisite and well worth the",

          "Yes, I saw the Turner Exhibition. And I thought it sublime. But then I appreciated that this was a narrative of Turner's development and style rather than a blockbuster show of \"Greatest Hits\". It gave me a much greater understanding about his approach, his acquisition of",
          "This building is extremely beautiful. The gardens and the restaurant are really worth visiting. We enjoyed the Turner exhibition very much indeed, even though it was busy on Saturday,3rd September.",
          "This is a special building- renovated about ten years ago and a nice mid sized museum. We saw the Turner special exhibit and some ongoing ones as well. Very conveniently located in old town Aix",
          "Saw the Turner exhibition. The exhibition was a little inaccessible to non French speakers. The house and gardens were great. Found the staff a little rude and confronting.",
          "If you are looking to see Turner's major masterpieces, this is not the exhibit to visit. You will however find some lovely lesser known pieces that are truly lovely and thought provoking.",
          "Recently opened, after a major renovation,the Hotel de Caumont is a gem. There was an excellent, informative Turner exhibit, as well as an informative film about Cezanne's life. A surprise treat was a charming restaurant, both inside and in the garden under huge umbrellas. A",
          "Our French is very rudimentary but when I learned that English audio guides were available we perked up a bit and went to see the exhibit (Turner) and learn about his work. Upon arrival, we were quite deflated as all the signage/instruction was in French and no one was at the",

          "We attended the Turner exhibition, but left disappointed. The presentation and layout of an exhibition are important to the experience, and the Caumont is not up to the task. The 18th century mansion and grounds are impressive, but that does not mean it is appropriate as a",
          "Saw the Turner exhibition here. It was lovely, so very many Turners and so well curated, with a real narrative to the exhibition. It is a bonus that the building is so beautifully restored. The restaurant was very good too !",
          "Being a Turner fan, this was an essential visit when in Provence. The exibition is the worse lit I have ever experienced, it was too crowded and contained a majority of minor works too small to appreciate. The glory of Turner remains in London, unseen by a gullible public in",
          "The Hotel and the garden are very well rehabilitate and the art center showed us a awesome part of Turner's talents. The boutique is too expensive. The restaurant was too crowdy for us to try it.",
          "Having been on two occasions to view exhibitions in this extremely well and expensively converted palace, we would strongly recommend visiting to see not only the art works on display - we have seen both Turner and Canaletto there. The art is well presented in an environment",

          "The Caumont's exhibitions are a wonderful way to immerse yourself in a painter, an era, a collection. The curations are thoughtful and evocative. The current exhibition of William Turner follows his progress through his probation use of color. The Caumont is one of Aix's",
          "This beautiful 1710 building has been restored with impeccable detail. When we visited the Turner exhibition was on and we had to queue for 30 minutes to get in. Not cheap at 14 Euro each and no senior concession, but very well worth it. As my wife is a baroque musician, we",

          "Located near the city center at Mazarin Quarter, 5 minutes walk from Courts Mirabeau. Worth to visit if you have extra available couple hours. Nice and excellent preserved garden, very french, you feel yourself as you are in some of Chateau garden. Take a chance to make some",
          "We went to see the Turner exhibition and noticed the absolutely unbeliveable interior of the restaurant! Unfortunately the restaurant is only open to vistors of the Art centre (unless you pay for a special pass) during the day - but, at least in the summertime, it\u00b4s open for",
          "We were very surprised by the place itself. Only just renovated, it is well worth the detour. But especially so for Turner. Here you will see a vast number of watercolours and they give a great insight into the techniques, motivations and thought patterns of Turner.",
          "the renovated mansion is a delight, the cafe in the garden with white flowers is a must, the shop in its original woodwork offers interesting books and goods in the spirit of Provence and the TURNER exhibit is wonderful. as a fan of Turner, I learned a few things about his",
          "As an architect, the rooms were wonderful to see. I had a coffee in the garden and enjyed the Turner exhibit. It was my one museum treat in Aix. Enjoy.",
          "We went in the afternoon and was planning to see the Cezanne film after touring the museum. We did not realize the Cezanne film was 20 minuets long and the last viewing was at 4:20 on that particular day. The attendant did not speak much English and would not let us in at first.",
          "What a wonderful place to visit the house is amazing and at times there are private showings. When we went there was a turner exhibition. Make sure you see the garden it's beautiful. Have a coffee or a meal in a magnificent restaurant but can be expensive but worth the",

          "I've seen three exhibits here. All three have been excellently curated with an amazing sense of taste and knowledge. Don't hesitate to see whatever show is on. And, if you don't speak French fluently, I'd advise the audio tour to get the most from your visit.",

          "Visited the Turner and Colors exhibit (a temporary one) on a Sunday--well presented, educational, and some very moving images! The audioguide was definitely worth it, and the gardens deserve a visit as well.",
          "Aix en Provence has a new gem. Close to the cours Mirabeau, a building which has been superbly restored. And if you find inside (until Sept 18 2016) a superb collection of rarely-seen Turner watercolours, no more excuses. Go. Now. Well explained, didactical, well arranged, not",
          "Saw a good although brief exhibit on William Turner. Otherwise there wasn't much to this museum and a little overpriced. It was also very crowded on an early Saturday afternoon in July.",

          "It is one of the main attractions in Tianjin and quite unique. Worth the visit and the entry fee, but certainly not everyone style. Lots of old furniture inside displayed in some random way, but still worth to visit.",
          "It is worth the visit. There are some ancient prices of furniture and ceramics, and the place is full of interesting designs made from pieces of broken porcelain",
          "Passby the Porcelain House as we return from Riverside 66 Mall. The whole building and the walls ard all with porcelain. Unique hiuse. Very crowded and narrow road makes it more jam. The Italian Street is not too far and beside it are lines of shops.",
          "Really is a must when in Tianjin. Fee is 50 yuan. But come earlier because people start crowding from 9am. Very unique very beautiful building. One of modern treasures of China.",
          "A total waste of money and time. It looks ugly af and they do charge 50 RMB per ticket. It doesn\u2019t have anything impressive or as other said no historical or cultural value. It is purely made for cheap group tour. Do never come here!!",
          "An extremely and uniquely decorated building. It is likely the world\u2019s most luxurious \u201cPorcelain Building.\u201d Many types of porcelain were used in the decoration of the building.",
          "If you are a Chinese porcelain admirer you should come here during regular days and rather early. But if you come here during holidays or weekends then you are going to find massive queues and overcrowded museum. Took couple photographs of the exterior and left.",
          "I don\u2019t know where to start! Walking up to this place and you just want to say Wow! So much work has went into this place. It is a must see and takes about 45 minutes to an hour to enjoy once you purchase your ticket to enter. It is heavily guarded as well. Do yourself a favor",
          "It is an unique house with lots of porcelain. Situated in a busy road and lots of visitors. nice for photo taking and if you have time, just drop by. Not much to appreciate except for the porcelain structure.",
          "Fascinating collection of antiques and scrap pottery arranged and cemented in place. Colorful and imaginative. While its not Antoni Gaudi (whose work of art is in Barcelona ES) but sure has a lot of similarities.",

          "a lot of work done, but it did not talk to me, go visit if u want something different but not absolutely 'must go'",
          "My friends and I visited the Porcelain House during the golden week. However, it was flooded with people. We couldn\u2019t move much even outside the house. The house was cool as it is made of porcelain, even the stairs and the walls and the ceilings. The sad part is that we had to",
          "Such a odd house but worth a visit. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. I wish there was some history about it though. We might have missed the brochures but I don\u2019t think there were any.",
          "It\u2019s a really fun place to look around, but probably won\u2019t take you more than an hour. The inside has piles of antique wood furniture, but it seems more like storage than the furniture actually being displayed.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by this place. It is made up of seemingly countless shards of pottery and porcelain, and reflects a tremendous amount of creativity in its design and execution. The inside is filled with antique furniture, including a dresser/mirror of the last",
          "It was one of the most unusual places I have ever visited and well worth seeing. The tour can be done on your own. The antiques are beautiful and the artwork superb. The dragon that goes around the top is stunning. I loved this house. To see porcelain pieces put together in",
          "You don't need a guide for this. Tickets can be easily purchased and the house is easy enough to walk through on your own. There are some very interesting ceramic artwork and gorgeous antique furniture - most in need of restoration - littered every floor of the house. A nice",
          "Let me preface this review by saying that China House (porcelain house) seems to support a local charity that is worthy of funding, however exactly how is unclear in the English translations located in the house. Beyond any charitable purposes though, I would call this a rather",
          "It's an amaxing house inside and out, a fairly ordinary French style building has been reworked by 700,000 vases, bottles and plates being plastered onto the walls and ceilings. what I am told is the worlds longest longest Dragon stretching all the way around the building.",
          "This place will blow your mind! A year ago it was hardly known, now it does have Chinese tourists, but is still not overcrowded. I suspect it will get busier as it gets better known. The house is still a work in progress, in that the owner is still collecting the old pottery",
          "Porcelain House in Tianjin is also called China house. We enjoyed very much the visit and the guide. Very nice place and colorful.",
          "Really enjoyed our visit to this unique museum. We didn't go in but enjoyed everything from the street. It really reminded me of our visit to Barcelona many of the structure by Gaudi. Can't even imagine what all that porcelain would be worth if it wasn't set in concrete.",
          "The entrance fee is expensive for just a 3 storey house. I suggest you to just peek from outside. No matter which part of the house, it's just filled with with Chinese porcelain like line of vases or plates, or broken pieces of bowl. There are a few patterns on the wall or",
          "First time in Tianjin, went to this place right the way because my firend in China told me that i have to go. She said that it is the best place in Tianjin. After I got here, it was definitely worth to come.",
          "This place is actually really cool, you can tell how much time was put into this place to make it look so beautiful. There are not many places in the world that look like this, its a good mix of Chinese and European culture. Tianjin doesn\u2019t offer too many places to see as a",
          "This is a place made expressly for tourists with no historical or cultural value. A building with a fa\u00e7ade of bits of pottery and vases. Full of people. Don't waste your time or money. There are lots of other things to do in Tianjin.",
          "Firstly, ensure you have 30 RMB cash for entry per person. They do not take cards and we only got in because of generosity of a Chinese lady behind us !! The building is effectively 4 floors of an eclectic mix of furniture, paintings and chinaware where the whole building is",
          "Like many other 'historic places of interest' this has obviously been renovated reasonably recently and I can say with some certainty that I am older than many of the things in this museum. Normally in these places the gift shop is the only professionally run part. Even that",
          "Very interesting. Different. I actually think a crazy person build this. Haha. Have taken everyone who visits us in Tianjin, China to see this strange place.",
          "This place is amazing and nothing I had ever seen before. Worth the visit. The whole place is made from Porcelain pots. It is two stories high and all made from these. The guards outside were very serious and took their job with great pride. We really enjoyed it",
          "Went here as we were in Tianjin with an organised tour. Been from Europe most people had seen Gaudi's orginal in Barcelona. This is not as impressive but is still worth a look if your in the local area.",
          "We were walking in this neighborhood and did a detour to see the funky China House. We followed the Lonely Planet's advice and didn't pay to enter since the writer said it wasn't worth the 60 yuan ticket price. Outside it's a mass of joyfully tacky pottery embedded in cement",
          "we saw signs for this on the streets, so followed them...which was interesting in its own, when we eventually found it, it was so busy...went inside, think cost us 50yen..but was so worth it, quite an amazing place the way the porcelain is all done and formed into pictures and",
          "This place looks like a big house with lots of broken porcelain pieces stuck on it. I wouldn't go there again as it has not really much story behind it.",
          "I have never seen a house such as this one! So , Porcelain adorns the walls, bannisters, front of the house, etc. It has 4 floors, and there is a central stairwell you can look down and it is a pretty sight. All along the exterior, along the wrap-around balcony are pots of",
          "I will say this is a place that is neat to walk to while in Tianjin. This really is one of the top ten places to see while in Tianjin not only because of the house but because of the neighbourhood full of restaurants and local shops. For a small fee you can tour the house that",
          "This house is utterly absurd and a sight to behold \u2013 but there's no need to pay RMB 50 to go inside. There are some dusty old rooms with 'antique' furnture and little else. And don't expect any info on the 'why' or the 'how' of this place. However, I can safely that this is the",
          "A four-storey house with bits of porcelain stuck into every crevice, including - I believe - the longest porcelain 'dragon' in the world. Wow! It would have been a complete waste of half an hour of my life were it not for the fact that the house also contains a random collection",
          "I can't believe i entered that place on my own. one of the most horrific places to visit. everything is dusted, run-down and just ruined. looks like they are taking money, but doing nothing in order to keep this place clean or at least in a safe condition.",
          "This is quite a quirky little attraction in Tianjin. Not really worth seeking out but good to have a look of you stumble upon it. The whole house is made of pieces of porcelain so you can take some okay photos here.",
          "We Actually went in because we had time and we were attracted from outer view. You will be little disappointed. If u don't want time don't go.",
          "The house is actually not made of Porcelain as the name indicates but is actually stick to the house and the only thing to see is on the outside of the house and nothing much inside the house",
          "the exterior is composed of broken porcelain from different periods of chinese dynasties. according to the guide, lots and lots of ming dynasty porcelain was used to cover the surfaces. inside there is a plethora of furniture and other household items. all the pieces have a",
          "It is a must to see if you visit Tianjin. Architect is very unique. Great art work. All is made from porcelain. Entrance fee is 50 RMB and it really worth it.",
          "Interesting, but a bit of a tourist trap. Way too crowded. No explanations to anything. Piles of old furniture everywhere, not sure the purpose of it... Needs some maintenance, as it was unkept and dirty.",
          "a nice attraction on the way from ferry wheel to the city center for capturing subway, house is made of vase and other porcelain material attractive specially in the evening",
          "I really don't get why some reviews are so negative about the Porcelain House. To me you travel to see things you would never see elsewhere--and the Porcelain House is that!! It is crowded but it is totally fascinating to see a huge house completely covered in porcelain. To",
          "The Porcelain House was one of my must see in Tianjin and I was not disappointed. It is not beautiful, I may say it is ugly, but breathtaking at the same time. Be aware that it is a crowded place and as it is small it is sometimes quite uncomfortable. There are no information",
          "This building was decorated to simulate Gaudi's style of architecture. It was worth a visit but get an English speaking guide to explain the process and features.",
          "I had heard about the Porcelain House prior to travelling to Tianjin but I was totally amazed by the amount of porcelain that the owner used to build this unique structure.",
          "This is a weird and surreal experience. This place is swarming with Chinese tourists and there is almost no explanation of the displays in either Chinese or English. It is over-priced and a tourist trap.",
          "This was an unusual building,it was covered totally with broken Chinese China plates and jars. It is situated right in the middle of the busy town of Tianjin.it was very busy ,so was difficult to see inside the house for people .",
          "Both SF and P-Town have similar Bizarre houses. This one seamed over the top. We were not able to get inside the gate but there were plenty of openings to look inside.",
          "We visited the Porcelain House in Tianjin.It is a colonial house heavily decorated with vases, plates ,mosiac , ceramics and pieces of broken porcelain.They are on the walls , ceilings , cornices ,windows , staircases and hallways .In the exterior ,are similar pieces used on",
          "Very nice place to admire porcelain art. They actually have free tour gng ard the building to intro the various histories of the beautiful pieces.",
          "Ok so I stated the obvious, the entire structure is made of porcelain vases and I guess that on its own is unique and also a little crazy. Worthwhile if you have a bit of time to kill or you are after touristy souvenirs etc.",
          "We got there about 10.00am and it was already very busy being on the tour party visit agenda. Getting photos without people in the background or foreground is very difficult. Worth a visit though as it is unusual",
          "A very impressive work from a passionate man with a vision. This is so impressive and having recently returned from Gaudi-land - Barcelona, it was moving to see. We got a privileged understanding of the history of the house as we know the owner and his daughter. A beautiful",
          "The porcelain house is an interesting sight indeed, However the displays within the house are old and lack of proper maintenance. A couple of photos from the outside of the house would be sufficient.",
          "The house was built around 100 year's ago, but in 2002 the owner (Zhang Lianzh) bought 1 million RMB worth of pottery and used it to decorate the house. The result is a fusion of Gaudi's style but with many Chinese themesdyn. Quirky and fun, with lots of interesting details.",
          "Hmmmm not too sure wat to make of this but there were lots of people admiring this. A lot of meticulous work to achieve this piece of Art. Not my thing though although other people into my party enjoyed this trip.",
          "The porcelain house is quite impressive from the outside as it is covered in porcelain and roofs are made of porcelain vase. However, it is not worth it to pay the 35 RMB fee to get inside. The inside is basically an old house with old furniture everywhere. It has four floors,",
          "This was quite impressive but you can walk it fairly quickly so don't allot too much time for this attraction.",
          "As someone lived in Tianjin for 20 odd years. This is one of a few places I would recommend. I have to say, this porcelain house has nothing about Tianjin but just something stands out in Tianjin.",
          "Decided to go into the house. What a disappointment, Chinese furniture stored in the house and literally dumped anywhere. Nothing more to see than you do from the street. Could be a great attraction!",
          "In essence this is a house made of Porcelain, there is not much to do except just look at the outside and explore the three floors on the inside. When I went there were too many people to move around at a slow pace and this everything was seen quickly, I think you would not",
          "I just saw the outside of the house, it's beautiful. I didn't want to enter because the visitors need to pay.",
          "Touted as a must see when one is in TianJin we were here to see how \u201cunique\u201d is the Porcelain House\u2026 From the outside it looks weird yet amazing. The entire 4 storey house is covered in porcelain pieces of bowls, vase, etc - from the outside to even designs on the walls inside.",
          "It is located in a business district. easy to find because there are many tour buses outside. It is excited to see such an interesting, creative giant architecture. There are many interesting details on the exterior of the houses. One can see some little dishes, little lions,",
          "This is simply awesome. The building is very unique and a different type of construction. The inside and the nearby space are very clean. To visit this place you should need to purchase the ticket from the counter. The building consists a lot of antique furniture. The",
          "From the outside it looks weird and invites you over to come in. When you are in there, you go crazy. Its amazing what they have done there, I was in shock. Its something you really have to see. Make sure you make your wish from the top floor.",
          "Didn't have the chance to go inside but definitely a worthwhile visit when around in the shopping district. Reminded me of the gaudi style in Barcelona. I was told by an ex colleague that Bill Gates wanted to buy it but wasn't allowed.",
          "The entire 3 storey house os covered in porcelain pieces of bowls, vase, etc. from the outside to even designs on the walls inside. 30 RMB to enter. Nice antique furniture. If you like learning about culture and history, visit this place.",
          "We didn't actually pay to enter this building, just viewed from the outside - it was one of those places that you just gotta see!!!",
          "...and incredible! Zhang Lianzhi, a 50-year-old porcelain collector from Tianjin, China, has spent four years decorating an old house with hundreds of millions of ancient porcelain fragments and tons of natural crystals. It\u2019s now known as the Porcelain House or Yuebao House.",
          "We stumbled on this by accident. It was interesting to walk around. Some more info in other languages would have been nice but an enjoyable 30 minutes or so none the less.",
          "This place is beautiful and definitely worth a visit. You can see the facade from the street which is really the best part, but seeing it up close gives a nice perspective of the broken vases and cups used. There is more to see on the inside so worth going in.",
          "It is not often to see these kind of house, so it is a nice experience to me.. The places is full made of porcelain and standing out among the other houses.. The entrance fee is about 40 yuan, you can get a half price if you are student who study in china.. Inside of the house",
          "If you like Watts Towers in Los Angeles, then you will like the Porcelain House in Tianjin. On the exterior, the house is classed with whole vases and, around doors and windows, with porcelain pieces. The interior has porcelain mosaics on the walls and plenty of old furniture",
          "There happened to be a free guided tour (in Mandarin), when I entered the museum, so I took the tour. The guide explained the history of the place and the significance of the porcelain. It was very interesting. The porcelain used are mostly antiques from various dynasties. The",
          "The house is a very interesting piece with walls, sculptures, stairs and wall murals made of broken pieces of porcelain. There are intact vases making up door frames and roof tiles. It's worth a visit if you're in the area.",
          "I was looking forward to the visit as I saw it on a tourist tv programme previously and thought it was unusual. The house is within the Five Avenue. It looked okay from a distant. Once you went close to it, it was just a house plastered with cheap vases, plates, pots and broken",
          "The building was wonderful, big with so many great things, the ceiling, walls and floor are made of beautiful hand made ceramic. Entry ticket price was reasonable and affordable for everybody, really I liked it and I recommended for everybody",
          "I didn't pay and go inside the museum but it's definitely worth seeing from the outside, it's also not difficult to find if you have a map, tripadvisor provides the address, just follow down that street and you can't miss it, only round the corner from the main shopping street",
          "Beware of the location! The House is not easy to find, and there are no signs showing the direction to it.",
          "Although a little crowded in peak season, this House is a wonderful photo opportunity and the more you look, the more you discover in the porcelain pieces that have been crafted imto amazing shapes.",
          "this place was beyond beautiful, it was breathtaking, definitely you must visit this place, it was so nice to see is made of porcelain pieces and vases, impressive",
          "it was a building with an interesting idea: decorated with porcelain and filled with antiques. But there was a feeling of being rushed through it and cramped full of what seemed like random antiques.",
          "If you come to Tianjin, you need to pass by, very nice to see. And you can throw a coin and make a wish in theiddle of the house.",
          "I was visiting this place and I can see it was not so great at the people told me. Just impressive the view from outside. I hope the ceramic is not really antic!",
          "This venue is near the shopping street hidden in the back. Great place to take picture cause the building is amazing. We took a lot of pictures there.",

It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted the East Asian Games, which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as \"National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area\". In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a major fire and explosion accident occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTianjin is located along the west coast of the Bohai Gulf, looking out to the provinces Shandong and Liaoning across those waters, bordered by Beijing 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border,  the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). There is 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. It lies at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the Yan Mountains intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak (\u4e5d\u9876\u5c71) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft).\nThe Hai River forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the Ziya River (\u5b50\u7259\u6cb3), Daqing River (\u5927\u6e05\u6cb3), Yongding River, North Grand Canal, and South Grand Canal, and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in Tanggu District. Major reservoirs include the Beidagang Reservoir in the extreme south (in Dagang District) and the Yuqiao Reservoir in the extreme north in Ji County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTianjin has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSk bordering on Dwa). It has a four-season, monsoon-influenced climate, typical of East Asia, with cold, windy, very dry winters reflecting the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone, and hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon. Spring in the city is dry and windy, occasionally seeing sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert, capable of lasting for several days. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from \u22123.4 \u00b0C (25.9 \u00b0F) in January to 26.8 \u00b0C (80.2 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.9 \u00b0C (55.2 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 48% in July to 61% in October, the city receives 2,522 hours of bright sunshine annually. Having a low annual total precipitation of 511 millimeters (20.1 in), and nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid zone, with parts of the municipality being humid continental (K\u00f6ppen BSk/Dwa, respectively).Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221222.9 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F) to 40.5 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Measures to improve air quality ===\nIn May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels. These measures included several restrictions on days of severe pollution; halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities.\n\nForeign-born professional sportsmen have made statements regarding Tianjin's air quality, citing it as an impediment to athletic activity and being thick enough to \"taste\".\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nTianjin is divided into 16 county-level divisions, which are all districts.\n\nIn addition, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) is not a formal level of administration, but nevertheless enjoys rights similar to a regular district. At the end of 2017, the total population of Tianjin is 15.57 million.[3]\n\nThese districts and counties are further subdivided, as of December 31, 2004, into 240 township-level divisions, including 120 towns, 18 townships, 2 ethnic townships and 100 subdistricts.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Tianjin is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in the mainland China.\nThe Mayor of Tianjin is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Tianjin. Since Tianjin is a municipality, the Communist Party of China Municipal Committee Secretary is colloquially termed the \"Tianjin CPC Party chief\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTianjin's GDP reached 1.572 trillion yuan in 2014, an increase of 10.0 percent over 2013. The city of Tianjin recorded China's highest per-capita GDP with $17,126, followed by Beijing with $16,278 and Shanghai with $15,847.\n\nMajor industries include petrochemical industries, textiles, car manufacturing, mechanical industries, and metalworking. EADS Airbus is an important manufacturer, and has opened an assembly plant for its Airbus A320 series airliners, operational since 2009. Tianjin also hit the news in 2010, as the current fastest supercomputer in the world, Tianhe-1A, is located at the National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin. GDP in 2009 hit \uffe5750.1 billion, with a per capita of RMB\uffe562,403.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area ===\n\nAs one of the first state-level economic and technological development zones, Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) was founded on December 6, 1984, with the approval of the State Council. It enjoys relevant state preferential policies with the major task of attracting domestic and foreign investment to develop high and new technology oriented modern industries. As an affiliated organ of the Tianjin Municipal Government, the Administrative Commission of Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area exercises unified administration of TEDA on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal Government and enjoys provincial-level administrative and economic management rights.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Export Processing Zone ===\nTianjin Export Processing Zone is one of the first 15 export processing zones approved by the State Council on April 27, 2000. This is a special enclosed zone where the Customs conduct 24-hour administration on commodities transported into and out of the zone and relevant places. The central government granted this special economic zone special preferential policies to attract enterprises in the business of processing and trade to invest in the zone. Tianjin Export Processing Zone is located to the northeast of TEDA with a planned area of 2.54 km2 (0.98 sq mi). The area developed in the first phase is 1 m2. A permanent wall is built to separate export processing zone and non-export processing zone.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Airport Economic Area ===\nTianjin Airport International Logistics Zone is jointly invested by Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone and Tianjin Binhai International Airport. It is located inside the airfreight area of Tianjin Binhai International Airport. It has domestic and foreign excellent airfreight logistics enterprises engaged in sorting, warehousing, distribution, processing, exhibition. It is in the process of constructing the largest airfreight base in northern China.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone ===\n Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone is the largest free trade zone in northern China as well as the only free trade zone in northern China. The zone was approved to be established in 1991 by State Council. It is 30 km (19 mi) from Tianjin city proper, less than 1 km (0.62 mi) away from the wharf and only 38 km (24 mi) away from Tianjin Binhai International Airport.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Tanggu National Marine High-Tech Development Area ===\nTianjin Tanggu Marine High-Tech Development Area was established in 1992, and was upgraded to the national-level high-tech development area by the State Council in 1995, it is the only national-level high-tech development area specializing in developing the marine Hi-Tech industry. By the end of 2008, the zone has 2068 corporations and has 5 industries there including new materials, oil manufacturing, modern machinery manufacturing, and electronic information.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Nangang Industrial Zone ===\nA heavy and chemical industry base and harbor; an important part of the \"dual-city, dual-harbor\"space development strategy of Tianjin, a demonstration zone of circular economy. The total planned area of Nangang Industrial Zone is 200 km2 (77 sq mi), of which the terrestrial area is 162 km2 (63 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nFarmland takes up about 40% of Tianjin Municipality's total area. Wheat, rice, and maize are the most important crops. Fishing is important along the coast.\n\n\n=== Resources ===\nTianjin Municipality also has deposits of about 1 billion tonnes of petroleum, with Dagang District containing important oilfields. Salt production is also important, with Changlu Yanqu being one of China's most important salt production areas. Geothermal energy is another resource of Tianjin. Deposits of manganese and boron under Tianjin were the first to be found in China.\n\n\n=== Binhai New Area ===\nTianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) is located in the juncture of the Beijing-Tianjin City Belt and the Circum-Bohai City Belt. It is the gateway to North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Lying in the center of Northeast Asia, it is the nearest point of departure of the Eurasian Continental Bridge.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the end of 2009, the population of Tianjin Municipality was 12.28 million, of which 9.8 million were residential holders of Tianjin hukou (permanent residence). Among Tianjin permanent residents, 5.99 million were urban, and 3.81 million were rural.  Tianjin has recently shifted to rapid population growth, its population has reached 14.72 million as of 2013 end.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 15.4 million.The majority of Tianjin residents are Han Chinese. There are also 51 out of the 55 minor Chinese ethnic groups living in Tianjin. Major minorities include Hui, Koreans, Manchus, and Mongols.\n\nThis excludes members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n\n== Media ==\nTianjin People's Broadcasting Station is the major radio station in Tianjin. Broadcasting in nine channels, it serves most of North China, part of East and Northeast China, reaching an audience of over 100 million. Tianjin Television, the local television station, broadcasts on nine channels. It also boasts a paid digital channel, featuring home improvement programs. Both the radio and television stations are now branches of the Tianjin Film, Radio and Television Group, established in October 2002.Major local newspapers include the Tianjin Daily and Jin Wan Bao (literally, tonight newspaper), which are the flagship papers of Tianjin Daily Newspaper Group and Jinwan Mass Media Group, respectively. There are also three English-language magazines: Jin, Tianjin Plus and Business Tianjin, mostly directed at ex-pats resident in the city.\n\n\n=== Previous newspapers ===\nThe first German newspaper in northern China, Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, was published in Tianjin.In 1912 Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and 5 daily newspapers in other languages; none of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers. Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News). Newspapers from Beijing published in Tianjin included Pei Ching Jih Pao, Peking Daily News, and Le Journal de Peking.In 1930, the newspaper Deutsch-Mandschurische Nachrichten moved from Harbin to Tianjin and changed its name to the Deutsch-Chinesische Nachrichten.\n\n\n=== Censorship capital ===\nMore and more, China's leading Internet information providers (usually located in Beijing), including social network Sina Weibo, Douban and the online video website Sohu, tend to relocate their censorship departments to Tianjin, where labor costs are cheaper than Beijing, as censorship is a kind of labor-intensive work. In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived. Despite its proximity to Beijing, the Tianjin dialect sounds quite different from the Beijing dialect, which provides the basis for Putonghua or Standard Chinese.\nTianjin is a respected home base of Beijing opera, one of the most prestigious forms of Chinese opera.\n\nTianjin is famous for its stand-up comedy and comedians including Guo Degang and Ma Sanli. Ma Sanli (1914\u20132003), an ethnic Hui and longtime resident of Tianjin, is renowned for his xiangsheng, a hugely popular form of Chinese entertainment akin to comedy. Ma Sanli delivered some of his xiangsheng in the Tianjin dialect. Tianjin, along with Beijing, is a center for the art of xiangsheng. Tianjin's style of stand-up also includes the use of rhythmic bamboo clappers, kuaiban.Yangliuqing (Green Willows), a town about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Tianjin's urban area and the seat of Xiqing District, is famous for its popular Chinese New Year-themed, traditional-style, colorful wash paintings (\u6768\u67f3\u9752\u5e74\u753b). Tianjin is also famous for the Zhang clay figurine, a type of intricate, colorful figurine depicting a variety of vivid characters, and Tianjin's Wei's kites, which can be folded to a fraction of their full sizes and are noted for portability.\nOn September 28, 2015, the Juilliard School in Manhattan, New York City announced a major expansion into Tianjin during a visit by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan, the institution's first such full-scale foray outside the United States, with plans to offer a master's degree program.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nTianjin cuisine places a heavy focus on seafood, due to Tianjin's proximity to the sea.  It can be further classified into several varieties, including the rough (Chinese: \u7c97; pinyin: c\u016b), smooth (simplified Chinese: \u7ec6; traditional Chinese: \u7d30; pinyin: x\u00ec), and high (Chinese: \u9ad8; pinyin: g\u0101o). Prominent menus include the Eight Great Bowls (Chinese: \u516b\u5927\u7897; pinyin: B\u0101d\u00e0 w\u01cen), a combination of eight mainly meat dishes, and the Four Great Stews (Chinese: \u56db\u5927\u6252; pinyin: s\u00ec d\u00e0 b\u0101), actually referring to a very large number of stews, including chicken, duck, seafood, beef, and mutton.\nThe four delicacies of Tianjin include Goubuli baozi, Guifaxiang Shibajie Mahua (Chinese: \u5341\u516b\u8857\u9ebb\u82b1; pinyin: sh\u00edb\u0101 ji\u0113 m\u00e1hu\u0101), Erduoyan Zhagao (Chinese: \u8033\u6735\u773c\u70b8\u7cd5; pinyin: erduoy\u01cen zh\u00e0 g\u0101o) and Maobuwen Jiaozi (Chinese: \u732b\u4e0d\u95fb\u997a\u5b50; pinyin: m\u0101o b\u00f9 w\u00e9n ji\u01ceozi). Well-known foods include Caoji donkey meat, Bazhen sheep-leg mutton of Guanshengyuan, Luji Tangmian Zhagao, Baiji Shuijiao, Gaogan of Zhilanzhai, Guobacai of Dafulai, Subao of Shitoumenkan and Xiaobao chestnut. These famous snacks are available in Nanshi Food Street, which was a famous calling-card of Tianjin in the aspect of cuisine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nTianjin Binhai International Airport is located in Dongli District roughly 13 km (8 mi) away from downtown area. The city will also be served by the new Beijing Daxing International Airport in Beijing, currently under construction and to be completed by late 2019.Tianjin Binhai International Airport now has a terminal building which covers an area of 25,000 m2 (269,000 sq ft), a merchandise warehouse which covers an area of 29,500 m2 (318,000 sq ft) and runways measuring 3.6 km (2.2 mi) in total. It has a grade 4E airstrip, which all kinds of large aircraft can take off from and land safely on. Tianjin Binhai International Airport has 59 flight routes, connecting 48 cities, including 30 domestic cities and 17 foreign cities. Airline companies like Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Korean Air, Asiana Airlines, Singapore Airlines Cargo and Martinair Holland all have flights to Tianjin Binhai International Airport.\n\n\n=== Port of Tianjin ===\n\nTianjin port is the world's top-level and China's largest artificial deep water harbor, and the throughput capacity ranks fifth in the world. Located in Binhai Economic Zone, a national new economic zone of China, Tianjin harbor is the port of call of international cruises visiting the wider area, including Beijing.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTianjin's harbor area of Binhai/TEDA has a modern, high speed rubber tired tram system, which is the first of its kind in China and Asia. Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.  Construction work on Line 2 and Line 3 was completed in 2012 and the two lines are now in operation. Several new metro lines are planned.\nThere was two rapid transit operators in Tianjin. In 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation.\n\nTianjin Metro General Corporation, operates Lines 1, 2, 3 and 6\nTianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company, operates Lines 5 and 9\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThere are several railway stations in the city, Tianjin railway station being the principal one. It was built in 1888. The station was initially located at Wangdaozhuang (simplified Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u5e84; traditional Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u838a; pinyin: W\u00e0ngd\u00e0ozhu\u0101ng). The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility and as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project involving Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9 as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-speed rail.\nTianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also major railway stations in Tianjin. There is also Tanggu railway station is located in the important port area of Tanggu District, and Binhai railway station and Binhai North railway station located in TEDA, to the north of Tanggu. There are several other railway stations in the city that do not handle passenger traffic. Construction on a Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail began on July 4, 2005 and was completed by August 2008.\nThe following rail lines go through Tianjin:\n\nJingshan Railway, from Beijing to Shanhai Pass\nJinpu Railway, from Tianjin to Pukou District, Nanjing\nJinji Railway, from Tianjin urban area to Ji County, Tianjin\nJinba Railway, from Tianjin to Bazhou, Hebei\nThe inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system: Cxxxx (C stands for interCity).

The ticket price as of Aug 15, 08 is 69 RMB for the first-class seat and 58 RMB for the second-class seat.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThere were over 900 bus lines in the city as of 2005.\n\n\n=== Roads and expressways ===\nSome roads and bridges have retained names that hark back to the Republic of China era (1912\u20131949) such as Minquan Gate and Beiyang Road. Like with most cities in China, many roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four cardinal directions.\nTianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is the closest thing to a highway-level ring road, although traffic is often chaotic.\n\nInner Ring Road (neihuan)\nMiddle Ring Road (zhonghuan)\nOuter Ring Road (waihuan)Tianjin's roads often finish in dao (Chinese: \u9053; lit.: 'avenue'), xian (simplified Chinese: \u7ebf; traditional Chinese: \u7dda; lit.: 'line'). These are most often used for highways and through routes. The terms lu (Chinese: \u8def; lit.: 'road'). Jie (Chinese: \u8857; lit.: 'street') are rare. As Tianjin's roads are rarely in a cardinal compass direction, jing (simplified Chinese: \u7ecf; traditional Chinese: \u7d93; lit.: 'avenue') roads and wei (simplified Chinese: \u7eac; traditional Chinese: \u7def; lit.: 'avenue') roads often appear, which attempt to run more directly north\u2013south and east\u2013west, respectively.\nThe following seven expressways of China run in or through Tianjin:\n\nJingjintang Expressway, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District / TEDA\nJinghu Expressway, from Jinjing Gonglu Bridge to Shanghai (together with Jingjintang Expressway, this is the expressway from Beijing to Shanghai)\nJingshen Expressway, through Baodi District on its way from Beijing to Shenyang\nTangjin Expressway, from Tanggu District, Tianjin, to Tangshan, Hebei\u2014known in Tianjin as the Jintang Expressway\nBaojin Expressway, from Beichen District, Tianjin, to Baoding, Hebei\u2014known in Tianjin as the Jinbao Expressway\nJinbin Expressway, from Zhangguizhuang Bridge to Hujiayuan Bridge, both within Tianjin\nJinji Expressway, from central Tianjin to Jixian CountyThe following six China National Highways pass through Tianjin:\n\nChina National Highway 102, through Ji County, Tianjin on its way from Beijing to Harbin\nChina National Highway 103, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District\nChina National Highway 104, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Fuzhou\nChina National Highway 105, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Macau\nChina National Highway 112, circular highway around Beijing, passes through Tianjin Municipality\nChina National Highway 205, from Shanhaiguan, Hebei, through Tianjin Municipality, to Guangzhou\n\n\n== Religion ==\nResidents of Tianjin participate in indigenous religions, such as the veneration of the goddess Mazu. In addition, Tianjin has a Buddhist Temple of Great Compassion, a Catholic St. Joseph's Cathedral (Laoxikai Church), a Catholic Our Lady of Victory Church (Wanghailou Church). A Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin exists. According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 1.51% of the city's population. Tianjin has been described as a historically \"strong center\" of Islam in China. Northwestern Tianjin is traditionally the location of the Muslim quarter of the city, where they have lived for centuries near the city's huge Great Mosque, Qingzhen si, founded in 1703. Other mosques include the Dahuoxiang Mosque.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nSports teams based in Tianjin include:\nChinese Super League\n\nTianjin TEDA F.C.\nTianjin Tianhai F.C.

Many past and present masters of arts such as Bajiquan, Pigua Zhang, Xing Yi Quan, Bagua Zhang and others lived or are living in the city. The districts most famous for martial arts in the city are Hong Qiao and Nankai, and martial artists abound in public green spaces such as Xigu Park and the Tianjin Water Park.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nUnder the National Ministry of Education:\n\nNankai University (founded 1919, one of the most prestigious universities in China)\nTianjin University (founded 1895, oldest university in China)Under the municipal government:\n\nTianjin Academy of Fine Arts\nTianjin Agricultural College\nTianjin Chengjian University\nTianjin Conservatory of Music\nTianjin Foreign Studies University\nTianjin Institute of Physical Education\nTianjin Medical University\nTianjin Normal University\nTianjin Polytechnic University\nTianjin University of Commerce\nTianjin University of Finance & Economics\nTianjin University of Science & Technology\nTianjin University of Technology\nTianjin University of Technology and Education\nTianjin University of Traditional Chinese MedicineUnder the national Civil Aviation Authority:\n\nCivil Aviation University of ChinaUnder the government of Hebei Province:\n\nHebei University of Technology (founded 1903, the earliest institute of technology in China)Foreign institutions:\n\nThe Florida International University Tianjin Center, opened in 2006 as a cooperative venture between the municipal government and the Miami-based university.\nThe Great Wall MBA Program Oklahoma City University Meinders School of Business, established in 1986 on the campus of Tianjin University of Finance & Economics.\nRaffles Design Institute Tianjin is a joint-project between Tianjin University of Commerce, Boustead College and Raffles Design Institute, Singapore.Private:\n\nBoustead CollegeNote: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== High schools ===\n\nTianjin Nankai High School (\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nTianjin No.21 High School (\u5929\u6d25\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e00\u4e2d\u5b78): Tianjin No. 21 High School, formerly Fahan College (\u6cd5\u6f22\u5b78\u5802; 'French\u2013Chinese (language) College'), was founded in 1895.

        "wiki": "Binhai, officially known as Binhai New Area (simplified Chinese: \u6ee8\u6d77\u65b0\u533a; traditional Chinese: \u6ff1\u6d77\u65b0\u5340; pinyin: B\u012bnh\u01cei X\u012bn Q\u016b), is a sub-provincial district and state-level new area within the jurisdiction of Tianjin Municipality in the People's Republic of China.\nBinhai is intended to replicate development seen in Shenzhen and Pudong in Shanghai.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nBinhai is located on the west coast of the Bohai Sea and east of Tianjin's main urban area. It is a part of the Bohai Economic Rim. It has an area of 3,000 km2 (1,200 sq mi), a coastline of 153 km (95 mi), and contains 700 km2 (270 sq mi) of water and wetlands.\n\n\n=== Natural resources ===\nBinhai New Area has 700 square kilometers (270 sq mi) of water and wetlands and a further 1,200 km2 (460 sq mi) of wasteland that is being re-developed into saline land. It has proven oil resources totalling more than 100 million tons, and 193.7 billion cubic meters (6.84 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\nThere are 19 subdistricts and 7 towns in the district:\n\nDefunct\nNow part of Tanggu: Yujiapu Subdistrict, Xingang Subdistrict, Xincun Subdistrict north\nNow part of Hangzhou Street: Xiangyang Subdistrict\nNow part of Dagu: Bohaishiyou Subdistrict, Xincun Subdistrict south\nNow part of Hangu: Datian town\nNow part of Chadian: Hexi Subdistrict\nNow part of Dagang: Yingbin Subdistrict, Shengli Subdistrict\nNow part of Haibin: Gangxi Subdistrict\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Binhai district was created by the government of China in the 1990s. In 1996 Soviet aircraft carrier Kiev was sold to Binhai Aircraft Park, a theme park in Binhai. The concept was developed by world tourism and attraction consultant Leisure Quest International.In August 2011, the ex-Kiev was developed into a luxury hotel after renovations costing \u00a39.6 million.Starting from November 2009, Binhai New Area was consolidated into a district, and the former subordinate districts of Tanggu, Hangu and Dagang were abolished. Binhai New Area consists of nine functional zones: Advanced Manufacturing Zone, Airport-based Industrial Zone, Binhai High-tech Industrial Development Zone, Seaport-based Industrial Zone, Nangang Industrial Zone, Seaport Logistics Zone, Coastal Leisure & Tourism Zone, Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City and the Yujiapu Financial District. In addition, Tianjin Port whose throughput ranks 5th in the world is also located here.The Binhai district was greatly affected by a large industrial-scale accident in August 2015. On August 12, a series of explosions took place at a port chemical storage facility in Binhai, causing 173 deaths and 797 injuries. The blast had the equivalent of 21 metric tons of TNT or a magnitude-2.9 earthquake, according to the China Earthquake Networks Center. Eight other people remain missing.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nYujiapu Financial District located in Binhai is an under construction financial district with a glitzy skyline envisioned to be a center of world trade and finance. Other parts of Binhai have also been intended to be a base for China's advanced industrial and financial reform and innovation. The Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) is an early free trade zone.\nTianjin Emissions Exchange organized China's first sulfur dioxide, carbon neutral, contract energy management and energy efficiency product transactions, and established China's first voluntary emission reduction public inquiry system.\nA number of major international companies including Rockefeller, Tishman Speyer, Motorola and Airbus have built branches here. For instance, EADS Airbus has already opened an assembly plant for its A320 series airliners, operational since 2009. Domestic companies headquartered in Binhai include noodlemaker Tingyi.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nA large culture complex, Binhai Cultural Center, with five central attractions planned. The centerpiece of the complex is the library that opened in November 2017. The library is nicknamed 'The Eye' because the sphere, which appears like an iris, can be seen from the park outside through an eye-shaped opening.The remnant of Taku Forts in the form of a gun platform overlooks the Hai River (Peiho River) in Binhai.\n\n\n== Education ==\nMany colleges and universities in Tianjin have branch campuses in Binhai New Area. In 2003, Nankai University established the TEDA Campus in the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone, which is dedicated to research on genomes, functional genomics, biochips, and molecular virology. Tianjin University of Science and Technology will move into Binhai New Area as a whole. The Juilliard College of New York and the Tianjin Conservatory of Music cooperated with the Juilliard Research Institute of the Tianjin Conservatory of Music in the Yujiapu Financial District to provide pre-university and postgraduate education. At the same time, Tianjin Maritime Vocational College, Tianjin Development Zone Vocational and Technical College, Tianjin Binhai Vocational College are located in Binhai New Area.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHigh speed rail stops in Binhai with Binhai railway station and Tanggu railway station on the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway. Binhai West railway station and Binhai North railway station are stops along the Tianjin\u2013Qinhuangdao High-Speed Railway. Tanggu railway station is also a station on the conventional speed Tianjin\u2013Shanhaiguan Railway.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nBinhai is currently served by one metro line and one tram line operated by Tianjin Metro:\n\n      Line 9 - Hujiayuan, Tanggu, TEDA  TEDA , Citizen Plaza, Convention and Exhibition Center Station, Donghai Road\n      TEDA Tram - TEDA  9 , First Avenue, Second Avenue, Third Avenue, Fourth Avenue, Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, Ninth Avenue, Tenth Avenue, Eleventh Avenue, International Joint Academy, College District, North of College District\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBinhai New Area Government official website\nOfficial Tianjin Media Gateway\nRenaissance Tianjin TEDA Convention Centre Hotel",

          "To be honest, I am a little disappointed. First of all, it seems that it is hard to get to this park through public transportation. Secondly, the CV is not well preserved. It is a theme park rather than a Museum ship. From the entrance to the CV there are lots Russian",

Originally built in 1863 as the private Rong Garden (\u8363\u56ed), it was donated to the state and opened to the public in 1951.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nPeople's Park is in the northeast of Hexi District, bounded by Xiamen Road in the east, Guangdong Road in the west, Qiongzhou Road in the south, and Huizhou Road in the north. It covers an area of 14.21 hectares (35.1 acres), including 3.3 hectares (8.2 acres) of water.\n\n\n== History ==\nBuilt in 1863 during the Qing dynasty, the park was originally the private garden of the wealthy salt merchant Li Chuncheng (\u674e\u6625\u57ce). Its formal name was Rong Garden, but it was commonly called the Li Shanren (Philanthropist Li) Garden.\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the Li family donated the garden to the state, and it was opened to the public on 1 July 1951 as People's Park. In 1954, Chairman Mao Zedong presented the park with his calligraphy of its name. It is the only work of calligraphy Mao wrote for a park.After major renovation work, the park was reopened in 2009. Entrance is free.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "On August 12, 2015, a series of explosions killed 173 people and injured hundreds of others at a container storage station at the Port of Tianjin. The first two explosions occurred within 30 seconds of each other at the facility, which is located in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, China. The second explosion was far larger and involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate (336 tons TNT equivalent). Fires caused by the initial explosions continued to burn uncontrolled throughout the weekend, resulting in eight additional explosions on 15 August. Of the 173 fatalities, 104 were firefighters.\nThe cause of the explosions was not immediately known, but an investigation concluded in February 2016 that an overheated container of dry nitrocellulose was the cause of the initial explosion.The official casualty report was 165 deaths, 8 missing, and 798 non-fatal injuries, but rumours on social media have claimed it was much higher.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTianjin Dongjiang Port Ruihai International Logistics (\u5929\u6d25\u4e1c\u7586\u4fdd\u7a0e\u6e2f\u533a\u745e\u6d77\u56fd\u9645\u7269\u6d41\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), or Ruihai Logistics (\u745e\u6d77\u7269\u6d41), is a privately held logistics company established in 2011. It handles hazardous chemicals within the Port of Tianjin, such as flammable and corrosive substances, oxidizing agents, and toxic chemicals. The company, which employed 70, is designated by the Tianjin Maritime Safety Administration (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u4e8b\u5c40) as an approved agent for handling these hazardous chemicals at the port, and its operating license was renewed two months prior to the explosions. Its 46,000-square-metre (500,000 sq ft) site contains multiple warehouses for hazardous goods, a fire pump and a fire pond.The warehouse building, owned by Ruihai Logistics, is recorded in a 2014 government document as being a hazardous chemical storage facility for calcium carbide, sodium nitrate, and potassium nitrate. Safety regulations requiring that public buildings and facilities should be at least 1 kilometre away were not followed, and local inhabitants were unaware of the danger. The authorities stated that poor record keeping, damage to the office facilities and \"major discrepancies\" with customs meant that they were unable to identify the substances stored. State media revealed that Ruihai had only received its authorisation to handle dangerous chemicals less than two months earlier, meaning that it had been operating illegally from October 2014, when its temporary license had expired, to June 2015.\n\n\n== Explosions ==\nThe first reports of a fire at a warehouse in the Binhai New Area began coming in at around 22:50 local time (14:50 UTC) on 12 August. The first responders were unable to keep the fire from spreading. Firefighters who first arrived on the scene proceeded to douse the fire with water as they were unaware that dangerous chemicals were stored on the site, thereby setting in motion a series of more violent chemical reactions.At around 23:30 (15:30 UTC), the first explosion occurred and registered as a magnitude 2.3 earthquake, generating seismic shock-waves energetically equivalent to 2.9 tonnes of TNT. After 30 seconds, a second, much more powerful explosion occurred, causing most of the damage and injuries with shock-waves felt many kilometres away. The second explosion registered as a magnitude 2.9 earthquake and generated seismic shock-waves with energy equivalent to 21.9 tonnes of TNT. The resulting fireballs reached hundreds of meters in height. Around 23:40 (15:40 UTC) on 15 August, a series of eight smaller explosions occurred in the port as fire from the original blasts continued to spread. The total energy release was equivalent to 28 tonnes of TNT, or 100GJ.\nThe explosion was large enough to be photographed by Himawari, a geostationary meteorological satellite operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Chinese scientists subsequently estimated that the second more powerful explosion involved the detonation of about 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, based on crater size and lethality radius (336 tons TNT equivalent, based on relative effectiveness factor of 0.42).One month after the explosion, official reports listed 173 deaths and 797 injuries. Media reported the area to be densely populated, with around 5,600 families living within 1.5 km radius of the plant, the closest being only 600 m away. Neither the developers nor the buyers were aware of the latent dangers of the activities at the nearby site; developers claimed also to be victims. According to the Tianjin government, more than 700 people were injured by the explosion, many with extensive injuries, mostly from burns and explosive blast injuries. Over a thousand firefighters were on scene, and 95 were killed. There was one surviving firefighter, a 19-year-old named Zhou Ti (\u5468\u501c), who was found on the morning of 14 August. The death toll of the incident, which also included 11 police officers, was the worst for Chinese front line responders since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, until the COVID-19 outbreak of 2020.\n\n\n=== Damage ===\n\nPhotographs and videos showed extensive destruction in and around the warehouse compound, with an enormous crater at the blast site. The buildings of seven more surrounding logistics companies were destroyed, and large quantities of intermodal container stacks were toppled and thrown by the forces of the explosions. More than eight thousand new cars from Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen, Renault, and Toyota, parked in lots located near the blast site, were largely burned as a result of the initial explosions. Multiple buildings surrounding the blast site were declared \"structurally unsafe\". In total, 304 buildings, 12,428 cars, and 7,533 intermodal containers were damaged. Beyond insurance, the cost to businesses of the break in the supply chain caused by the explosions was estimated at $9 billion, making it the third most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015.Apartment blocks 2 km (1.2 mi) from the site sustained shattered glass, loss of roof tiles and damage to ceilings \u2013 with 17,000 units being affected. Nearby Donghai Road Station suffered severe damage as a result of the explosions and was closed until 2016, as was the rest of Line 9 of the Tianjin Metro beginning on 13 August. A Japanese department store four kilometres away reported damage to walls and ceilings. The explosions also affected the National Supercomputing Center of Tianjin several kilometres away, knocking out windows and causing some internal ceilings to collapse; the center's supercomputer Tianhe-1A itself was not damaged.\n\n\n=== Cause ===\nIt is not known what chemicals were being stored at the site. In addition to vast quantities of sodium cyanide and calcium carbide, paperwork was discovered showing that 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and 500 tonnes of potassium nitrate were at the blast site. On 17 August, the deputy director of the public security bureau's fire department told CCTV: Over 40 kinds of hazardous chemicals [were stored on site]. As far as we know, there were ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate. According to what we know so far, all together there should have been around 3,000 tonnes.\nAmmonium nitrate, which is principally used in manufacturing fertilizer, has been implicated in a number of other fatal industrial explosions. A fire department spokesman confirmed that firefighters had used water in combating the initial fire, which may have led to water being sprayed on calcium carbide, releasing the highly flammable gas acetylene. This would have provided the fuel source for reaction with the oxidizer, ammonium nitrate, thus triggering its detonation.\n\n\n=== Pollution ===\nAt least 700 tonnes of highly toxic sodium cyanide was stored at the site \u2013 70 times the legal limit. Sodium cyanide leakage was reported in the sewer. On 13 August, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, all of which are toxic, were detected within 500 m (1,600 ft) of the origin of the explosion, but the levels conformed with the national standards. The government maintained that gases were undetectable 2 km (1.2 mi) from the site during initial testing on 14 August.With the first rains after the initial explosions, coming on 18 August, white chemical foam covered the streets. Citizens complained of burning sensations and rashes on sensitive skin parts after coming into contact with rain droplets. However, meteorologists sought to reassure the public that the rain was not directly harmful to health, whilst the Environment Protection Board advised against exposure to the rain due to traces of cyanide dust reacting with water.Thousands of dead sticklebacks washed up on the banks 6 km from the explosion site on 20 August, fuelling fears of water contamination. Officials downplayed the fears, saying that there were not high levels of cyanide in the river and that the fish likely died due to oxygen depletion in the water.Rain on 25 August 2015 in the Binhai New Area brought more complaints of skin burns from volunteers and journalists. A bright white foam also appeared on the streets. Deng Xiaowen, director of Tianjin's environmental monitoring centre, questionably stated that the foam was \"a normal phenomenon when rain falls, and similar things have occurred before\".\n\n\n== Immediate aftermath ==\n\nOn Thursday morning, the Chinese leaders ordered officers in the city to make full effort in rescuing the injured, and search for those missing. Xi Jinping, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and Li Keqiang, the Premier of the People's Republic of China, also said police should investigate the cause of the incident and punish those responsible for the blast.Tianjin officials, initially concerned at public response, announced that 14 people had perished in the explosions, but later raised the death toll to 44 once the scale of the explosions became clear. The South China Morning Post (SCMP) cited a Tianjin police source that officers had been instructed to remove bodies from the scene to deliberately understate the official death toll, which angered the Tianjin government.The morning following the explosion military personnel began to arrive in Tianjin to help with the search and recovery efforts. Extra equipment, such as bulldozers, were brought in to help with the clean-up operation. Over 200 nuclear and biochemical experts, including a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency, began arriving in Tianjin to assess the health risks from the chemicals being released into the atmosphere. Government personnel set up twelve temporary monitoring stations near the blast site with above-normal levels of pollutants being detected. A nearby drainage outlet was also closed, and water quality tested.Firefighting was suspended on the afternoon of 13 August due to the uncertainty of the content and quantity of hazardous materials being stored on site. A team of over 200 chemical specialists was deployed to the site to assess the hazardous materials on site and dangers to the environment, and to determine the best way to put out the remaining fires and proceed with search and rescue and clean-up operations. Later that day, rescue personnel were dispatched in an attempt to remove the 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide believed to be stored at the site, with hydrogen peroxide being prepared to neutralise the chemicals. Daily press conferences were organised. A press conference organised by local officials held on 14 August came to an abrupt end when a journalist began asking questions as to why such dangerous chemicals were stockpiled so close to housing estates.Initially, more than 3,500 area residents were staying in temporary shelters, but the number surpassed six thousand within three days. The government issued an evacuation order over concerns of further explosions; not all residents complied.On 15 August, local authorities ordered the evacuation of residents within a 3 km (1.9 mi) radius of the blast site, prompted by the threat of \"toxic substances\", including sodium cyanide.The State Council ordered inspections of all businesses using dangerous chemicals and explosives across the country.\n\n\n== Company ownership ==\nHong Kong media announced that Li Liang, the major shareholder \u2013 owning 55%, was the nephew of former chairman of the CPPCC National Committee Li Ruihuan, who had been de facto leader of the Tianjin clique, and that the company may have been named after his brother and Li Liang's father; the remaining 45% was owned by Shu Zheng. Reports in state media one week after the explosion were contradictory, holding that Ruihai was owned via proxies by Yu Xuewei, a former senior executive at Sinochem, and Dong Shexuan, who served as the company's vice-president and had been arrested by police by the time of the reports. Dong Shexuan is the son of Tianjin port's former police chief Dong Peijun, who was a colleague of Wu Changshun, the former chief of the public security bureau of Tianjin. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), CPC's anti-corruption body, charged Wu Changshun with bribery in 2014; Dong Peijun was also under investigation for corruption, but died that year.\n\n\n== Investigation ==\nAfter the explosions, the CCDI placed Yang Dongliang, Director of the State Administration of Work Safety and China's highest work-safety official, under investigation on 18 August 2015. Yang had previously served as Tianjin's vice mayor for 11 years. In 2012, Yang Dongliang had issued an order to loosen rules for the handling of hazardous substances, which may have enabled Ruihai to store toxic chemicals such as sodium cyanide.On 27 August, Xinhua reported that police had arrested twelve people with suspected connections to the explosions, including Ruihai Logistics' chairman, vice-chairman, and at least three other managers, with the other seven people unnamed.On 5 February 2016, the Chinese government issued the investigation report of the explosions. The report concluded the fire started in a container through auto-ignition of nitrocellulose, due to vaporization of the wetting agent during hot weather.On 8 November 2016, various courts in China handed jail sentences to 49 government officials and warehouse executives and staff for their roles in circumventing the safety rules that led to the disaster. Yu Xuewei, the Chairman of Ruihai Logistics, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve.\n\n\n== Response ==\n\n\n=== Media coverage ===\n\n\n==== News outlets ====\nInitially, Tianjin authorities banned editors and reporters from sharing information about the disaster on Weibo and WeChat, and websites were ordered to follow state media.The Tianjin internet police warned social media users to use only official casualty figures.Tianjin Television had reported the explosion on their early morning news at 7:00 am, but citizens complained that the station had not reported live nor updated on the event, instead showing soap operas eight hours later.\n\n\n==== Social media ====\nA great deal of specific information on the event, including the majority of early stage video was first released over social media sites, and in particular microblogging platforms like Weibo. Major media has drawn heavily from social media sources, greatly widening the audience. The Economist noted, \"Social media fills in the blanks left by official narratives of the Tianjin disaster. The most remarkable feature of the aftermath of the explosions in Tianjin, in northern China, has been the extraordinary contrast between the official reaction to the crisis, which has been profoundly flawed, and the online reaction, which has entirely dominated the agenda.\"\n\n\n==== Censorship and criticism ====\nProfessional and social media reports were censored by Chinese authorities. The censorship rate increased tenfold on the social media site Weibo, with users reporting the deletion of their posts regarding the blasts, with \"Tianjin\" and \"explosion\" being the most censored words. An article by Caijing, which carried an interview with a firefighter who said that no-one on the front line had been informed of the dangerous chemicals on site that would react exothermically when mixed with water, was deleted after it had been reposted 10,000 times; many other posts mentioning the existence of deadly sodium cyanide were also expunged.The Cyberspace Administration of China banned all journalists from posting to social media, and insisted on strict adherence to Xinhua copy. On 15 August, it announced that it had shut down 18 websites and suspended 32 more for spreading false information. More than 360 Weibo and public WeChat accounts which had allegedly been spreading such false rumors have been \"punished according to laws\". Of these accounts, over 160 were shut down permanently.Press freedom organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) accused the Chinese state media of playing up the heroic efforts of rescue workers and firefighters while downplaying the causes of the explosions and the number of casualties. RSF said that censorship by the Chinese authorities showed \"a flagrant indifference to the public's legitimate concerns\".A CNN correspondent was interrupted by bystanders and forced to leave during a live report outside TEDA Hospital. A journalist from the Beijing News reported that he and two other reporters were chased by police, caught, searched, and made to delete photographs from their cameras and computers.\n\n\n=== Reactions ===\nImmediately following the blasts the company website was taken down fuelling suspicions that an attempt was being made to shield owners with powerful political connections. For several successive days, local residents seeking compensation for their homes protested in front of the venue of the daily press conference, they were joined by distraught families of missing firefighters, and confronted police angrily.The Chinese public security minister threatened severe punishment for those found to be responsible for the explosions. However, the authorities did not release any significant information for several days about the chemicals and circumstances, causing public anger to mount during this time. Marking an official change of tack that suggested top-level endorsement, the official People's Daily joined in to criticise local officials' lack of candour and their use of bureaucratic jargon. In addition, the Global Times remarked on the inadequacy of emergency response and the reluctance of high-ranking officials to answer the public's questions and address their concerns until four days after the blasts. The People's Daily acknowledged that public scepticism of the reported death toll was fuelling rampant rumours; there was also disquiet over the emergency assistance provided and the way the aftermath was being handled. Attempting to defuse widespread anger at the lack of official transparency, mouthpieces of the ruling party declared that investigations would be thorough and transparent. Former deputy mayor, Yang Dongliang, was put under investigation for corruption; mayor Huang Xingguo proclaimed his \"unshirkable responsibility for this accident\". Authorities also released information about the ownership of Ruihai, as well as a confession by one beneficial owner for the proxy shareholdings.Meanwhile, Greenpeace Asia alleged that two Sinochem subsidiaries \u2013 Sinochem Tianjin Binhai Logistics Company (with a 130,000-square-metre (1,400,000 sq ft) site) and Tianjin Port Sinochem Hazardous Goods Logistics Company Ltd. \u2013 had warehouses in the vicinity in close proximity to a primary and a nursery school, meaning that both were also in similar breach of laws.Observers stated that top officials always attempt to show such disasters as isolated instances, have never accepted political accountability nor addressed the underlying governance issues, and have always heavily censored any criticism of the central government. Willy Lam, professor at CUHK and senior fellow at The Jamestown Foundation, noted the highly unusual 4 days it took for Li Keqiang to make an official visit, suggesting that the lack of a top-ranking visitor to a major disaster site within 48 hours despite the proximity to Beijing reflected \"division among the leadership on who should be the fall guy.\"\n\n\n=== Clean-up and redress ===\nTianjin officials announced that as at the deadline on 3 September 2015, more than 9,000 households out of some 17,000 affected by the explosions had signed agreements to settle their damages claims. It was reported that some had chosen to sell their damaged apartments to private developers, who offered them around 130% of the original purchase price, while others accepted an offer from the local government promising to fix the damaged apartments. The local government offered an additional of \u00a520,000 renminbi ($3,100) to those who agreed to settle their claims by the deadline. New York Times journalists, however, reported that some owners had faced heavy pressure from government officials to settle; similarly, owners who were employees in state-owned enterprises were under threat of dismissal from their bosses for not settling.On 10 September 2015 China Daily reported that families of the firefighters killed in the explosions would each receive compensation of 2.3 million yuan (US$360,669), citing a report in Beijing News. It was also reported that a monument would be built on the site and that the government planned to compensate residents whose houses were damaged by repurchasing them at 130% of their purchase price.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n2019 Xiangshui chemical plant explosion\n2015 Dongying explosion\n2014 Shanghai stampede\n2014 Kunshan explosion\n1988 PEPCON disaster\nLargest artificial non-nuclear explosions\nList of accidents and disasters by death toll\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Huge explosions rock Chinese city\", The Telegraph (video), UK, 13 August 2015.\nExtended panoramic view of Tianjin blast site, drone video, New China TV, 14 August 2015.\nDrone video of Tianjin explosion aftermath, New China, 14 August 2015.\nClose footage of the second explosion; footage ends when the camera and the surrounding area are destroyed by the shockwave\nRuihai Logistics (official site) (in Chinese), archived from the original on 12 August 2015.\n\"Casualties Increasing in Huge Explosion in China\", News 365 Today, 13 August 2015.\nPanoramic view of Ruihai Logistics, QQ Maps Street View, archived from the original on 31 March 2015, retrieved 18 March 2016.\n\"\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\"8\u00b712\"\u745e\u6d77\u516c\u53f8\u5371\u9669\u54c1\u4ed3\u5e93 \u7279\u522b\u91cd\u5927\u706b\u707e\u7206\u70b8\u4e8b\u6545\u8c03\u67e5\u62a5\u544a\", State Administration of Work Safety (report), China.",

        "wiki": "Guwenhua Jie, Tianjin's Ancient Culture Street, is a pedestrian pathway complex dotted with temple gates and kiosks on the west bank of the Hai River in Tianjin, China. The Nankai District area is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration.\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street was opened on New Year's Day in 1986. It preserves the architectural style of Qing dynasty, with its Niangniang Palace honoring the sea-goddess Mazu in the center. There are many tourist attractions along the street.\n\n\n== Queen of Heaven Palace ==\nThe Queen of Heaven, Tianhou, or Niangniang Palace is a temple to the Chinese sea-goddess Mazu, a medieval Fujianese who was later deified. It is in the middle of the Ancient Culture Street. Other names include \"Niangniang\" or \"Tianhou Temple\", the \"Tianfei Palace\", the \"Xiaozhigu Tianfei Palace\", and the \"Western Temple\".\nThe Niangniang Palace was first constructed in 1326 under the Yuan; it has subsequently been repaired many times.\nThe complex faces east with the Haihe River running in front. From east to west, the main buildings are the Opera Tower, the Flag Pole, the Temple Gate, the Memorial Archway, the Front Hall, the Main Hall, Canon-Storing Pavilion, the Qisheng Temple, the Bell-Drum Tower, the Side Hall, and the Zhangxian Pavilion. The Main Hall is constructed on a high and large platform, which is typical for wooden structures of the mid- to late-Ming Dynasty. The complex is one of the three major surviving Mazu temples in China and one of the oldest.\nThe main function of the temple is to pray for safe navigation. The palace was a center of marine sacrifice in past dynasties and a venue for sailors to have happy get-togethers. Besides ceremonial rituals held to worship the Goddess of the Sea, performances are held to thank her. It is said that the 23rd day of the third month of the Chinese lunar calendar is Matsu's birthday and a folk flower fair is held here annually to commemorate her on the day.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Yuhuangge Taoist Temple ==\n\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple was once the most famous building group in Hai River Triple Junction. In 2007, an ancient government road in Ming Dynasty was found, however large-scale excavation was not made due to architectural and other reasons.\nA few days ago, many famous historians had special argumentation in respect of discovering historical and cultural resources of the Cultural Street, and improving the cultural landscape of Yuhuangge Taoist Temple. Around Yuhuangge Taoist Temple, there may be many historical relics and sites to be discovered. Experts advised the restoration of the museum held by historical Zhili Public Welfare Services in this Temple about one hundred years ago, forming the \u201cYuhuangge Historical Museum\u201d.\nYuhuangge was built in Hongwu Years of Ming Dynasty, 1368 AD, and is one of the oldest buildings remaining in Tianjin.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Making the effort to go up the tower on a clear day gives a great view of the city, but avoid the Restaurant at the top which is only average and very expensive. Better to go down and walk the short distance to Shanggu and drink coffee or eat at one of the small Restaurants",

        "wiki": "St. Joseph Cathedral (Chinese: \u5723\u82e5\u745f\u4e3b\u6559\u5ea7\u5802; pinyin: Sh\u00e8ng Ru\u00f2s\u00e8 Zh\u01d4ji\u00e0o Zu\u00f2t\u00e1ng), also known as the Xikai Church (Chinese: \u897f\u958b\u5802; pinyin: Xik\u0101i T\u00e1ng), is a Roman Catholic church located in the central commercial district and former French concession of Tianjin, China. It is at the southern end of Binjiang Dao (\u6ee8\u6c5f\u9053) in Heping District.  The cathedral is one of Tianjin's protected historical relics. The church was built in 1913 under the name of MG Church before it was renamed St. Joseph's Church.  It is the largest Roman Catholic Church in Tianjin.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1912, the Holy See issued an edict, announced by Zhili Vicariate on behalf of the Northern Territory Zhili Vicariate. Tianjin's Bishop House was located near the Sancha River in the Wanghailou Church, and the first apostolic vicar was Paul-Marie Dumond of the Congregation of the Mission.\nIn August 1913, construction began, and each brick had to be shipped from France.  In June 1916, Xikai was completed and became the main cathedral for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin. Afterward, Bishop Paul-Marie Dumond opened the St. Joseph's Primary School (now Tianjin No. 21 Middle School).  Since then the diocese also acquired a St. Joseph's School of Law and the Catholic Hospital (now Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Tianjin).\nAt the start of construction, the French concession of Tianjin was ordered to station police in the area. On October 20, 1916, however, the French stationed police was forced to disarm by local Chinese police who detained the bridge and caused massive public protests in Tianjin. Later, the Sino-French people of the region maintained control.  On August 23, 1966, the Red Guards attacked the area, during which three towers were destroyed and were not rebuilt until the 1980s.\nThe 1976 Tangshan earthquake also caused some damage.  The two front shock towers at the base of the dome were severely damaged, and the repairs to the base did not begin until 1979.  They were completed in the Fall of 1980 when the official opening was celebrated.  \nIn August 1991, August, Xikai was listed on Tianjin's cultural relics protection list. As of today, the church is still the largest Catholic Church in the Tianjin metropolitan area.\n\n\n== Architectural style ==\n\nXikai is northern China's largest Romanesque church, with an area of 1891.95 square meters and can accommodate 1,500 people.  The giant dome has a \"product\" shape with a green copper surface on the outside, supported by a wood structure and topped with a bronze cross.  At the time it was built, the bishop refused to install a lightning rod on the dome, but 50 years later it was added.  However, 80 years later when the area became a commercial center for Tianjin, the church was no longer the tallest building and therefore no longer required a lightning rod. \nXikai's walls are checkered with red and yellow tiles and framed with white water masonry.  Circular windows, columns, large indoor paintings, a large pipe organ, and semi-circular windows accent the building.  The entrance consists of two doors in the back of Xikai, originally meant to allow men and women to enter through separate doors.\nThe interior of Xikai is based on French and Roman architecture styles. The long main hall is lined by 14 large columns (two rows of seven), leading to a gallery-style tee.  The nave has a stacked composite side portico, supported by semi-circular tops.  The tall central dome consists of an octagonal drum roof that complements the octagonal windows throughout the church.  Its side windows are stained glass with inlay painting. Painted, ornate murals, full of Biblical scenes, cover the walls.\n\n\n== Religious activities ==\nThere are two Our Lady of China, Tianjin (OLCTJ) parishes that celebrate at this cathedral: Chinese and English.\nEvery morning the Chinese parish holds a Mass, while also providing additional Saturday and Sunday services.\nThe English speaking parish, started in 2007 by Father Joseph Loftus, celebrates at 11:30am every Sunday, with special Masses around certain holidays.  Since this parish began, the English speaking foreign celebrants have created a Council to run all of the parish activities including a Music Ministry, Youth Group, Rosary Group, potluck meals, an RCIA, and a Charity Ministry.  More specifically, the Xikai English parish has developed partnerships to help with Tianjin's local Huiling Orphanage and TICCO.\n\n\n== Images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "The Taku Forts or Dagu Forts, also called the Peiho Forts are forts located by the Hai River (Peiho River) estuary in the Binhai New Area, Tianjin, in northeastern China. They are located 60 km (37 mi) southeast of the Tianjin urban center.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first fort was built during the reign of the Ming Jiajing Emperor between 1522 and 1527. Its purpose was to protect Tianjin from attack by wokou sea raiders. \nLater, in 1816, the Qing government built the first two forts on both sides of the Haihe estuary in response to increased concerns about seaborne threats from the West. By 1841, in response to the First Opium War, the defensive system in Dagukou was reinforced into a system of five big forts, 13 earthen batteries, and 13 earthworks. In 1851, Imperial Commissioner Sengge Rinchen carried out a comprehensive renovation of the forts, building 6 large forts: two on the south of the estuary, called \"W\u0113i\" (\u5a01-Might) and \"Zh\u00e8n\"(\u9707-Thunder, Tremor, Quake), three to the north, \"H\u01cei\"(\u6d77-sea), \"M\u00e9n\"(\u95e8-gate) \"G\u0101o\" (\u9ad8-high), and the sixth, the \"Shitoufeng\" (\u77f3\u5934\u7f1d-Stone Seam) Fort, was built on a small ridge on the northern shore. Each fort had three large guns and 20 small caliber guns. Forts were constructed of wood and brick with an external curtain of two feet of concrete, the layering designed to avoid spalling and minimize penetration by artillery rounds. The forts were around 10 to 15 meters (33 to 49 ft) high, which located as they were in an exceedingly flat landscape, provided a critical vantage point.\n\n\n=== Second Opium War ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. Though the certificate allowing the ship to fly a British flag had expired, there was still an armed response. The British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku Forts in May 1858. In June 1858, at the end of the first part of the Second Opium War, the Treaties of Tianjin were signed, which opened Tianjin to foreign trade.\nIn 1859, after China refused to allow the setting up of foreign legations in Beijing, a naval force under the command of British Admiral Sir James Hope attacked the forts guarding the mouth of the Hai River. During the action, US Navy Commodore Josiah Tattnall, who later served in the Confederate Navy during the American Civil War, came to the assistance of the British gunboat HMS Plover, offering to take off their wounded. Plover's commander, Rear Admiral James Hope, accepted the offer and a launch was sent to take off the wounded. Later, Tattnall discovered that some of his men were black from powder flashes. When asked, the men replied that the British had been short handed with the bow gun. His famous report sent to Washington claimed \"Blood is thicker than water\". This was the first time the British troops needed American assistance after suffering major casualties from the Taku cannon barrage, and the first time that British and independent American troops fought side by side.   \nIn 1860, an Anglo-French force gathered at Hong Kong and then carried out a landing at Pei Tang on August 1, and a successful assault on the Taku Forts on August 21 after which Hospital Apprentice Andrew Fitzgibbon of the Indian Medical Establishment became the youngest recipient of the Victoria Cross at the age of 15 years and 3 months.  The forts were severely mauled and General Sengge Rinchen's troops were forced to withdraw. On September 26, the force arrived at Beijing and had captured the city by October 13.\n\n\n=== Boxer Rebellion ===\n\nAfter the Battle of Taku Forts (1900), most of the forts were dismantled when the Eight-Nation Alliance Forces invaded China during the Boxer Rebellion (1899\u20131901). Two forts remain today, one on the southern bank (the former \"Wei\" fort) and the other on the northern bank of the Hai River (the former \"Hai\" fort). Dagu Fort (on the southern bank) was repaired in 1988 and opened to the public in June 1997. Land reclamation has left it some considerable distance from the modern shoreline. Its restoration has not returned it to anything like the appearance it would have had when it was an active gun battery (see photo of the aftermath of the 1860 attack), but a number of cannons have been placed in the reconstructed gun embrasures to hint at its former use. An exhibition in Chinese recounts the history of the Opium Wars and the forts' role in them. Unrestored forts are visible to its north from Haifang Road.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Queen's Royal Surrey Regimental Association. \"TAKU FORTS 1860\".

First built in 1875, it covers over 6,000 square meters, including large and small yards and over 200 folk houses, a theater and over 275 rooms that served as apartments and places of business and worship for this powerful family. Shifu Garden, which finished its expansion in October 2003, covers 1,200 square meters, incorporates the elegance of imperial garden and delicacy of south garden. Now the courtyard of Shi family covers about 10,000 square meters, which is called the first mansion in North China. Now it serves as the folk custom museum in Yangliuqing, which has a large collection of folk art pieces like Yanliuqing New Year pictures, brick sculpture.\nShi's ancestor came from Dong'e County in Shandong, engaged in water transport of grain. As the wealth gradually accumulated, the Shi Family moved to Yangliuqing and bought large tracts of land and set up their residence. Shi Yuanshi came from the fourth generation of the family, who was a successful businessman and a good household manager, and the residence was thus enlarged for several times until it acquired the present scale. It is believed to be the first mansion in the west of Tianjin.\nThe residence is symmetric based on the axis formed by a passageway in the middle, on which there are four archways. On the east side of the courtyard, there are traditional single-story houses with rows of rooms around the four sides, which was once the living area for the Shi Family. The rooms on north side were the accountants' office. On the west are the major constructions including the family hall for worshiping Buddha, theater and the south reception room. On both sides of the residence are side yard rooms for maids and servants.\nToday, the Shi mansion, located in the township of Yangliuqing to the west of central Tianjin, stands as a surprisingly well-preserved monument to China's pre-revolution mercantile spirit. It also serves as an on-location shoot for many of China's popular historical dramas. Many of the rooms feature period furniture, paintings and calligraphy, and the extensive Shifu Garden.\nPart of the complex has been turned into the Yangliuqing Museum, which includes displays focused on symbolic aspects of the courtyards' construction, local folk art and customs, and traditional period furnishings and crafts.\n\n\n== External links ==\nShi Family Grand Courtyard \u2013 local tourism information",

        "wiki": "The Port of Tianjin (Tianjin Gang, Chinese: \u5929\u6d25\u6e2f; pinyin: ti\u0101nj\u012bn g\u01ceng), formerly known as the Port of Tanggu, is the largest port in Northern China and the main maritime gateway to Beijing. The name \"Tianjin Xingang\" (Chinese: \u5929\u6d25\u65b0\u6e2f; pinyin: ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012bng\u01ceng; lit.: 'Tianjin New Port'), which strictly speaking refers only to the main seaport area, is sometimes used to refer to the whole port. The port is on the western shore of the Bohai Bay, centred on the estuary of the Haihe River, 170 km southeast of Beijing and 60 km east of Tianjin city. It is the largest man-made port in mainland China, and one of the largest in the world. It covers 121 square kilometers of land surface, with over 31.9 km of quay shoreline and 151 production berths at the end of 2010.Tianjin Port handled 500 million tonnes of cargo and 13 million TEU of containers in 2013, making it the world's fourth largest port by throughput tonnage and the ninth in container throughput. The port trades with more than 600 ports in 180 countries and territories around the world. It is served by over 115 regular container lines. run by 60 liner companies, including all the top 20 liners. Expansion in the last two decades has been enormous, going from 30 million tonnes of cargo and 490,000 TEU in 1993 to well beyond 400 million tonnes and 10 million TEU in 2012. Capacity is still increasing at a high rate, with 550\u2013600 Mt of throughput capacity expected by 2015.\nThe port is part of the Binhai New Area district of Tianjin Municipality, the main special economic zone of northern China, and it lies directly east of the TEDA. The Port of Tianjin is at the core of the ambitious development program of the BNA and, as part of that plan, the port aims to become the primary logistics and shipping hub of North China.\nOn 12 August 2015, at least two explosions within 30 seconds of each other occurred at a container storage station at the Port of Tianjin in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, China. The cause of the explosions was not immediately known, but initial reports pointed to an industrial accident. Chinese state media said that at least the initial blast was from unknown hazardous materials in shipping containers at a plant warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics, a firm specializing in handling hazardous materials.\n\n\n== Location and layout ==\n\nThe Port of Tianjin is on the coast of Tianjin Municipality, in the former county of Tanggu, on the coast between the estuaries of the Haihe to the south and the New Yongding River to the north.  To the west, the port borders the city of Tanggu (now the Urban Core of the Binhai New Area) and the TEDA. To the east, the port opens up to the Bohai Bay.\nTianjin Port is divided into nine port areas: the three core (\"Tianjin Xingang\") areas of Beijiang, Nanjiang, and Dongjiang around the Xingang fairway; the Haihe area along the river; the Beitang port area around the Beitangkou estuary; the Dagukou port area in the estuary of the Haihe River; and three areas under construction (Hanggu, Gaoshaling, Nangang).\n\n\n== Geophysical setting ==\n\nThe coastal area of Tianjin municipality before development was dominated by mudflats, salt marshes (and salterns), and coastal shallows. This littoral zone is wide and slopes gently: The 0 m isobath (the intertidal flats) extends to 3\u20138 km from shore at a slope of 0.71\u20131.28%, the \u22125 m isobath extends 14\u201318 km from shore, and the \u221210 m isobath reaches 22\u201336 km from shore. These features make deep water navigation dependent on extensive dredging, and it means that land reclamation is a cost-effective option for construction. Tianjin Port is by necessity largely man-made through dredging and reclamation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe lower course and estuary of the Haihe is the main stem of a large navigable basin, as well as the westernmost seashore of the North China Plain, and there have been major ports on the area at least since the late Eastern Han Dynasty. The river port at the junction of the Grand Canal served as both an inland port and seaport supplying the northeast border of Chinese states. Since 1153, it was the critical supply hub for what is now Beijing.\nHowever, it was not until after the conclusion of the Second Opium War in 1860 that the port of Tanggu became an important transshipment center, allowing oceangoing ships to lighter their cargoes to cross the very shallow sandbar barring the entrance to Haihe, the Taku Bar (\u5927\u6cbd\u575d \u2014 the name of this barrier was often used by foreign powers to refer to the entire port).\nAfter the Boxer Rebellion, the whole of Tanggu came under foreign occupation, and those foreign powers developed an extensive network of quays on the riverside.The capacity of the Tanggu and Tianjin river port was limited, and so the Japanese occupation forces started in 1940 the construction of the Tanggu Xingang seaport (later the Tianjin Xingang port) outside the river estuary. By the end of the war, the new port was incomplete, and damage during the Chinese Civil War left it unusable by the time of its capture in 1949.\nThe Communists reconstructed the Tanggu New Port slowly. On 17 October 1952, it reopened for traffic. At the time, the main channel was dredged to 6 m depth, could handle ships of up to 7,000 DWT and had an annual throughput of only 800,000 tonnes \u2014 less than 1/500 of present capacity. The port remained small throughout the Maoist era, although it pioneered the first container routes and dedicated container terminal in China.\nThe export boom that followed the post-1979 Reform and Opening period put enormous pressure on the rickety port infrastructure of China. Congestion became serious enough to force reform by the central government: On 1 June 1984, the Port of Tianjin was transferred from direct control of the Ministry of Communications to a \"dual\" system of shared central and local control.\n\nProduction then increased in leaps and bounds. In 1988 throughput passed the 20 million tonnes milestone, and in the ten years from 1993, annual throughput growth averaged 10 million tonnes every year. In December 2001, the port was the first port in north China to reach the 100 million tonnes mark. In 2004 it reached 200 million tonnes, in 2007 300 million tonnes and in 2010 400 million tonnes. The container handling capacity of the port increased from 0.4 million TEU in 1992, to 2.4 million TEU in 2002, 7.1 million TEU in 2007, and more than 10 million TEU in 2010.\nThe structure of the port also changed. In 1992, Tianjin Port Storage and Transportation Company was made into a joint stock company under the full ownership of the Tianjin Port Bureau. In 1996, it was converted into the Tianjin Port Holdings Company (TPC) and listed in the Shanghai stock market. In 1997, Tianjin Development Holdings, which owned the container-handling assets of the Port, was listed in Hong Kong. Its port assets were later spun out as the Tianjin Port Development Company (TPD) and listed in the Hong Kong exchange in 2006.\nThe PTA delayed corporatization to steer the passing of the 11th five-year development plan for the port. The transition was only completed on 3 June 2004, when the PTA became the last major Port Authority in China to become a corporation: the Tianjin Port (Group) Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f(\u96c6\u56e2)\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8, or TPG by its English acronym).The financial tsunami of 2008 hit Chinese ports particularly hard, as they depended heavily on foreign trade flows. The Tianjin Port did better than average due to its diversification: While container business plummeted, bulk trade (in particular iron ore) remained strong. Nevertheless, the crisis hit profits hard, and it convinced the Tianjin government to reorganize and streamline the structure of the Port, which they did in 2009 by having TPD (the smaller operator, but one with the useful foreign registration and access to foreign capital markets) take over TPC. Simultaneously, ownership of TPD was transferred from Tianjin Development Holdings (a subsidiary of the Tianjin Ministry of Commerce) to TPG. By the time the merger was concluded, on 4 February 2010, all operations in the Tianjin Port had been consolidated under TPG.\nThe Port of Tianjin was adversely affected by a large industrial-scale accident in August 2015. On August 12, a series of explosions took place at a port chemical storage facility in Binhai, causing 173 deaths and nearly 800 injuries. The blast had the equivalent of 800 metric tonnes of ammonium nitrate or a magnitude-2.9 earthquake, according to the China Earthquake Networks Center. Eight other people remain missing.\n\n\n== Port fairway ==\n\nThe Tianjin Xingang Fairway is divided into the Main Shipping Channel, the Chuanzhadong Channel, and the Northern Branch Channel. The Dagusha Channel and the Haihe river channel are separate fairways with slightly different regulations.\n\n\n=== Anchorages ===\nTianjin Port has six main anchorage areas and two temporary anchorages. All anchorages are designated for all functions \u2014 berth waiting, quarantine, inspection and pilotage \u2014 and provide little shelter from weather or rough seas. Bottom hold is poor to very poor. Anchored vessels are advised to keep five cables of clearance, as anchor dragging is common (up to 5\u201310 NM in a day in winter, due to drifting ice).\n\n\n=== Shiplocks and tidal barriers ===\n\nThe Haihe river channel is separated from the sea channels by three structures: \n\nThe Xingang Shiplock (Chinese: \u65b0\u6e2f\u8239\u95f8; pinyin: x\u012bng\u01ceng chu\u00e1nzh\u00e1) in the northern side of the estuary is the main shipping route into the Haihe area.\nThe Haihe Tidal Barrier (Chinese: \u6d77\u6cb3\u9632\u6f6e\u95f8; pinyin: h\u01ceih\u00e9 f\u00e1ngch\u00e1ozh\u00e1), built in 1958, and last refurbished in 1999, serves as a dam, flood control sluice and tide surge protection for the Haihe river mouth.\nThe Tanggu Fishing Boat Lock (Chinese: \u5858\u6cbd\u6e14\u8239\u95f8; pinyin: t\u00e1ngg\u016b y\u00fachu\u00e1nzh\u00e1) is at the western end of the channel between Donggu and Lanjingdao Island. In 2011, the Fishing Boat Lock gates started to be rebuilt to allow for larger road traffic between Donggu and Lanjingdao.\nThe final hydraulic structure of the Tianjin Port is the Haihe Second Barrier (Chinese: \u6d77\u6cb3\u4e8c\u9053\u95f8; pinyin: h\u01ceih\u00e9 \u00e8rd\u00e0ozh\u00e1) at Dongnigucun, in the Jinnan district. The Second Barrier is also an open-type sluice barrier, with 8 vertical-rising gates allowing an average flow of 1200 m3/s. The barrier, opened in July 1984, closes ship traffic upriver into Tianjin city proper, and its erection resulted in the abandonment of 29.3 km of navigable channel.\n\n\n== Port governance ==\n\n\n=== State regulation and supervision ===\nThe Port of Tianjin falls under the supervisory and regulatory purview of the Tianjin Municipality People's Government. The 2004 incorporation of the Tianjin Port Authority into TPG formally divested the group of its role as Port Regulator, which passed to the Tianjin Transportation and Port Authority (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u6e2f\u53e3\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40), formerly the Tianjin Transport Commission. The TTPA implements state policy on port work; drafts local policies, by-laws and regulations; and licenses, audits, and issues certifications to businesses operating in the port, in particular to ship terminals. The TTPA supervises and manages compliance to all laws and regulations regarding environmental protection, service compliance, pilotage, maintenance of port infrastructure and handling of dangerous goods and disinfection in all terminals and storage areas.\nThe Tianjin Municipality People's Government Port Services Office (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u4eba\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u53e3\u5cb8\u670d\u52a1\u529e\u516c\u5ba4) was set up in May 2009 to streamline port operations, in particular customs and inspection clearance procedures.Tianjin Maritime Safety Bureau: Harbormaster powers for the Port of Tianjin are mostly vested on the Tianjin Maritime Safety Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u4e8b\u5c40), which is the local agency of the China Maritime Safety Administration.Maritime Law: The Port of Tianjin falls under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Maritime Court for all matters of national and international Maritime law, including all forms of maritime contracts, torts and offenses.\n\n\n=== Inspection and clearance ===\nInbound ships, cargo and personnel require clearance by four main government bodies: China Customs for customs declaration, Border Inspection for migration formalities, China Inspection and Quarantine for quarantine and fumigation, and the MSA for ship and crew safety regulations. Obtaining clearance from these so-called \"One Customs Three Inspections\" (\u4e00\u5173\u4e09\u68c0) used to be a protracted process, and one of the continued foci of port reform is to speed up the clearance procedures and reduce their (still significant) burden.\n\n\n=== Port management ===\n\nTianjin Port Group (TPG) is both the main Port Operator and Port Landowner, and retains some of the old Port Authority's supervisory functions. TPG is the holding company and Ultimate Controlling Party for most of the Tianjin Port operating units, and its affiliates and subordinate units run most aspects of port operation. The Dagukou port area is (at present) run separately by the Tianjin Lingang Port Group Co. (\u5929\u6d25\u4e34\u6e2f\u6e2f\u52a1\u96c6\u56e2\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), owned by the Tianjin Lingang Economic Area Administrative Committee (of which TPG is a part).|TPG also serves as Port Landlord, providing basic municipal services (including roads, power, water and sewerage) and other services, extending from construction materials to printing services, to the port's tenant operators. In this role, TPG maintains quasi-municipal authority over port areas. Finally, as with all Chinese SOEs, the control and coordination role of the local Communist Party units is significant, as is the common cross-sharing of personnel among related units.\n\n\n== Traffic management and navigational safety ==\n\n\n=== Area procedures and traffic rules ===\n\nThe Vessel Traffic Service Center (\u5929\u6d25\u8239\u8236\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3) of the MSA provides traffic control, navigation assistance and local communication to all vessels in the Port's fairway, anchorages and berths. The VTS Center is located in an 88 m tall control tower at the eastern end of the Dongtudi (East Pier), and has two subordinate monitoring stations at Dongjiang and Lingang. Its control area extends 20 nautical miles (37 km) from the tower. Compliance with the VTSC's authority is mandatory, and all ships must maintain watch on its VHF channel (Ch. 9) while on the port area. On the Haihe, both VHF 09 and 71 must be on watch.\n\n\n=== Aids to navigation ===\nThe Tianjin Port's aids to navigation (AtoN) system is fairly dense, and growing rapidly. The MSA Beihai Navigational Security Center's Tianjin Aids to Navigation Office (\u5317\u6d77\u822a\u6d77\u4fdd\u969c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5929\u6d25\u822a\u6807\u5904) is responsible for the maintenance of all navaids within the Tianjin area. In 2004, the AtoN office controlled 141 navaids in the Tianjin jurisdiction, including 3 lighthouses, 12 light beacons, 22 lead markers, 44 day beacons, 55 light buoys, 1 NDB station, 1 RBN/DGPS station, 3 radar transponders, 2 large AtoN ships, 2 small AtoN ships and 1 survey ship operating from two wharves.\n\n\n=== Weather monitoring and reporting ===\nWhile the Port directly operates a number of hydro-meteorological stations (including tide gauges), weather forecasting is primarily the responsibility of the Tianjin Binhai New Area Weather Warning Center (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u6ee8\u6d77\u65b0\u533a\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u8b66\u4e2d\u5fc3), the local agency of the Tianjin Municipal Weather Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u6c14\u8c61\u5c40). The Warning Center uses local (26 automatic weather stations in Binhai), national and satellite data to forecast marine and port weather.\n\n\n=== Maritime communication ===\n\nTianjin Coastal Radio: The Beihai Navigational Security Center's Tianjin Communications and Information Center (\u5317\u6d77\u822a\u6d77\u4fdd\u969c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5929\u6d25\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5fc3) runs the Tianjin Coastal Station (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u5cb8\u7535\u53f0, Callsign: XSV; Call: Tianjin Radio; MMSI 004121100). The Station is in charge of the communication obligations of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System in the Port's jurisdiction, supports the SAR Center's communication needs, and supports the MSA's duties of coordination and communications.\n\n\n=== SAR operations and emergency response ===\nMaritime Rescue Coordination: The primary SAR coordination agency is the Tianjin Maritime Search and Rescue Center (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u6d77\u4e0a\u641c\u6551\u4e2d\u5fc3), with responsibility for coordinating all SAR activities in Port waters.\n\nThe Tianjin Search and Rescue Base is one of the six rescue bases of the China Rescue and Salvage Beihai Bureau, which is the front-line rescue and salvage force of the Ministry of Transport.SAR Assets: Tianjin Rescue Base keeps three dynamic standby stations, normally with the following units:\nSearch and Rescue Base's Wharf: One Fast Rescue Boat (Huaying 387) and one rescue tug.\nDagukou Anchorage: One 1940 kW Rescue Ship (Beihaijiu 169)\nBeihai 2nd Point (10 NM south of Caofeidian, 38\u00ba50\u00b4N / 118\u00ba25\u00b4E) : One 1940 kW Rescue Ship (Beihaijiu 115)Tianjin Port PSB Fire Services Detachment (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u516c\u5b89\u5c40\u6d88\u9632\u652f\u961f) holds the fire-fighting and fire prevention duties for both the land and water areas of the Port.Emergency Medical Assistance: The Tianjin Port Hospital (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u53e3\u533b\u9662) is the primary provider of emergency medical care in the port. It is a 314-bed comprehensive hospital, owned by TPG, that is specially licensed to deal with infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine and maritime accident trauma: its orthopedic trauma department is especially well ranked nationally.Pollution Control: Tianjin MSA is the Port's \"National Operational Contact Point\" pursuant to MARPOL, and must be contacted (VHF 9) in all incidents of shipborne harmful substance spills.The State Oceanic Administration has overlapping authority regarding spills and pollution, usually concentrated on oil platform and pipeline incidents.\n\n\n== Law enforcement ==\n\nThe maritime governance regime in China is peculiar in its multiplicity of actors and apparent duplication of labor. Five major agencies (MSA, SOA, CCG, FLEC, GAC), plus the local People's Police and other local units, divide maritime and coastal law enforcement, safety and administrative duties, with much overlap in formal remits. These agencies' responsibilities reflect the functional jurisdiction of their parent ministries, and their operational emphases fit those jurisdictions. Only the Coast Guard (Maritime Police) patrol vessels are armed gunboats, and the Guard has first line jurisdiction in gendarmerie missions such as terrorism, piracy and serious crimes.\n\n\n=== People's Police units ===\n\nThe Tianjin Port Public Security Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u516c\u5b89\u5c40) is one of the fourteen branch offices of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, with sub-bureau status. It is responsible for public order, law enforcement, criminal investigation, road traffic control, and fire safety and firefighting.Water Police: The Tianjin Port PSB has its own water police unit running its own patrol boats, which are berthed on a floating pontoon station (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u516c\u5b89\u5c40\u6c34\u4e0a\u6cbb\u5b89\u6d3e\u51fa\u6240) built on a converted floating crane, currently located on the K1 berth of the Tianjin Port Passenger Terminal.\n\nBorder Protection: the Public Security Border Troops (\u516c\u5b89\u8fb9\u9632\u90e8\u961f) are a gendarmerie force under control of the MPS in charge of border protection and security. The border guards' local ground unit is the Binhai New Area Public Security Border Protection Detachment (\u6ee8\u6d77\u65b0\u533a\u516c\u5b89\u8fb9\u9632\u652f\u961f).The Tianjin Customs Anti-Smuggling Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u5173\u7f09\u79c1\u5c40), usually called the Anti-Smuggling Police (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u5173\u7f09\u79c1\u8b66\u5bdf) is a People's Police unit under the dual command of the MPS and the GAC. It is the main body engaged in control, prevention and investigation of customs fraud and duty evasion and smuggling (including cultural goods, drugs, dangerous materials, etc.).\n\n\n=== Other law enforcement bodies ===\nThe law enforcement arms of the MSA are the Tianjin Maritime Public Security Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u4e8b\u516c\u5b89\u5c40) and the Tianjin MSA Law Enforcement Patrol Flotilla (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u4e8b\u5c40\u5de1\u67e5\u6267\u6cd5\u652f\u961f). The Tianjin Maritime PSB (not to be confused with the Tianjin Port Public Security Bureau) is responsible for maritime law enforcement and carries out marine accident and criminal investigations. The Patrol Flotilla deploys eleven patrol ships (hull numbers haixun 05xx), which monitor and manage shipping traffic, maintain navigational order and safety, and cooperate on patrol, escort, and search and rescue missions as needed.\nThe Second Detachment of China Maritime Surveillance (\u4e2d\u56fd\u6d77\u76d1\u7b2c\u4e8c\u652f\u961f) of the Tianjin Oceanic Administration has jurisdiction over the Bohai and Laizhou Bays, and over all the coastal areas of Tianjin and Hebei. It monitors environmental damage, illegal use of sea resources, violation of maritime regulations, and damage to marine facilities.The Tianjin Fisheries Management and Fishing Port Supervision and Management Office (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u6e14\u653f\u6e14\u6e2f\u76d1\u7763\u7ba1\u7406\u5904) is a branch of the Tianjin Fisheries Bureau under the China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command Center (\u4e2d\u56fd\u6e14\u653f\u6307\u6325\u4e2d\u5fc3). It is in charge of enforcing fishing regulations, of controlling illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU), and of fishing navigational safety.\n\n\n== Business structure ==\n\n\n=== Ownership structure ===\n\nThe Port of Tianjin is a state-owned enterprise (SOE), run as an independent corporation, with separate finances and a commercial orientation. The Port Owner is the Tianjin Municipality People's Government (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u4eba\u6c11\u653f), through the Tianjin SASAC (Tianjin State Assets Supervision and Administration Committee\u2014\u5929\u6d25\u56fd\u6709\u8d44\u4ea7\u76d1\u7763\u7ba1\u7406\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a), which is the full owner of the Tianjin Port (Group) Company (TPG). TPG's board is appointed by the Tianjin government. TPG is the effective holding company and main Port Operator, and it owns or has a stake on the majority of the Port's various operating outfits.\nSince the 2009 merger, TPG's main operating subsidiary is Tianjin Port Development Co. Ltd (TPD), which in turn is the majority shareholder of Tianjin Port Holdings Co. Ltd (TPC).\nTPG has been injecting operational assets to TPC for several years, and since 2009 to TPD (most recently the Shihua Crude Oil Terminal). This has created somewhat of a functional division. The listed TPD, directly or through TPC, controls all terminals and direct cargo-handling operations. TPG still directly controls most of the utility, support and ancillary units related to the Port, and retains control of strategic planning. TPG is also directly or indirectly a party in 53 joint ventures\n\n\n== Port operations ==\n\nThe subsidiaries and partial-ownership partners of TPG are involved in all facets of port operation, including stevedoring, shipping agency, cargo handling, storage and transportation, infrastructure management, communications and information services, financial services, power supply, real estate development, health care, personnel training, education, port security, transportation, fire protection, port facilities management, environmental management, etc.The core activity of the Port is, naturally, cargo handling and processing. As a comprehensive port, it handles all sort of cargoes, including dry and liquid bulk, general cargo, containers, vehicles, and passengers. Tianjin Port operates 365 days a year, 24 hours a day (on three shifts at 00:00\u201308:00, 08:00\u201316:00 and 16:00\u201324:00).\n\n\n=== Port production ===\nDocking terminals and wharves: As of 2011, the Port had 217 berths (including service berths); 90 berths were capable of accommodating ships over 10,000 DWT. Of these, 72 could dock ships over 50,000 DWT; 30 over 100,000 DWT, 23 over 150,000 DWT, 5 over 200,000 DWT, and 2 over 300,000 DWT.The Port's docking terminals are operated by autonomous companies that are mostly either fully owned by, or are joint ventures with, TPC or TPD. While the 2004 Port Law allowed full foreign ownership of port facilities, TPG is still the majority shareholder of all but a few of the Port's main terminals, excepting single-company (customs type II) terminals. Additional stevedoring personnel is provided by a number of labor services companies affiliated to various operators.\nSecondary wharves tend to the service, supply and maintenance ships that a complex port needs to function. These facilities range from temporary sand unloading wharves, needed for construction, to large bunkering wharves, workboat stations and the bases of the various law enforcement agencies.\nScheduling and Dispatching: The Tianjin Port Group's Operations Department (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u96c6\u56e2\u4e1a\u52a1\u90e8) is in charge of coordinating the productive operation of the Port, and must be informed of all ship movements and major operations. The production schedule (ship movement plan) is arranged by the TPG Dispatch Control Center (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u96c6\u56e2\u751f\u4ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u6307\u4e2d\u5fc3), in coordination with the wharf operators, the MSA, and the pilot center. The Dispatch Center organizes ship movements, tracks pilotage operations, and supervises terminal operations via real-time CCTV monitoring. The Dagukou port area has a separate dispatching center (\u5929\u6d25\u4e34\u6e2f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u533a\u8239\u8236\u8c03\u5ea6\u6307\u6325\u4e2d\u5fc3).\n\nHarbor Craft: The main provider of harbor craft is the Tianjin Port Tug & Lighter Company. The TTLC operates the harbor tugs, fireboats, pilot boats and other ancillary craft such as the crew boat\nXinbinhai, or the sightseeing boat Xinhaimen (used for inspection and visiting VIPs). The company operates 26 harbor tugs (between 2,600 HP and 6,000 HP of power), 5 pilot ships, 7 other ancillary crafts, 2 floating cranes (120 t and 200 t capacity); and around three dozen lighters, the largest around 1,340 t displacement. The Dagusha channel is served by a subsidiary company of TTLC, the Tianjin Lingang Tug Company (\u5929\u6d25\u4e34\u6e2f\u62d6\u8f6e\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), operating four tugboats.Other work vessels: CNOOC Bohai Oil maintains a flotilla of 110 offshore support vessels (OSV), many homeported at Tianjin. These boats are available for emergency work under MSA authority. Two of CNOOC's floating cranes (800 tonnes and 500 tonnes) can be commercially engaged for harbor duty.\n\n\n=== Port maintenance and construction ===\nFacilities management: TPG operates as the port landlord, and provides most utilities, municipal services and ancillary services to the various port operators. The services it provides are very wide in scope, spanning everything from electrical power, to construction materials, to printing services. The main organ of TPG's landlord function is the Tianjin Port Facilities Management Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ba1\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u516c\u53f8), which manages and maintains all municipal services  \u2014 including roads, railroads, bridges, water, and sewerage \u2014 installs and maintains wharf equipment and other production material, provides municipal administration, and provides engineering consultancy services.Hydrographic Surveying and Charting: As an artificial port dependent on dredged channels susceptible to silting, continuous depth surveying is critical to the Port. Tianjin Port is the base of the Beihai Navigational Security Center's Tianjin Marine Survey and Charting Center (\u5317\u6d77\u822a\u6d77\u4fdd\u969c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u4e8b\u6d4b\u7ed8\u4e2d\u5fc3) with responsibility for the hydrographic surveying, monitoring, fairway sounding and charting of all waters and shipping channels in the Beihai (Northern Seas) area, which includes the Bohai and Yellow seas. As of 2011, the Hydrographic Brigade had 149 personnel, two survey ships (Haice 051 and Haice 0502), surveying equipment including ROVs, and UAVs for aerial surveyingChannel maintenance: The Tianjin Dredging Company  (\u5929\u6d25\u822a\u9053\u5c40) is the organic waterway management company of the Tianjin Port Group. As of January 2010, the TDC deployed 100 boats, and had the largest dredging capacity of China, with a capacity of 300 million cubic meters and more than 500,000 kW of vessel power. Despite these numbers, the scale of fairway expansion and land reclamation in the Port means that several other construction companies operate large numbers of dredging vessels as well.Dredging the Haihe Channel is the responsibility of the Tianjin Municipal Water Management Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u6c34\u52a1\u5c40), which maintains both navigability and river flow capacity (set at 800 m3/s). The Water Management dredgers operate from wharves at the Haihe Second Barrier and at the Haihe Tidal Barrier.Icebreaking: Routine icebreaking is usually handled by the Tug & Lighter Company. In case of ice emergencies, the MSA coordinates icebreaking patrols, using heavy harbor tugs and dredges. During the frozen winter of 2010\u201311, the Port authorities estimated that there were 16 ships with icebreaking capabilities available, 10 of which belonged to the TTLC. CNOOC Bohai had 24 icebreakers, needed to clear offshore platforms, and also lent two larger icebreakers to the Port.Port Construction: The Port's main construction and engineering outfit is CCCC First Harbor Engineering (\u4e2d\u4ea4\u7b2c\u4e00\u822a\u52a1\u5de5\u7a0b\u5c40\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8).\n Four subsidiary companies carry out all forms of project engineering and construction, from roads to breakwaters. As of 2010, First Harbor Engineering First Company (the main boat outfit) had a fleet of 74 work vessels. As in the case of dredgers, the sheer scale of construction in the Port means that many other outfits deploy hundreds of vessels. As of 2008, there were 418 construction vessels operating at the Port, including 236 sand barges and fluvial workboats.The Tianjin Research Institute for Water Transport Engineering is in charge of the technical supervision of most port engineering projects.\nReal Estate Development: Commercial and residential property development in newly reclaimed or repurposed land is one of the four core \"industries\" of the Port. The Tianjin Port Real Estate Development Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u5730\u4ea7\u53d1\u5c55\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), founded 2009, is now very active in developing both residential and commercial property on Port land.\n\n\n=== Services and amenities ===\n\nBunkerage: The main bunker oil, lubricants and water provider in Tianjin Port is Tianjin Chimbusco (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8239\u8236\u71c3\u6599\u4f9b\u5e94\u5929\u6d25\u516c\u53f8). Chimbusco China had a monopoly on the supply of bonded bunker oil (i.e. for foreign vessels) in China until 2006. Tianjin Chimbusco (now a TPG subsidiary) retained its exclusive rights in Tianjin until 2009, and the end of the monopoly resulted in a black gold rush of competing bunkerage companies: Sinopec Zhoushan entered the Tianjin market in October 2010, followed in December 2010 by SinoBunker, and in June 2011, by China Changjiang Bunker. This sudden rise in competition resulted in a serious price war and crashing prices in 2011. Most forms of maritime fuels are available, primarily IFO 180 cSt and 380 cSt; IFO 120 cSt, MDG, MDO and other diesels are available. Bunkering operations are done by fuel tender, as most berths do not have fueling equipment. Equally, drinking water is mostly delivered by tender.\nChandlery and Supplies: Several dozen ship chandlers are capable of supplying all necessary deck, engine and cabin stores, and all other provisions both at berth or at anchorage. The oldest international chandler is Tianjin Ocean Shipping Supply company (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u5916\u8f6e\u4f9b\u5e94\u516c\u53f8), owned by the Tianjin government. Most spare parts are available locally, and special orders can be flown in easily.\nCleaning and Sanitation Services: Bilge, slops and ballast water disposal is a major pollution hazard for the Bohai Bay, and it is tightly regulated by the MSA. Only specially authorized enterprises can engage in their removal and disposal, or in tank cleanup. Nevertheless, illegal dumping of ballast water is a persistent problem and one of the Port's major law enforcement challenges. Ships carrying oil or liquid chemicals, and all ships over 10,000 gt are required to sign an \"Agreement for Ship Pollution Response\" with one of four authorized emergency spill response companies.Tianjin Port Harbor Service Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u6e2f\u53e3\u670d\u52a1\u516c\u53f8) is the Group's organic \"housekeeping\" service, providing cabin, hold and bedding clean-up, and garbage disposal for ships at berth. Other companies are available for all sorts of cleaning, disinfection and deck maintenance, fifteen companies are authorized for ship garbage collection.Seafarers:  As the port of a major city, facilities available to crews on shore leave are extensive, if somewhat difficult to reach. The International Seamen's Club (\u5929\u6d25\u65b0\u6e2f\u56fd\u9645\u6d77\u5458\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8) is located at Xingang Liumi Road, opposite the Bomesc shipyard. Around two dozen crew management companies provide replacement crews at all times.\n\n\n=== Ship repair and shipbuilding facilities ===\n\nTianjin Port has several ship repair and shipbuilding facilities capable of carrying out almost all forms of ship repair and refitting for all but the largest ships, and those capabilities are increasing rapidly.\nThe Tanggu port area was one of the earliest modern shipbuilding areas of China. The still-functioning Taku Dockyard (now the Tianjin City Shipyard) was founded in 1880, and is the oldest modern dockyard in Northern China. Many small shipyards operated in the Haihe region, but most have closed in recent years, or will soon close to make way for the large development projects of the Binhai Urban Core.\nThe main ship repair facility in the port is the CSIC Tianjin Xingang Shipyard. Founded in 1939, it is located at the very end of the main harbor basin, right next to the Haihe shiplock. Immediately next to it is the CCCC Bomesc Maritime Industry's facility (built in 2007). On the Nanjiang region, Singapore's Sembawang Shipyard entered in 1997 to the first foreign joint shipyard project in China, in partnership with Bohai Oil. That shipyard is now the CNOOC Bohai Oil BOHIC subsidiary.A large number of ship repair companies offer maintenance services at berth, and the Tianjin Wuzhou Marine Service Engineering Co. (\u5929\u6d25\u4e94\u6d32\u6d77\u4e8b\u5de5\u7a0b\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8) offers anchorage and under-way repairs using its specialized ship Jinyuanhangxiu 1 (\u6d25\u8fdc\u822a\u4fee1\u53f7), one of only five such vessels in China.\n\n\n=== Trade and shipping services ===\nOne of the strategic goals of the Port is to increase its high value-added services business, providing advance support for all forms of logistic activities.\nThe Tianjin International Trade and Shipping Service District (\u5929\u6d25 \u4e0e\u822a\u8fd0\u670d\u52a1\u533a) The Service District is composed of nine high-rise buildings, including the TPG main office building and the International Shipping Service Center.\n\nThe Tianjin International Trade and Shipping Service Center (\u5929\u6d25\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u4e0e\u822a\u8fd0\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fc3) provides \"one-stop\" service for all sorts of aspects of shipping and trade, with a core mission of centralizing and streamlining the clearance process. The Center aggregates 270 government service windows from 14 government agencies, including customs, inspection and quarantine, maritime safety, border control, traffic control, maritime court, electronic customs clearance, business taxes, and state audit and supervision.\nThe Dongjiang shipping services area is still under development, and aims to form a cluster of specific shipping services. Taking advantage of its favorable tax and currency exchange regime, the Dongjiang Bonded Port intends to attract a cluster of enterprises related to the financing of ship leasing and shipbroking, and to other forms of shipping financing, including offshore financial services, offshore banking, marine insurers and P&I clubs, ship registration, local offices of the leading classification societies, etc.Shipping Agencies: Engaging a shipping agent is mandatory for all foreign flagged ships, and Tianjin has several dozen such outfits operating at present. The largest agents are Tianjin Penavico (\u5929\u6d25\u5916\u8f6e\u4ee3\u7406\u516c\u53f8), owned by TPG, and Tianjin Sinoagent (\u5929\u6d25\u8239\u52a1\u4ee3\u7406\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), a subsidiary of Tianjin Sinotrans. Agencies have fairly extensive obligations as intermediaries for most paperwork procedures involving TPG, ship operators, or government agencies, as well as their traditional duties of arranging ship supply and cargo handling.\n\n\n== Passenger services ==\n\n\n=== Passenger terminals ===\n\nThe Tianjin Xingang Passenger Terminal (\u5929\u6d25\u65b0\u6e2f\u5ba2\u8fd0\u7ad9) is run by the Tianjin Passenger Company, and provides ferry services and coastal cruises.  Two main regular ferry lines and one summer-only ferry line leave Tianjin, serviced by a fleet of three Ro-Ro ferry boats.  There are two international destinations, Kobe in Japan and Incheon in South Korea, and one national destination, Dalian in Liaoning Province.\n\nThe new Tianjin Cruise Homeport started operation in the summer of 2010. It is located in the southern tip of the Dongjiang peninsula. The all-services terminal building is a large white GFRC-clad building designed to mimic the flow of white silk on an ocean breeze. It has an annual capacity of 500,000 passengers. At present, the Homeport has two berths capable of accommodating ships up to 220,000 gt \u2014enough to receive even the largest current cruisers.\n\n\n=== Leisure services ===\nYachting marinas: There are three large-scale marina projects underway at the Tianjin Port to expand yachting services.\nThe Binhai Ocean One Yachting Club (\u6ee8\u6d77\u4e00\u6d0b\u6e38\u8247\u4f1a) is being built at the southern end of the Dongjiang Scenic Area's artificial beach. It is planned to become a yachting port with 700 berths, plus an extra 200 pile mooring slots.\nThe Sino-Australia Royal Yacht City (\u4e2d\u6fb3\u7687\u5bb6\u6e38\u8247\u57ce) is a 1,000-berth development (to be completed in 2012) in the Tianjin Central Fishing Port.\nThe Hi-speed Tianjin Yacht City (\u6d77\u65af\u6bd4\u5929\u6d25\u6e38\u8247\u57ce) in the Binhai Tourist Area plans to add 3,000 berths, focusing on high-speed boats, sailboats and high-performance yachts.Sightseeing tours: Two companies offer short (30-45min) boat tours of the harbor, traveling to the end of the Chuanzhadong channel. The first, Tianjin Port Haiyi Travel Service Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u6d77\u9890\u65c5\u884c\u793e\u516c\u53f8), a TPG subsidiary, runs the sightseeing boat Haiyi (\u6d77\u9890\u53f7) from the K1 berth of the Passenger Terminal, with capacity for 132 passengers (CN\u00a5 30 as of November 2011). The second, Tianjin Haihe Jinlu Sightseeing Boats Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u6cb3\u6d25\u65c5\u6e38\u8239\u516c\u53f8) operates from the Sightseeing Boats Pier at the other side of the main basin. It runs two ships, the Haijing (\u6d77\u666f\u53f7) with capacity for 150 passengers and the Jinhai (\u6d25\u6d77\u53f7) with capacity for 184 passengers. CN\u00a5 50 as of April 2011.\n\n\n== Transportation and logistics ==\n\nStorage, transportation and all forms of logistics processing are the core activity of the Port, and it is no surprise that the majority of its land surface is dedicated to storage and processing facilities, with several million km2 of storage yards, warehouses and tank farms operated by dozens of enterprises. There are two large-scale purpose-built logistics areas designed to provide support and facilities to the operating logistics outfits.\nThe chief logistics unit of the Port Group is Tianjin Logistics Development Co. , established in 2009 by merging the Tianjin Port Storage and Distribution Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u8d27\u8fd0\u516c\u53f8) with other Group logistics assets. TLD runs 1,800,000 m2 of storage yard, with a capacity for 32,000 TEU of containers, and is responsible for the establishment and management of the dry port network and the establishment of intermodal routes, as well as being the principal drayage provider.\n\n\n=== Transportation corridors ===\n\nSea routes: Two main sea routes connect the Bohai Bay with the Yellow Sea and the open ocean. These two routes carry the large majority of all traffic in and out of the Bohai Sea, and can be very crowded. The main deep-water route (6 nmi wide) goes from the Laotieshan Channel (38\u00b036.1\u2032 N, 120\u00b051.3\u2032 E) at a 276\u00b0 bearing until reaching a Traffic Separation Scheme south of Caofeidian (38\u00b048.0\u2032 N/118\u00b045.2\u2032 E), and can be quite a crowded waterway. A second main route (3 NM wide westward, 3 NM wide eastward) goes westward from Changshan channel (38\u00b005.0\u2032 N/120\u00b024.6\u2032 E) at a 293.5\u00b0 bearing up to a point north of oil platform BZ28-1 (38\u00b021.0\u2032 N/119\u00b038.5\u2032 E), continuing at a 291\u00b0 bearing up to the south of Caofedian Head (38\u00b038.7\u2032 N/118\u00b038.4\u2032 E) and then into the Xingang Main Channel.Internal waterways: The three main port areas are fairly poorly connected by road, requiring rather long detours to transport any cargo or equipment between them. While several bridges and tunnels directly linking Dongjiang with Beijiang and Nanjiang areas are projected for future development, these are still in early planning stages. To help relieve this internal bottleneck, in April 2010 the Port introduced a lighter route connecting Nanjiang (N-10 berth) and Beijiang (Tianjin Container Terminal), using one heavy barge (7800 DWT, 200 TEU). Another regular lighter route connecting Beijiang with Dongjiang was established in September 2010.\n\nRailroads: Two main lines (First and Second Port Railroads: \u8fdb\u6e2f\u4e00\u4e8c\u7ebf) serve the Beijiang and Nanjiang areas respectively. The Jinji Railway connects these lines as a de facto ring railroad. A web of around 60 km of internal railways goes deep into the wharves and storage yards of the Beijiang area. The Nanjiang area is primarily connected through the Nanjiang Rail Bridge. This bridge was expanded to double-track in 2010, for an annual capacity of 70 million tonnes. A second bridge is under construction. A conveyor belt corridor runs parallel to the railway, carrying coal and ore to the Bulk Logistics Center.Highways and roads: The internal roads in the Port carry an enormously heavy, noisy and noisome flow of traffic, and traffic jams are not uncommon at certain bottlenecks. The internal roads at the three main Port areas form a broken grid pattern, the east-west roads connecting with the expressways that feed the port. The main north-south roads are the Yuejin road transfixing the Container Logistics Center, the Meizhou (Americas) Road in the Dongjiang Area.\nThe backbone road of the Port is the S11 Haibin Expressway (\u6d77\u6ee8\u9ad8\u901f), which runs north-south and roughly represents the Port's western boundary. The main east-west feeder roads are the S40 Jingjintang Expressway (\u4eac\u6d25\u5858\u9ad8\u901f), which merges into the Jingmen road; the S13 Jinbin Expressway ( \u6d25\u6ee8\u9ad8\u901f) and the G103 Highway, which both merge into the Xingang Fourth Road; and the S30 Jingjin Expressway (\u4eac\u6d25\u9ad8\u901f), which becomes the Jishuanggang road and then the Xingang 8th Road into Dongjiang. In the south, the Tianjin Avenue and the S50 Jinpu Expressway (\u6d25\u6d66\u9ad8\u901f) connect into the Nanjiang and Lingang areas.\nThese feeder roads connect in turn with the thick Beijing-Tianjin road hub, with seven radial expressways from Beijing and four from Tianjin. Of these, the Jinji Expressway (S1) is the main alternative route into Beijing (through Pinggu) and the Northwest (through the 6th Ring Road and the G6 Jingla Expressway), while the G25 Changzhen Expressway is the main North-South connector.\nAirports: The Port is 30 minutes away from Tianjin Binhai International Airport, and 120 min from Beijing Capital International Airport. Two small general aviation aerodromes\u2014Tanggu Airport (\u5858\u6cbd\u673a\u573a) and Binhai Eastern General Heliport (\u6ee8\u6d77\u4e1c\u65b9\u901a\u7528\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u573a)\u2014 provide offshore helicopter shuttles and other services to Port operators.\n\n\n=== Logistics centers, yards and warehouses ===\n\nThe Tianjin Port Container Logistics Center (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3) is located in the north part of the Beijiang area, in 7.03  km\u00b2 of reclaimed land. The Center currently hosts 42 logistics enterprises, and it has 350 hectares of yard space, 26 hectares of warehouses, or about 60% of the Port's container handling capacity. Tianjin Port International Logistics Development Co. Ltd.  (TPL) was established in 2003 to take charge of the development, construction, operation and management of the Center.The Tianjin Port Bulk Logistics Center (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u6563\u8d27\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3) opened in 2000, built on 26.8  km2 of former salt flats to the south of Donggu. It serves as a large storage and distribution area for coal, ore and other bulk cargoes. As of April 2011, there were 268 enterprises operating within it. The Bulk Logistics Center is being progressively relocated south, to the Nangang area, to free its land for urban development (i. e. the Binhai Central New Town \u2013 \u6ee8\u6d77\u4e2d\u90e8\u65b0\u57ce)\nThe 12-5 plan envisages six large logistics parks in the port area by 2015: the Container Logistics and Bulk Cargo Centers will be upgraded to \"Parks\" (with additional policy privileges), joined by the newly established Nangang Chemical Logistics Park (\u5357\u6e2f\u5316\u5de5\u7269\u6d41\u56ed\u533a), Lingang Industrial ProLogis Logistics Park (\u4e34\u6e2f\u5de5\u4e1a\u666e\u6d1b\u65af\u7269\u6d41\u56ed\u533a), and the Central Fishing Port Logistics Park (\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6e14\u6e2f\u7269\u6d41\u56ed\u533a).\n\n\n=== Intermodal transportation and dry ports ===\nEconomic Hinterland: The hinterland of the Tianjin Port (as determined by existing railway and road patterns) is vast. It includes the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, and the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, Tibet and Xinjiang, amounting to over 5 million km2, or 52\uff05 of China's area, and covering 17% of the country's population. Tianjin is also one of the railheads of the Eurasian Land Bridge.Dedicated Container Train Routes: TPL owns and operates 15 different scheduled railway routes, dispatching 50-car (100 TEU) trains to 15 different cities in China, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Taiyuan, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, Baotou, Shizuishan, Erenhot, Alashankou, and Manzhouli, the last three being border crossings. In the first half of 2011, these dedicated train lines carried 129,000 TEU, including cargoes for Eurasian destinations.Dry Ports: As of October 2011, Tianjin Port had established 21 dry ports, of which 8 were fully operational. These ports are located at:\n\nChaoyang (Beijing)\nPinggu (Beijing)\nBaoding (Hebei)\nShijiazhuang (Hebei)\nZhangjiakou (Hebei)\nHandan (Hebei)\nZibo (Shandong)\nDezhou (Shandong)\nZhengzhou (Henan)\nHebi (Henan)\nDaqing(Heilongjiang)\nBaotou (Inner Mongolia)\nBayannur (Inner Mongolia)\nErenhot (Inner Mongolia)\nHouma (Shanxi)\nXi'an (Shaanxi)\nDatong (Shaanxi)\nJiayuguan (Gansu)\nYinchuan (Ningxia)\nHuinong (Ningxia)\nDulat (Xinjiang)Erenhot and Dulat are border crossings. In 2010, the Tianjin dry ports processed 150,000 TEU worth of containers. The 12th five-year plan envisages increasing throughput by Tianjin's dry ports to up to 1 million TEU by 2015.\n\n\n== Friendship ports ==\n Amsterdam, Netherlands\n Barcelona, Spain\n Incheon, South Korea\n Kobe, Japan\n Marseille, France\n Melbourne, Australia\n Montreal, Canada\n Philadelphia, United States\n Tacoma, United States\n Tokyo, Japan\n Trieste, Italy\n Zeebrugge, Belgium\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTianjin Port Holdings Company Limited\nTianjin Port Development Holdings Limited\nMap of the Port of Tianjin\nLive AIS Map of the Port of Tianjin",

          "When we were there at the Drum Tower previously, it wasn't open for visit. As such, we only walked around the tower to take pictures. Around the tower, it's like a flea market where many vendors laid their merchandise on the ground. We did not spend too much time there and",
          "I have been to the Drum Tower before but this day was disappointing. First, when I walked up you hear this horrible pop music. I would much prefer to hear Chinese cultural music. Then, as you walk past the vendor stalls, there wasn't much to look at. Plus, there was a lot of",

        "wiki": "The Hai River (\u6d77\u6cb3, lit. \"Sea River\"), also known as the Peiho, Pei Ho (\"White River\"), or Hai Ho,  is a Chinese river connecting Beijing to Tianjin and the Bohai Sea.\nThe Hai River at Tianjin is formed by the confluence of five rivers, the Southern Canal, Ziya River, Daqing River, Yongding River, and the Northern Canal. The southern and northern canals are parts of the Grand Canal. The Southern Canal is joined by the Wei River at Linqing. The Northern Canal joins with the Bai He (or Chaobai River) at Tongzhou. The Northern Canal (sharing a channel with Bai He) is also the only waterway from the sea to Beijing. Therefore, early Westerners also called the Hai He the Bai He.\nAt Tianjin, through the Grand Canal, the Hai connects with the Yellow and Yangtze rivers. The construction of the Grand Canal greatly altered the rivers of the Hai He basin.  Previously, the Wei, Ziya Yongding and Bai Rivers flowed separately to the sea.  The Grand Canal cut through the lower reaches of these rivers and fused them into one outlet to the sea, in the form of the current Hai He.\nThe Hai River is 1,329 kilometers (826 mi) long measured from the longest tributary. However, the Hai River is only around 70 kilometers (43 mi) from Tianjin to its estuary. Its basin has an area of approximately 319,000 km2 (123,000 sq mi).\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn 20 May 1858, the Pei-ho, as it was then known, was the scene of an invasion by Anglo-French forces during the Second Opium War whereby the Taku Forts were captured.In 1863 seagoing ships could reach the head of navigation at Tongzhou, but the crooked river was difficult for large vessels.\nDuring the Boxer Rebellion, Imperial Chinese forces deployed a weapon called \"electric mines\" on June 15, at the Baihe river before the Battle of Taku Forts (1900), to prevent the western Eight-Nation Alliance from sending ships to attack. This was reported by American military intelligence in the United States. War Dept. by the United States. Adjutant-General's Office. Military Information Division.Like the Yellow River, the Hai is exceedingly muddy because of the powdery soil through which it flows. The silt carried by the water deposits in the lower reaches, sometimes causing flooding. The waters from the five major tributaries only have one shallow outlet to the sea, which makes such floods stronger. Because China's capital (and second largest city), Beijing, and the third largest city, Tianjin, both lie in the Hai He Basin, Hai He floods cause a significant loss. To alleviate flooding, reservoirs have been built and artificial channels dug to divert excess water directly into the sea. For example, the Chaobai River is diverted to the Chaobai Xin River and no longer joins with the Northern Canal.\nDue to industrial and urban development in the Hai He Basin, the volume of water flow has greatly decreased. Many smaller tributaries and some of the major tributaries are dry for most of the year. With reduced water flow, water pollution worsens. The water shortage in the Hai He basin is expected to be alleviated by the South-North Water Transfer Project.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGeography of China\nTaku (Peiho) Forts\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from Publication, Issue 33 Document (United States.

        "wiki": "Tianjin ([t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n.t\u0255\u00edn] (listen)), alternately romanized as Tientsin, is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China on the shore of the Bohai Sea. It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted the East Asian Games, which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as \"National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area\". In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a major fire and explosion accident occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTianjin is located along the west coast of the Bohai Gulf, looking out to the provinces Shandong and Liaoning across those waters, bordered by Beijing 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border,  the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). There is 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. It lies at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the Yan Mountains intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak (\u4e5d\u9876\u5c71) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft).\nThe Hai River forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the Ziya River (\u5b50\u7259\u6cb3), Daqing River (\u5927\u6e05\u6cb3), Yongding River, North Grand Canal, and South Grand Canal, and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in Tanggu District. Major reservoirs include the Beidagang Reservoir in the extreme south (in Dagang District) and the Yuqiao Reservoir in the extreme north in Ji County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTianjin has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSk bordering on Dwa). It has a four-season, monsoon-influenced climate, typical of East Asia, with cold, windy, very dry winters reflecting the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone, and hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon. Spring in the city is dry and windy, occasionally seeing sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert, capable of lasting for several days. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from \u22123.4 \u00b0C (25.9 \u00b0F) in January to 26.8 \u00b0C (80.2 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.9 \u00b0C (55.2 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 48% in July to 61% in October, the city receives 2,522 hours of bright sunshine annually. Having a low annual total precipitation of 511 millimeters (20.1 in), and nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid zone, with parts of the municipality being humid continental (K\u00f6ppen BSk/Dwa, respectively).Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221222.9 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F) to 40.5 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Measures to improve air quality ===\nIn May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels. These measures included several restrictions on days of severe pollution; halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities.\n\nForeign-born professional sportsmen have made statements regarding Tianjin's air quality, citing it as an impediment to athletic activity and being thick enough to \"taste\".\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nTianjin is divided into 16 county-level divisions, which are all districts.\n\nIn addition, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) is not a formal level of administration, but nevertheless enjoys rights similar to a regular district. At the end of 2017, the total population of Tianjin is 15.57 million.[3]\n\nThese districts and counties are further subdivided, as of December 31, 2004, into 240 township-level divisions, including 120 towns, 18 townships, 2 ethnic townships and 100 subdistricts.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Tianjin is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in the mainland China.\nThe Mayor of Tianjin is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Tianjin. Since Tianjin is a municipality, the Communist Party of China Municipal Committee Secretary is colloquially termed the \"Tianjin CPC Party chief\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTianjin's GDP reached 1.572 trillion yuan in 2014, an increase of 10.0 percent over 2013. The city of Tianjin recorded China's highest per-capita GDP with $17,126, followed by Beijing with $16,278 and Shanghai with $15,847.\n\nMajor industries include petrochemical industries, textiles, car manufacturing, mechanical industries, and metalworking. EADS Airbus is an important manufacturer, and has opened an assembly plant for its Airbus A320 series airliners, operational since 2009. Tianjin also hit the news in 2010, as the current fastest supercomputer in the world, Tianhe-1A, is located at the National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin. GDP in 2009 hit \uffe5750.1 billion, with a per capita of RMB\uffe562,403.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area ===\n\nAs one of the first state-level economic and technological development zones, Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) was founded on December 6, 1984, with the approval of the State Council. It enjoys relevant state preferential policies with the major task of attracting domestic and foreign investment to develop high and new technology oriented modern industries. As an affiliated organ of the Tianjin Municipal Government, the Administrative Commission of Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area exercises unified administration of TEDA on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal Government and enjoys provincial-level administrative and economic management rights.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Export Processing Zone ===\nTianjin Export Processing Zone is one of the first 15 export processing zones approved by the State Council on April 27, 2000. This is a special enclosed zone where the Customs conduct 24-hour administration on commodities transported into and out of the zone and relevant places. The central government granted this special economic zone special preferential policies to attract enterprises in the business of processing and trade to invest in the zone. Tianjin Export Processing Zone is located to the northeast of TEDA with a planned area of 2.54 km2 (0.98 sq mi). The area developed in the first phase is 1 m2. A permanent wall is built to separate export processing zone and non-export processing zone.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Airport Economic Area ===\nTianjin Airport International Logistics Zone is jointly invested by Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone and Tianjin Binhai International Airport. It is located inside the airfreight area of Tianjin Binhai International Airport. It has domestic and foreign excellent airfreight logistics enterprises engaged in sorting, warehousing, distribution, processing, exhibition. It is in the process of constructing the largest airfreight base in northern China.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone ===\n Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone is the largest free trade zone in northern China as well as the only free trade zone in northern China. The zone was approved to be established in 1991 by State Council. It is 30 km (19 mi) from Tianjin city proper, less than 1 km (0.62 mi) away from the wharf and only 38 km (24 mi) away from Tianjin Binhai International Airport.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Tanggu National Marine High-Tech Development Area ===\nTianjin Tanggu Marine High-Tech Development Area was established in 1992, and was upgraded to the national-level high-tech development area by the State Council in 1995, it is the only national-level high-tech development area specializing in developing the marine Hi-Tech industry. By the end of 2008, the zone has 2068 corporations and has 5 industries there including new materials, oil manufacturing, modern machinery manufacturing, and electronic information.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Nangang Industrial Zone ===\nA heavy and chemical industry base and harbor; an important part of the \"dual-city, dual-harbor\"space development strategy of Tianjin, a demonstration zone of circular economy. The total planned area of Nangang Industrial Zone is 200 km2 (77 sq mi), of which the terrestrial area is 162 km2 (63 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nFarmland takes up about 40% of Tianjin Municipality's total area. Wheat, rice, and maize are the most important crops. Fishing is important along the coast.\n\n\n=== Resources ===\nTianjin Municipality also has deposits of about 1 billion tonnes of petroleum, with Dagang District containing important oilfields. Salt production is also important, with Changlu Yanqu being one of China's most important salt production areas. Geothermal energy is another resource of Tianjin. Deposits of manganese and boron under Tianjin were the first to be found in China.\n\n\n=== Binhai New Area ===\nTianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) is located in the juncture of the Beijing-Tianjin City Belt and the Circum-Bohai City Belt. It is the gateway to North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Lying in the center of Northeast Asia, it is the nearest point of departure of the Eurasian Continental Bridge.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the end of 2009, the population of Tianjin Municipality was 12.28 million, of which 9.8 million were residential holders of Tianjin hukou (permanent residence). Among Tianjin permanent residents, 5.99 million were urban, and 3.81 million were rural.  Tianjin has recently shifted to rapid population growth, its population has reached 14.72 million as of 2013 end.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 15.4 million.The majority of Tianjin residents are Han Chinese. There are also 51 out of the 55 minor Chinese ethnic groups living in Tianjin. Major minorities include Hui, Koreans, Manchus, and Mongols.\n\nThis excludes members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n\n== Media ==\nTianjin People's Broadcasting Station is the major radio station in Tianjin. Broadcasting in nine channels, it serves most of North China, part of East and Northeast China, reaching an audience of over 100 million. Tianjin Television, the local television station, broadcasts on nine channels. It also boasts a paid digital channel, featuring home improvement programs. Both the radio and television stations are now branches of the Tianjin Film, Radio and Television Group, established in October 2002.Major local newspapers include the Tianjin Daily and Jin Wan Bao (literally, tonight newspaper), which are the flagship papers of Tianjin Daily Newspaper Group and Jinwan Mass Media Group, respectively. There are also three English-language magazines: Jin, Tianjin Plus and Business Tianjin, mostly directed at ex-pats resident in the city.\n\n\n=== Previous newspapers ===\nThe first German newspaper in northern China, Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, was published in Tianjin.In 1912 Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and 5 daily newspapers in other languages; none of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers. Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News). Newspapers from Beijing published in Tianjin included Pei Ching Jih Pao, Peking Daily News, and Le Journal de Peking.In 1930, the newspaper Deutsch-Mandschurische Nachrichten moved from Harbin to Tianjin and changed its name to the Deutsch-Chinesische Nachrichten.\n\n\n=== Censorship capital ===\nMore and more, China's leading Internet information providers (usually located in Beijing), including social network Sina Weibo, Douban and the online video website Sohu, tend to relocate their censorship departments to Tianjin, where labor costs are cheaper than Beijing, as censorship is a kind of labor-intensive work. In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived. Despite its proximity to Beijing, the Tianjin dialect sounds quite different from the Beijing dialect, which provides the basis for Putonghua or Standard Chinese.\nTianjin is a respected home base of Beijing opera, one of the most prestigious forms of Chinese opera.\n\nTianjin is famous for its stand-up comedy and comedians including Guo Degang and Ma Sanli. Ma Sanli (1914\u20132003), an ethnic Hui and longtime resident of Tianjin, is renowned for his xiangsheng, a hugely popular form of Chinese entertainment akin to comedy. Ma Sanli delivered some of his xiangsheng in the Tianjin dialect. Tianjin, along with Beijing, is a center for the art of xiangsheng. Tianjin's style of stand-up also includes the use of rhythmic bamboo clappers, kuaiban.Yangliuqing (Green Willows), a town about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Tianjin's urban area and the seat of Xiqing District, is famous for its popular Chinese New Year-themed, traditional-style, colorful wash paintings (\u6768\u67f3\u9752\u5e74\u753b). Tianjin is also famous for the Zhang clay figurine, a type of intricate, colorful figurine depicting a variety of vivid characters, and Tianjin's Wei's kites, which can be folded to a fraction of their full sizes and are noted for portability.\nOn September 28, 2015, the Juilliard School in Manhattan, New York City announced a major expansion into Tianjin during a visit by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan, the institution's first such full-scale foray outside the United States, with plans to offer a master's degree program.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nTianjin cuisine places a heavy focus on seafood, due to Tianjin's proximity to the sea.  It can be further classified into several varieties, including the rough (Chinese: \u7c97; pinyin: c\u016b), smooth (simplified Chinese: \u7ec6; traditional Chinese: \u7d30; pinyin: x\u00ec), and high (Chinese: \u9ad8; pinyin: g\u0101o). Prominent menus include the Eight Great Bowls (Chinese: \u516b\u5927\u7897; pinyin: B\u0101d\u00e0 w\u01cen), a combination of eight mainly meat dishes, and the Four Great Stews (Chinese: \u56db\u5927\u6252; pinyin: s\u00ec d\u00e0 b\u0101), actually referring to a very large number of stews, including chicken, duck, seafood, beef, and mutton.\nThe four delicacies of Tianjin include Goubuli baozi, Guifaxiang Shibajie Mahua (Chinese: \u5341\u516b\u8857\u9ebb\u82b1; pinyin: sh\u00edb\u0101 ji\u0113 m\u00e1hu\u0101), Erduoyan Zhagao (Chinese: \u8033\u6735\u773c\u70b8\u7cd5; pinyin: erduoy\u01cen zh\u00e0 g\u0101o) and Maobuwen Jiaozi (Chinese: \u732b\u4e0d\u95fb\u997a\u5b50; pinyin: m\u0101o b\u00f9 w\u00e9n ji\u01ceozi). Well-known foods include Caoji donkey meat, Bazhen sheep-leg mutton of Guanshengyuan, Luji Tangmian Zhagao, Baiji Shuijiao, Gaogan of Zhilanzhai, Guobacai of Dafulai, Subao of Shitoumenkan and Xiaobao chestnut. These famous snacks are available in Nanshi Food Street, which was a famous calling-card of Tianjin in the aspect of cuisine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nTianjin Binhai International Airport is located in Dongli District roughly 13 km (8 mi) away from downtown area. The city will also be served by the new Beijing Daxing International Airport in Beijing, currently under construction and to be completed by late 2019.Tianjin Binhai International Airport now has a terminal building which covers an area of 25,000 m2 (269,000 sq ft), a merchandise warehouse which covers an area of 29,500 m2 (318,000 sq ft) and runways measuring 3.6 km (2.2 mi) in total. It has a grade 4E airstrip, which all kinds of large aircraft can take off from and land safely on. Tianjin Binhai International Airport has 59 flight routes, connecting 48 cities, including 30 domestic cities and 17 foreign cities. Airline companies like Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Korean Air, Asiana Airlines, Singapore Airlines Cargo and Martinair Holland all have flights to Tianjin Binhai International Airport.\n\n\n=== Port of Tianjin ===\n\nTianjin port is the world's top-level and China's largest artificial deep water harbor, and the throughput capacity ranks fifth in the world. Located in Binhai Economic Zone, a national new economic zone of China, Tianjin harbor is the port of call of international cruises visiting the wider area, including Beijing.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTianjin's harbor area of Binhai/TEDA has a modern, high speed rubber tired tram system, which is the first of its kind in China and Asia. Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.  Construction work on Line 2 and Line 3 was completed in 2012 and the two lines are now in operation. Several new metro lines are planned.\nThere was two rapid transit operators in Tianjin. In 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation.\n\nTianjin Metro General Corporation, operates Lines 1, 2, 3 and 6\nTianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company, operates Lines 5 and 9\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThere are several railway stations in the city, Tianjin railway station being the principal one. It was built in 1888. The station was initially located at Wangdaozhuang (simplified Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u5e84; traditional Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u838a; pinyin: W\u00e0ngd\u00e0ozhu\u0101ng). The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility and as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project involving Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9 as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-speed rail.\nTianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also major railway stations in Tianjin. There is also Tanggu railway station is located in the important port area of Tanggu District, and Binhai railway station and Binhai North railway station located in TEDA, to the north of Tanggu. There are several other railway stations in the city that do not handle passenger traffic. Construction on a Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail began on July 4, 2005 and was completed by August 2008.\nThe following rail lines go through Tianjin:\n\nJingshan Railway, from Beijing to Shanhai Pass\nJinpu Railway, from Tianjin to Pukou District, Nanjing\nJinji Railway, from Tianjin urban area to Ji County, Tianjin\nJinba Railway, from Tianjin to Bazhou, Hebei\nThe inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system: Cxxxx (C stands for interCity). The train numbers range between C2001\uff5eC2298:\n\nC2001\uff5eC2198: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, directly\nC2201\uff5eC2268: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, with stops at Wuqing Station (\u6b66\u6e05\u7ad9)\nC2271\uff5eC2298: From Beijing South Station to Yujiapu Railway Station of TianjinThe new C trains take only 30 min to travel between Beijing and Tianjin, cutting the previous D train time by more than a half. The ticket price as of Aug 15, 08 is 69 RMB for the first-class seat and 58 RMB for the second-class seat.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThere were over 900 bus lines in the city as of 2005.\n\n\n=== Roads and expressways ===\nSome roads and bridges have retained names that hark back to the Republic of China era (1912\u20131949) such as Minquan Gate and Beiyang Road. Like with most cities in China, many roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four cardinal directions.\nTianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections.

Growing up in a poverty-stricken family, her father died when she was at a young age and her single mother taught and practiced medicine. Deng studied at Beiyang Women's Normal School. Deng participated as a team leader in the May Fourth Movement, where she met Zhou Enlai in 1919. They married on 8 August 1925 in Guangzhou. She was a legal witness at the wedding of Ho Chi Minh and Zeng Xueming in 1926.\nDeng and Zhou had no children of their own. However, they adopted several orphans of \"revolutionary martyrs\", including Li Peng, who later became the Premier of the People's Republic of China. She promoted the abolition of foot binding imposed on women.\nShe died in Beijing at the age of 88.\nThere is a memorial hall dedicated to her and her husband in Tianjin (\u5929\u6d25\u5468\u6069\u4f86\u9127\u7a4e\u8d85\u7d00\u5ff5\u9928).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDeng Yingchao: a painting and a b/w photo\nExterior of the Memorial Hall",

        "wiki": "Tianjin ([t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n.t\u0255\u00edn] (listen)), alternately romanized as Tientsin, is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China on the shore of the Bohai Sea. It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted the East Asian Games, which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as \"National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area\". In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a major fire and explosion accident occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTianjin is located along the west coast of the Bohai Gulf, looking out to the provinces Shandong and Liaoning across those waters, bordered by Beijing 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border,  the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). There is 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. It lies at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the Yan Mountains intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak (\u4e5d\u9876\u5c71) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft).\nThe Hai River forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the Ziya River (\u5b50\u7259\u6cb3), Daqing River (\u5927\u6e05\u6cb3), Yongding River, North Grand Canal, and South Grand Canal, and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in Tanggu District. Major reservoirs include the Beidagang Reservoir in the extreme south (in Dagang District) and the Yuqiao Reservoir in the extreme north in Ji County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTianjin has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSk bordering on Dwa). It has a four-season, monsoon-influenced climate, typical of East Asia, with cold, windy, very dry winters reflecting the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone, and hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon. Spring in the city is dry and windy, occasionally seeing sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert, capable of lasting for several days. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from \u22123.4 \u00b0C (25.9 \u00b0F) in January to 26.8 \u00b0C (80.2 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.9 \u00b0C (55.2 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 48% in July to 61% in October, the city receives 2,522 hours of bright sunshine annually. Having a low annual total precipitation of 511 millimeters (20.1 in), and nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid zone, with parts of the municipality being humid continental (K\u00f6ppen BSk/Dwa, respectively).Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221222.9 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F) to 40.5 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Measures to improve air quality ===\nIn May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels. These measures included several restrictions on days of severe pollution; halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities.\n\nForeign-born professional sportsmen have made statements regarding Tianjin's air quality, citing it as an impediment to athletic activity and being thick enough to \"taste\".\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nTianjin is divided into 16 county-level divisions, which are all districts.\n\nIn addition, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) is not a formal level of administration, but nevertheless enjoys rights similar to a regular district. At the end of 2017, the total population of Tianjin is 15.57 million.[3]\n\nThese districts and counties are further subdivided, as of December 31, 2004, into 240 township-level divisions, including 120 towns, 18 townships, 2 ethnic townships and 100 subdistricts.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Tianjin is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in the mainland China.\nThe Mayor of Tianjin is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Tianjin. Since Tianjin is a municipality, the Communist Party of China Municipal Committee Secretary is colloquially termed the \"Tianjin CPC Party chief\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTianjin's GDP reached 1.572 trillion yuan in 2014, an increase of 10.0 percent over 2013. The city of Tianjin recorded China's highest per-capita GDP with $17,126, followed by Beijing with $16,278 and Shanghai with $15,847.\n\nMajor industries include petrochemical industries, textiles, car manufacturing, mechanical industries, and metalworking. EADS Airbus is an important manufacturer, and has opened an assembly plant for its Airbus A320 series airliners, operational since 2009. Tianjin also hit the news in 2010, as the current fastest supercomputer in the world, Tianhe-1A, is located at the National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin. GDP in 2009 hit \uffe5750.1 billion, with a per capita of RMB\uffe562,403.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area ===\n\nAs one of the first state-level economic and technological development zones, Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) was founded on December 6, 1984, with the approval of the State Council. It enjoys relevant state preferential policies with the major task of attracting domestic and foreign investment to develop high and new technology oriented modern industries. As an affiliated organ of the Tianjin Municipal Government, the Administrative Commission of Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area exercises unified administration of TEDA on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal Government and enjoys provincial-level administrative and economic management rights.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Export Processing Zone ===\nTianjin Export Processing Zone is one of the first 15 export processing zones approved by the State Council on April 27, 2000. This is a special enclosed zone where the Customs conduct 24-hour administration on commodities transported into and out of the zone and relevant places. The central government granted this special economic zone special preferential policies to attract enterprises in the business of processing and trade to invest in the zone. Tianjin Export Processing Zone is located to the northeast of TEDA with a planned area of 2.54 km2 (0.98 sq mi). The area developed in the first phase is 1 m2. A permanent wall is built to separate export processing zone and non-export processing zone.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Airport Economic Area ===\nTianjin Airport International Logistics Zone is jointly invested by Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone and Tianjin Binhai International Airport. It is located inside the airfreight area of Tianjin Binhai International Airport. It has domestic and foreign excellent airfreight logistics enterprises engaged in sorting, warehousing, distribution, processing, exhibition. It is in the process of constructing the largest airfreight base in northern China.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone ===\n Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone is the largest free trade zone in northern China as well as the only free trade zone in northern China. The zone was approved to be established in 1991 by State Council. It is 30 km (19 mi) from Tianjin city proper, less than 1 km (0.62 mi) away from the wharf and only 38 km (24 mi) away from Tianjin Binhai International Airport.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Tanggu National Marine High-Tech Development Area ===\nTianjin Tanggu Marine High-Tech Development Area was established in 1992, and was upgraded to the national-level high-tech development area by the State Council in 1995, it is the only national-level high-tech development area specializing in developing the marine Hi-Tech industry. By the end of 2008, the zone has 2068 corporations and has 5 industries there including new materials, oil manufacturing, modern machinery manufacturing, and electronic information.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Nangang Industrial Zone ===\nA heavy and chemical industry base and harbor; an important part of the \"dual-city, dual-harbor\"space development strategy of Tianjin, a demonstration zone of circular economy. The total planned area of Nangang Industrial Zone is 200 km2 (77 sq mi), of which the terrestrial area is 162 km2 (63 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nFarmland takes up about 40% of Tianjin Municipality's total area. Wheat, rice, and maize are the most important crops. Fishing is important along the coast.\n\n\n=== Resources ===\nTianjin Municipality also has deposits of about 1 billion tonnes of petroleum, with Dagang District containing important oilfields. Salt production is also important, with Changlu Yanqu being one of China's most important salt production areas. Geothermal energy is another resource of Tianjin. Deposits of manganese and boron under Tianjin were the first to be found in China.\n\n\n=== Binhai New Area ===\nTianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) is located in the juncture of the Beijing-Tianjin City Belt and the Circum-Bohai City Belt. It is the gateway to North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Lying in the center of Northeast Asia, it is the nearest point of departure of the Eurasian Continental Bridge.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the end of 2009, the population of Tianjin Municipality was 12.28 million, of which 9.8 million were residential holders of Tianjin hukou (permanent residence). Among Tianjin permanent residents, 5.99 million were urban, and 3.81 million were rural.  Tianjin has recently shifted to rapid population growth, its population has reached 14.72 million as of 2013 end.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 15.4 million.The majority of Tianjin residents are Han Chinese. There are also 51 out of the 55 minor Chinese ethnic groups living in Tianjin. Major minorities include Hui, Koreans, Manchus, and Mongols.\n\nThis excludes members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n\n== Media ==\nTianjin People's Broadcasting Station is the major radio station in Tianjin. Broadcasting in nine channels, it serves most of North China, part of East and Northeast China, reaching an audience of over 100 million. Tianjin Television, the local television station, broadcasts on nine channels. It also boasts a paid digital channel, featuring home improvement programs. Both the radio and television stations are now branches of the Tianjin Film, Radio and Television Group, established in October 2002.Major local newspapers include the Tianjin Daily and Jin Wan Bao (literally, tonight newspaper), which are the flagship papers of Tianjin Daily Newspaper Group and Jinwan Mass Media Group, respectively. There are also three English-language magazines: Jin, Tianjin Plus and Business Tianjin, mostly directed at ex-pats resident in the city.\n\n\n=== Previous newspapers ===\nThe first German newspaper in northern China, Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, was published in Tianjin.In 1912 Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and 5 daily newspapers in other languages; none of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers. Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News). Newspapers from Beijing published in Tianjin included Pei Ching Jih Pao, Peking Daily News, and Le Journal de Peking.In 1930, the newspaper Deutsch-Mandschurische Nachrichten moved from Harbin to Tianjin and changed its name to the Deutsch-Chinesische Nachrichten.\n\n\n=== Censorship capital ===\nMore and more, China's leading Internet information providers (usually located in Beijing), including social network Sina Weibo, Douban and the online video website Sohu, tend to relocate their censorship departments to Tianjin, where labor costs are cheaper than Beijing, as censorship is a kind of labor-intensive work. In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived. Despite its proximity to Beijing, the Tianjin dialect sounds quite different from the Beijing dialect, which provides the basis for Putonghua or Standard Chinese.\nTianjin is a respected home base of Beijing opera, one of the most prestigious forms of Chinese opera.\n\nTianjin is famous for its stand-up comedy and comedians including Guo Degang and Ma Sanli. Ma Sanli (1914\u20132003), an ethnic Hui and longtime resident of Tianjin, is renowned for his xiangsheng, a hugely popular form of Chinese entertainment akin to comedy. Ma Sanli delivered some of his xiangsheng in the Tianjin dialect. Tianjin, along with Beijing, is a center for the art of xiangsheng. Tianjin's style of stand-up also includes the use of rhythmic bamboo clappers, kuaiban.Yangliuqing (Green Willows), a town about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Tianjin's urban area and the seat of Xiqing District, is famous for its popular Chinese New Year-themed, traditional-style, colorful wash paintings (\u6768\u67f3\u9752\u5e74\u753b). Tianjin is also famous for the Zhang clay figurine, a type of intricate, colorful figurine depicting a variety of vivid characters, and Tianjin's Wei's kites, which can be folded to a fraction of their full sizes and are noted for portability.\nOn September 28, 2015, the Juilliard School in Manhattan, New York City announced a major expansion into Tianjin during a visit by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan, the institution's first such full-scale foray outside the United States, with plans to offer a master's degree program.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nTianjin cuisine places a heavy focus on seafood, due to Tianjin's proximity to the sea.  It can be further classified into several varieties, including the rough (Chinese: \u7c97; pinyin: c\u016b), smooth (simplified Chinese: \u7ec6; traditional Chinese: \u7d30; pinyin: x\u00ec), and high (Chinese: \u9ad8; pinyin: g\u0101o). Prominent menus include the Eight Great Bowls (Chinese: \u516b\u5927\u7897; pinyin: B\u0101d\u00e0 w\u01cen), a combination of eight mainly meat dishes, and the Four Great Stews (Chinese: \u56db\u5927\u6252; pinyin: s\u00ec d\u00e0 b\u0101), actually referring to a very large number of stews, including chicken, duck, seafood, beef, and mutton.\nThe four delicacies of Tianjin include Goubuli baozi, Guifaxiang Shibajie Mahua (Chinese: \u5341\u516b\u8857\u9ebb\u82b1; pinyin: sh\u00edb\u0101 ji\u0113 m\u00e1hu\u0101), Erduoyan Zhagao (Chinese: \u8033\u6735\u773c\u70b8\u7cd5; pinyin: erduoy\u01cen zh\u00e0 g\u0101o) and Maobuwen Jiaozi (Chinese: \u732b\u4e0d\u95fb\u997a\u5b50; pinyin: m\u0101o b\u00f9 w\u00e9n ji\u01ceozi). Well-known foods include Caoji donkey meat, Bazhen sheep-leg mutton of Guanshengyuan, Luji Tangmian Zhagao, Baiji Shuijiao, Gaogan of Zhilanzhai, Guobacai of Dafulai, Subao of Shitoumenkan and Xiaobao chestnut. These famous snacks are available in Nanshi Food Street, which was a famous calling-card of Tianjin in the aspect of cuisine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nTianjin Binhai International Airport is located in Dongli District roughly 13 km (8 mi) away from downtown area. The city will also be served by the new Beijing Daxing International Airport in Beijing, currently under construction and to be completed by late 2019.Tianjin Binhai International Airport now has a terminal building which covers an area of 25,000 m2 (269,000 sq ft), a merchandise warehouse which covers an area of 29,500 m2 (318,000 sq ft) and runways measuring 3.6 km (2.2 mi) in total. It has a grade 4E airstrip, which all kinds of large aircraft can take off from and land safely on. Tianjin Binhai International Airport has 59 flight routes, connecting 48 cities, including 30 domestic cities and 17 foreign cities. Airline companies like Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Korean Air, Asiana Airlines, Singapore Airlines Cargo and Martinair Holland all have flights to Tianjin Binhai International Airport.\n\n\n=== Port of Tianjin ===\n\nTianjin port is the world's top-level and China's largest artificial deep water harbor, and the throughput capacity ranks fifth in the world. Located in Binhai Economic Zone, a national new economic zone of China, Tianjin harbor is the port of call of international cruises visiting the wider area, including Beijing.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTianjin's harbor area of Binhai/TEDA has a modern, high speed rubber tired tram system, which is the first of its kind in China and Asia. Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.  Construction work on Line 2 and Line 3 was completed in 2012 and the two lines are now in operation. Several new metro lines are planned.\nThere was two rapid transit operators in Tianjin. In 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation.\n\nTianjin Metro General Corporation, operates Lines 1, 2, 3 and 6\nTianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company, operates Lines 5 and 9\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThere are several railway stations in the city, Tianjin railway station being the principal one. It was built in 1888. The station was initially located at Wangdaozhuang (simplified Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u5e84; traditional Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u838a; pinyin: W\u00e0ngd\u00e0ozhu\u0101ng). The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility and as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project involving Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9 as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-speed rail.\nTianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also major railway stations in Tianjin. There is also Tanggu railway station is located in the important port area of Tanggu District, and Binhai railway station and Binhai North railway station located in TEDA, to the north of Tanggu. There are several other railway stations in the city that do not handle passenger traffic. Construction on a Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail began on July 4, 2005 and was completed by August 2008.\nThe following rail lines go through Tianjin:\n\nJingshan Railway, from Beijing to Shanhai Pass\nJinpu Railway, from Tianjin to Pukou District, Nanjing\nJinji Railway, from Tianjin urban area to Ji County, Tianjin\nJinba Railway, from Tianjin to Bazhou, Hebei\nThe inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system: Cxxxx (C stands for interCity). The train numbers range between C2001\uff5eC2298:\n\nC2001\uff5eC2198: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, directly\nC2201\uff5eC2268: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, with stops at Wuqing Station (\u6b66\u6e05\u7ad9)\nC2271\uff5eC2298: From Beijing South Station to Yujiapu Railway Station of TianjinThe new C trains take only 30 min to travel between Beijing and Tianjin, cutting the previous D train time by more than a half. The ticket price as of Aug 15, 08 is 69 RMB for the first-class seat and 58 RMB for the second-class seat.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThere were over 900 bus lines in the city as of 2005.\n\n\n=== Roads and expressways ===\nSome roads and bridges have retained names that hark back to the Republic of China era (1912\u20131949) such as Minquan Gate and Beiyang Road. Like with most cities in China, many roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four cardinal directions.\nTianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is the closest thing to a highway-level ring road, although traffic is often chaotic.\n\nInner Ring Road (neihuan)\nMiddle Ring Road (zhonghuan)\nOuter Ring Road (waihuan)Tianjin's roads often finish in dao (Chinese: \u9053; lit.: 'avenue'), xian (simplified Chinese: \u7ebf; traditional Chinese: \u7dda; lit.: 'line'). These are most often used for highways and through routes. The terms lu (Chinese: \u8def; lit.: 'road'). Jie (Chinese: \u8857; lit.: 'street') are rare. As Tianjin's roads are rarely in a cardinal compass direction, jing (simplified Chinese: \u7ecf; traditional Chinese: \u7d93; lit.: 'avenue') roads and wei (simplified Chinese: \u7eac; traditional Chinese: \u7def; lit.: 'avenue') roads often appear, which attempt to run more directly north\u2013south and east\u2013west, respectively.\nThe following seven expressways of China run in or through Tianjin:\n\nJingjintang Expressway, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District / TEDA\nJinghu Expressway, from Jinjing Gonglu Bridge to Shanghai (together with Jingjintang Expressway, this is the expressway from Beijing to Shanghai)\nJingshen Expressway, through Baodi District on its way from Beijing to Shenyang\nTangjin Expressway, from Tanggu District, Tianjin, to Tangshan, Hebei\u2014known in Tianjin as the Jintang Expressway\nBaojin Expressway, from Beichen District, Tianjin, to Baoding, Hebei\u2014known in Tianjin as the Jinbao Expressway\nJinbin Expressway, from Zhangguizhuang Bridge to Hujiayuan Bridge, both within Tianjin\nJinji Expressway, from central Tianjin to Jixian CountyThe following six China National Highways pass through Tianjin:\n\nChina National Highway 102, through Ji County, Tianjin on its way from Beijing to Harbin\nChina National Highway 103, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District\nChina National Highway 104, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Fuzhou\nChina National Highway 105, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Macau\nChina National Highway 112, circular highway around Beijing, passes through Tianjin Municipality\nChina National Highway 205, from Shanhaiguan, Hebei, through Tianjin Municipality, to Guangzhou\n\n\n== Religion ==\nResidents of Tianjin participate in indigenous religions, such as the veneration of the goddess Mazu. In addition, Tianjin has a Buddhist Temple of Great Compassion, a Catholic St. Joseph's Cathedral (Laoxikai Church), a Catholic Our Lady of Victory Church (Wanghailou Church). A Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin exists. According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 1.51% of the city's population. Tianjin has been described as a historically \"strong center\" of Islam in China. Northwestern Tianjin is traditionally the location of the Muslim quarter of the city, where they have lived for centuries near the city's huge Great Mosque, Qingzhen si, founded in 1703. Other mosques include the Dahuoxiang Mosque.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nSports teams based in Tianjin include:\nChinese Super League\n\nTianjin TEDA F.C.\nTianjin Tianhai F.C. (dissolved in 2020)China Baseball League\n\nTianjin LionsChinese Basketball Association\n\nTianjin PioneersChinese Volleyball League\n\nTianjin Bohai Bank women's volleyball team\nThe 1995 World Table Tennis Championships, the 2013 East Asian Games, and the 2017 National Games of China were hosted by the city. Additionally, Tianjin will be one of the host cities for both the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.\nSince 2014, a WTA international tennis tournament has taken place in Tianjin every year at the Tuanbo International Tennis Center.\n\n\n== Martial arts ==\nTogether with Beijing, Tianjin had been for many centuries considered a center for traditional Chinese martial arts. Many past and present masters of arts such as Bajiquan, Pigua Zhang, Xing Yi Quan, Bagua Zhang and others lived or are living in the city. The districts most famous for martial arts in the city are Hong Qiao and Nankai, and martial artists abound in public green spaces such as Xigu Park and the Tianjin Water Park.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nUnder the National Ministry of Education:\n\nNankai University (founded 1919, one of the most prestigious universities in China)\nTianjin University (founded 1895, oldest university in China)Under the municipal government:\n\nTianjin Academy of Fine Arts\nTianjin Agricultural College\nTianjin Chengjian University\nTianjin Conservatory of Music\nTianjin Foreign Studies University\nTianjin Institute of Physical Education\nTianjin Medical University\nTianjin Normal University\nTianjin Polytechnic University\nTianjin University of Commerce\nTianjin University of Finance & Economics\nTianjin University of Science & Technology\nTianjin University of Technology\nTianjin University of Technology and Education\nTianjin University of Traditional Chinese MedicineUnder the national Civil Aviation Authority:\n\nCivil Aviation University of ChinaUnder the government of Hebei Province:\n\nHebei University of Technology (founded 1903, the earliest institute of technology in China)Foreign institutions:\n\nThe Florida International University Tianjin Center, opened in 2006 as a cooperative venture between the municipal government and the Miami-based university.\nThe Great Wall MBA Program Oklahoma City University Meinders School of Business, established in 1986 on the campus of Tianjin University of Finance & Economics.\nRaffles Design Institute Tianjin is a joint-project between Tianjin University of Commerce, Boustead College and Raffles Design Institute, Singapore.Private:\n\nBoustead CollegeNote: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== High schools ===\n\nTianjin Nankai High School (\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nTianjin No.21 High School (\u5929\u6d25\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e00\u4e2d\u5b78): Tianjin No. 21 High School, formerly Fahan College (\u6cd5\u6f22\u5b78\u5802; 'French\u2013Chinese (language) College'), was founded in 1895.

          "Very crowded as everything in China on weekends. Free of charge. Impressive dinosaur fossils collection. And the most amazing about this museum is its architecture. The building itself reminds me of UFO smth. You can easily spend there 2 hours",
          "For Chinese readers (especially for those with young kids), I would give this 3.5 stars. For foreigners (especially without young kids), I would give it 1.5 stars. This is a noisy place and filled with kids younger than 10. For those with kids it could be a nice place. I think",
          "There are many great collections and a total of close to 400,000 specimens. The Ancient Earth exhibits/specimens are my favourite (i.e., I love museums with dinosaur-age exhibits), but there is no close second, as I liked all the collections. Admission is free.",
          "Visited with a local friend during \"Golden Week\" (first week in October), so it was busy! The building's outer walls contain much glass, so it is light and airy inside the main reception area. The design is contemporary, reasonably clean in appearance. The main exhibition halls",
          "A vast collection of history about nature. You will be surprised that you can find such rich experience there. Take a break from the city life and learn something about nature that you may never know. It's free. You can get your entry ticket by showing your ID.",

          "The Tianjin Natural History Museum is a free museum located next to the Tianjin National Museum. You only need to bring your passport to enter. The design and landscape of the museum looks similar to some of the museums found in Europe. The museum has many rooms that displayed",

          "Great exterior building, but once you walk in, it's pretty underwhelming. Very small museum that can be walked through in 30 minutes at most. It mostly has stuffed taxidermy animals, dinosaurs and a bunch of rocks. Would be interesting if any of the information was in English.",
          "If you happen to be in Tianjin with children in tow, this is a decent place to kill a couple of hours and let the kids gawk at rocks and motorized dinosaurs. Pros: - Clean and uncrowded. - Cool looking building. - Some decent looking exhibits taking you through the history",
          "There's a good collection of dinosaur skeletons which kids seem to love, and also decent presentation of a variety of other items. One of note was a butterfly collection left behind by an expat in the colonial era. Worth a visit, with or without kids. Bring your passport for",

          "The Museum is still open! I took my 2 children with me who are 2 years and 7 years old. We all had a great time, there was so much to see. Most of the information was in Chinese but there were a lot of touch screens for the children to use and these had great photos etc. The",

          "Even though they have built(improved) the museum, the cost is still to high and the exibits are rather boring and old. Don't get me wrong, I love this city! It has plenty to offer for us foreigners."

        "wiki": "Guwenhua Jie, Tianjin's Ancient Culture Street, is a pedestrian pathway complex dotted with temple gates and kiosks on the west bank of the Hai River in Tianjin, China. The Nankai District area is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration.\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street was opened on New Year's Day in 1986. It preserves the architectural style of Qing dynasty, with its Niangniang Palace honoring the sea-goddess Mazu in the center. There are many tourist attractions along the street.\n\n\n== Queen of Heaven Palace ==\nThe Queen of Heaven, Tianhou, or Niangniang Palace is a temple to the Chinese sea-goddess Mazu, a medieval Fujianese who was later deified. It is in the middle of the Ancient Culture Street. Other names include \"Niangniang\" or \"Tianhou Temple\", the \"Tianfei Palace\", the \"Xiaozhigu Tianfei Palace\", and the \"Western Temple\".\nThe Niangniang Palace was first constructed in 1326 under the Yuan; it has subsequently been repaired many times.\nThe complex faces east with the Haihe River running in front. From east to west, the main buildings are the Opera Tower, the Flag Pole, the Temple Gate, the Memorial Archway, the Front Hall, the Main Hall, Canon-Storing Pavilion, the Qisheng Temple, the Bell-Drum Tower, the Side Hall, and the Zhangxian Pavilion. The Main Hall is constructed on a high and large platform, which is typical for wooden structures of the mid- to late-Ming Dynasty. The complex is one of the three major surviving Mazu temples in China and one of the oldest.\nThe main function of the temple is to pray for safe navigation. The palace was a center of marine sacrifice in past dynasties and a venue for sailors to have happy get-togethers. Besides ceremonial rituals held to worship the Goddess of the Sea, performances are held to thank her. It is said that the 23rd day of the third month of the Chinese lunar calendar is Matsu's birthday and a folk flower fair is held here annually to commemorate her on the day.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Yuhuangge Taoist Temple ==\n\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple was once the most famous building group in Hai River Triple Junction. In 2007, an ancient government road in Ming Dynasty was found, however large-scale excavation was not made due to architectural and other reasons.\nA few days ago, many famous historians had special argumentation in respect of discovering historical and cultural resources of the Cultural Street, and improving the cultural landscape of Yuhuangge Taoist Temple. Around Yuhuangge Taoist Temple, there may be many historical relics and sites to be discovered. Experts advised the restoration of the museum held by historical Zhili Public Welfare Services in this Temple about one hundred years ago, forming the \u201cYuhuangge Historical Museum\u201d.\nYuhuangge was built in Hongwu Years of Ming Dynasty, 1368 AD, and is one of the oldest buildings remaining in Tianjin.\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Tianjin ([t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n.t\u0255\u00edn] (listen)), alternately romanized as Tientsin, is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China on the shore of the Bohai Sea. It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted the East Asian Games, which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as \"National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area\". In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a major fire and explosion accident occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTianjin is located along the west coast of the Bohai Gulf, looking out to the provinces Shandong and Liaoning across those waters, bordered by Beijing 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border,  the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). There is 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. It lies at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the Yan Mountains intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak (\u4e5d\u9876\u5c71) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft).\nThe Hai River forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the Ziya River (\u5b50\u7259\u6cb3), Daqing River (\u5927\u6e05\u6cb3), Yongding River, North Grand Canal, and South Grand Canal, and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in Tanggu District. Major reservoirs include the Beidagang Reservoir in the extreme south (in Dagang District) and the Yuqiao Reservoir in the extreme north in Ji County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTianjin has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSk bordering on Dwa).

Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News).

In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived.

Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.

The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility and as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project involving Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9 as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-speed rail.\nTianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also major railway stations in Tianjin.

        "wiki": "Tianjin ([t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n.t\u0255\u00edn] (listen)), alternately romanized as Tientsin, is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China on the shore of the Bohai Sea. It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted the East Asian Games, which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as \"National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area\". In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a major fire and explosion accident occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTianjin is located along the west coast of the Bohai Gulf, looking out to the provinces Shandong and Liaoning across those waters, bordered by Beijing 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border,  the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). There is 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. It lies at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the Yan Mountains intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak (\u4e5d\u9876\u5c71) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft).\nThe Hai River forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the Ziya River (\u5b50\u7259\u6cb3), Daqing River (\u5927\u6e05\u6cb3), Yongding River, North Grand Canal, and South Grand Canal, and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in Tanggu District. Major reservoirs include the Beidagang Reservoir in the extreme south (in Dagang District) and the Yuqiao Reservoir in the extreme north in Ji County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTianjin has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSk bordering on Dwa). It has a four-season, monsoon-influenced climate, typical of East Asia, with cold, windy, very dry winters reflecting the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone, and hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon. Spring in the city is dry and windy, occasionally seeing sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert, capable of lasting for several days. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from \u22123.4 \u00b0C (25.9 \u00b0F) in January to 26.8 \u00b0C (80.2 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.9 \u00b0C (55.2 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 48% in July to 61% in October, the city receives 2,522 hours of bright sunshine annually. Having a low annual total precipitation of 511 millimeters (20.1 in), and nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid zone, with parts of the municipality being humid continental (K\u00f6ppen BSk/Dwa, respectively).Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221222.9 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F) to 40.5 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Measures to improve air quality ===\nIn May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels. These measures included several restrictions on days of severe pollution; halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities.\n\nForeign-born professional sportsmen have made statements regarding Tianjin's air quality, citing it as an impediment to athletic activity and being thick enough to \"taste\".\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nTianjin is divided into 16 county-level divisions, which are all districts.\n\nIn addition, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) is not a formal level of administration, but nevertheless enjoys rights similar to a regular district. At the end of 2017, the total population of Tianjin is 15.57 million.[3]\n\nThese districts and counties are further subdivided, as of December 31, 2004, into 240 township-level divisions, including 120 towns, 18 townships, 2 ethnic townships and 100 subdistricts.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Tianjin is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in the mainland China.\nThe Mayor of Tianjin is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Tianjin. Since Tianjin is a municipality, the Communist Party of China Municipal Committee Secretary is colloquially termed the \"Tianjin CPC Party chief\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTianjin's GDP reached 1.572 trillion yuan in 2014, an increase of 10.0 percent over 2013. The city of Tianjin recorded China's highest per-capita GDP with $17,126, followed by Beijing with $16,278 and Shanghai with $15,847.\n\nMajor industries include petrochemical industries, textiles, car manufacturing, mechanical industries, and metalworking. EADS Airbus is an important manufacturer, and has opened an assembly plant for its Airbus A320 series airliners, operational since 2009. Tianjin also hit the news in 2010, as the current fastest supercomputer in the world, Tianhe-1A, is located at the National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin. GDP in 2009 hit \uffe5750.1 billion, with a per capita of RMB\uffe562,403.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area ===\n\nAs one of the first state-level economic and technological development zones, Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) was founded on December 6, 1984, with the approval of the State Council. It enjoys relevant state preferential policies with the major task of attracting domestic and foreign investment to develop high and new technology oriented modern industries. As an affiliated organ of the Tianjin Municipal Government, the Administrative Commission of Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area exercises unified administration of TEDA on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal Government and enjoys provincial-level administrative and economic management rights.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Export Processing Zone ===\nTianjin Export Processing Zone is one of the first 15 export processing zones approved by the State Council on April 27, 2000. This is a special enclosed zone where the Customs conduct 24-hour administration on commodities transported into and out of the zone and relevant places. The central government granted this special economic zone special preferential policies to attract enterprises in the business of processing and trade to invest in the zone. Tianjin Export Processing Zone is located to the northeast of TEDA with a planned area of 2.54 km2 (0.98 sq mi). The area developed in the first phase is 1 m2. A permanent wall is built to separate export processing zone and non-export processing zone.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Airport Economic Area ===\nTianjin Airport International Logistics Zone is jointly invested by Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone and Tianjin Binhai International Airport. It is located inside the airfreight area of Tianjin Binhai International Airport. It has domestic and foreign excellent airfreight logistics enterprises engaged in sorting, warehousing, distribution, processing, exhibition. It is in the process of constructing the largest airfreight base in northern China.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone ===\n Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone is the largest free trade zone in northern China as well as the only free trade zone in northern China. The zone was approved to be established in 1991 by State Council. It is 30 km (19 mi) from Tianjin city proper, less than 1 km (0.62 mi) away from the wharf and only 38 km (24 mi) away from Tianjin Binhai International Airport.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Tanggu National Marine High-Tech Development Area ===\nTianjin Tanggu Marine High-Tech Development Area was established in 1992, and was upgraded to the national-level high-tech development area by the State Council in 1995, it is the only national-level high-tech development area specializing in developing the marine Hi-Tech industry. By the end of 2008, the zone has 2068 corporations and has 5 industries there including new materials, oil manufacturing, modern machinery manufacturing, and electronic information.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Nangang Industrial Zone ===\nA heavy and chemical industry base and harbor; an important part of the \"dual-city, dual-harbor\"space development strategy of Tianjin, a demonstration zone of circular economy. The total planned area of Nangang Industrial Zone is 200 km2 (77 sq mi), of which the terrestrial area is 162 km2 (63 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nFarmland takes up about 40% of Tianjin Municipality's total area. Wheat, rice, and maize are the most important crops. Fishing is important along the coast.\n\n\n=== Resources ===\nTianjin Municipality also has deposits of about 1 billion tonnes of petroleum, with Dagang District containing important oilfields. Salt production is also important, with Changlu Yanqu being one of China's most important salt production areas. Geothermal energy is another resource of Tianjin. Deposits of manganese and boron under Tianjin were the first to be found in China.\n\n\n=== Binhai New Area ===\nTianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) is located in the juncture of the Beijing-Tianjin City Belt and the Circum-Bohai City Belt. It is the gateway to North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Lying in the center of Northeast Asia, it is the nearest point of departure of the Eurasian Continental Bridge.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the end of 2009, the population of Tianjin Municipality was 12.28 million, of which 9.8 million were residential holders of Tianjin hukou (permanent residence). Among Tianjin permanent residents, 5.99 million were urban, and 3.81 million were rural.  Tianjin has recently shifted to rapid population growth, its population has reached 14.72 million as of 2013 end.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 15.4 million.The majority of Tianjin residents are Han Chinese. There are also 51 out of the 55 minor Chinese ethnic groups living in Tianjin. Major minorities include Hui, Koreans, Manchus, and Mongols.\n\nThis excludes members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n\n== Media ==\nTianjin People's Broadcasting Station is the major radio station in Tianjin. Broadcasting in nine channels, it serves most of North China, part of East and Northeast China, reaching an audience of over 100 million. Tianjin Television, the local television station, broadcasts on nine channels. It also boasts a paid digital channel, featuring home improvement programs. Both the radio and television stations are now branches of the Tianjin Film, Radio and Television Group, established in October 2002.Major local newspapers include the Tianjin Daily and Jin Wan Bao (literally, tonight newspaper), which are the flagship papers of Tianjin Daily Newspaper Group and Jinwan Mass Media Group, respectively. There are also three English-language magazines: Jin, Tianjin Plus and Business Tianjin, mostly directed at ex-pats resident in the city.\n\n\n=== Previous newspapers ===\nThe first German newspaper in northern China, Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, was published in Tianjin.In 1912 Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and 5 daily newspapers in other languages; none of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers. Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News). Newspapers from Beijing published in Tianjin included Pei Ching Jih Pao, Peking Daily News, and Le Journal de Peking.In 1930, the newspaper Deutsch-Mandschurische Nachrichten moved from Harbin to Tianjin and changed its name to the Deutsch-Chinesische Nachrichten.\n\n\n=== Censorship capital ===\nMore and more, China's leading Internet information providers (usually located in Beijing), including social network Sina Weibo, Douban and the online video website Sohu, tend to relocate their censorship departments to Tianjin, where labor costs are cheaper than Beijing, as censorship is a kind of labor-intensive work. In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived. Despite its proximity to Beijing, the Tianjin dialect sounds quite different from the Beijing dialect, which provides the basis for Putonghua or Standard Chinese.\nTianjin is a respected home base of Beijing opera, one of the most prestigious forms of Chinese opera.\n\nTianjin is famous for its stand-up comedy and comedians including Guo Degang and Ma Sanli. Ma Sanli (1914\u20132003), an ethnic Hui and longtime resident of Tianjin, is renowned for his xiangsheng, a hugely popular form of Chinese entertainment akin to comedy. Ma Sanli delivered some of his xiangsheng in the Tianjin dialect. Tianjin, along with Beijing, is a center for the art of xiangsheng. Tianjin's style of stand-up also includes the use of rhythmic bamboo clappers, kuaiban.Yangliuqing (Green Willows), a town about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Tianjin's urban area and the seat of Xiqing District, is famous for its popular Chinese New Year-themed, traditional-style, colorful wash paintings (\u6768\u67f3\u9752\u5e74\u753b). Tianjin is also famous for the Zhang clay figurine, a type of intricate, colorful figurine depicting a variety of vivid characters, and Tianjin's Wei's kites, which can be folded to a fraction of their full sizes and are noted for portability.\nOn September 28, 2015, the Juilliard School in Manhattan, New York City announced a major expansion into Tianjin during a visit by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan, the institution's first such full-scale foray outside the United States, with plans to offer a master's degree program.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nTianjin cuisine places a heavy focus on seafood, due to Tianjin's proximity to the sea.  It can be further classified into several varieties, including the rough (Chinese: \u7c97; pinyin: c\u016b), smooth (simplified Chinese: \u7ec6; traditional Chinese: \u7d30; pinyin: x\u00ec), and high (Chinese: \u9ad8; pinyin: g\u0101o). Prominent menus include the Eight Great Bowls (Chinese: \u516b\u5927\u7897; pinyin: B\u0101d\u00e0 w\u01cen), a combination of eight mainly meat dishes, and the Four Great Stews (Chinese: \u56db\u5927\u6252; pinyin: s\u00ec d\u00e0 b\u0101), actually referring to a very large number of stews, including chicken, duck, seafood, beef, and mutton.\nThe four delicacies of Tianjin include Goubuli baozi, Guifaxiang Shibajie Mahua (Chinese: \u5341\u516b\u8857\u9ebb\u82b1; pinyin: sh\u00edb\u0101 ji\u0113 m\u00e1hu\u0101), Erduoyan Zhagao (Chinese: \u8033\u6735\u773c\u70b8\u7cd5; pinyin: erduoy\u01cen zh\u00e0 g\u0101o) and Maobuwen Jiaozi (Chinese: \u732b\u4e0d\u95fb\u997a\u5b50; pinyin: m\u0101o b\u00f9 w\u00e9n ji\u01ceozi). Well-known foods include Caoji donkey meat, Bazhen sheep-leg mutton of Guanshengyuan, Luji Tangmian Zhagao, Baiji Shuijiao, Gaogan of Zhilanzhai, Guobacai of Dafulai, Subao of Shitoumenkan and Xiaobao chestnut. These famous snacks are available in Nanshi Food Street, which was a famous calling-card of Tianjin in the aspect of cuisine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nTianjin Binhai International Airport is located in Dongli District roughly 13 km (8 mi) away from downtown area. The city will also be served by the new Beijing Daxing International Airport in Beijing, currently under construction and to be completed by late 2019.Tianjin Binhai International Airport now has a terminal building which covers an area of 25,000 m2 (269,000 sq ft), a merchandise warehouse which covers an area of 29,500 m2 (318,000 sq ft) and runways measuring 3.6 km (2.2 mi) in total. It has a grade 4E airstrip, which all kinds of large aircraft can take off from and land safely on. Tianjin Binhai International Airport has 59 flight routes, connecting 48 cities, including 30 domestic cities and 17 foreign cities. Airline companies like Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways, Korean Air, Asiana Airlines, Singapore Airlines Cargo and Martinair Holland all have flights to Tianjin Binhai International Airport.\n\n\n=== Port of Tianjin ===\n\nTianjin port is the world's top-level and China's largest artificial deep water harbor, and the throughput capacity ranks fifth in the world. Located in Binhai Economic Zone, a national new economic zone of China, Tianjin harbor is the port of call of international cruises visiting the wider area, including Beijing.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTianjin's harbor area of Binhai/TEDA has a modern, high speed rubber tired tram system, which is the first of its kind in China and Asia. Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.  Construction work on Line 2 and Line 3 was completed in 2012 and the two lines are now in operation. Several new metro lines are planned.\nThere was two rapid transit operators in Tianjin. In 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation.\n\nTianjin Metro General Corporation, operates Lines 1, 2, 3 and 6\nTianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company, operates Lines 5 and 9\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThere are several railway stations in the city, Tianjin railway station being the principal one. It was built in 1888. The station was initially located at Wangdaozhuang (simplified Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u5e84; traditional Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u838a; pinyin: W\u00e0ngd\u00e0ozhu\u0101ng). The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility and as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project involving Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9 as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-speed rail.\nTianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also major railway stations in Tianjin. There is also Tanggu railway station is located in the important port area of Tanggu District, and Binhai railway station and Binhai North railway station located in TEDA, to the north of Tanggu. There are several other railway stations in the city that do not handle passenger traffic. Construction on a Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail began on July 4, 2005 and was completed by August 2008.\nThe following rail lines go through Tianjin:\n\nJingshan Railway, from Beijing to Shanhai Pass\nJinpu Railway, from Tianjin to Pukou District, Nanjing\nJinji Railway, from Tianjin urban area to Ji County, Tianjin\nJinba Railway, from Tianjin to Bazhou, Hebei\nThe inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system: Cxxxx (C stands for interCity). The train numbers range between C2001\uff5eC2298:\n\nC2001\uff5eC2198: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, directly\nC2201\uff5eC2268: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, with stops at Wuqing Station (\u6b66\u6e05\u7ad9)\nC2271\uff5eC2298: From Beijing South Station to Yujiapu Railway Station of TianjinThe new C trains take only 30 min to travel between Beijing and Tianjin, cutting the previous D train time by more than a half. The ticket price as of Aug 15, 08 is 69 RMB for the first-class seat and 58 RMB for the second-class seat.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThere were over 900 bus lines in the city as of 2005.\n\n\n=== Roads and expressways ===\nSome roads and bridges have retained names that hark back to the Republic of China era (1912\u20131949) such as Minquan Gate and Beiyang Road. Like with most cities in China, many roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four cardinal directions.\nTianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is the closest thing to a highway-level ring road, although traffic is often chaotic.\n\nInner Ring Road (neihuan)\nMiddle Ring Road (zhonghuan)\nOuter Ring Road (waihuan)Tianjin's roads often finish in dao (Chinese: \u9053; lit.: 'avenue'), xian (simplified Chinese: \u7ebf; traditional Chinese: \u7dda; lit.: 'line'). These are most often used for highways and through routes. The terms lu (Chinese: \u8def; lit.: 'road'). Jie (Chinese: \u8857; lit.: 'street') are rare. As Tianjin's roads are rarely in a cardinal compass direction, jing (simplified Chinese: \u7ecf; traditional Chinese: \u7d93; lit.: 'avenue') roads and wei (simplified Chinese: \u7eac; traditional Chinese: \u7def; lit.: 'avenue') roads often appear, which attempt to run more directly north\u2013south and east\u2013west, respectively.\nThe following seven expressways of China run in or through Tianjin:\n\nJingjintang Expressway, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District / TEDA\nJinghu Expressway, from Jinjing Gonglu Bridge to Shanghai (together with Jingjintang Expressway, this is the expressway from Beijing to Shanghai)\nJingshen Expressway, through Baodi District on its way from Beijing to Shenyang\nTangjin Expressway, from Tanggu District, Tianjin, to Tangshan, Hebei\u2014known in Tianjin as the Jintang Expressway\nBaojin Expressway, from Beichen District, Tianjin, to Baoding, Hebei\u2014known in Tianjin as the Jinbao Expressway\nJinbin Expressway, from Zhangguizhuang Bridge to Hujiayuan Bridge, both within Tianjin\nJinji Expressway, from central Tianjin to Jixian CountyThe following six China National Highways pass through Tianjin:\n\nChina National Highway 102, through Ji County, Tianjin on its way from Beijing to Harbin\nChina National Highway 103, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District\nChina National Highway 104, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Fuzhou\nChina National Highway 105, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Macau\nChina National Highway 112, circular highway around Beijing, passes through Tianjin Municipality\nChina National Highway 205, from Shanhaiguan, Hebei, through Tianjin Municipality, to Guangzhou\n\n\n== Religion ==\nResidents of Tianjin participate in indigenous religions, such as the veneration of the goddess Mazu. In addition, Tianjin has a Buddhist Temple of Great Compassion, a Catholic St. Joseph's Cathedral (Laoxikai Church), a Catholic Our Lady of Victory Church (Wanghailou Church). A Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin exists. According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 1.51% of the city's population. Tianjin has been described as a historically \"strong center\" of Islam in China. Northwestern Tianjin is traditionally the location of the Muslim quarter of the city, where they have lived for centuries near the city's huge Great Mosque, Qingzhen si, founded in 1703. Other mosques include the Dahuoxiang Mosque.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nSports teams based in Tianjin include:\nChinese Super League\n\nTianjin TEDA F.C.\nTianjin Tianhai F.C.

Additionally, Tianjin will be one of the host cities for both the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.\nSince 2014, a WTA international tennis tournament has taken place in Tianjin every year at the Tuanbo International Tennis Center.\n\n\n== Martial arts ==\nTogether with Beijing, Tianjin had been for many centuries considered a center for traditional Chinese martial arts. Many past and present masters of arts such as Bajiquan, Pigua Zhang, Xing Yi Quan, Bagua Zhang and others lived or are living in the city. The districts most famous for martial arts in the city are Hong Qiao and Nankai, and martial artists abound in public green spaces such as Xigu Park and the Tianjin Water Park.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nUnder the National Ministry of Education:\n\nNankai University (founded 1919, one of the most prestigious universities in China)\nTianjin University (founded 1895, oldest university in China)Under the municipal government:\n\nTianjin Academy of Fine Arts\nTianjin Agricultural College\nTianjin Chengjian University\nTianjin Conservatory of Music\nTianjin Foreign Studies University\nTianjin Institute of Physical Education\nTianjin Medical University\nTianjin Normal University\nTianjin Polytechnic University\nTianjin University of Commerce\nTianjin University of Finance & Economics\nTianjin University of Science & Technology\nTianjin University of Technology\nTianjin University of Technology and Education\nTianjin University of Traditional Chinese MedicineUnder the national Civil Aviation Authority:\n\nCivil Aviation University of ChinaUnder the government of Hebei Province:\n\nHebei University of Technology (founded 1903, the earliest institute of technology in China)Foreign institutions:\n\nThe Florida International University Tianjin Center, opened in 2006 as a cooperative venture between the municipal government and the Miami-based university.\nThe Great Wall MBA Program Oklahoma City University Meinders School of Business, established in 1986 on the campus of Tianjin University of Finance & Economics.\nRaffles Design Institute Tianjin is a joint-project between Tianjin University of Commerce, Boustead College and Raffles Design Institute, Singapore.Private:\n\nBoustead CollegeNote: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== High schools ===\n\nTianjin Nankai High School (\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nTianjin No.21 High School (\u5929\u6d25\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e00\u4e2d\u5b78): Tianjin No. 21 High School, formerly Fahan College (\u6cd5\u6f22\u5b78\u5802; 'French\u2013Chinese (language) College'), was founded in 1895.

          "Tianjin Zoo was a big disappointment. While in TJ for business, I decided to go on my own to fill up some time. The zoo is how Western zoos would look after a few decades of post apocalyptic neglect. I didn't see a single member of staff to offer help apart from the ones trying",
          "It is absolutely shocking to see that there is no one even bothers looking after those animals in the cages, and worst of all, none of the Chinese did even care about it... The panda was asleep in the cage and some Chinese kept banging on the glass, trying to wake the poor thing",
          "Not one zoo keeper in a zoo that was dirty, had nothing for the poor dirty, underfed animals. People were throwing food at the begging animals. I have never seen anything like it. Water features were full of garbage. Many cages had no animals thank goodness! Didn't seem to",

          "Horrible place of sadness for the animals and source of contempt to given to the people of Tianjin who seem perfectly happy having animals live in squalor, filth and whatever food or trash they happen to be holding that they think is cute to throw into the cages. Saw maggots",

        "wiki": "Tianjin ([t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n.t\u0255\u00edn] (listen)), alternately romanized as Tientsin, is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China on the shore of the Bohai Sea. It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted the East Asian Games, which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as \"National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area\". In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a major fire and explosion accident occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTianjin is located along the west coast of the Bohai Gulf, looking out to the provinces Shandong and Liaoning across those waters, bordered by Beijing 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border,  the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). There is 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. It lies at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the Yan Mountains intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak (\u4e5d\u9876\u5c71) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft).\nThe Hai River forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the Ziya River (\u5b50\u7259\u6cb3), Daqing River (\u5927\u6e05\u6cb3), Yongding River, North Grand Canal, and South Grand Canal, and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in Tanggu District. Major reservoirs include the Beidagang Reservoir in the extreme south (in Dagang District) and the Yuqiao Reservoir in the extreme north in Ji County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTianjin has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSk bordering on Dwa). It has a four-season, monsoon-influenced climate, typical of East Asia, with cold, windy, very dry winters reflecting the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone, and hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon. Spring in the city is dry and windy, occasionally seeing sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert, capable of lasting for several days. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from \u22123.4 \u00b0C (25.9 \u00b0F) in January to 26.8 \u00b0C (80.2 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.9 \u00b0C (55.2 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 48% in July to 61% in October, the city receives 2,522 hours of bright sunshine annually. Having a low annual total precipitation of 511 millimeters (20.1 in), and nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid zone, with parts of the municipality being humid continental (K\u00f6ppen BSk/Dwa, respectively).Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221222.9 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F) to 40.5 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Measures to improve air quality ===\nIn May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels.

Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News).

In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived.

Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.

The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position.

        "wiki": "Tianjin ([t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n.t\u0255\u00edn] (listen)), alternately romanized as Tientsin, is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China on the shore of the Bohai Sea. It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted the East Asian Games, which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as \"National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area\". In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a major fire and explosion accident occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTianjin is located along the west coast of the Bohai Gulf, looking out to the provinces Shandong and Liaoning across those waters, bordered by Beijing 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border,  the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). There is 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. It lies at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the Yan Mountains intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak (\u4e5d\u9876\u5c71) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft).\nThe Hai River forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the Ziya River (\u5b50\u7259\u6cb3), Daqing River (\u5927\u6e05\u6cb3), Yongding River, North Grand Canal, and South Grand Canal, and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in Tanggu District.

Having a low annual total precipitation of 511 millimeters (20.1 in), and nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid zone, with parts of the municipality being humid continental (K\u00f6ppen BSk/Dwa, respectively).Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221222.9 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F) to 40.5 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Measures to improve air quality ===\nIn May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels. These measures included several restrictions on days of severe pollution; halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities.\n\nForeign-born professional sportsmen have made statements regarding Tianjin's air quality, citing it as an impediment to athletic activity and being thick enough to \"taste\".\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nTianjin is divided into 16 county-level divisions, which are all districts.\n\nIn addition, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) is not a formal level of administration, but nevertheless enjoys rights similar to a regular district. At the end of 2017, the total population of Tianjin is 15.57 million.[3]\n\nThese districts and counties are further subdivided, as of December 31, 2004, into 240 township-level divisions, including 120 towns, 18 townships, 2 ethnic townships and 100 subdistricts.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Tianjin is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in the mainland China.\nThe Mayor of Tianjin is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Tianjin. Since Tianjin is a municipality, the Communist Party of China Municipal Committee Secretary is colloquially termed the \"Tianjin CPC Party chief\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTianjin's GDP reached 1.572 trillion yuan in 2014, an increase of 10.0 percent over 2013. The city of Tianjin recorded China's highest per-capita GDP with $17,126, followed by Beijing with $16,278 and Shanghai with $15,847.\n\nMajor industries include petrochemical industries, textiles, car manufacturing, mechanical industries, and metalworking. EADS Airbus is an important manufacturer, and has opened an assembly plant for its Airbus A320 series airliners, operational since 2009. Tianjin also hit the news in 2010, as the current fastest supercomputer in the world, Tianhe-1A, is located at the National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin. GDP in 2009 hit \uffe5750.1 billion, with a per capita of RMB\uffe562,403.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area ===\n\nAs one of the first state-level economic and technological development zones, Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) was founded on December 6, 1984, with the approval of the State Council. It enjoys relevant state preferential policies with the major task of attracting domestic and foreign investment to develop high and new technology oriented modern industries.

By the end of 2008, the zone has 2068 corporations and has 5 industries there including new materials, oil manufacturing, modern machinery manufacturing, and electronic information.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Nangang Industrial Zone ===\nA heavy and chemical industry base and harbor; an important part of the \"dual-city, dual-harbor\"space development strategy of Tianjin, a demonstration zone of circular economy. The total planned area of Nangang Industrial Zone is 200 km2 (77 sq mi), of which the terrestrial area is 162 km2 (63 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nFarmland takes up about 40% of Tianjin Municipality's total area. Wheat, rice, and maize are the most important crops. Fishing is important along the coast.\n\n\n=== Resources ===\nTianjin Municipality also has deposits of about 1 billion tonnes of petroleum, with Dagang District containing important oilfields. Salt production is also important, with Changlu Yanqu being one of China's most important salt production areas. Geothermal energy is another resource of Tianjin. Deposits of manganese and boron under Tianjin were the first to be found in China.\n\n\n=== Binhai New Area ===\nTianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) is located in the juncture of the Beijing-Tianjin City Belt and the Circum-Bohai City Belt. It is the gateway to North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Lying in the center of Northeast Asia, it is the nearest point of departure of the Eurasian Continental Bridge.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the end of 2009, the population of Tianjin Municipality was 12.28 million, of which 9.8 million were residential holders of Tianjin hukou (permanent residence). Among Tianjin permanent residents, 5.99 million were urban, and 3.81 million were rural.

There are also three English-language magazines: Jin, Tianjin Plus and Business Tianjin, mostly directed at ex-pats resident in the city.\n\n\n=== Previous newspapers ===\nThe first German newspaper in northern China, Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, was published in Tianjin.In 1912 Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and 5 daily newspapers in other languages; none of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers. Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News). Newspapers from Beijing published in Tianjin included Pei Ching Jih Pao, Peking Daily News, and Le Journal de Peking.In 1930, the newspaper Deutsch-Mandschurische Nachrichten moved from Harbin to Tianjin and changed its name to the Deutsch-Chinesische Nachrichten.\n\n\n=== Censorship capital ===\nMore and more, China's leading Internet information providers (usually located in Beijing), including social network Sina Weibo, Douban and the online video website Sohu, tend to relocate their censorship departments to Tianjin, where labor costs are cheaper than Beijing, as censorship is a kind of labor-intensive work. In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived.

Ma Sanli (1914\u20132003), an ethnic Hui and longtime resident of Tianjin, is renowned for his xiangsheng, a hugely popular form of Chinese entertainment akin to comedy. Ma Sanli delivered some of his xiangsheng in the Tianjin dialect. Tianjin, along with Beijing, is a center for the art of xiangsheng. Tianjin's style of stand-up also includes the use of rhythmic bamboo clappers, kuaiban.Yangliuqing (Green Willows), a town about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Tianjin's urban area and the seat of Xiqing District, is famous for its popular Chinese New Year-themed, traditional-style, colorful wash paintings (\u6768\u67f3\u9752\u5e74\u753b). Tianjin is also famous for the Zhang clay figurine, a type of intricate, colorful figurine depicting a variety of vivid characters, and Tianjin's Wei's kites, which can be folded to a fraction of their full sizes and are noted for portability.\nOn September 28, 2015, the Juilliard School in Manhattan, New York City announced a major expansion into Tianjin during a visit by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan, the institution's first such full-scale foray outside the United States, with plans to offer a master's degree program.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nTianjin cuisine places a heavy focus on seafood, due to Tianjin's proximity to the sea.  It can be further classified into several varieties, including the rough (Chinese: \u7c97; pinyin: c\u016b), smooth (simplified Chinese: \u7ec6; traditional Chinese: \u7d30; pinyin: x\u00ec), and high (Chinese: \u9ad8; pinyin: g\u0101o). Prominent menus include the Eight Great Bowls (Chinese: \u516b\u5927\u7897; pinyin: B\u0101d\u00e0 w\u01cen), a combination of eight mainly meat dishes, and the Four Great Stews (Chinese: \u56db\u5927\u6252; pinyin: s\u00ec d\u00e0 b\u0101), actually referring to a very large number of stews, including chicken, duck, seafood, beef, and mutton.\nThe four delicacies of Tianjin include Goubuli baozi, Guifaxiang Shibajie Mahua (Chinese: \u5341\u516b\u8857\u9ebb\u82b1; pinyin: sh\u00edb\u0101 ji\u0113 m\u00e1hu\u0101), Erduoyan Zhagao (Chinese: \u8033\u6735\u773c\u70b8\u7cd5; pinyin: erduoy\u01cen zh\u00e0 g\u0101o) and Maobuwen Jiaozi (Chinese: \u732b\u4e0d\u95fb\u997a\u5b50; pinyin: m\u0101o b\u00f9 w\u00e9n ji\u01ceozi). Well-known foods include Caoji donkey meat, Bazhen sheep-leg mutton of Guanshengyuan, Luji Tangmian Zhagao, Baiji Shuijiao, Gaogan of Zhilanzhai, Guobacai of Dafulai, Subao of Shitoumenkan and Xiaobao chestnut.

Located in Binhai Economic Zone, a national new economic zone of China, Tianjin harbor is the port of call of international cruises visiting the wider area, including Beijing.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTianjin's harbor area of Binhai/TEDA has a modern, high speed rubber tired tram system, which is the first of its kind in China and Asia. Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.  Construction work on Line 2 and Line 3 was completed in 2012 and the two lines are now in operation. Several new metro lines are planned.\nThere was two rapid transit operators in Tianjin.

It was built in 1888. The station was initially located at Wangdaozhuang (simplified Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u5e84; traditional Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u838a; pinyin: W\u00e0ngd\u00e0ozhu\u0101ng). The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility and as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project involving Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9 as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-speed rail.\nTianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also major railway stations in Tianjin. There is also Tanggu railway station is located in the important port area of Tanggu District, and Binhai railway station and Binhai North railway station located in TEDA, to the north of Tanggu. There are several other railway stations in the city that do not handle passenger traffic. Construction on a Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail began on July 4, 2005 and was completed by August 2008.\nThe following rail lines go through Tianjin:\n\nJingshan Railway, from Beijing to Shanhai Pass\nJinpu Railway, from Tianjin to Pukou District, Nanjing\nJinji Railway, from Tianjin urban area to Ji County, Tianjin\nJinba Railway, from Tianjin to Bazhou, Hebei\nThe inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system: Cxxxx (C stands for interCity). The train numbers range between C2001\uff5eC2298:\n\nC2001\uff5eC2198: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, directly\nC2201\uff5eC2268: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, with stops at Wuqing Station (\u6b66\u6e05\u7ad9)\nC2271\uff5eC2298: From Beijing South Station to Yujiapu Railway Station of TianjinThe new C trains take only 30 min to travel between Beijing and Tianjin, cutting the previous D train time by more than a half. The ticket price as of Aug 15, 08 is 69 RMB for the first-class seat and 58 RMB for the second-class seat.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThere were over 900 bus lines in the city as of 2005.\n\n\n=== Roads and expressways ===\nSome roads and bridges have retained names that hark back to the Republic of China era (1912\u20131949) such as Minquan Gate and Beiyang Road. Like with most cities in China, many roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four cardinal directions.\nTianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is the closest thing to a highway-level ring road, although traffic is often chaotic.\n\nInner Ring Road (neihuan)\nMiddle Ring Road (zhonghuan)\nOuter Ring Road (waihuan)Tianjin's roads often finish in dao (Chinese: \u9053; lit.: 'avenue'), xian (simplified Chinese: \u7ebf; traditional Chinese: \u7dda; lit.: 'line'). These are most often used for highways and through routes. The terms lu (Chinese: \u8def; lit.: 'road'). Jie (Chinese: \u8857; lit.: 'street') are rare. As Tianjin's roads are rarely in a cardinal compass direction, jing (simplified Chinese: \u7ecf; traditional Chinese: \u7d93; lit.: 'avenue') roads and wei (simplified Chinese: \u7eac; traditional Chinese: \u7def; lit.: 'avenue') roads often appear, which attempt to run more directly north\u2013south and east\u2013west, respectively.\nThe following seven expressways of China run in or through Tianjin:\n\nJingjintang Expressway, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District / TEDA\nJinghu Expressway, from Jinjing Gonglu Bridge to Shanghai (together with Jingjintang Expressway, this is the expressway from Beijing to Shanghai)\nJingshen Expressway, through Baodi District on its way from Beijing to Shenyang\nTangjin Expressway, from Tanggu District, Tianjin, to Tangshan, Hebei\u2014known in Tianjin as the Jintang Expressway\nBaojin Expressway, from Beichen District, Tianjin, to Baoding, Hebei\u2014known in Tianjin as the Jinbao Expressway\nJinbin Expressway, from Zhangguizhuang Bridge to Hujiayuan Bridge, both within Tianjin\nJinji Expressway, from central Tianjin to Jixian CountyThe following six China National Highways pass through Tianjin:\n\nChina National Highway 102, through Ji County, Tianjin on its way from Beijing to Harbin\nChina National Highway 103, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District\nChina National Highway 104, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Fuzhou\nChina National Highway 105, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Macau\nChina National Highway 112, circular highway around Beijing, passes through Tianjin Municipality\nChina National Highway 205, from Shanhaiguan, Hebei, through Tianjin Municipality, to Guangzhou\n\n\n== Religion ==\nResidents of Tianjin participate in indigenous religions, such as the veneration of the goddess Mazu.

          "My partner and I visited this \"theme park.\" It was an incredibly odd experience. Yes, there is a Soviet-era aircraft carrier. You can walk around inside of the carrier a bit, but less than I would have liked. Mostly, this park was really odd. They seemed to be a lot of small",
          "To be honest, I am a little disappointed. First of all, it seems that it is hard to get to this park through public transportation. Secondly, the CV is not well preserved. It is a theme park rather than a Museum ship. From the entrance to the CV there are lots Russian",
          "As an aerospace history fan (and former museum tour guide), I rarely miss the chance to visit an aviation museum. To be clear, this visit is light on the history and not really a museum. And, I would agree with the other reviews that describe this attraction as all a bit odd.",
          "Highly odd attraction oddity a Russian carrier in China lined with all sorts of other kiosks giving it no identity they played a music show while i was there saying it was Russian but felt very American country twang sounding Over all the carrier itself is impressive",
          "If you want to see Cold War Era Russian Aircraft and other stuff this is the place to do it. It has that strange combination or Chinese and Russian that is not to be missed.",
          "Loved this trip. Beautifully done, lots to see. Experience Kiev streets with Russians selling authentic Russian food and Vodka. The Aircraft Carrier was worth a visit",

          "I was in Tianjin for a day and decided this was the attraction I wanted to see the most. When I arrived in Tianjin, I took bus 462, thinking it would take me to the park in a while. 1 hour later, I was still on the bus! The whole journey by bus 462 took about 1 h 15 min. The",
          "I was there a few years ago. Got to experience a party/rave on the carrier. One of the coolest experiences as you can drink and party beside some jet fighters and cannons.",
          "We knew this would be a somewhat wackadoo experience, and it did not disappoint. We hired a car and driver to take us out here from downtown Tianjin - well worth the expense. I've been to several other aircraft carrier museums, and this was no different, except for the Russia",
          "this is located at the Beach but I cant find anything interesting, people were going to explore inside but it depends on your chose and availability of time.",
          "It was very excited Experience to be on real Aircraft,, Guide was perfect, there was so nice Russian show, i recommend that place for everyone",
          "This place is bizarre. If you like your Russian aircraft carrier theme parks in China lined with little dinosaurs, kiddie rides, closed buildings and attractions, an American country music show passed off as a Russian music show, than this place is for you! Really, I encourage",
          "I'm not sure whether this is owned by Russians or Chinese, but suffice to say it's a Russian theme park built in China around a Russian Aircraft Carrier. As soon as you approach, you can see the Disney design influences but it like some parallel universe where things are not",
          "The whole Theme Park is very odd, lots of Russians cutting around - some very very beautiful! There are military vehicles, kids rides, water rides, shows and the carrier. The shows are actually very good and totally worth seeing. The carrier is fascinating, I really enjoyed",

        "wiki": "The Port of Tianjin (Tianjin Gang, Chinese: \u5929\u6d25\u6e2f; pinyin: ti\u0101nj\u012bn g\u01ceng), formerly known as the Port of Tanggu, is the largest port in Northern China and the main maritime gateway to Beijing. The name \"Tianjin Xingang\" (Chinese: \u5929\u6d25\u65b0\u6e2f; pinyin: ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012bng\u01ceng; lit.: 'Tianjin New Port'), which strictly speaking refers only to the main seaport area, is sometimes used to refer to the whole port. The port is on the western shore of the Bohai Bay, centred on the estuary of the Haihe River, 170 km southeast of Beijing and 60 km east of Tianjin city. It is the largest man-made port in mainland China, and one of the largest in the world. It covers 121 square kilometers of land surface, with over 31.9 km of quay shoreline and 151 production berths at the end of 2010.Tianjin Port handled 500 million tonnes of cargo and 13 million TEU of containers in 2013, making it the world's fourth largest port by throughput tonnage and the ninth in container throughput. The port trades with more than 600 ports in 180 countries and territories around the world. It is served by over 115 regular container lines. run by 60 liner companies, including all the top 20 liners. Expansion in the last two decades has been enormous, going from 30 million tonnes of cargo and 490,000 TEU in 1993 to well beyond 400 million tonnes and 10 million TEU in 2012. Capacity is still increasing at a high rate, with 550\u2013600 Mt of throughput capacity expected by 2015.\nThe port is part of the Binhai New Area district of Tianjin Municipality, the main special economic zone of northern China, and it lies directly east of the TEDA. The Port of Tianjin is at the core of the ambitious development program of the BNA and, as part of that plan, the port aims to become the primary logistics and shipping hub of North China.\nOn 12 August 2015, at least two explosions within 30 seconds of each other occurred at a container storage station at the Port of Tianjin in the Binhai New Area of Tianjin, China. The cause of the explosions was not immediately known, but initial reports pointed to an industrial accident. Chinese state media said that at least the initial blast was from unknown hazardous materials in shipping containers at a plant warehouse owned by Ruihai Logistics, a firm specializing in handling hazardous materials.\n\n\n== Location and layout ==\n\nThe Port of Tianjin is on the coast of Tianjin Municipality, in the former county of Tanggu, on the coast between the estuaries of the Haihe to the south and the New Yongding River to the north.  To the west, the port borders the city of Tanggu (now the Urban Core of the Binhai New Area) and the TEDA. To the east, the port opens up to the Bohai Bay.\nTianjin Port is divided into nine port areas: the three core (\"Tianjin Xingang\") areas of Beijiang, Nanjiang, and Dongjiang around the Xingang fairway; the Haihe area along the river; the Beitang port area around the Beitangkou estuary; the Dagukou port area in the estuary of the Haihe River; and three areas under construction (Hanggu, Gaoshaling, Nangang).\n\n\n== Geophysical setting ==\n\nThe coastal area of Tianjin municipality before development was dominated by mudflats, salt marshes (and salterns), and coastal shallows. This littoral zone is wide and slopes gently: The 0 m isobath (the intertidal flats) extends to 3\u20138 km from shore at a slope of 0.71\u20131.28%, the \u22125 m isobath extends 14\u201318 km from shore, and the \u221210 m isobath reaches 22\u201336 km from shore. These features make deep water navigation dependent on extensive dredging, and it means that land reclamation is a cost-effective option for construction. Tianjin Port is by necessity largely man-made through dredging and reclamation.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe lower course and estuary of the Haihe is the main stem of a large navigable basin, as well as the westernmost seashore of the North China Plain, and there have been major ports on the area at least since the late Eastern Han Dynasty. The river port at the junction of the Grand Canal served as both an inland port and seaport supplying the northeast border of Chinese states. Since 1153, it was the critical supply hub for what is now Beijing.\nHowever, it was not until after the conclusion of the Second Opium War in 1860 that the port of Tanggu became an important transshipment center, allowing oceangoing ships to lighter their cargoes to cross the very shallow sandbar barring the entrance to Haihe, the Taku Bar (\u5927\u6cbd\u575d \u2014 the name of this barrier was often used by foreign powers to refer to the entire port).\nAfter the Boxer Rebellion, the whole of Tanggu came under foreign occupation, and those foreign powers developed an extensive network of quays on the riverside.The capacity of the Tanggu and Tianjin river port was limited, and so the Japanese occupation forces started in 1940 the construction of the Tanggu Xingang seaport (later the Tianjin Xingang port) outside the river estuary. By the end of the war, the new port was incomplete, and damage during the Chinese Civil War left it unusable by the time of its capture in 1949.\nThe Communists reconstructed the Tanggu New Port slowly. On 17 October 1952, it reopened for traffic. At the time, the main channel was dredged to 6 m depth, could handle ships of up to 7,000 DWT and had an annual throughput of only 800,000 tonnes \u2014 less than 1/500 of present capacity. The port remained small throughout the Maoist era, although it pioneered the first container routes and dedicated container terminal in China.\nThe export boom that followed the post-1979 Reform and Opening period put enormous pressure on the rickety port infrastructure of China. Congestion became serious enough to force reform by the central government: On 1 June 1984, the Port of Tianjin was transferred from direct control of the Ministry of Communications to a \"dual\" system of shared central and local control.\n\nProduction then increased in leaps and bounds. In 1988 throughput passed the 20 million tonnes milestone, and in the ten years from 1993, annual throughput growth averaged 10 million tonnes every year. In December 2001, the port was the first port in north China to reach the 100 million tonnes mark. In 2004 it reached 200 million tonnes, in 2007 300 million tonnes and in 2010 400 million tonnes. The container handling capacity of the port increased from 0.4 million TEU in 1992, to 2.4 million TEU in 2002, 7.1 million TEU in 2007, and more than 10 million TEU in 2010.\nThe structure of the port also changed. In 1992, Tianjin Port Storage and Transportation Company was made into a joint stock company under the full ownership of the Tianjin Port Bureau. In 1996, it was converted into the Tianjin Port Holdings Company (TPC) and listed in the Shanghai stock market. In 1997, Tianjin Development Holdings, which owned the container-handling assets of the Port, was listed in Hong Kong. Its port assets were later spun out as the Tianjin Port Development Company (TPD) and listed in the Hong Kong exchange in 2006.\nThe PTA delayed corporatization to steer the passing of the 11th five-year development plan for the port. The transition was only completed on 3 June 2004, when the PTA became the last major Port Authority in China to become a corporation: the Tianjin Port (Group) Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f(\u96c6\u56e2)\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8, or TPG by its English acronym).The financial tsunami of 2008 hit Chinese ports particularly hard, as they depended heavily on foreign trade flows. The Tianjin Port did better than average due to its diversification: While container business plummeted, bulk trade (in particular iron ore) remained strong. Nevertheless, the crisis hit profits hard, and it convinced the Tianjin government to reorganize and streamline the structure of the Port, which they did in 2009 by having TPD (the smaller operator, but one with the useful foreign registration and access to foreign capital markets) take over TPC. Simultaneously, ownership of TPD was transferred from Tianjin Development Holdings (a subsidiary of the Tianjin Ministry of Commerce) to TPG. By the time the merger was concluded, on 4 February 2010, all operations in the Tianjin Port had been consolidated under TPG.\nThe Port of Tianjin was adversely affected by a large industrial-scale accident in August 2015. On August 12, a series of explosions took place at a port chemical storage facility in Binhai, causing 173 deaths and nearly 800 injuries. The blast had the equivalent of 800 metric tonnes of ammonium nitrate or a magnitude-2.9 earthquake, according to the China Earthquake Networks Center. Eight other people remain missing.\n\n\n== Port fairway ==\n\nThe Tianjin Xingang Fairway is divided into the Main Shipping Channel, the Chuanzhadong Channel, and the Northern Branch Channel. The Dagusha Channel and the Haihe river channel are separate fairways with slightly different regulations.\n\n\n=== Anchorages ===\nTianjin Port has six main anchorage areas and two temporary anchorages. All anchorages are designated for all functions \u2014 berth waiting, quarantine, inspection and pilotage \u2014 and provide little shelter from weather or rough seas. Bottom hold is poor to very poor. Anchored vessels are advised to keep five cables of clearance, as anchor dragging is common (up to 5\u201310 NM in a day in winter, due to drifting ice).\n\n\n=== Shiplocks and tidal barriers ===\n\nThe Haihe river channel is separated from the sea channels by three structures: \n\nThe Xingang Shiplock (Chinese: \u65b0\u6e2f\u8239\u95f8; pinyin: x\u012bng\u01ceng chu\u00e1nzh\u00e1) in the northern side of the estuary is the main shipping route into the Haihe area.\nThe Haihe Tidal Barrier (Chinese: \u6d77\u6cb3\u9632\u6f6e\u95f8; pinyin: h\u01ceih\u00e9 f\u00e1ngch\u00e1ozh\u00e1), built in 1958, and last refurbished in 1999, serves as a dam, flood control sluice and tide surge protection for the Haihe river mouth.\nThe Tanggu Fishing Boat Lock (Chinese: \u5858\u6cbd\u6e14\u8239\u95f8; pinyin: t\u00e1ngg\u016b y\u00fachu\u00e1nzh\u00e1) is at the western end of the channel between Donggu and Lanjingdao Island. In 2011, the Fishing Boat Lock gates started to be rebuilt to allow for larger road traffic between Donggu and Lanjingdao.\nThe final hydraulic structure of the Tianjin Port is the Haihe Second Barrier (Chinese: \u6d77\u6cb3\u4e8c\u9053\u95f8; pinyin: h\u01ceih\u00e9 \u00e8rd\u00e0ozh\u00e1) at Dongnigucun, in the Jinnan district. The Second Barrier is also an open-type sluice barrier, with 8 vertical-rising gates allowing an average flow of 1200 m3/s. The barrier, opened in July 1984, closes ship traffic upriver into Tianjin city proper, and its erection resulted in the abandonment of 29.3 km of navigable channel.\n\n\n== Port governance ==\n\n\n=== State regulation and supervision ===\nThe Port of Tianjin falls under the supervisory and regulatory purview of the Tianjin Municipality People's Government. The 2004 incorporation of the Tianjin Port Authority into TPG formally divested the group of its role as Port Regulator, which passed to the Tianjin Transportation and Port Authority (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u6e2f\u53e3\u7ba1\u7406\u5c40), formerly the Tianjin Transport Commission. The TTPA implements state policy on port work; drafts local policies, by-laws and regulations; and licenses, audits, and issues certifications to businesses operating in the port, in particular to ship terminals. The TTPA supervises and manages compliance to all laws and regulations regarding environmental protection, service compliance, pilotage, maintenance of port infrastructure and handling of dangerous goods and disinfection in all terminals and storage areas.\nThe Tianjin Municipality People's Government Port Services Office (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u4eba\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u53e3\u5cb8\u670d\u52a1\u529e\u516c\u5ba4) was set up in May 2009 to streamline port operations, in particular customs and inspection clearance procedures.Tianjin Maritime Safety Bureau: Harbormaster powers for the Port of Tianjin are mostly vested on the Tianjin Maritime Safety Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u4e8b\u5c40), which is the local agency of the China Maritime Safety Administration.Maritime Law: The Port of Tianjin falls under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin Maritime Court for all matters of national and international Maritime law, including all forms of maritime contracts, torts and offenses.\n\n\n=== Inspection and clearance ===\nInbound ships, cargo and personnel require clearance by four main government bodies: China Customs for customs declaration, Border Inspection for migration formalities, China Inspection and Quarantine for quarantine and fumigation, and the MSA for ship and crew safety regulations. Obtaining clearance from these so-called \"One Customs Three Inspections\" (\u4e00\u5173\u4e09\u68c0) used to be a protracted process, and one of the continued foci of port reform is to speed up the clearance procedures and reduce their (still significant) burden.\n\n\n=== Port management ===\n\nTianjin Port Group (TPG) is both the main Port Operator and Port Landowner, and retains some of the old Port Authority's supervisory functions. TPG is the holding company and Ultimate Controlling Party for most of the Tianjin Port operating units, and its affiliates and subordinate units run most aspects of port operation. The Dagukou port area is (at present) run separately by the Tianjin Lingang Port Group Co. (\u5929\u6d25\u4e34\u6e2f\u6e2f\u52a1\u96c6\u56e2\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), owned by the Tianjin Lingang Economic Area Administrative Committee (of which TPG is a part).|TPG also serves as Port Landlord, providing basic municipal services (including roads, power, water and sewerage) and other services, extending from construction materials to printing services, to the port's tenant operators. In this role, TPG maintains quasi-municipal authority over port areas. Finally, as with all Chinese SOEs, the control and coordination role of the local Communist Party units is significant, as is the common cross-sharing of personnel among related units.\n\n\n== Traffic management and navigational safety ==\n\n\n=== Area procedures and traffic rules ===\n\nThe Vessel Traffic Service Center (\u5929\u6d25\u8239\u8236\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5fc3) of the MSA provides traffic control, navigation assistance and local communication to all vessels in the Port's fairway, anchorages and berths. The VTS Center is located in an 88 m tall control tower at the eastern end of the Dongtudi (East Pier), and has two subordinate monitoring stations at Dongjiang and Lingang. Its control area extends 20 nautical miles (37 km) from the tower. Compliance with the VTSC's authority is mandatory, and all ships must maintain watch on its VHF channel (Ch. 9) while on the port area. On the Haihe, both VHF 09 and 71 must be on watch.\n\n\n=== Aids to navigation ===\nThe Tianjin Port's aids to navigation (AtoN) system is fairly dense, and growing rapidly. The MSA Beihai Navigational Security Center's Tianjin Aids to Navigation Office (\u5317\u6d77\u822a\u6d77\u4fdd\u969c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5929\u6d25\u822a\u6807\u5904) is responsible for the maintenance of all navaids within the Tianjin area. In 2004, the AtoN office controlled 141 navaids in the Tianjin jurisdiction, including 3 lighthouses, 12 light beacons, 22 lead markers, 44 day beacons, 55 light buoys, 1 NDB station, 1 RBN/DGPS station, 3 radar transponders, 2 large AtoN ships, 2 small AtoN ships and 1 survey ship operating from two wharves.\n\n\n=== Weather monitoring and reporting ===\nWhile the Port directly operates a number of hydro-meteorological stations (including tide gauges), weather forecasting is primarily the responsibility of the Tianjin Binhai New Area Weather Warning Center (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u6ee8\u6d77\u65b0\u533a\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u8b66\u4e2d\u5fc3), the local agency of the Tianjin Municipal Weather Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u6c14\u8c61\u5c40). The Warning Center uses local (26 automatic weather stations in Binhai), national and satellite data to forecast marine and port weather.\n\n\n=== Maritime communication ===\n\nTianjin Coastal Radio: The Beihai Navigational Security Center's Tianjin Communications and Information Center (\u5317\u6d77\u822a\u6d77\u4fdd\u969c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5929\u6d25\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5fc3) runs the Tianjin Coastal Station (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u5cb8\u7535\u53f0, Callsign: XSV; Call: Tianjin Radio; MMSI 004121100). The Station is in charge of the communication obligations of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System in the Port's jurisdiction, supports the SAR Center's communication needs, and supports the MSA's duties of coordination and communications.\n\n\n=== SAR operations and emergency response ===\nMaritime Rescue Coordination: The primary SAR coordination agency is the Tianjin Maritime Search and Rescue Center (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u6d77\u4e0a\u641c\u6551\u4e2d\u5fc3), with responsibility for coordinating all SAR activities in Port waters.\n\nThe Tianjin Search and Rescue Base is one of the six rescue bases of the China Rescue and Salvage Beihai Bureau, which is the front-line rescue and salvage force of the Ministry of Transport.SAR Assets: Tianjin Rescue Base keeps three dynamic standby stations, normally with the following units:\nSearch and Rescue Base's Wharf: One Fast Rescue Boat (Huaying 387) and one rescue tug.\nDagukou Anchorage: One 1940 kW Rescue Ship (Beihaijiu 169)\nBeihai 2nd Point (10 NM south of Caofeidian, 38\u00ba50\u00b4N / 118\u00ba25\u00b4E) : One 1940 kW Rescue Ship (Beihaijiu 115)Tianjin Port PSB Fire Services Detachment (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u516c\u5b89\u5c40\u6d88\u9632\u652f\u961f) holds the fire-fighting and fire prevention duties for both the land and water areas of the Port.Emergency Medical Assistance: The Tianjin Port Hospital (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u53e3\u533b\u9662) is the primary provider of emergency medical care in the port. It is a 314-bed comprehensive hospital, owned by TPG, that is specially licensed to deal with infectious disease outbreaks, quarantine and maritime accident trauma: its orthopedic trauma department is especially well ranked nationally.Pollution Control: Tianjin MSA is the Port's \"National Operational Contact Point\" pursuant to MARPOL, and must be contacted (VHF 9) in all incidents of shipborne harmful substance spills.The State Oceanic Administration has overlapping authority regarding spills and pollution, usually concentrated on oil platform and pipeline incidents.\n\n\n== Law enforcement ==\n\nThe maritime governance regime in China is peculiar in its multiplicity of actors and apparent duplication of labor. Five major agencies (MSA, SOA, CCG, FLEC, GAC), plus the local People's Police and other local units, divide maritime and coastal law enforcement, safety and administrative duties, with much overlap in formal remits. These agencies' responsibilities reflect the functional jurisdiction of their parent ministries, and their operational emphases fit those jurisdictions. Only the Coast Guard (Maritime Police) patrol vessels are armed gunboats, and the Guard has first line jurisdiction in gendarmerie missions such as terrorism, piracy and serious crimes.\n\n\n=== People's Police units ===\n\nThe Tianjin Port Public Security Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u516c\u5b89\u5c40) is one of the fourteen branch offices of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, with sub-bureau status. It is responsible for public order, law enforcement, criminal investigation, road traffic control, and fire safety and firefighting.Water Police: The Tianjin Port PSB has its own water police unit running its own patrol boats, which are berthed on a floating pontoon station (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u516c\u5b89\u5c40\u6c34\u4e0a\u6cbb\u5b89\u6d3e\u51fa\u6240) built on a converted floating crane, currently located on the K1 berth of the Tianjin Port Passenger Terminal.\n\nBorder Protection: the Public Security Border Troops (\u516c\u5b89\u8fb9\u9632\u90e8\u961f) are a gendarmerie force under control of the MPS in charge of border protection and security. The border guards' local ground unit is the Binhai New Area Public Security Border Protection Detachment (\u6ee8\u6d77\u65b0\u533a\u516c\u5b89\u8fb9\u9632\u652f\u961f).The Tianjin Customs Anti-Smuggling Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u5173\u7f09\u79c1\u5c40), usually called the Anti-Smuggling Police (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u5173\u7f09\u79c1\u8b66\u5bdf) is a People's Police unit under the dual command of the MPS and the GAC. It is the main body engaged in control, prevention and investigation of customs fraud and duty evasion and smuggling (including cultural goods, drugs, dangerous materials, etc.).\n\n\n=== Other law enforcement bodies ===\nThe law enforcement arms of the MSA are the Tianjin Maritime Public Security Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u4e8b\u516c\u5b89\u5c40) and the Tianjin MSA Law Enforcement Patrol Flotilla (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u4e8b\u5c40\u5de1\u67e5\u6267\u6cd5\u652f\u961f). The Tianjin Maritime PSB (not to be confused with the Tianjin Port Public Security Bureau) is responsible for maritime law enforcement and carries out marine accident and criminal investigations. The Patrol Flotilla deploys eleven patrol ships (hull numbers haixun 05xx), which monitor and manage shipping traffic, maintain navigational order and safety, and cooperate on patrol, escort, and search and rescue missions as needed.\nThe Second Detachment of China Maritime Surveillance (\u4e2d\u56fd\u6d77\u76d1\u7b2c\u4e8c\u652f\u961f) of the Tianjin Oceanic Administration has jurisdiction over the Bohai and Laizhou Bays, and over all the coastal areas of Tianjin and Hebei. It monitors environmental damage, illegal use of sea resources, violation of maritime regulations, and damage to marine facilities.The Tianjin Fisheries Management and Fishing Port Supervision and Management Office (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u6e14\u653f\u6e14\u6e2f\u76d1\u7763\u7ba1\u7406\u5904) is a branch of the Tianjin Fisheries Bureau under the China Fisheries Law Enforcement Command Center (\u4e2d\u56fd\u6e14\u653f\u6307\u6325\u4e2d\u5fc3). It is in charge of enforcing fishing regulations, of controlling illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU), and of fishing navigational safety.\n\n\n== Business structure ==\n\n\n=== Ownership structure ===\n\nThe Port of Tianjin is a state-owned enterprise (SOE), run as an independent corporation, with separate finances and a commercial orientation. The Port Owner is the Tianjin Municipality People's Government (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u4eba\u6c11\u653f), through the Tianjin SASAC (Tianjin State Assets Supervision and Administration Committee\u2014\u5929\u6d25\u56fd\u6709\u8d44\u4ea7\u76d1\u7763\u7ba1\u7406\u59d4\u5458\u4f1a), which is the full owner of the Tianjin Port (Group) Company (TPG). TPG's board is appointed by the Tianjin government. TPG is the effective holding company and main Port Operator, and it owns or has a stake on the majority of the Port's various operating outfits.\nSince the 2009 merger, TPG's main operating subsidiary is Tianjin Port Development Co. Ltd (TPD), which in turn is the majority shareholder of Tianjin Port Holdings Co. Ltd (TPC).\nTPG has been injecting operational assets to TPC for several years, and since 2009 to TPD (most recently the Shihua Crude Oil Terminal). This has created somewhat of a functional division. The listed TPD, directly or through TPC, controls all terminals and direct cargo-handling operations. TPG still directly controls most of the utility, support and ancillary units related to the Port, and retains control of strategic planning. TPG is also directly or indirectly a party in 53 joint ventures\n\n\n== Port operations ==\n\nThe subsidiaries and partial-ownership partners of TPG are involved in all facets of port operation, including stevedoring, shipping agency, cargo handling, storage and transportation, infrastructure management, communications and information services, financial services, power supply, real estate development, health care, personnel training, education, port security, transportation, fire protection, port facilities management, environmental management, etc.The core activity of the Port is, naturally, cargo handling and processing. As a comprehensive port, it handles all sort of cargoes, including dry and liquid bulk, general cargo, containers, vehicles, and passengers. Tianjin Port operates 365 days a year, 24 hours a day (on three shifts at 00:00\u201308:00, 08:00\u201316:00 and 16:00\u201324:00).\n\n\n=== Port production ===\nDocking terminals and wharves: As of 2011, the Port had 217 berths (including service berths); 90 berths were capable of accommodating ships over 10,000 DWT. Of these, 72 could dock ships over 50,000 DWT; 30 over 100,000 DWT, 23 over 150,000 DWT, 5 over 200,000 DWT, and 2 over 300,000 DWT.The Port's docking terminals are operated by autonomous companies that are mostly either fully owned by, or are joint ventures with, TPC or TPD. While the 2004 Port Law allowed full foreign ownership of port facilities, TPG is still the majority shareholder of all but a few of the Port's main terminals, excepting single-company (customs type II) terminals. Additional stevedoring personnel is provided by a number of labor services companies affiliated to various operators.\nSecondary wharves tend to the service, supply and maintenance ships that a complex port needs to function. These facilities range from temporary sand unloading wharves, needed for construction, to large bunkering wharves, workboat stations and the bases of the various law enforcement agencies.\nScheduling and Dispatching: The Tianjin Port Group's Operations Department (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u96c6\u56e2\u4e1a\u52a1\u90e8) is in charge of coordinating the productive operation of the Port, and must be informed of all ship movements and major operations. The production schedule (ship movement plan) is arranged by the TPG Dispatch Control Center (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u96c6\u56e2\u751f\u4ea7\u8c03\u5ea6\u6307\u4e2d\u5fc3), in coordination with the wharf operators, the MSA, and the pilot center. The Dispatch Center organizes ship movements, tracks pilotage operations, and supervises terminal operations via real-time CCTV monitoring. The Dagukou port area has a separate dispatching center (\u5929\u6d25\u4e34\u6e2f\u7ecf\u6d4e\u533a\u8239\u8236\u8c03\u5ea6\u6307\u6325\u4e2d\u5fc3).\n\nHarbor Craft: The main provider of harbor craft is the Tianjin Port Tug & Lighter Company. The TTLC operates the harbor tugs, fireboats, pilot boats and other ancillary craft such as the crew boat\nXinbinhai, or the sightseeing boat Xinhaimen (used for inspection and visiting VIPs). The company operates 26 harbor tugs (between 2,600 HP and 6,000 HP of power), 5 pilot ships, 7 other ancillary crafts, 2 floating cranes (120 t and 200 t capacity); and around three dozen lighters, the largest around 1,340 t displacement. The Dagusha channel is served by a subsidiary company of TTLC, the Tianjin Lingang Tug Company (\u5929\u6d25\u4e34\u6e2f\u62d6\u8f6e\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), operating four tugboats.Other work vessels: CNOOC Bohai Oil maintains a flotilla of 110 offshore support vessels (OSV), many homeported at Tianjin. These boats are available for emergency work under MSA authority. Two of CNOOC's floating cranes (800 tonnes and 500 tonnes) can be commercially engaged for harbor duty.\n\n\n=== Port maintenance and construction ===\nFacilities management: TPG operates as the port landlord, and provides most utilities, municipal services and ancillary services to the various port operators. The services it provides are very wide in scope, spanning everything from electrical power, to construction materials, to printing services. The main organ of TPG's landlord function is the Tianjin Port Facilities Management Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u8bbe\u65bd\u7ba1\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u516c\u53f8), which manages and maintains all municipal services  \u2014 including roads, railroads, bridges, water, and sewerage \u2014 installs and maintains wharf equipment and other production material, provides municipal administration, and provides engineering consultancy services.Hydrographic Surveying and Charting: As an artificial port dependent on dredged channels susceptible to silting, continuous depth surveying is critical to the Port. Tianjin Port is the base of the Beihai Navigational Security Center's Tianjin Marine Survey and Charting Center (\u5317\u6d77\u822a\u6d77\u4fdd\u969c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u4e8b\u6d4b\u7ed8\u4e2d\u5fc3) with responsibility for the hydrographic surveying, monitoring, fairway sounding and charting of all waters and shipping channels in the Beihai (Northern Seas) area, which includes the Bohai and Yellow seas. As of 2011, the Hydrographic Brigade had 149 personnel, two survey ships (Haice 051 and Haice 0502), surveying equipment including ROVs, and UAVs for aerial surveyingChannel maintenance: The Tianjin Dredging Company  (\u5929\u6d25\u822a\u9053\u5c40) is the organic waterway management company of the Tianjin Port Group. As of January 2010, the TDC deployed 100 boats, and had the largest dredging capacity of China, with a capacity of 300 million cubic meters and more than 500,000 kW of vessel power. Despite these numbers, the scale of fairway expansion and land reclamation in the Port means that several other construction companies operate large numbers of dredging vessels as well.Dredging the Haihe Channel is the responsibility of the Tianjin Municipal Water Management Bureau (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u6c34\u52a1\u5c40), which maintains both navigability and river flow capacity (set at 800 m3/s). The Water Management dredgers operate from wharves at the Haihe Second Barrier and at the Haihe Tidal Barrier.Icebreaking: Routine icebreaking is usually handled by the Tug & Lighter Company. In case of ice emergencies, the MSA coordinates icebreaking patrols, using heavy harbor tugs and dredges. During the frozen winter of 2010\u201311, the Port authorities estimated that there were 16 ships with icebreaking capabilities available, 10 of which belonged to the TTLC. CNOOC Bohai had 24 icebreakers, needed to clear offshore platforms, and also lent two larger icebreakers to the Port.Port Construction: The Port's main construction and engineering outfit is CCCC First Harbor Engineering (\u4e2d\u4ea4\u7b2c\u4e00\u822a\u52a1\u5de5\u7a0b\u5c40\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8).\n Four subsidiary companies carry out all forms of project engineering and construction, from roads to breakwaters. As of 2010, First Harbor Engineering First Company (the main boat outfit) had a fleet of 74 work vessels. As in the case of dredgers, the sheer scale of construction in the Port means that many other outfits deploy hundreds of vessels. As of 2008, there were 418 construction vessels operating at the Port, including 236 sand barges and fluvial workboats.The Tianjin Research Institute for Water Transport Engineering is in charge of the technical supervision of most port engineering projects.\nReal Estate Development: Commercial and residential property development in newly reclaimed or repurposed land is one of the four core \"industries\" of the Port. The Tianjin Port Real Estate Development Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u5730\u4ea7\u53d1\u5c55\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), founded 2009, is now very active in developing both residential and commercial property on Port land.\n\n\n=== Services and amenities ===\n\nBunkerage: The main bunker oil, lubricants and water provider in Tianjin Port is Tianjin Chimbusco (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8239\u8236\u71c3\u6599\u4f9b\u5e94\u5929\u6d25\u516c\u53f8). Chimbusco China had a monopoly on the supply of bonded bunker oil (i.e. for foreign vessels) in China until 2006. Tianjin Chimbusco (now a TPG subsidiary) retained its exclusive rights in Tianjin until 2009, and the end of the monopoly resulted in a black gold rush of competing bunkerage companies: Sinopec Zhoushan entered the Tianjin market in October 2010, followed in December 2010 by SinoBunker, and in June 2011, by China Changjiang Bunker. This sudden rise in competition resulted in a serious price war and crashing prices in 2011. Most forms of maritime fuels are available, primarily IFO 180 cSt and 380 cSt; IFO 120 cSt, MDG, MDO and other diesels are available. Bunkering operations are done by fuel tender, as most berths do not have fueling equipment. Equally, drinking water is mostly delivered by tender.\nChandlery and Supplies: Several dozen ship chandlers are capable of supplying all necessary deck, engine and cabin stores, and all other provisions both at berth or at anchorage. The oldest international chandler is Tianjin Ocean Shipping Supply company (\u5929\u6d25\u5e02\u5916\u8f6e\u4f9b\u5e94\u516c\u53f8), owned by the Tianjin government. Most spare parts are available locally, and special orders can be flown in easily.\nCleaning and Sanitation Services: Bilge, slops and ballast water disposal is a major pollution hazard for the Bohai Bay, and it is tightly regulated by the MSA. Only specially authorized enterprises can engage in their removal and disposal, or in tank cleanup. Nevertheless, illegal dumping of ballast water is a persistent problem and one of the Port's major law enforcement challenges. Ships carrying oil or liquid chemicals, and all ships over 10,000 gt are required to sign an \"Agreement for Ship Pollution Response\" with one of four authorized emergency spill response companies.Tianjin Port Harbor Service Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u6e2f\u53e3\u670d\u52a1\u516c\u53f8) is the Group's organic \"housekeeping\" service, providing cabin, hold and bedding clean-up, and garbage disposal for ships at berth. Other companies are available for all sorts of cleaning, disinfection and deck maintenance, fifteen companies are authorized for ship garbage collection.Seafarers:  As the port of a major city, facilities available to crews on shore leave are extensive, if somewhat difficult to reach. The International Seamen's Club (\u5929\u6d25\u65b0\u6e2f\u56fd\u9645\u6d77\u5458\u4ff1\u4e50\u90e8) is located at Xingang Liumi Road, opposite the Bomesc shipyard. Around two dozen crew management companies provide replacement crews at all times.\n\n\n=== Ship repair and shipbuilding facilities ===\n\nTianjin Port has several ship repair and shipbuilding facilities capable of carrying out almost all forms of ship repair and refitting for all but the largest ships, and those capabilities are increasing rapidly.\nThe Tanggu port area was one of the earliest modern shipbuilding areas of China. The still-functioning Taku Dockyard (now the Tianjin City Shipyard) was founded in 1880, and is the oldest modern dockyard in Northern China. Many small shipyards operated in the Haihe region, but most have closed in recent years, or will soon close to make way for the large development projects of the Binhai Urban Core.\nThe main ship repair facility in the port is the CSIC Tianjin Xingang Shipyard. Founded in 1939, it is located at the very end of the main harbor basin, right next to the Haihe shiplock. Immediately next to it is the CCCC Bomesc Maritime Industry's facility (built in 2007). On the Nanjiang region, Singapore's Sembawang Shipyard entered in 1997 to the first foreign joint shipyard project in China, in partnership with Bohai Oil. That shipyard is now the CNOOC Bohai Oil BOHIC subsidiary.A large number of ship repair companies offer maintenance services at berth, and the Tianjin Wuzhou Marine Service Engineering Co. (\u5929\u6d25\u4e94\u6d32\u6d77\u4e8b\u5de5\u7a0b\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8) offers anchorage and under-way repairs using its specialized ship Jinyuanhangxiu 1 (\u6d25\u8fdc\u822a\u4fee1\u53f7), one of only five such vessels in China.\n\n\n=== Trade and shipping services ===\nOne of the strategic goals of the Port is to increase its high value-added services business, providing advance support for all forms of logistic activities.\nThe Tianjin International Trade and Shipping Service District (\u5929\u6d25 \u4e0e\u822a\u8fd0\u670d\u52a1\u533a) The Service District is composed of nine high-rise buildings, including the TPG main office building and the International Shipping Service Center.\n\nThe Tianjin International Trade and Shipping Service Center (\u5929\u6d25\u56fd\u9645\u8d38\u6613\u4e0e\u822a\u8fd0\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u5fc3) provides \"one-stop\" service for all sorts of aspects of shipping and trade, with a core mission of centralizing and streamlining the clearance process. The Center aggregates 270 government service windows from 14 government agencies, including customs, inspection and quarantine, maritime safety, border control, traffic control, maritime court, electronic customs clearance, business taxes, and state audit and supervision.\nThe Dongjiang shipping services area is still under development, and aims to form a cluster of specific shipping services. Taking advantage of its favorable tax and currency exchange regime, the Dongjiang Bonded Port intends to attract a cluster of enterprises related to the financing of ship leasing and shipbroking, and to other forms of shipping financing, including offshore financial services, offshore banking, marine insurers and P&I clubs, ship registration, local offices of the leading classification societies, etc.Shipping Agencies: Engaging a shipping agent is mandatory for all foreign flagged ships, and Tianjin has several dozen such outfits operating at present. The largest agents are Tianjin Penavico (\u5929\u6d25\u5916\u8f6e\u4ee3\u7406\u516c\u53f8), owned by TPG, and Tianjin Sinoagent (\u5929\u6d25\u8239\u52a1\u4ee3\u7406\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), a subsidiary of Tianjin Sinotrans. Agencies have fairly extensive obligations as intermediaries for most paperwork procedures involving TPG, ship operators, or government agencies, as well as their traditional duties of arranging ship supply and cargo handling.\n\n\n== Passenger services ==\n\n\n=== Passenger terminals ===\n\nThe Tianjin Xingang Passenger Terminal (\u5929\u6d25\u65b0\u6e2f\u5ba2\u8fd0\u7ad9) is run by the Tianjin Passenger Company, and provides ferry services and coastal cruises.  Two main regular ferry lines and one summer-only ferry line leave Tianjin, serviced by a fleet of three Ro-Ro ferry boats.  There are two international destinations, Kobe in Japan and Incheon in South Korea, and one national destination, Dalian in Liaoning Province.\n\nThe new Tianjin Cruise Homeport started operation in the summer of 2010. It is located in the southern tip of the Dongjiang peninsula. The all-services terminal building is a large white GFRC-clad building designed to mimic the flow of white silk on an ocean breeze. It has an annual capacity of 500,000 passengers. At present, the Homeport has two berths capable of accommodating ships up to 220,000 gt \u2014enough to receive even the largest current cruisers.\n\n\n=== Leisure services ===\nYachting marinas: There are three large-scale marina projects underway at the Tianjin Port to expand yachting services.\nThe Binhai Ocean One Yachting Club (\u6ee8\u6d77\u4e00\u6d0b\u6e38\u8247\u4f1a) is being built at the southern end of the Dongjiang Scenic Area's artificial beach. It is planned to become a yachting port with 700 berths, plus an extra 200 pile mooring slots.\nThe Sino-Australia Royal Yacht City (\u4e2d\u6fb3\u7687\u5bb6\u6e38\u8247\u57ce) is a 1,000-berth development (to be completed in 2012) in the Tianjin Central Fishing Port.\nThe Hi-speed Tianjin Yacht City (\u6d77\u65af\u6bd4\u5929\u6d25\u6e38\u8247\u57ce) in the Binhai Tourist Area plans to add 3,000 berths, focusing on high-speed boats, sailboats and high-performance yachts.Sightseeing tours: Two companies offer short (30-45min) boat tours of the harbor, traveling to the end of the Chuanzhadong channel. The first, Tianjin Port Haiyi Travel Service Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u6d77\u9890\u65c5\u884c\u793e\u516c\u53f8), a TPG subsidiary, runs the sightseeing boat Haiyi (\u6d77\u9890\u53f7) from the K1 berth of the Passenger Terminal, with capacity for 132 passengers (CN\u00a5 30 as of November 2011). The second, Tianjin Haihe Jinlu Sightseeing Boats Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6d77\u6cb3\u6d25\u65c5\u6e38\u8239\u516c\u53f8) operates from the Sightseeing Boats Pier at the other side of the main basin. It runs two ships, the Haijing (\u6d77\u666f\u53f7) with capacity for 150 passengers and the Jinhai (\u6d25\u6d77\u53f7) with capacity for 184 passengers. CN\u00a5 50 as of April 2011.\n\n\n== Transportation and logistics ==\n\nStorage, transportation and all forms of logistics processing are the core activity of the Port, and it is no surprise that the majority of its land surface is dedicated to storage and processing facilities, with several million km2 of storage yards, warehouses and tank farms operated by dozens of enterprises. There are two large-scale purpose-built logistics areas designed to provide support and facilities to the operating logistics outfits.\nThe chief logistics unit of the Port Group is Tianjin Logistics Development Co. , established in 2009 by merging the Tianjin Port Storage and Distribution Company (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u8d27\u8fd0\u516c\u53f8) with other Group logistics assets. TLD runs 1,800,000 m2 of storage yard, with a capacity for 32,000 TEU of containers, and is responsible for the establishment and management of the dry port network and the establishment of intermodal routes, as well as being the principal drayage provider.\n\n\n=== Transportation corridors ===\n\nSea routes: Two main sea routes connect the Bohai Bay with the Yellow Sea and the open ocean. These two routes carry the large majority of all traffic in and out of the Bohai Sea, and can be very crowded. The main deep-water route (6 nmi wide) goes from the Laotieshan Channel (38\u00b036.1\u2032 N, 120\u00b051.3\u2032 E) at a 276\u00b0 bearing until reaching a Traffic Separation Scheme south of Caofeidian (38\u00b048.0\u2032 N/118\u00b045.2\u2032 E), and can be quite a crowded waterway. A second main route (3 NM wide westward, 3 NM wide eastward) goes westward from Changshan channel (38\u00b005.0\u2032 N/120\u00b024.6\u2032 E) at a 293.5\u00b0 bearing up to a point north of oil platform BZ28-1 (38\u00b021.0\u2032 N/119\u00b038.5\u2032 E), continuing at a 291\u00b0 bearing up to the south of Caofedian Head (38\u00b038.7\u2032 N/118\u00b038.4\u2032 E) and then into the Xingang Main Channel.Internal waterways: The three main port areas are fairly poorly connected by road, requiring rather long detours to transport any cargo or equipment between them. While several bridges and tunnels directly linking Dongjiang with Beijiang and Nanjiang areas are projected for future development, these are still in early planning stages. To help relieve this internal bottleneck, in April 2010 the Port introduced a lighter route connecting Nanjiang (N-10 berth) and Beijiang (Tianjin Container Terminal), using one heavy barge (7800 DWT, 200 TEU). Another regular lighter route connecting Beijiang with Dongjiang was established in September 2010.\n\nRailroads: Two main lines (First and Second Port Railroads: \u8fdb\u6e2f\u4e00\u4e8c\u7ebf) serve the Beijiang and Nanjiang areas respectively. The Jinji Railway connects these lines as a de facto ring railroad. A web of around 60 km of internal railways goes deep into the wharves and storage yards of the Beijiang area. The Nanjiang area is primarily connected through the Nanjiang Rail Bridge. This bridge was expanded to double-track in 2010, for an annual capacity of 70 million tonnes. A second bridge is under construction. A conveyor belt corridor runs parallel to the railway, carrying coal and ore to the Bulk Logistics Center.Highways and roads: The internal roads in the Port carry an enormously heavy, noisy and noisome flow of traffic, and traffic jams are not uncommon at certain bottlenecks. The internal roads at the three main Port areas form a broken grid pattern, the east-west roads connecting with the expressways that feed the port. The main north-south roads are the Yuejin road transfixing the Container Logistics Center, the Meizhou (Americas) Road in the Dongjiang Area.\nThe backbone road of the Port is the S11 Haibin Expressway (\u6d77\u6ee8\u9ad8\u901f), which runs north-south and roughly represents the Port's western boundary. The main east-west feeder roads are the S40 Jingjintang Expressway (\u4eac\u6d25\u5858\u9ad8\u901f), which merges into the Jingmen road; the S13 Jinbin Expressway ( \u6d25\u6ee8\u9ad8\u901f) and the G103 Highway, which both merge into the Xingang Fourth Road; and the S30 Jingjin Expressway (\u4eac\u6d25\u9ad8\u901f), which becomes the Jishuanggang road and then the Xingang 8th Road into Dongjiang. In the south, the Tianjin Avenue and the S50 Jinpu Expressway (\u6d25\u6d66\u9ad8\u901f) connect into the Nanjiang and Lingang areas.\nThese feeder roads connect in turn with the thick Beijing-Tianjin road hub, with seven radial expressways from Beijing and four from Tianjin. Of these, the Jinji Expressway (S1) is the main alternative route into Beijing (through Pinggu) and the Northwest (through the 6th Ring Road and the G6 Jingla Expressway), while the G25 Changzhen Expressway is the main North-South connector.\nAirports: The Port is 30 minutes away from Tianjin Binhai International Airport, and 120 min from Beijing Capital International Airport. Two small general aviation aerodromes\u2014Tanggu Airport (\u5858\u6cbd\u673a\u573a) and Binhai Eastern General Heliport (\u6ee8\u6d77\u4e1c\u65b9\u901a\u7528\u76f4\u5347\u673a\u573a)\u2014 provide offshore helicopter shuttles and other services to Port operators.\n\n\n=== Logistics centers, yards and warehouses ===\n\nThe Tianjin Port Container Logistics Center (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u96c6\u88c5\u7bb1\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3) is located in the north part of the Beijiang area, in 7.03  km\u00b2 of reclaimed land. The Center currently hosts 42 logistics enterprises, and it has 350 hectares of yard space, 26 hectares of warehouses, or about 60% of the Port's container handling capacity. Tianjin Port International Logistics Development Co. Ltd.  (TPL) was established in 2003 to take charge of the development, construction, operation and management of the Center.The Tianjin Port Bulk Logistics Center (\u5929\u6d25\u6e2f\u6563\u8d27\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\u5fc3) opened in 2000, built on 26.8  km2 of former salt flats to the south of Donggu. It serves as a large storage and distribution area for coal, ore and other bulk cargoes. As of April 2011, there were 268 enterprises operating within it. The Bulk Logistics Center is being progressively relocated south, to the Nangang area, to free its land for urban development (i. e. the Binhai Central New Town \u2013 \u6ee8\u6d77\u4e2d\u90e8\u65b0\u57ce)\nThe 12-5 plan envisages six large logistics parks in the port area by 2015: the Container Logistics and Bulk Cargo Centers will be upgraded to \"Parks\" (with additional policy privileges), joined by the newly established Nangang Chemical Logistics Park (\u5357\u6e2f\u5316\u5de5\u7269\u6d41\u56ed\u533a), Lingang Industrial ProLogis Logistics Park (\u4e34\u6e2f\u5de5\u4e1a\u666e\u6d1b\u65af\u7269\u6d41\u56ed\u533a), and the Central Fishing Port Logistics Park (\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6e14\u6e2f\u7269\u6d41\u56ed\u533a).\n\n\n=== Intermodal transportation and dry ports ===\nEconomic Hinterland: The hinterland of the Tianjin Port (as determined by existing railway and road patterns) is vast. It includes the municipalities of Beijing and Tianjin, and the provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, Tibet and Xinjiang, amounting to over 5 million km2, or 52\uff05 of China's area, and covering 17% of the country's population. Tianjin is also one of the railheads of the Eurasian Land Bridge.Dedicated Container Train Routes: TPL owns and operates 15 different scheduled railway routes, dispatching 50-car (100 TEU) trains to 15 different cities in China, including Xi'an, Chengdu, Taiyuan, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, Baotou, Shizuishan, Erenhot, Alashankou, and Manzhouli, the last three being border crossings. In the first half of 2011, these dedicated train lines carried 129,000 TEU, including cargoes for Eurasian destinations.Dry Ports: As of October 2011, Tianjin Port had established 21 dry ports, of which 8 were fully operational. These ports are located at:\n\nChaoyang (Beijing)\nPinggu (Beijing)\nBaoding (Hebei)\nShijiazhuang (Hebei)\nZhangjiakou (Hebei)\nHandan (Hebei)\nZibo (Shandong)\nDezhou (Shandong)\nZhengzhou (Henan)\nHebi (Henan)\nDaqing(Heilongjiang)\nBaotou (Inner Mongolia)\nBayannur (Inner Mongolia)\nErenhot (Inner Mongolia)\nHouma (Shanxi)\nXi'an (Shaanxi)\nDatong (Shaanxi)\nJiayuguan (Gansu)\nYinchuan (Ningxia)\nHuinong (Ningxia)\nDulat (Xinjiang)Erenhot and Dulat are border crossings. In 2010, the Tianjin dry ports processed 150,000 TEU worth of containers. The 12th five-year plan envisages increasing throughput by Tianjin's dry ports to up to 1 million TEU by 2015.\n\n\n== Friendship ports ==\n Amsterdam, Netherlands\n Barcelona, Spain\n Incheon, South Korea\n Kobe, Japan\n Marseille, France\n Melbourne, Australia\n Montreal, Canada\n Philadelphia, United States\n Tacoma, United States\n Tokyo, Japan\n Trieste, Italy\n Zeebrugge, Belgium\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTianjin Port Holdings Company Limited\nTianjin Port Development Holdings Limited\nMap of the Port of Tianjin\nLive AIS Map of the Port of Tianjin",

        "wiki": "Tianjin ([t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n.t\u0255\u00edn] (listen)), alternately romanized as Tientsin, is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China on the shore of the Bohai Sea. It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened.

There are also three English-language magazines: Jin, Tianjin Plus and Business Tianjin, mostly directed at ex-pats resident in the city.\n\n\n=== Previous newspapers ===\nThe first German newspaper in northern China, Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, was published in Tianjin.In 1912 Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and 5 daily newspapers in other languages; none of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers. Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News).

In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived.

Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.

The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility and as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project involving Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9 as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-speed rail.\nTianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also major railway stations in Tianjin.

        "wiki": "China (Chinese: \u4e2d\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3; lit.: 'Central State; Middle Earth; Midland'), officially the People's Republic of China (PRC; Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3), is a country in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of around 1.428 billion in 2017. Covering approximately 9.6 million square kilometres (3.7 million mi2), it is the world's third or fourth largest country by area. Governed by the Communist Party of China, the state exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\nChina emerged as one of the world's first civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the semi-mythical Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty, which ruled from 206 BCE until 220 CE, saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) and Northern Song (960\u20131127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa. Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the Xinhai Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty. The subsequent Chinese Civil War resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the Communist Party of China led by Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China on mainland China while the Kuomintang-led nationalist government retreated to the island of Taiwan where it governed until 1996 when Taiwan transitioned to democracy. The political status of Taiwan remains disputed to this day.\nChina is a unitary one-party socialist republic and is one of the few existing socialist states. Political dissidents and human rights groups have denounced and criticized the Chinese government for widespread human rights abuses, including suppression of religious and ethnic minorities, censorship and mass surveillance, and cracking down on protests such as in 1989. The Chinese government says that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present economic level.\nSince the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, China's economy has been one of the world's fastest-growing with annual growth rates consistently above 6 percent. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $12.24 trillion by 2017. According to official data, China's GDP in 2018 was 90 trillion Yuan ($13.5 trillion). Since 2010, China has been the world's second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and since 2014, the largest economy in the world by PPP. China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods. China is a recognized nuclear weapons state and has the world's largest standing army, the People's Liberation Army, and the second-largest defense budget. The PRC is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council as it replaced the ROC in 1971, as well as an active global partner of ASEAN Plus mechanism. China has been characterized as a emerging superpower, mainly because of its massive population, large and rapidly-growing economy, and powerful military.\n\n\n== Names ==\n\nThe word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century. However, it was not a word used by the Chinese themselves during the period. Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word C\u012bna, used in ancient India.\"China\" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa. Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian Ch\u012bn (\u0686\u06cc\u0646), which was in turn derived from Sanskrit C\u012bna (\u091a\u0940\u0928). C\u012bna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (5th century BCE) and the Laws of Manu (2nd century BCE). In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BCE). Although this derivation is still given in various sources, the origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Alternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state.The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (Chinese: \u4e2d\u534e\u4eba\u6c11\u5171\u548c\u56fd; pinyin: Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 R\u00e9nm\u00edn G\u00f2ngh\u00e9gu\u00f3). The shorter form is \"China\" Zh\u014dnggu\u00f3 (\u4e2d\u56fd), from zh\u014dng (\"central\") and gu\u00f3 (\"state\"), a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne. It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing. It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived \"barbarians\". The name Zhongguo is also translated as \"Middle Kingdom\" in English.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nArchaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China between 2.24 million and 250,000 years ago. The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a Homo erectus who used fire, were discovered in a cave at Zhoukoudian near Beijing; they have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago. The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens (dated to 125,000\u201380,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave in Dao County, Hunan. Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 7000 BCE, Damaidi around 6000 BCE, Dadiwan from 5800\u20135400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE. Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system.\n\n\n=== Early dynastic rule ===\n\nAccording to Chinese tradition, the first dynasty was the Xia, which emerged around 2100 BCE. Xia dynasty marked the beginning of China's political system based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, which lasted for a millennia. The dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou, Henan in 1959. It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period. The succeeding Shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records. The Shang ruled the plain of the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century BCE. Their oracle bone script (from c.\u20091500 BCE) represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found, and is a direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters.The Shang was conquered by the Zhou, who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries BCE, though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou, no longer fully obeyed the Zhou king and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year Spring and Autumn period. By the time of the Warring States period of the 5th\u20133rd centuries BCE, there were only seven powerful states left.\n\n\n=== Imperial China ===\n\nThe Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six kingdoms, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy. King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty. He enacted Qin's legalist reforms throughout China, notably the forced standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths (i.e., cart axles' length), and currency. His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Vietnam. The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death, as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion.Following a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at Xianyang was burned, the Han dynasty emerged to rule China between 206 BCE and CE 220, creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the Han Chinese. The Han expanded the empire's territory considerably, with military campaigns reaching Central Asia, Mongolia, South Korea, and Yunnan, and the recovery of Guangdong and northern Vietnam from Nanyue. Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road, replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world. Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism, Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors.\n\nAfter the end of the Han dynasty, a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed, whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the Four Classics of Chinese literature. At its end, Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty. The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally-disabled emperor; the Five Barbarians then invaded and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States. The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei, whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects, largely integrating them into Chinese culture. In the south, the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song. The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581. The Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and imperial examination system, constructed the Grand Canal, and patronized Buddhism. However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern Korea provoked widespread unrest.Under the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties, Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age. The Tang Empire returned control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road, brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa, and made the capital Chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Shi Rebellion in the 8th century. In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and Khitan Liao. The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade.\n\nBetween the 10th and 11th centuries, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang, and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity. However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchen Jin dynasty. In 1127, Emperor Huizong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin\u2013Song Wars. The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China.The 13th century brought the Mongol conquest of China. In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty; the Yuan conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300. A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor. Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.\nIn the early years of the Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations. The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598) and Manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasury.In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.\n\n\n=== Late imperial ===\n\nThe Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. Its conquest of the Ming (1618\u20131683) cost 25 million lives and the economy of China shrank drastically. After the Southern Ming ended, the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire. The centralized autocracy was strengthened to crack down on anti-Qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, the Haijin (\"sea ban\"), and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition, causing social and technological stagnation. In the mid-19th century, the dynasty experienced Western imperialism in the Opium Wars with Britain and France. China was forced to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals, and cede Hong Kong to the British under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, the first of the Unequal Treaties. The First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u201395) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula, as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan.\n\nThe Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the White Lotus Rebellion, the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377) in the northwest. The initial success of the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.\nIn the 19th century, the great Chinese diaspora began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876\u201379, in which between 9 and 13 million people died. The Guangxu Emperor drafted a reform plan in 1898 to establish a modern constitutional monarchy, but these plans were thwarted by the Empress Dowager Cixi. The ill-fated anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion of 1899\u20131901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms, the Xinhai Revolution of 1911\u201312 brought an end to the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China.\n\n\n=== Republic (1912\u20131949) ===\n\nOn 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed provisional president. However, the presidency was later given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic.After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory. In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang, under Chiang Kai-shek, the then Principal of the Republic of China Military Academy, was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political manoeuvrings, known collectively as the Northern Expedition. The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to Nanjing and implemented \"political tutelage\", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's San-min program for transforming China into a modern democratic state. The political division in China made it difficult for Chiang to battle the communist People's Liberation Army (PLA), against whom the Kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the Chinese Civil War. This war continued successfully for the Kuomintang, especially after the PLA retreated in the Long March, until Japanese aggression and the 1936 Xi'an Incident forced Chiang to confront Imperial Japan.\n\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), a theater of World War II, forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the PLA. Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population; in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died. An estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were massacred in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation. During the war, China, along with the UK, the US, and the Soviet Union, were referred to as \"trusteeship of the powerful\" and were recognized as the Allied \"Big Four\" in the Declaration by United Nations. Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four major Allies of World War II, and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war. After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the Pescadores, was returned to Chinese control. China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China.\n\n\n=== People's Republic (1949\u2013present) ===\n\nMajor combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with the Communist Party in control of most of mainland China, and the Kuomintang retreating offshore, reducing its territory to only Taiwan, Hainan, and their surrounding islands. On 21 September 1949, Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong proclaimed the establishment of the People's Republic of China with a speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This was followed by a mass celebration in Tiananmen Square on 1 October, at which the proclamation was made publicly by Mao at the Tiananmen Gate, the date becoming the new country's first National Day. In 1950, the People's Liberation Army captured Hainan from the ROC and incorporated Tibet. However, remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.The regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform, which included the execution of between 1 and 2 million landlords. China developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons. The Chinese population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974. However, the Great Leap Forward, an idealistic massive reform project, resulted in an estimated 15 to 35 million deaths between 1958 and 1961, mostly from starvation. In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution, sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In October 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic in the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.\n\nAfter Mao's death, the Gang of Four was quickly arrested and held responsible for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, and instituted significant economic reforms. The Party loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives, and the communes were gradually disbanded in favor of working contracted to households. This marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open-market environment. China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982. In 1989, the violent suppression of student protests in Tiananmen Square brought sanctions against the Chinese government from various countries.Jiang Zemin, Li Peng and Zhu Rongji led the nation in the 1990s. Under their administration, China's economic performance pulled an estimated 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%. The country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and maintained its high rate of economic growth under Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao's leadership in the 2000s. However, the growth also severely impacted the country's resources and environment, and caused major social displacement. Living standards continued to improve rapidly despite the late-2000s recession, but political control remained tight.\n\nPreparations for a decadal leadership change in 2012 were marked by factional disputes and political scandals. During the 18th National Communist Party Congress in November 2012, Hu Jintao was replaced as General Secretary of the Communist Party by Xi Jinping. Under Xi, the Chinese government began large-scale efforts to reform its economy, which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing growth. The Xi\u2013Li Administration also announced major reforms to the one-child policy and prison system.In December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus, later identified as COVID-19, broke out in Wuhan, Hubei, then spread to other provinces of China, and then worldwide, becoming the COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 2020, more than 6.39 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than 383,000 deaths and then 2.78 million recovered people.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nChina's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 kilometers (9,000 mi) long and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe which has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the Steppe route \u2013 the ancestor of the terrestrial Silk Road(s).\n\n\n=== Landscape and climate ===\n\nThe territory of China lies between latitudes 18\u00b0 and 54\u00b0 N, and longitudes 73\u00b0 and 135\u00b0 E. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. The world's highest point, Mount Everest (8,848 m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border. The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake (\u2212154m) in the Turpan Depression.\n\nChina's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons, which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist. The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex topography.\nA major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts, particularly the Gobi Desert. Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms, prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including Japan and Korea. China's environmental watchdog, SEPA, stated in 2007 that China is losing 4,000 km2 (1,500 sq mi) per year to desertification. Water quality, erosion, and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people.\nChina has a very agriculturally suitable climate and has been the largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, brinjal, grapes, water melon, spinach in the world.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\nChina is one of 17 megadiverse countries, lying in two of the world's major biogeographic realms: the Palearctic and the Indomalayan. By one measure, China has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world, after Brazil and Colombia. The country signed the Rio de Janeiro Convention on Biological Diversity on 11 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 5 January 1993. It later produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, with one revision that was received by the convention on 21 September 2010.China is home to at least 551 species of mammals (the third-highest such number in the world), 1,221 species of birds (eighth), 424 species of reptiles (seventh) and 333 species of amphibians (seventh). Wildlife in China share habitat with and bear acute pressure from the world's largest population of Homo sapiens. At least 840 animal species are threatened, vulnerable or in danger of local extinction in China, due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction, pollution and poaching for food, fur and ingredients for traditional Chinese medicine. Endangered wildlife is protected by law, and as of 2005, the country has over 2,349 nature reserves, covering a total area of 149.95 million hectares, 15 percent of China's total land area. The Baiji was confirmed extinct on 12 December 2006.China has over 32,000 species of vascular plants, and is home to a variety of forest types. Cold coniferous forests predominate in the north of the country, supporting animal species such as moose and Asian black bear, along with over 120 bird species. The understorey of moist conifer forests may contain thickets of bamboo. In higher montane stands of juniper and yew, the bamboo is replaced by rhododendrons. Subtropical forests, which are predominate in central and southern China, support as many as 146,000 species of flora. Tropical and seasonal rainforests, though confined to Yunnan and Hainan Island, contain a quarter of all the animal and plant species found in China. China has over 10,000 recorded species of fungi, and of them, nearly 6,000 are higher fungi.\n\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\n\nIn recent decades, China has suffered from severe environmental deterioration and pollution. While regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, they are poorly enforced, as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid economic development. Urban air pollution is a severe health issue in the country, yet matters have been improving in recent years; the World Bank estimated in 2016 that only 1 of the world's 20 most-polluted cities is located in China, making significant improvements since previous rankings. China is the country with the second highest death toll because of air pollution, after India. There are approximately 1 million deaths caused by exposure to ambient air pollution. China is the world's largest carbon dioxide emitter. The country also has significant water pollution problems: 8.2% of China's rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste in 2019, and were unfit for use. In 2014, the internal freshwater resources per capita of China reduced to 2,062m3, and it was below 500m3 in the North China Plain, while 5,920m3 in the world.\n\nIn China, heavy metals also cause environmental pollution. Heavy metal pollution is an inorganic chemical hazard, which is mainly caused by lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure. The total volume of discharged heavy metals in the waste water, waste gas and solid wastes are around 900,000 tons each year from 2005\u20132011.\n\nHowever, China is the world's leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization, with $52 billion invested in 2011 alone; it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects. By 2015, over 24% of China's energy was derived from renewable sources, while most notably from hydroelectric power: a total installed capacity of 197 GW makes China the largest hydroelectric power producer in the world. China also has the largest power capacity of installed solar photovoltaics system and wind power system in the world. In 2011, the Chinese government announced plans to invest four trillion yuan (US$619 billion) in water infrastructure and desalination projects over a ten-year period, and to complete construction of a flood prevention and anti-drought system by 2020. In 2013, China began a five-year, US$277 billion effort to reduce air pollution, particularly in the north of the country.\n\n\n=== Political geography ===\n\nThe People's Republic of China is the second-largest country in the world by land area after Russia, and is the third largest by total area, after Russia and Canada. China's total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000 km2 (3,700,000 sq mi). Specific area figures range from 9,572,900 km2 (3,696,100 sq mi) according to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, to 9,596,961 km2 (3,705,407 sq mi) according to the UN Demographic Yearbook, and the CIA World Factbook.China has the longest combined land border in the world, measuring 22,117 km (13,743 mi) from the mouth of the Yalu River (Amnok River) to the Gulf of Tonkin. China borders 14 nations, more than any other country except Russia, which also borders 14. China extends across much of East Asia, bordering Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar (Burma) in Southeast Asia; India, Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan, and Pakistan in South Asia; Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia; and Russia, Mongolia, and North Korea in Inner Asia and Northeast Asia. Additionally, China shares maritime boundaries with South Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and the Philippines.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nChina's constitution states that The People's Republic of China \"is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants,\" and that the state organs \"apply the principle of democratic centralism.\" The PRC is one of the world's only socialist states explicitly aiming to build communism. The Chinese government has been variously described as communist and socialist, but also as authoritarian and corporatist, with heavy restrictions in many areas, most notably against free access to the Internet, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, the right to have children, free formation of social organizations and freedom of religion. Its current political, ideological and economic system has been termed by its leaders as a \"consultative democracy\" \"people's democratic dictatorship\", \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" (which is Marxism adapted to Chinese circumstances) and the \"socialist market economy\" respectively. According to Lutgard Lams, \"President Xi is making great attempts to 'Sinicize' Marxist\u2013Leninist Thought 'with Chinese characteristics' in the political sphere.\"\n\n\n=== Communist Party ===\n\nSince 2018, the main body of the Chinese constitution declares that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC).\" The 2018 amendments constitutionalized the de facto one-party state status of China, wherein the General Secretary (party leader) holds ultimate power and authority over state and government and serves as the paramount leader of China. The electoral system is pyramidal. Local People's Congresses are directly elected, and higher levels of People's Congresses up to the National People's Congress (NPC) are indirectly elected by the People's Congress of the level immediately below. The political system is decentralized, and provincial and sub-provincial leaders have a significant amount of autonomy. Another eight political parties, have representatives in the NPC and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). China supports the Leninist principle of \"democratic centralism\", but critics describe the elected National People's Congress as a \"rubber stamp\" body.\n\n\n=== Government ===\n\nThe President is the titular head of state, elected by the National People's Congress. The Premier is the head of government, presiding over the State Council composed of four vice premiers and the heads of ministries and commissions. The incumbent president is Xi Jinping, who is also the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China and the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, making him China's paramount leader. The incumbent premier is Li Keqiang, who is also a senior member of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, China's de facto top decision-making body.There have been some moves toward political liberalization, in that open contested elections are now held at the village and town levels. However, the party retains effective control over government appointments: in the absence of meaningful opposition, the CPC wins by default most of the time. In 2017, Xi called on the communist party to further tighten its grip on the country, to uphold the unity of the party leadership, and achieve the \"Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation\". Political concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption. Nonetheless, the level of public support for the government and its management of the nation is high, with 80\u201395% of Chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government, according to a 2011 survey.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nThe People's Republic of China is divided into 22 provinces, five autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), and four municipalities\u2014collectively referred to as \"mainland China\"\u2014as well as the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau. Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China, Northeast China, East China, South Central China, Southwest China, and Northwest China.\nChina considers Taiwan to be its 23rd province, although Taiwan is governed by the Republic of China (ROC), which rejects the PRC's claim. Conversely, the ROC claims sovereignty over all divisions governed by the PRC.\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nThe PRC has diplomatic relations with 175 countries and maintains embassies in 162. Its legitimacy is disputed by the Republic of China and a few other countries; it is thus the largest and most populous state with limited recognition. In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. China was also a former member and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries. Along with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, China is a member of the BRICS group of emerging major economies and hosted the group's third official summit at Sanya, Hainan in April 2011.Under its interpretation of the One-China policy, Beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to Taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the Republic of China. Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan, especially in the matter of armament sales.\n\nMuch of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is also driven by the concept of \"harmony without uniformity\", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences. This policy may have led China to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by Western nations, such as Zimbabwe, North Korea and Iran. China has a close economic and military relationship with Russia, and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council.\n\n\n==== Trade relations ====\n\nChina became the world's largest trading nation in 2013, as measured by the sum of imports and exports. By 2016, China was the largest trading partner of 124 other countries. In 2019, China's exports of goods and services was $2.5 trillion and imports was $2.1 trillion, thus resulting in $4.6 trillion of foreign trade. In recent decades, China has played an increasing role in calling for free trade areas and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. China became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on 11 December 2001. In 2004, it proposed an entirely new East Asia Summit (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues. The EAS, which includes ASEAN Plus Three, India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005. China is also a founding member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), along with Russia and the Central Asian republics.\nChina has had a long and complex trade relationship with the United States. In 2000, the United States Congress approved \"permanent normal trade relations\" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries. China has a significant trade surplus with the United States, its most important export market. In the early 2010s, US politicians argued that the Chinese yuan was significantly undervalued, giving China an unfair trade advantage.Since the turn of the century, China has followed a policy of engaging with African nations for trade and bilateral co-operation; in 2012, Sino-African trade totalled over US$160 billion. China maintains healthy and highly diversified trade links with the European Union. China has furthermore strengthened its ties with major South American economies, becoming the largest trading partner of Brazil and building strategic links with Argentina.China's Belt and Road Initiative has expanded significantly over the last six years and, as of 2019, includes 137 countries and 30 international organizations.\n\n\n==== Territorial disputes ====\n\nEver since its establishment after the second Chinese Civil War, the PRC has claimed the territories governed by the Republic of China (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory. It regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province. These claims are controversial because of the complicated Cross-Strait relations, with the PRC treating the One-China policy as one of its most important diplomatic principles.\n\nIn addition to Taiwan, China is also involved in other international territorial disputes. Since the 1990s, China has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders, including a disputed border with India and an undefined border with Bhutan. China is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas, such as the Senkaku Islands and the Scarborough Shoal. On 21 May 2014 Xi Jinping, speaking at a conference in Shanghai, pledged to settle China's territorial disputes peacefully. \"China stays committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests\", he said.\n\n\n==== Emerging superpower status ====\nChina is regularly hailed as a potential new superpower, with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress, growing military might, very large population, and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a prominent global role in the 21st century. Others, however, warn that economic bubbles and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt China's growth as the century progresses.\nSome authors also question the definition of \"superpower\", arguing that China's large economy alone would not qualify it as a superpower, and noting that it lacks the military power and cultural influence of the United States. Others \u2013 namely, IRENA \u2013 have argued that China's investment in renewable energy has positioned it to be a likely superpower in that area, especially due to a shift in global trade relations.\n\n\n=== Sociopolitical issues, human rights and reform ===\n\nThe Chinese democracy movement, social activists, and some members of the Communist Party of China believe in the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, political freedom is still tightly restricted. The Constitution of the People's Republic of China states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state. Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling Communist Party are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information, most notably on the Internet, are routinely used to prevent collective action. By 2020, China plans to give all its citizens a personal \"Social Credit\" score based on how they behave. The Social Credit System, now being piloted in a number of Chinese cities, is considered a form of mass surveillance which uses big data analysis technology. In 2005, Reporters Without Borders ranked China 159th out of 167 states in its Annual World Press Freedom Index, which indicates a very low level of press freedom. In 2014, China ranked 175th out of 180 countries.Rural migrants to China's cities often find themselves treated as second class citizens by the hukou household registration system, which controls access to state benefits. Property rights are often poorly protected, However, a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s, and additional social services provided to rural dwellers.A number of foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and NGOs have criticized China's human rights record, alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial, forced abortions, forced confessions, torture, restrictions of fundamental rights, and excessive use of the death penalty. The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to \"social stability\", as was the case with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989.\n\nFalun Gong was first taught publicly in 1992. In 1999, when there were about 70 million practitioners, the persecution of Falun Gong began, resulting in mass arrests, extralegal detention, and alleged reports of torture and deaths in custody. The Chinese state is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang, including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression. At least one million members of China's Muslim Uyghur minority have been detained in mass detention camps, termed \"Vocational Education and Training Centers\", aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs. The camps were established under General Secretary Xi Jinping's administration. In January 2019 the United Nations asked for direct access to the detention camps after a panel said it had received \"credible reports\" that 1.1 million Uygur, Kazakhs, Hui and other ethnic minorities had been detained in these camps. The state has also sought to control offshore reporting of tensions in Xinjiang, intimidating foreign-based reporters by detaining their family members.The Chinese government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights, and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country's present level of economic development. It emphasizes the rise in the Chinese standard of living, literacy rate, and average life expectancy since the 1970s, as well as improvements in workplace safety and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial Yangtze River floods. Furthermore, some Chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratization, although others remain more conservative. Some major reform efforts have been conducted. For instance, in November 2013 the government announced plans to relax the one-child policy and abolish the much-criticized re-education through labour program, although human rights groups note that reforms to the latter have been largely cosmetic. During the 2000s and early 2010s, the Chinese government was increasingly tolerant of NGOs that offer practical, efficient solutions to social problems, but such \"third sector\" activity remained heavily regulated. After Xi Jinping succeeded General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012, human rights in China have become worse.\n \nThe Global Slavery Index estimated that in 2016 more than 3.8 million people were living in \"conditions of modern slavery\", or 0.25% of the population, including victims of human trafficking, forced labor, forced marriage, child labor, and state-imposed forced labor. All except the last category are illegal. The state-imposed forced system was formally abolished in 2013 but it is not clear the extent to which its various practices have stopped. The Chinese penal system includes labor prison factories, detention centers, and re-education camps, which fall under the heading Laogai (\"reform through labor\"). The Laogai Research Foundation in the United States estimated that there were over a thousand slave labour prisons and camps, known collectively as the Laogai. Prisoners are not paid at all, and need their families to send money to them. Prisoners who refuse to work are beaten, and some are beaten to death. Many of the prisoners are political or religious dissidents, and some are recognized internationally as prisoners of conscience. A Chinese leader said that they want to see two products coming out of the prisons: the man who has been reformed, and the product made by the man. Harry Wu, himself a former prisoner of the Laogai, filmed undercover footage of the Laogai, and was charged with stealing state secrets. For this, Harry Wu was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but only served 66 days before being deported to the United States.In 2019 a world-first study called for the mass retraction of more than 400 scientific papers on organ transplantation, because of fears the organs were obtained unethically from Chinese prisoners. The study was published in the medical journal BMJ Open. A report published in 2016 found a large discrepancy between official transplant figures from the Chinese government and the number of transplants reported by hospitals. While the government says 10,000 transplants occur each year, hospital data shows between 60,000 and 100,000 organs are transplanted each year. The report provided evidence that this gap is being made up by executed prisoners of conscience.\n\n\n== Military ==\n\nWith 2.3 million active troops, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is the largest standing military force in the world, commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC). China has the second-biggest military reserve force, only behind North Korea. The PLA consists of the Ground Force (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF), and the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF). According to the Chinese government, China's military budget for 2017 totalled US$151.5 billion, constituting the world's second-largest military budget, although the military expenditures-GDP ratio with 1.3% of GDP is below world average. However, many authorities \u2013 including SIPRI and the U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense \u2013 argue that China does not report its real level of military spending, which is allegedly much higher than the official budget.\n\nAs a recognized nuclear weapons state, China is considered both a major regional military power and a potential military superpower. According to a 2013 report by the US Department of Defense, China fields between 50 and 75 nuclear ICBMs, along with a number of SRBMs. However, compared with the other four UN Security Council Permanent Members, China has relatively limited power projection capabilities. To offset this, it has developed numerous power projection assets since the early 2000s \u2013 its first aircraft carrier entered service in 2012, and it maintains a substantial fleet of submarines, including several nuclear-powered attack and ballistic missile submarines. China has furthermore established a network of foreign military relationships along critical sea lanes.\n\nChina has made significant progress in modernising its air force in recent decades, purchasing Russian fighter jets such as the Sukhoi Su-30, and also manufacturing its own modern fighters, most notably the Chengdu J-10, J-20 and the Shenyang J-11, J-15, J-16, and J-31. China is furthermore engaged in developing an indigenous stealth aircraft and numerous combat drones. Air and Sea denial weaponry advances have increased the regional threat from the perspective of Japan as well as Washington. China has also updated its ground forces, replacing its ageing Soviet-derived tank inventory with numerous variants of the modern Type 99 tank, and upgrading its battlefield C3I and C4I systems to enhance its network-centric warfare capabilities. In addition, China has developed or acquired numerous advanced missile systems, including anti-satellite missiles, cruise missiles and submarine-launched nuclear ICBMs. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute's data, China became the world's third largest exporter of major arms in 2010\u201314, an increase of 143 percent from the period 2005\u201309. SIPRI also calculated that China surpassed Russia to become the world's second largest arms exporter by 2020. Chinese officials stated that spending on the military will rise to U.S. $173B in 2018. In the period of 2014\u20132018, China was the fifth largest exporter of major arms in the world, with an increase of 2.7% compared to the previous period.\nIn August 2018, China tested its first hypersonic flight. The China Academy of Aerospace Aerodynamics (CAAA) claims to have successfully conducted the test with the aircraft Starry Sky-2 that touched a speed of Mach 6 \u2013 which is six times the speed of sound, that can carry nuclear missiles.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSince 2010, China had the world's second-largest economy in terms of nominal GDP, totaling approximately US$13.5 trillion (90 trillion Yuan) as of 2018. In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP GDP), China's economy has been the largest in the world since 2014, according to the World Bank. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $13.6 trillion by 2018. China's economic growth has been consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978. China is also the world's largest exporter and second-largest importer of goods. Between 2010 and 2019, China's contribution to global GDP growth has been 25% to 39%.China had the largest economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline. Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has developed into a highly diversified economy and one of the most consequential players in international trade. Major sectors of competitive strength include manufacturing, retail, mining, steel, textiles, automobiles, energy generation, green energy, banking, electronics, telecommunications, real estate, e-commerce, and tourism. China has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world\u2014Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen\u2014that together have a market capitalization of over $10 trillion, as of 2019.China has been the world's No. 1 manufacturer since 2010, after overtaking the US, which had been No. 1 for the previous hundred years. China has also been No. 2 in high-tech manufacturing since 2012, according to US National Science Foundation. China is the second largest retail market in the world, next to the United States. China leads the world in e-commerce, accounting for 40% of the global market share in 2016 and more than 50% of the global market share in 2019. China is the world's leader in electric vehicles, manufacturing and buying half of all the plug-in electric cars (BEV and PHEV) in the world in 2018. China had 174 GW of installed solar capacity by the end of 2018, which amounts to more than 40% of the global solar capacity.\n\nAs of 2018, China was first in the world in total number of billionaires and second in millionaires\u2014there were 658 Chinese billionaires and 3.5 million millionaires. However, it ranks behind over 70 countries (out of around 180) in per capita economic output, making it a middle income country. Additionally, its development is highly uneven. Its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions. China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history\u2014between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million. China reduced the extreme poverty rate\u2014per international standard, it refers to an income of less than $1.90/day\u2014from 88% in 1981 to 1.85% by 2013. According to the World Bank, the number of Chinese in extreme poverty fell from 756 million to 25 million between 1990 and 2013. China's own national poverty standards are higher and thus the national poverty rates were 3.1% in 2017 and 1% in 2018.In 2019, China overtook the US as the home to the highest number of rich people in the world, according to the global wealth report by Credit Suisse. In other words, as of 2019, 100 million Chinese are in the top 10% of the wealthiest individuals in the world\u2014those who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000.\n\n\n=== Economic history and growth ===\n\nFrom its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally planned economy. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the Cultural Revolution, Deng Xiaoping and the new Chinese leadership began to reform the economy and move towards a more market-oriented mixed economy under one-party rule. Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs). Inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses. Modern-day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership, and is one of the leading examples of state capitalism. The state still dominates in strategic \"pillar\" sectors such as energy production and heavy industries, but private enterprise has expanded enormously, with around 30 million private businesses recorded in 2008. In 2018, private enterprises in China accounted for 60% of GDP, 80% of urban employment and 90% of new jobs.In 2015, China's Middle Class became the largest in the world. By 2019, there were more Chinese than Americans in the richest 10% of the people in the world. Since economic liberalization began in 1978, China has been among the world's fastest-growing economies, relying originally on investment- and export-led growth, but now shifting more to consumption. In 2018, 76% of growth in China's GDP came from consumption. According to the IMF, China's annual average GDP growth between 2001 and 2010 was 10.5%. In the years immediately following the financial crisis of 2007, China's economic growth rate was equivalent to all of the G7 countries' growth combined. According to the Global Growth Generators index announced by Citigroup in February 2011, China has a very high 3G growth rating. Its high productivity, low labor costs and relatively good infrastructure have made it a global leader in manufacturing.\nChina ranks No. 1 in the production of steel, aluminum and automobiles\u2014China's global market shares are 50% in steel, 50% in aluminum and 30% in automobile manufacturing. China has also been increasingly turning to automation, becoming the world's largest market for industrial robots in 2013. Between 2010 and 2015, China installed 90,000 industrial robots, or one-third of the world's total. In 2017, China bought 36% of all the new industrial robots in the world. China's plan is to also domestically design and manufacture 100,000 industrial robots by 2020. However, the Chinese economy is highly energy-intensive and inefficient; China became the world's largest energy consumer in 2010, relies on coal to supply over 70% of its energy needs, and surpassed the US to become the world's largest oil importer in 2013.In the last decade, China has become #1 in the world in terms of installed solar power capacity, hydro-power and wind power. According to the World Economic Forum, China will account for 40% of the global renewable energy by 2022. In addition, official GDP figures are seen as unreliable and there have been several well-publicized cases of data manipulation. In the early 2010s, China's economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles, weakening international demand for Chinese exports and fragility in the global economy. China's GDP was smaller than Germany's in 2007; however, by 2017, China's $12.2 trillion-economy became larger than those of Germany, UK, France and Italy combined. In 2018, the IMF reiterated its forecast that China will overtake the US in terms of nominal GDP by the year 2030. Economists also expect China's middle class to expand to 600 million people by 2025.Tourism is a major contributor to the economy. In 2017, this sector contributed about CNY 8.77 trillion (US$1.35 trillion), 11.04% of the GDP, and contributed direct and indirect employment of up to 28.25 million people. There were 139.48 million inbound trips and five billion domestic trips. China is now No. 1 in the number of skyscrapers (buildings taller than 200m), accounting for about 50% of world's total. In four years\u20142015 through 2018\u2014China built 310 skyscrapers, while the corresponding number for the US was 33.\n\n\n==== Technology, e-commerce, and innovation ====\nChina is one of the world's most technologically advanced nations. It is the world's largest e-commerce market, amounting to 42% of the global market by 2016 and is expected to account for 55% of global e-commerce retail sales in 2019 (more than three times as large as the US market). China's e-commerce market had online sales of more than $1 trillion in 2018, according to PWC and is expected to be just under $2 trillion in 2019. China's e-commerce industry took off in 2009, marked by the growth of internet giants Tencent and Alibaba \u2013 purveyors of products such as WeChat and Tmall \u2013 that have become ubiquitous in contemporary Chinese life. Tencent's WeChat Pay and Alibaba's Ali Pay have helped China become a world leader in mobile payments, which amounted to about $30 trillion in China in 2017 and more than $40 trillion in 2018.China is also second only to the United States in venture capital activity and is home to a large number of unicorn startup companies. In 2018, China attracted $105 billion of venture capital investments, amounting to 38% of global VC investments that year. In late 2018, the world's most valuable startup was ByteDance, a Chinese company; and the two most valuable artificial intelligence (AI) startups in the world were SenseTime and Face++, both from China. In 2017, China's State Council released its Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which declared AI technology a priority economic growth and investment sector. In 2018, China created 97 \"unicorns\" \u2013 startups that are worth more than $1 billion \u2013 which amounted to 1 unicorn every 3.8 days. Chinese smartphone brands \u2013 Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, OnePlus etc. \u2013 have captured more than 40% of the global market. By 2019, Huawei had become the world's largest telecom infrastructure provider, surpassing Nokia and Ericsson, and had taken the lead in 5G technology. The company also entered the consumer smartphone and enterprise services markets, and is the world's third-largest smartphone company, after Apple and Samsung.Other Chinese tech giants include DJI (world's largest drone maker with 70% market share), BOE (world's largest flat-panel display maker), Didi (world's largest and most valuable ride-sharing company) and BYD (world's largest plug-in vehicle maker\u2014including both BEV and PHEV) China also the most number of supercomputers\u2014227 out of the Top 500 (as of 2019).China is also the world leader in patents, accounting for 1.54 million patents or almost half of all global patents in 2018. China's spending on R&D has been growing rapidly in the last decade, amounting to $277 billion in 2017.\n\n\n=== China in the global economy ===\nChina is a member of the WTO and is the world's largest trading power, with a total international trade value of US$4.62 trillion in 2018. Its foreign exchange reserves reached US$3.1 trillion as of 2019, making its reserves by far the world's largest. In 2012, China was the world's largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), attracting $253 billion. In 2014, China's foreign exchange remittances were $US64 billion making it the second largest recipient of remittances in the world. China also invests abroad, with a total outward FDI of $62.4 billion in 2012, and a number of major takeovers of foreign firms by Chinese companies. China is a major owner of US public debt, holding trillions of dollars worth of U.S. Treasury bonds. China's undervalued exchange rate has caused friction with other major economies, and it has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit goods.\n\nChina ranks 17th in the world in Global Innovation Index, not too far from the US, which ranks 6th. China ranks 27th out of 137 countries in the 2017\u20132018 Global Competitiveness Index, above many advanced economies and making it by far the most competitive major emerging economy. This is largely owing to its strength in infrastructure and wide adoption of communication and information technology. However, it lags behind advanced economies in labor market efficiency, institutional strength, and openness of market competition, especially for foreign players attempting to enter the domestic market. In 2018, Fortune's Global 500 list of the world's largest corporations included 120 Chinese companies. Many of the largest public companies in the world were Chinese, including the world's largest bank by total assets, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.Following the 2007\u201308 financial crisis, Chinese authorities sought to actively wean off of its dependence on the U.S. Dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system. To achieve those ends, China took a series of actions to further the internationalization of the Renminbi. In 2008, China established dim sum bond market and expanded the Cross-Border Trade RMB Settlement Pilot Project, which helps establish pools of offshore RMB liquidity. This was followed with bilateral agreements to settle trades directly in renminbi with Russia, Japan, Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Canada. As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the eighth-most-traded currency in the world, an emerging international reserve currency, and a component of the IMF's special drawing rights; however, partly due to capital controls that make the renminbi fall short of being a fully convertible currency, it remains far behind the Euro, Dollar and Japanese Yen in international trade volumes.\n\n\n=== Class and income inequality ===\n\nChina has had the world's largest middle class population since 2015, and the middle class grew to a size of 400 million by 2018. China's middle-class population (if defined as those with annual income of between US$10,000 and US$60,000) had reached more than 300 million by 2012. Wages in China have grown exponentially in the last 40 years\u2014real (inflation-adjusted) wages grew seven-fold from 1978 to 2007. By 2018, median wages in Chinese cities such as Shanghai were about the same as or higher than the wages in Eastern European countries. More than 75 percent of China's urban consumers are expected to earn between 60,000 and 229,000 RMB per year by 2022. China has the world's second-highest number of billionaires, with nearly 400 as of 2018, increasing at the rate of roughly two per week. China's domestic retail market was worth over 20 trillion yuan (US$3.2 trillion) in 2012 and is growing at over 12% annually as of 2013, while the country's luxury goods market has expanded immensely, with 27.5% of the global share. However, in recent years, China's rapid economic growth has contributed to severe consumer inflation, leading to increased government regulation. China has a high level of economic inequality, which has increased in the past few decades. In 2012, China's official Gini coefficient was 0.474. A study conducted by Southwestern University of Finance and Economics showed that China's Gini coefficient actually had reached 0.61 in 2012, and top 1% Chinese held more than 25% of China's wealth. By 2018, China's GINI index had risen to 0.467, according to the World Bank.\n\n\n== Science and technology ==\n\n\n=== Historical ===\n\nChina was once a world leader in science and technology up until the Ming dynasty. Ancient Chinese discoveries and inventions, such as papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder (the Four Great Inventions), became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later to Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers. By the 17th century, Europe and the Western world surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement. The causes of this early modern Great Divergence continue to be debated by scholars to this day.After repeated military defeats by the European colonial powers and Japan in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Self-Strengthening Movement. After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the Soviet Union, in which scientific research was part of central planning. After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology was established as one of the Four Modernizations, and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nSince the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research and is quickly catching up with the US in R&D spending. In 2017, China spent $279 billion on scientific research and development. According to OECD, China spent 2.11% of its GDP on Research and Development (R&D) in 2016. Science and technology are seen as vital for achieving China's economic and political goals, and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as \"techno-nationalism\". Nonetheless, China's investment in basic and applied scientific research remains behind that of leading technological powers such as the United States and Japan. According to the US National Science Board, China had, for the first time, more science and engineering publications than the US, in 2016. Also, in 2016, China spent $409 billion (by PPP) on Research and Development. In 2018, China is estimated to have spent $475 billion (by PPP), second only to the USA. In 2017, China was No. 2 in international patents application, behind the US but ahead of Japan. Chinese tech companies Huawei and ZTE were the top 2 filers of international patents in 2017. Chinese-born scientists have won the Nobel Prize in Physics four times, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and Physiology or Medicine once respectively, though most of these scientists conducted their Nobel-winning research in western nations.\n\nChina is developing its education system with an emphasis on science, mathematics and engineering; in 2009, China graduated over 10,000 PhD engineers, and as many as 500,000 BSc graduates, more than any other country. In 2016, there were 4.7 million STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates in China, which was more than eight times the corresponding number for the US. China also became the world's largest publisher of scientific papers, by 2016. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei and Lenovo have become world leaders in telecommunications and personal computing, and Chinese supercomputers are consistently ranked among the world's most powerful. China is also expanding its use of industrial robots; from 2008 to 2011, the installation of multi-role robots in Chinese factories rose by 136 percent. China has been the world's largest market for industrial robots since 2013 and will account for 45% of newly installed robots from 2019\u20132021.The Chinese space program is one of the world's most active, and is a major source of national pride. In 2018, China successfully launched more satellites (35) than any other country, including the USA (30). In 1970, China launched its first satellite, Dong Fang Hong I, becoming the fifth country to do so independently. In 2003, China became the third country to independently send humans into space, with Yang Liwei's spaceflight aboard Shenzhou 5; as of 2015, ten Chinese nationals have journeyed into space, including two women. In 2011, China's first space station module, Tiangong-1, was launched, marking the first step in a project to assemble a large manned station by the early 2020s. In 2013, China successfully landed the Chang'e 3 lander and Yutu rover onto the lunar surface. In 2016, China's 2nd space station module, Tiangong-2, was launched from Jiuquan aboard a Long March 2F rocket on 15 September 2016. Then Shenzhou 11 successfully docked with Tiangong-2 on 19 October 2016. In 2019, China became the first country to land a probe\u2014Chang'e 4\u2014on the far side of the moon.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\nA 2016 report by McKinsey consulting group, revealed that China has been annually spending more on infrastructure than North America and Western Europe combined.\n\n\n=== Telecommunications ===\n\nChina is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country in the world, with over 1.5 billion subscribers, as of 2018. It also has the world's largest number of internet and broadband users, with over 800 million Internet users as of 2018\u2014equivalent to around 60% of its population\u2014and almost all of them being mobile as well. Almost entire China's population had access to 4G network by 2017. By 2018, China had more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of world's total. In terms of unique mobile subscribers as percentage of population, China came in at 82%, placing the country No. 3 in the world (as of 2018). As of early 2019, the average mobile connection speed in China was 30 Mbit/s (megabits per second), which is 9% slower than the US. As for fixed broadband in China, the average download speed was 76 Mbit/s; and 60% of fixed broadband Chinese users (or 200 million Chinese households) were able to access the Internet at 100 Mbit/s or higher (as of 2018). China is making rapid progress in 1 Gbit/s (1000 Mbit/s) internet, and 42% of Chinese homes are expected to have 1 Gbit/s broadband link by 2023. In 2018, China had 378 million fixed broadband users and 87% of them were fiber-optic users, making China No. 1 in the world in deployment of fiber-optic cables for broadband. By the end of 2017, China had 29 million kilometers of fiber-optic cable. In 2019, China is expected to account for 24% of the world's spending on IoT or internet-connected devices. Since 2011 China has been the nation with the most installed telecommunication bandwidth in the world. By 2014, China hosted more than twice as much national bandwidth potential than the U.S., the historical leader in terms of installed telecommunication bandwidth (China: 29% versus US:13% of the global total). China is making rapid advances in 5G\u2014by late 2018, China had started large-scale and commercial 5G trials. In early 2019, Shanghai railway station introduced 5G WiFi that has an internet speed of 1,200 Mbit/s.China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, are the three large providers of mobile and internet in China. China Telecom alone served more than 145 million broadband subscribers and 300 million mobile users; China Unicom had about 300 million subscribers; and China Mobile, the biggest of them all, had 925 million users, as of 2018. Combined, the three operators had over 3.4 million 4G base-stations in China. Several Chinese telecommunications companies, most notably Huawei and ZTE, have been accused of spying for the Chinese military. British intelligence\u2014GCHQ and NCSC\u2014said in 2019 that there have been no evidence of malicious activity or spying by Huawei.China is developing its own satellite navigation system, dubbed Beidou, which began offering commercial navigation services across Asia in 2012 and it started providing global services by the end of 2018. Now China belongs to the elite group of three countries\u2014US and Russia being the other two members\u2014that provide global satellite navigation.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\n\nSince the late 1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of national highways and expressways. In 2018, China's highways had reached a total length of 142,500 km (88,500 mi), making it the longest highway system in the world; and China's railways reached a total length of 127,000 km by 2017. By the end of 2018, China's high-speed railway network reached a length of 29,000 km, representing more than 60% of the world's total. In 1991, there were only six bridges across the main stretch of the Yangtze River, which bisects the country into northern and southern halves. By October 2014, there were 81 such bridges and tunnels.\nChina has the world's largest market for automobiles, having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and production. Sales of passenger cars in 2016 exceeded 24 million. A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents, with poorly enforced traffic laws cited as a possible cause\u2014in 2011 alone, around 62,000 Chinese died in road accidents. However, the Chinese government has taken a lot of steps to address this problem and has reduced the number of fatalities in traffic accidents by 20% from 2007 to 2017. In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles \u2013 as of 2012, there are approximately 470 million bicycles in China.\n\nChina's railways, which are state-owned, are among the busiest in the world, handling a quarter of the world's rail traffic volume on only 6 percent of the world's tracks in 2006. as of 2017, the country had 127,000 km (78,914 mi) of railways, the second longest network in the world. The railways strain to meet enormous demand particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday, when the world's largest annual human migration takes place. In 2013, Chinese railways delivered 2.106 billion passenger trips, generating 1,059.56 billion passenger-kilometers and carried 3.967 billion tons of freight, generating 2,917.4 billion cargo tons-kilometers.China's high-speed rail (HSR) system started construction in the early 2000s. By the end of 2019, high speed rail in China had over 35,000 kilometers (21,748 miles) of dedicated lines alone, a length that exceeds rest of the world's high-speed rail tracks combined twice, making it the longest HSR network in the world. With an annual ridership of over 1.1 billion passengers in 2015 it is the world's busiest. The network includes the Beijing\u2013Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen High-Speed Railway, the single longest HSR line in the world, and the Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway, which has three of longest railroad bridges in the world. The HSR track network is set to reach approximately 30,000 km (19,000 mi) by the end of 2019. The Shanghai Maglev Train, which reaches 431 km/h (268 mph), is the fastest commercial train service in the world. In May 2019, China released a prototype for a maglev high-speed train that would reach a speed of 600 km/hr (375 mph); and it is expected to go into commercial production by 2021.\n\nSince 2000, the growth of rapid transit systems in Chinese cities has accelerated. As of January 2016, 26 Chinese cities have urban mass transit systems in operation and 39 more have metro systems approved with a dozen more to join them by 2020. The Shanghai Metro, Beijing Subway, Guangzhou Metro, Hong Kong MTR and Shenzhen Metro are among the longest and busiest in the world.\n\nThere were approximately 229 airports in 2017, with around 240 planned by 2020. More than two-thirds of the airports under construction worldwide in 2013 were in China, and Boeing expects that China's fleet of active commercial aircraft in China will grow from 1,910 in 2011 to 5,980 in 2031. In just five years\u2014from 2013 to 2018\u2014China bought 1000 planes from Boeing. With rapid expansion in civil aviation, the largest airports in China have also joined the ranks of the busiest in the world. In 2018, Beijing's Capital Airport ranked second in the world by passenger traffic (it was 26th in 2002). Since 2010, the Hong Kong International Airport and Shanghai Pudong International Airport have ranked first and third in air cargo tonnage.\nSome 80% of China's airspace remains restricted for military use, and Chinese airlines made up eight of the 10 worst-performing Asian airlines in terms of delays.\nChina has over 2,000 river and seaports, about 130 of which are open to foreign shipping. In 2017, the Ports of Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Ningbo-Zhoushan, Guangzhou, Qingdao and Tianjin ranked in the Top 10 in the world in container traffic and cargo tonnage.\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nWater supply and sanitation infrastructure in China is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization, as well as water scarcity, contamination, and pollution. According to data presented by the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation of WHO and UNICEF in 2015, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to improved sanitation. In June 2010, there were 1,519 sewage treatment plants in China and 18 plants were added each week. The ongoing South\u2013North Water Transfer Project intends to abate water shortage in the north.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe national census of 2010 recorded the population of the People's Republic of China as approximately 1,370,536,875. About 16.60% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 70.14% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 13.26% were over 60 years old. The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%. China used to make up much of the world's poor; now it makes up much of the world's middle class. Although a middle-income country by Western standards, China's rapid growth has pulled hundreds of millions\u2014800 million, to be more precise\u2014of its people out of poverty since 1978. By 2013, less than 2% of the Chinese population lived below the international poverty line of US$1.9 per day, down from 88% in 1981. China's own standards for poverty are higher and still the country is on its way to eradicate national poverty completely by 2019. From 2009\u20132018, the unemployment rate in China has averaged about 4%.Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid 1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a \"1.5\"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits). The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child. In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a two-child policy. Data from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may be around 1.4, although due to underreporting of births it may be closer to 1.5\u20131.6.According to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on population growth or the size of the total population. However, these scholars have been challenged. Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions, with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction.The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth. According to the 2010 census, the sex ratio at birth was 118.06 boys for every 100 girls, which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls. The 2010 census found that males accounted for 51.27 percent of the total population. However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.82 percent of the total population.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nChina legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who altogether comprise the Zhonghua Minzu. The largest of these nationalities are the ethnic Chinese or \"Han\", who constitute more than 80% of the total\npopulation. The Han Chinese \u2013 the world's largest single ethnic group \u2013 outnumber other ethnic groups in every provincial-level division except Tibet and Xinjiang. Ethnic minorities account for about less than 25% of the population of China, according to\nthe 2010 census. Compared with the 2000 population census, the Han population increased by 66,537,177 persons, or 5.74%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 7,362,627 persons, or 6.92%. The 2010 census recorded a total of 593,832 foreign nationals living in China. The largest such groups were from South Korea (120,750), the\nUnited States (71,493) and Japan (66,159).\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThere are as many as 292 living languages in China. The languages most commonly spoken belong to the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family, which contains Mandarin (spoken by 70% of the population), and other varieties of Chinese language: Yue (including Cantonese and Taishanese), Wu (including Shanghainese and Suzhounese), Min (including Fuzhounese, Hokkien and Teochew), Xiang, Gan and Hakka. Languages of the Tibeto-Burman branch, including Tibetan, Qiang, Naxi and Yi, are spoken across the Tibetan and Yunnan\u2013Guizhou Plateau. Other ethnic minority languages in southwest China include Zhuang, Thai, Dong and Sui of the Tai-Kadai family, Miao and Yao of the Hmong\u2013Mien family, and Wa of the Austroasiatic family. Across northeastern and northwestern China, local ethnic groups speak Altaic languages including Manchu, Mongolian and several Turkic languages: Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Salar and Western Yugur. Korean is spoken natively along the border with North Korea. Sarikoli, the language of Tajiks in western Xinjiang, is an Indo-European language. Taiwanese aborigines, including a small population on the mainland, speak Austronesian languages.Standard Mandarin, a variety of Mandarin based on the Beijing dialect, is the official national language of China and is used as a lingua franca in the country between people of different linguistic backgrounds. Mongolian, Uyghur, Tibetan, Zhuang and various other languages are also regionally recognized throughout the country.Chinese characters have been used as the written script for the Sinitic languages for thousands of years. They allow speakers of mutually unintelligible Chinese varieties to communicate with each other through writing. In 1956, the government introduced simplified characters, which have supplanted the older traditional characters in mainland China. Chinese characters are romanized using the Pinyin system. Tibetan uses an alphabet based on an Indic script. Uyghur is most commonly written in Persian alphabet based Uyghur Arabic alphabet. The Mongolian script used in China and the Manchu script are both derived from the Old Uyghur alphabet. Zhuang uses both an official Latin alphabet script and a traditional Chinese character script.\n\n\n=== Urbanization ===\n\nChina has urbanized significantly in recent decades. The percent of the country's population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1980 to over 55% in 2016. It is estimated that China's urban population will reach one billion by 2030, potentially equivalent to one-eighth of the world population. As of 2012, there are more than 262 million migrant workers in China, mostly rural migrants seeking work in cities.China has over 160 cities with a population of over one million, including the seven megacities (cities with a population of over 10 million) of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Shenzhen, and Wuhan. Shanghai is China's most populous urban area while Chongqing is its largest city proper. By 2025, it is estimated that the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants. The figures in the table below are from the 2010 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large \"floating populations\" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult; the figures below include only long-term residents.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nSince 1986, compulsory education in China comprises primary and junior secondary school, which together last for nine years. In 2010, about 82.5 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior secondary school. The Gaokao, China's national university entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions. In 2010, 27 percent of secondary school graduates are enrolled in higher education. This number increased significantly over the last years, reaching a tertiary school enrollment of 50 percent in 2018. Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level.In February 2006, the government pledged to provide completely free nine-year education, including textbooks and fees. Annual education investment went from less than US$50 billion in 2003 to more than US$250 billion in 2011. However, there remains an inequality in education spending. In 2010, the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing totalled \u00a520,023, while in Guizhou, one of the poorest provinces in China, only totalled \u00a53,204. Free compulsory education in China consists of primary school and junior secondary school between the ages of 6 and 15. In 2011, around 81.4% of Chinese have received secondary education. By 2007, there were 396,567 primary schools, 94,116 secondary schools, and 2,236 higher education institutions in China.As of 2018, 96% of the population over age 15 are literate. In 1949, only 20% of the population could read, compared to 65.5% thirty years later. In 2009, Chinese students from Shanghai achieved the world's best results in mathematics, science and literacy, as tested by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance. Despite the high results, Chinese education has also faced both native and international criticism for its emphasis on rote memorization and its gap in quality from rural to urban areas.There is an increasing number of top-ranked international universities seeking influence in China in recent years. Washington University in St. Louis established an EMBA program with Fudan University in 2002 which has since been constantly ranked as one of the best in the world. Columbia Global Centers Beijing opened in 2009, and Harvard Institute Shanghai opened in 2010. Two years later, Stanford University established an academic center in Peking University. The year after, in 2013, Duke Kunshan University was put into operation. Subsequently, the Yale Center Beijing, and NYU Shanghai were both established in 2014.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nThe National Health and Family Planning Commission, together with its counterparts in the local commissions, oversees the health needs of the Chinese population. An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. At that time, the Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and scarlet fever, which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign. After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the People's Communes. Healthcare in China became mostly privatized, and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a 3-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion. By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage. In 2011, China was estimated to be the world's third-largest supplier of pharmaceuticals, but its population has suffered from the development and distribution of counterfeit medications.As of 2017, the average life expectancy at birth in China is 76 years, and the infant mortality rate is 7 per thousand. Both have improved significantly since the 1950s. Rates of stunting, a condition caused by malnutrition, have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010. Despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities, China has several emerging public health problems, such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution, hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers, and an increase in obesity among urban youths. China's large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years, such as the 2003 outbreak of SARS, although this has since been largely contained. In 2010, air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in China.The COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019. The Chinese government has been criticized for its handling of the epidemic and accused of concealing the extent of the outbreak before it became an international pandemic.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe government of the People's Republic of China officially espouses state atheism, and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end. Religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the State Administration for Religious Affairs. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by China's constitution, although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution.Over the millennia, Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements. The \"three teachings\", including Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism (Chinese Buddhism), historically have a significant role in shaping Chinese culture, enriching a theological and spiritual framework which harkens back to the early Shang and Zhou dynasty. Chinese popular or folk religion, which is framed by the three teachings and other traditions, consists in allegiance to the shen (\u795e), a character that signifies the \"energies of generation\", who can be deities of the environment or ancestral principles of human groups, concepts of civility, culture heroes, many of whom feature in Chinese mythology and history. Among the most popular cults are those of Mazu (goddess of the seas), Huangdi (one of the two divine patriarchs of the Chinese race), Guandi (god of war and business), Caishen (god of prosperity and richness), Pangu and many others. China is home to many of the world's tallest religious statues, including the tallest of all, the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan.\nClear data on religious affiliation in China is difficult to gather due to varying definitions of \"religion\" and the unorganized, diffusive nature of Chinese religious traditions. Scholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between three teachings religions and local folk religious practice. A 2015 poll conducted by Gallup International found that 61% of Chinese people self-identified as \"convinced atheist\", though it is worthwhile to note that Chinese religions or some of their strands are definable as non-theistic and humanistic religions, since they do not believe that divine creativity is completely transcendent, but it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being. According to a 2014 study, approximately 74% are either non-religious or practise Chinese folk belief, 16% are Buddhists, 2% are Christians, 1% are Muslims, and 8% adhere to other religions including Taoists and folk salvationism. In addition to Han people's local religious practices, there are also various ethnic minority groups in China who maintain their traditional autochthone religions. The various folk religions today comprise 2\u20133% of the population, while Confucianism as a religious self-identification is common within the intellectual class. Significant faiths specifically connected to certain ethnic groups include Tibetan Buddhism and the Islamic religion of the Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz and other peoples in Northwest China.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nSince ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism. For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations, which have their origins in the Han dynasty. The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective. Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today.\n\nThe first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the May Fourth Movement and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, sexism, and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as \"regressive and harmful\" or \"vestiges of feudalism\". Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts like Peking opera, were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time. Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted.Today, the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival, and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide. China is now the third-most-visited country in the world, with 55.7 million inbound international visitors in 2010. It also experiences an enormous volume of domestic tourism; an estimated 740 million Chinese holidaymakers travelled within the country in October 2012.\n\n\n=== Literature ===\n\nChinese literature is based on the literature of the Zhou dynasty. Concepts covered within the Chinese classic texts present a wide range of thoughts and subjects including calendar, military, astrology, herbology, geography and many others. Some of the most important early texts include the I Ching and the Shujing within the Four Books and Five Classics which served as the Confucian authoritative books for the state-sponsored curriculum in dynastic era. Inherited from the Classic of Poetry, classical Chinese poetry developed to its floruit during the Tang dynasty. Li Bai and Du Fu opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively. Chinese historiography began with the Shiji, the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty-Four Histories, which set a vast stage for Chinese fictions along with Chinese mythology and folklore. Pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the Ming dynasty, Chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical, town and gods and demons fictions as represented by the Four Great Classical Novels which include Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber. Along with the wuxia fictions of Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng, it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the East Asian cultural sphere.In the wake of the New Culture Movement after the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese literature embarked on a new era with written vernacular Chinese for ordinary citizens. Hu Shih and Lu Xun were pioneers in modern literature. Various literary genres, such as misty poetry, scar literature, young adult fiction and the xungen literature, which is influenced by magic realism, emerged following the Cultural Revolution. Mo Yan, a xungen literature author, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nChinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the \"Eight Major Cuisines\", including Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang cuisines. All of them are featured by the precise skills of shaping, heating, colorway and flavoring. Chinese cuisine is also known for its width of cooking methods and ingredients, as well as food therapy that is emphasized by traditional Chinese medicine. Generally, China's staple food is rice in the south, wheat based breads and noodles in the north. The diet of the common people in pre-modern times was largely grain and simple vegetables, with meat reserved for special occasions. And the bean products, such as tofu and soy milk, remain as a popular source of protein. Pork is now the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption. While pork dominates the meat market, there is also the vegetarian Buddhist cuisine and the pork-free Chinese Islamic cuisine. Southern cuisine, due to the area's proximity to the ocean and milder climate, has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables; it differs in many respects from the wheat-based diets across dry northern China. Numerous offshoots of Chinese food, such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese food, have emerged in the nations that play host to the Chinese diaspora.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nChina has become a prime sports destination worldwide. The country gained the hosting rights for several major global sports tournaments including the 2008 Summer Olympics, the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup and the upcoming 2022 Winter Olympics.\nChina has one of the oldest sporting cultures in the world. There is evidence that archery (sh\u00e8ji\u00e0n) was practiced during the Western Zhou dynasty. Swordplay (ji\u00e0nsh\u00f9) and cuju, a sport loosely related to association football date back to China's early dynasties as well.\n\nPhysical fitness is widely emphasized in Chinese culture, with morning exercises such as qigong and t'ai chi ch'uan widely practiced, and commercial gyms and private fitness clubs are gaining popularity across the country. Basketball is currently the most popular spectator sport in China. The Chinese Basketball Association and the American National Basketball Association have a huge following among the people, with native or ethnic Chinese players such as Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian held in high esteem. China's professional football league, now known as Chinese Super League, was established in 1994, it is the largest football market in Asia. Other popular sports in the country include martial arts, table tennis, badminton, swimming and snooker. Board games such as go (known as w\u00e9iq\u00ed in Chinese), xiangqi, mahjong, and more recently chess, are also played at a professional level. In addition, China is home to a huge number of cyclists, with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012. Many more traditional sports, such as dragon boat racing, Mongolian-style wrestling and horse racing are also popular.China has participated in the Olympic Games since 1932, although it has only participated as the PRC since 1952. China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where its athletes received 51 gold medals \u2013 the highest number of gold medals of any participating nation that year.

          "Typical tourist area with many different shops. Due to the virus we were probably the only Western tourists there. Many shops closed, but still worth a visit.",
          "Full of interesting things to see and learn. There are traditional clothing, traditional food, art, music.",
          "We visited ancient culture street and really enjoyed the atmosphere and the available souvenirs that were there. We also got a great bing for a snack. Nice for a wander with a very Chinese flavor. Highly recommended for visitors to Tianjin.",
          "You have to like kitsch and crowds (which we do) to visit this fun area. Some history mixed in but it is the mixture of food and people that makes it a hit.",
          "Visit during the week when it is quiet for a great chance to explore & take photos. Although aimed at tourists, a great collection of historic traditions & icons. Purple cla9y antiques, crafts, food, clothes temple, souvineers, photos..",
          "The buildings look nice but nothing much to see. We just wondering around the areas. Everywhere shops, shops, shops. Not for us. Can skip ...",
          "This area was very touristy, but it was still fun having a look round all the different shops selling all kinds of souvenirs. There was even an antiques market, which was nice to look around",
          "That impressed me. Looks kinda old and modern at the same time, but with a touch or touristy. Just good foods probably",
          "I have mixed feelings. The bad: This area claims to be historic but most of the charm is gone (just like other shopping streets throughout China). The buildings are old looking when you see the roofs BUT modern and boring shops on the first floor. It feels fake and charmless.",
          "It was hot as anything that day but outside of the weather, we loved the ancient culture street. Many of the shops were more like museums with history and artifacts than touristy items. It was beautiful.",
          "Traditional atmosphere, souvenir shops, good place to find little something to bring home. You can find pretty much every little thing that anyone associates with China. Bought a lovely paper sun umbrella (also used it since it was smoking hot).",
          "Enjoyed the street on a quite afternoon! So beautiful and authentic! Take your time and walk around, not a huge place, so you can use two hours and have a lunch. I have been told not to shop there since it is too expensive,haven\u2019t checked it for myself.",
          "We recently went to this area and had a great time haggling with the small shop owners over various prices. Such a nice environment and full of lots of cultural sights and activity.",
          "We first came here years back as part of a Tour package, this time free-easy can definitely spend more time exploring at our own pace. We have walked 20 mins from Drum Tower station to here, and the streets are loooong to explore, endless number of shops/stalls. There are",
          "Pretty well maintained area worth checking out especially if you're not touring places like Xian or Beijing. Nothing standout or special though. The kids mostly occupied themselves running laps of the drum tower. The little market stalls were cheaper than those at the Italian",
          "The place is very well maintained, lots of traditional arts and culture shops and displays, great place to learn and experience the traditional Tianjin arts and culture. You can taste all kinds of traditional Tianjin foods here too. It is definitely the best place in Tianjin to",
          "I don't know what I was expecting from the \"ancient culture street\" but I felt somewhat underwhelmed. I certainly wasn't expecting a street built in the 1980s...although I kind of did expect to find a tourist trap with over inflated prices, which is exactly what this place is.",
          "Actuality walked along \u6d77\u6cb3 (Hai He). It took 2hrs or so but this included numerous stops along the way to take photos since it was a relatively smog free day. The walk in itself along the river is very pleasant.",
          "The place was closed for the day. But still managed to get a feel of the place from the outside. Each painting tells a story of time gone by. Highly recommended.",
          "In winter vacation,my parents,my grandmother and I drove to Tianjin,we went there for eating and shopping.You should go to the Ancient Culture Street because that is a symbol of Tianjin's culture.That day was very cold,with strong wind,but with big amount of people,it was quite",
          "I had an hour walking around this shopping area. Many of the shops sold similar stuff but there were a few gems appealing to more than tourists. Worth trying to barter on larger purchases.",
          "This street in Tianjin has a lot of souvenirs shops but you must bargain a lot with the sellers. also you can taste some traditional dishes and sweet.",
          "I would recommend it mostly to visit the Palace Temple in the area. Other than that it's a standard tourist road complex with lots of shops, souvenirs/art shops and snacks.",
          "This might be worth a brief visit if you were nearby and needed an engraved seal to stamp documents, or some t-shirts. The layout is traditional and there\u2019s a bell tower in the centre, but little interesting to see or buy.",
          "A number of useful shops, antiques, eye catching architecture, all make this a place where we can spend substantial time. We toured in a cab and glad that this spot was included in the itinerary.",
          "Nice area, but you get the feeling that everthing is new, a bit like Disneyland. Entrance price reasonable., nice museum showing local crafts.",
          "I liked this market. I bought shoes and gifts for family and friends back home. You can bargain for deals in most of the shops. The bathrooms here are the traditional eastern style which is no toilet, just a ground level hole. I was with a group of colleagues so we were on a",
          "We did a 1/2 day tour of TianJin. As it was cold and raining, we did a fast walk through the area. Not many people were there as such. F&B establishments and shops selling nick nacks abound. The shops were closing earlier due to cold and wet weather. Not as crowded and rowdy as",
          "Maybe I've been to too many of these tourist spots - it takes a lot to get me enthused. The evening I went was cold, so that didn't help. The trinkets on sale are the usual dross; a mixture of kitsch crap and plastic rubbish. If you're looking for cheap souvenirs, you'll be in",
          "Lots of food, many to chose from, and performing artists, food are not expensive, there are also many restaurants.",
          "This is a beautiful old Chinese style market, ideal for tourists. They also have indoor areas (in case its raining or it is too hot).",
          "I think \u201cancient\u201d isn\u2019t an apt name for the street, as they\u2019re newer buildings designed to look older, but it\u2019s a great place for cheap souvenirs and snack foods",
          "LOVE this place! Towards the end of my 3 month stay, I became an expert at haggling prices in the native tongue! So don't be afraid to negotiate prices, it's expected. There are so many shops and street vendors, it's almost overwhelming but you can get through the whole area if",
          "This was a stop on our tour through the cruise ship. It was a fine stop and we managed to shop for souvenirs. Of course haggling is encouraged, even by our tour operator. I wouldn't necessarily recommend a visit to the Ancient Culture Street but as part of a tour it's a fine",
          "Ok so this is a massive tourist trap,but still as China goes though such rapid change in many of the big cities there are less and less places left where you can find some of these traditional Chinese\u2019s things so if you want to see crickets being sold in small cages ...",
          "The street is lined with intriguing architectural styles and most structures are built to replicate the Qing Dynasty style. It's located on the Haihe River and is a shopper's paradise with shops selling jade carvings and pottery in the folk art galleries. Plenty of restaurants",
          "If you visit Tianjin just for one day, you do not want to miss this place (\u53e4\u6587\u5316\u8857). We had them tour before the May 1st nation holiday, so it was not crowded. From arts crafts (silk painting) to various snacks, it is a good place to walk around and windows shopping (for us",
          "There are so many jade shops, craft shops, silk and pashmina stores, toy shops, shops for traditional Chinese clothing and such along Old Culture Street. I've had small sculptures of my kids made here, found exquisite aged pu-er tea here (for my collection), and picked up a",
          "This market is a series of streets with an ancient shrine. There are many shops, art, sculptures, souvenirs, clothing. there are also many food vendors. There are also individuals selling trinkets and small antiques. There is a wide varity of street food, meats, fish and",
          "Great place to get an authentic experience of food, arts and crafts, Street food and the sheer number of people in Beijing. It has a unique feel of subway, carnival, flee market, and street fair. On the walk there is a temple that offers a quiet reprieve of the bustle outside.",
          "Very good place to buy a lot of souvenirs,you can test Chinese food and view traditional Chinese buldings",
          "As far as cultural streets go, this one left something to be desired. It's very colorful and offers lots of photo opportunities, but it's essentially an indoor/outdoor market. If you're into that kinda thing, then you'll like this place. I'm not into shopping so it seemed a bit",
          "I had wanted to visit this area on my previous two trips to Tianjin, but stiffling heat and later cold, prevented this. When I finally did make a concerted effort to visit, it was unfortunately Chinese New Year and it was a sea of people, not to mention the traffic jam out the",
          "Our guide took us on a walking tour of the street focusing on the history and architecture which we thoroughly enjoyed. She also guided us to the best stores that offered traditional products. Highly recommend",
          "There are so many shops of ancient and oriental things along street. Also a lot of Chinese people are touring also. You can see many shops for cultural things and others. It is good place to see many things from old chinese culture.",
          "The Ancient Culture Street is a place to learn and feel how Chinese used to shop , eat and gather socially a few decades ago . Just by walking around , window-shopping and looking at people , it is possible to learn a lot about the way Chinese live and enjoy living ! More of a",
          "One of my Tianjin colleagues took us exploring for the day. The Ancient Culture Street was full of quaint little shops and food stalls, we visited on a Saturday and it was very busy. Lunar new year decorations were lining the street and all the stores. Amazing art for sale. I",
          "Very chinees and nice to visit. A lot to see and shop and eat. I also sent postcards to Sweden from here.",
          "This could be a place for treasure hunt if you are into old stuff and have the time to dig. Sure, there are many newly made items that looked old but you can also find some good artifacts if you are interested. We had a good time here just browsing through the many arts and",
          "Ancient Culture Street (Gu Wenhua Jie) in Tianjin is wonderful place to visit, walk and enjoy the special atmosphere.",
          "A bustling local cultural experience! Local snacks, local arts & crafts, artifacts and more!! A number of temples and other historical sites feed of this area. Worth a look when in Tianjin.",
          "This street is a very popular street in tianjin. You can find most of the antique chinese traditional equipments from there such as tea ceramony stuff, papers and inks and drawing books for art lovers and students. Bracelets,incents,ceramics...",
          "We went during the National Day holidays. Even without the press of a large crowd, this place would not be interesting - the usual tourist trinkets and souvenirs that you can get anywhere. We ducked into the temple to escape the crowd but it was a typical temple and nothing",
          "Whilst this may be an area depicting ancient culture, it is very modern and is basically a tourist trap where you can buy recently made \"antiques\" or jade like products. Visit if close by but not worth a special trip.",
          "Plenty of things to see here. All sorts of knick knacks would be repetitively sold as you stroll through the lanes so it would be worth the wait if you wish to scout for the best price! Items like jade, local snacks and local craft works are worth checking out, in my opinion.",
          "Built to look old, but isn't. Lots of shops featuring traditional crafts and arts. There's also a temple, but it was closed when we were there. Lots of restaurants. It's an ok area. Very touristy. And crowded.",
          "I went to this place in the afternoon and it was really got (summer). This place provides you the ancient stores selling traditional goods, like painting, statues, and traditional jewelries. Just prepare 1 hour visiting this place.",
          "If you want to get a feeling for her old Chinese heritage, this is a place to go. A lot of unique shops and museums. We can plan on spending a whole day here.",
          "The Ancient Culture Street of Tianjin is a nice place to spend a day. The location had a modern feel to it, though it still preserves a lot of traditional Tianjin. The place feel really catered to tourists, with vendors selling all sorts of souvenirs and food. The place is",
          "This is an ancient street, but it has a modern feel; catered for tourists, so it sells many souvenir items, food, clothing, and so on. Look out for seasonal bargains. It's quite enjoyable to just stroll along the street and to soak up the atmosphere. Recommended place to visit.",
          "This area is a great place to visit to see various types of Chinese culture - art and craft, food, music, performing arts etc. it has a good atmosphere and can get very busy on weekends. There are lots of shops with a variety of souvenirs and knock-knacks to purchase. You can",
          "It is quite varied in that there is a lot to see and do but also a lot to buy. Obviously there is a load of tat but also plenty of good Chinese souvenirs.",
          "Great local restaurants and street food vendors with a big variety of different shops as well. I have visited the Culture street on a holiday so no surprise it was crazy crowded. Even if you aren't planning to buy anything there, it worth a visit.",
          "This area is filled with shops and stalls carrying all kinds of new and old goods, food stands, artists stands. You can find most anything here, be prepared to dicker on price.",
          "I have nothing good to say about this place. Each shop sells exactly the same as the next one. You would think they had the initiative to create a fridge magnet for Tianjin, but, no, they sell fridge magnets for Beijing.....what can I say!!!",
          "As part of our private Tianjin tour, we asked to spend some time here? There is the clock tower, but the best is the local handicrafts, real local products, hand made. One of our party had something hand made for him which we picked up after lunch. I much prefer this to the",
          "Interesting architecture. Pretty much the same souvenir shops found through out China. We were brought here as part of a cruise ship tour. No need to go out of your way to come here.",
          "Good place to find inexpensive Chinese souvenirs. A wide variety of shops including artwork, porcelain, wooden items, women's clothing. The setting is very pleasant with old style Chinese architecture. Lots of street food. Some merchants speak English. Nice for a stroll and",
          "Spent 4 days at this tourist site. There was so much to see and do. Of course, you have to be interested in art, silk, paintings, craft, crystal or Jade. There was also a Chinese temple. It is a nice walking street, which is also situated along a river with an excellent bund to",
          "Oh my god. Disneyland for the Chinese. I don't want to be offensive, we all have streets like this. At the boulevards at sea and everywhere else. They cater for the masses. The tour busses wait in the streets surrounding it. The tour guides almost drive their groups as cattle",
          "I visited with a Chinese friend. I bought some brushes and ink and will go back soon, for another look. Recommend.",
          "This area is well worth the time to visit. There are many shops with a wide variety of goods (as well as prices), and there are many street side vendors as well. Plenty of things to eat on and off the street. Also if you want souvenirs then you can get them here.",
          "This type of 'ancient' street can be found all over China. Every city seems to have one. The buildings are ancient so they are cool to see and they are used to sell cheap souvenirs. I give it 4 stars as this street in particular is so cheap and if you need some gifts to take",
          "So this place is quite fun unlike all the other ancient streets in other towns. There really is a lot of stuff and I do see things which I don't see anywhere else in other parts of town. There are lots of street food such as sweets you can blow and create so pretty, cultural",
          "Cheap wares, cool little vendors and shops to check out. Get a nibble here and there and pick up some souvenirs.",
          "Upon walking in, you may feel as if you're walking into an authentic \"ancient\" \"culture\" street, but it's honestly a well decorated tourist trap with the common touristy souvenirs. Not saying you can't completely get items of interest, you may, but I don't find this place unique",
          "its a place where you will find a little bit of everything. from goods to food. some stores sell the chinese version of known brands. there is a variety of food that one can try. some will look strange and others will look more familiar. i think its worth trying the food as its",
          "We walked around the area for about 2 hours. Three Americans with 2 Tianjin locals. Lots of Chinese culture types of gifts. Also several stores selling knockoff of high end goods like the Pearl Market. Take a chance and try some street food, you will not be sorry.",
          "interesting street with lots of shop houses displaying similar goods and products. there are sure something to catch your eyes here.....",
          "Lots of sights and smells and interesting things to look at. I planned to spend an hour, and stayed 3, just wandering around taking it in. For a westerner it was unique and fun.",
          "The buildings along the streets are modeled after the Qing dynasty architectural style, which makes us feel like going back to the ancient time when walking around the area. There are shops selling tea sets, handicrafts, paintings, Chinese calligraphy accessories, souvenirs,",
          "Nice place to collect souvenirs from China. Need to bargain. People seldom speak English so better have someone local with you.",
          "This was an easy destination by subway for us, only a few miles from our hotel. The buildings were interesting, although we didn't know the history behind the place. There was an actual Buddhist temple there, where people could go in and worship. Besides the interest of the",
          "good street where you can find variety of shops for cloths, utensils and gift items. there is tea house where you can find sculptures and traditional architecture including stage activities.",
          "Great place to be in and discover the local temples, art and craft stores. It a pretty crowded street buzzing with a lot of energy, so if your having your local guide/friend to show you around, better make sure you stay close.",
          "This is a fun place to shop for the travel trinkets and crazy souvenirs that you need to take home. The prices are super good--much lower than many other places I have visited and there is a decent variety of stores and goods including some very upscale art. Lots of fun food",
          "This is most impressive place I have visited in Tianjin. You can buy here souvenirs and hand made goods, admire old Chinese architecture, get some Chinese food. I am sure you will enjoy. Once you are there don't forget to visit Palace of Queen of Heaven. It is located in the",
          "Very interesting and very crowded but very Chinese. Lots of fake amber and jade around in the stalls but some nice shops. Much better than the Italian area we had just come from.",
          "Very nice place. It shows you the Chinese architecture and you can buy many souvenirs and cheap girds. If you go to Tianjin you should visit this place.",
          "As I compare visiting the Ancient Culture Street in 2011 and 2016, I find that there seems to be less people coming to Ancient Culture Street for a bargain and/or a visit. Or may be there are less people on a Sunday, compared to a week day? I usually like to stroll and look at",
          "Ancient Cultural Street (Guwenhua Jie) Formally opened in 1986 on the west bank of Haihe River, Ancient Cultural Street is a famous tourist attraction in Downtown (city center) Tianjin. It is 0.7 km long and 5 meter wide street, starting at Gongbei Avenue in the north, and",
          "The Ancient Culture Street is a tourist popular area where you can buy souvenirs and try exotic local food. It is worth a visit as it is the best one stop place to buy souvenirs home. Remember to compare prices before deciding. There is also one area where street vendors will",
          "Quite a nice old town hotong for a walk and good for shopping some souvenirs. Wood stuff, China, cloth, quite a range of goods and not too overpriced.",
          "A tourist attraction - a street that was designed to feel like old China. Many shops and some eateries in a market atmosphere. It is nice but nothing special.",
          "There seemed to be a rebuilt ancient cultural street selling souvenirs in every Chinese city. This one is for Tianjin and the shop keepers here tend not to bargain. This is still a good place to pick up souvenirs.",
          "Doing my last minute shopping at China. You can finds a lot of interesting souvenirs here, enjoyed the bargain moments with the shopkeeper. i brought my 5 billion dollar note from the Great Qing post.",
          "Among the numerous shops for tourists, there are some of them which are a little bit more interesting. There is also a temple and a public place circled by what is looking like ancient houses. You can spend a couple of hours there, no more.",
          "This is tourist trap and the street itself is just a place to buy touristy souvenirs. It is entirely reconstructed. The temple is well worth a visit and is a pleasant distraction from the choatic capitalism outside.",
          "This is a good place to view, it gives s flavour of the old China, with lots of old style buildings and shops. Very colourful,which lots of lanterns decorating the streets.It is worth a visit.",
          "This street or rather area has a lot of people selling \u201cancient\u201d things such as calligraphy brushes and paper, qipaos, traditional music instruments, tea pots, things made of jade and so forth. It's not the cheapest place to buy these things and the quality also doesn't always",
          "All built with early chinese architecture so it is visually appealing. Everything here starts to shut down around 5pm so go early. This is mostly a tourist trap with every chinese trinket you could want available; always haggle.",
          "This street is a reflection of old Tianjin and worth a visit. There are a variety of shops with local crafts. The architecture is very interesting and a step into the past. Tianjin is a very modern city and this is your best chance to experience what it was like over a century",
          "my group arrived at the same that that the Chinese holiday were over. that means that there were so many people that it was almost impossible to walk around. But with that said, the street were nice and you could look at a lot of pretty things to buy.",
          "This version was built around 2003 when they pulled down the old place. Certainly worth a visit, but mainly aims for tourist trinket market. Hasn't changed much over the last 13 years",
          "It has to be done. You come to China or friends come to visit and they need to go away with a souvenir. This is the place for it. You might be able to find better bargains if you hunt the back streets, but this has a good variety in a small area and at reasonable prices. It's",
          "The area is bustling with life and active people. We were surprised by the quality of some shops offering genuine, quality clothes, arts and craft. Lots of street vendors and food vendors with local delicacies such as steamed rice cakes and quail eggs. There is also the",
          "Great tourist trap. Though I knew this I walked around anyway. Lots of trinkets and a few high value shops. All the vendors were very friendly and enjoyed haggling over prices. I ended up buying a few things and had a lot of fun.",
          "Seemed to be just a tourist trap, selling cheap tourist stuff and overpriced \"antiquities\" and not old at all but recently constructed to look like a traditional Chinese marketplace. There were a couple of historic temples but no information in English and they were closed",
          "Nice street full of small souvenir shops and some little kiosk for food and beverages. Architecture in old Chinese style, in the middle of the main street there is also a small temple to visit. Always haggle for buy some souvenirs.",
          "This is a must see for tourists who aren't afraid of crowds and who aren't afraid to barter. Taxis are very cheap in China, so we were able to get there easily. There is a wide range of shops - art, ornaments, jewellery, clothing etc. Most shopkeepers seemed happy to",
          "This is a nice street away from cars however it is mostly about extracting money from tourists. Depending on what your after you'll find most things overpriced here as your captive audience and unless you know the price range for items the outcome may not be good. Bartering",
          "Much of Tianjin that I went to is modern, such as the shopping malls along Nanjing Lu and the areas around Heping Commercial Distrcit. When and where it is old (well, not very old actually), it was buildings which were modelled after those in Europe in an era gone by. Ancient",
          "Nothing special just area for tourists. If it's your first time in China then go maybe but other than that I would find somewhere else to spend my time",
          "To get the flavour of Old Tianjin, just visit this place. Carry a lot of money with you to shop to your heart's content.",
          "You have to have a great time. Yes, it can, is crowded. but well worth the effort. The first time in, you should see the performance artists, wonderful. The food is good for what they have, pretty much the same as any street food. But still a good time.",
          "Good way to spend 30-60 minutes browsing the stalls and shops and doing a spot of haggling if anything takes your fancy. Make sure and visit the sugar art man to watch an artist at work. He is very skilled and an absolute perfectionist. Our daughters got a panda shaped one and",
          "Ancient Culture Street is in the north of the city and is actually a series of streets, built in typical Tianjin style featuring Qing style architecture. The shops are decorated with watercolor paintings and carved bricks. There are plenty of traditional Chinese items on sale",
          "Quite a big area to browse. The feel of the place is of ancient chinese experience which is doing what it is supposed to.",
          "The most beautiful city I have visited in China is Tianjin. ...It is an ancient city where you see the mix culture between Chinese and European. Awesome. There are many European buildings because in the past Tianjin was the place for Europeans to live. To get Tianjin, it is",
          "This is both the first and last place I visited on my trip to Tianjin as it is close to my hotel and on my way to a mall. This place is nothing special. Typical souvenir shops that all have the same things. If you're close, go for it but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",
          "Typical street market experience where it pays to barter but beware that you may agree to buy something that you did not intend to. It was hard to find unique Chinese gifts. If you want fans, cheap jewelry, wooden frogs, or jade carvings, you'll be ok.",
          "The ancient cultural street in Tianjin is, on the surface much like any other ancient cultural streets in other Chinese cities. You can find many similar things being sold. However, Tianjin's cultural street is unique for 3 shops. One is actually a museum and the other two are",

          "The Ancient Culture Street is the only place like that in Tianjin. There are a lot of shops with a lot of \"traditional\" items. If you are a foreigner, don't hesitate : BARGAIN ! I bought a nice Qipao there (traditional dress) and a carved seal and some other gifts for my friends",
          "very cultural in Tianjin- hope everyone gets a chance to visit this in Tianjin- great food- very safe and get presents of China needed to take back to others in the US!",
          "Went there for a walk to sightsee. Most of the stores sell similar stuff and after a while, everything looks the same. Nevertheless, still good for some photography along the streets.",
          "We visited ancient culture street in 2 places in Tianjin. Imrge shops are like little treasures and good for souvenirs. We bought silk chinese dresses at better prices. It's like seeing a different side of the City. My most enjoyable part for shopping",
          "I first went to Ancient Culture street when it was comparatively new, ie three years old despite its name. I've gone most years since then, but this year there is a real difference. A lot more shops, with more variety, actually somewhere reasonable to eat rather than dubious",

          "A variety of the same things! The highlight of the trip was a visit to the flagship store of Zhang ceramic artist dynasty- 6 generations of incredible artistic talent in the earth element, clay. Well worth an afternoon",

          "We went at midday and found the street to be aesthetically pleasing whilst less crowded and intense than your standard Beijing market. Plenty of the usual 'antiques' to buy along with your more obvious novelty Chinese goods. A fun way to spend an hour or so.",
          "It was more enjoyable than I was expecting. The area is quite fascinating with all types of shops and interesting architecture. Our tour guide recommended that we try some twisted bread, which was easy to find there. Quite tasty.",
          "We only had one day for the day trip toTianjin. By the time we arrived at this street, it was almost 4pm. We spent the next 2 hours here browsing the many shops selling antiques, food, ancient wares & many unique local things. And some of these products were beautiful - like",

          "How this can be called \"Ancient\" defies any stretch of the imagination, given that the entire area, and everything it represents, was destroyed during the \"Four Olds\" campaign of the 1960s. Best place I can think of to be robbed, either by pickpockets or vendors - one glimpse",
          "Like most of the 'Ancient' streets in China, the buildings are relatively new, but in the old style. This however does not takeaway from its beauty and charm. The best part of a visit here is the sampling of traditional snacks and street food. As far as the shopping goes, be",

        "wiki": "Tianjin ([t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n.t\u0255\u00edn] (listen)), alternately romanized as Tientsin, is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China on the shore of the Bohai Sea. It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted the East Asian Games, which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as \"National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area\". In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a major fire and explosion accident occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTianjin is located along the west coast of the Bohai Gulf, looking out to the provinces Shandong and Liaoning across those waters, bordered by Beijing 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border,  the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). There is 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. It lies at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the Yan Mountains intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak (\u4e5d\u9876\u5c71) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft).\nThe Hai River forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the Ziya River (\u5b50\u7259\u6cb3), Daqing River (\u5927\u6e05\u6cb3), Yongding River, North Grand Canal, and South Grand Canal, and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in Tanggu District.

Having a low annual total precipitation of 511 millimeters (20.1 in), and nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid zone, with parts of the municipality being humid continental (K\u00f6ppen BSk/Dwa, respectively).Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221222.9 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F) to 40.5 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Measures to improve air quality ===\nIn May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels. These measures included several restrictions on days of severe pollution; halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities.\n\nForeign-born professional sportsmen have made statements regarding Tianjin's air quality, citing it as an impediment to athletic activity and being thick enough to \"taste\".\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nTianjin is divided into 16 county-level divisions, which are all districts.\n\nIn addition, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) is not a formal level of administration, but nevertheless enjoys rights similar to a regular district. At the end of 2017, the total population of Tianjin is 15.57 million.[3]\n\nThese districts and counties are further subdivided, as of December 31, 2004, into 240 township-level divisions, including 120 towns, 18 townships, 2 ethnic townships and 100 subdistricts.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Tianjin is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in the mainland China.\nThe Mayor of Tianjin is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Tianjin. Since Tianjin is a municipality, the Communist Party of China Municipal Committee Secretary is colloquially termed the \"Tianjin CPC Party chief\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTianjin's GDP reached 1.572 trillion yuan in 2014, an increase of 10.0 percent over 2013. The city of Tianjin recorded China's highest per-capita GDP with $17,126, followed by Beijing with $16,278 and Shanghai with $15,847.\n\nMajor industries include petrochemical industries, textiles, car manufacturing, mechanical industries, and metalworking. EADS Airbus is an important manufacturer, and has opened an assembly plant for its Airbus A320 series airliners, operational since 2009. Tianjin also hit the news in 2010, as the current fastest supercomputer in the world, Tianhe-1A, is located at the National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin. GDP in 2009 hit \uffe5750.1 billion, with a per capita of RMB\uffe562,403.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area ===\n\nAs one of the first state-level economic and technological development zones, Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) was founded on December 6, 1984, with the approval of the State Council. It enjoys relevant state preferential policies with the major task of attracting domestic and foreign investment to develop high and new technology oriented modern industries.

By the end of 2008, the zone has 2068 corporations and has 5 industries there including new materials, oil manufacturing, modern machinery manufacturing, and electronic information.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Nangang Industrial Zone ===\nA heavy and chemical industry base and harbor; an important part of the \"dual-city, dual-harbor\"space development strategy of Tianjin, a demonstration zone of circular economy. The total planned area of Nangang Industrial Zone is 200 km2 (77 sq mi), of which the terrestrial area is 162 km2 (63 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nFarmland takes up about 40% of Tianjin Municipality's total area. Wheat, rice, and maize are the most important crops. Fishing is important along the coast.\n\n\n=== Resources ===\nTianjin Municipality also has deposits of about 1 billion tonnes of petroleum, with Dagang District containing important oilfields. Salt production is also important, with Changlu Yanqu being one of China's most important salt production areas. Geothermal energy is another resource of Tianjin. Deposits of manganese and boron under Tianjin were the first to be found in China.\n\n\n=== Binhai New Area ===\nTianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) is located in the juncture of the Beijing-Tianjin City Belt and the Circum-Bohai City Belt. It is the gateway to North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Lying in the center of Northeast Asia, it is the nearest point of departure of the Eurasian Continental Bridge.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the end of 2009, the population of Tianjin Municipality was 12.28 million, of which 9.8 million were residential holders of Tianjin hukou (permanent residence). Among Tianjin permanent residents, 5.99 million were urban, and 3.81 million were rural.

There are also 51 out of the 55 minor Chinese ethnic groups living in Tianjin. Major minorities include Hui, Koreans, Manchus, and Mongols.\n\nThis excludes members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n\n== Media ==\nTianjin People's Broadcasting Station is the major radio station in Tianjin. Broadcasting in nine channels, it serves most of North China, part of East and Northeast China, reaching an audience of over 100 million.

There are also three English-language magazines: Jin, Tianjin Plus and Business Tianjin, mostly directed at ex-pats resident in the city.\n\n\n=== Previous newspapers ===\nThe first German newspaper in northern China, Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, was published in Tianjin.In 1912 Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and 5 daily newspapers in other languages; none of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers. Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News). Newspapers from Beijing published in Tianjin included Pei Ching Jih Pao, Peking Daily News, and Le Journal de Peking.In 1930, the newspaper Deutsch-Mandschurische Nachrichten moved from Harbin to Tianjin and changed its name to the Deutsch-Chinesische Nachrichten.\n\n\n=== Censorship capital ===\nMore and more, China's leading Internet information providers (usually located in Beijing), including social network Sina Weibo, Douban and the online video website Sohu, tend to relocate their censorship departments to Tianjin, where labor costs are cheaper than Beijing, as censorship is a kind of labor-intensive work. In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived.

Ma Sanli (1914\u20132003), an ethnic Hui and longtime resident of Tianjin, is renowned for his xiangsheng, a hugely popular form of Chinese entertainment akin to comedy. Ma Sanli delivered some of his xiangsheng in the Tianjin dialect. Tianjin, along with Beijing, is a center for the art of xiangsheng. Tianjin's style of stand-up also includes the use of rhythmic bamboo clappers, kuaiban.Yangliuqing (Green Willows), a town about 15 km (9.3 mi) west of Tianjin's urban area and the seat of Xiqing District, is famous for its popular Chinese New Year-themed, traditional-style, colorful wash paintings (\u6768\u67f3\u9752\u5e74\u753b). Tianjin is also famous for the Zhang clay figurine, a type of intricate, colorful figurine depicting a variety of vivid characters, and Tianjin's Wei's kites, which can be folded to a fraction of their full sizes and are noted for portability.\nOn September 28, 2015, the Juilliard School in Manhattan, New York City announced a major expansion into Tianjin during a visit by China's first lady, Peng Liyuan, the institution's first such full-scale foray outside the United States, with plans to offer a master's degree program.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nTianjin cuisine places a heavy focus on seafood, due to Tianjin's proximity to the sea.  It can be further classified into several varieties, including the rough (Chinese: \u7c97; pinyin: c\u016b), smooth (simplified Chinese: \u7ec6; traditional Chinese: \u7d30; pinyin: x\u00ec), and high (Chinese: \u9ad8; pinyin: g\u0101o). Prominent menus include the Eight Great Bowls (Chinese: \u516b\u5927\u7897; pinyin: B\u0101d\u00e0 w\u01cen), a combination of eight mainly meat dishes, and the Four Great Stews (Chinese: \u56db\u5927\u6252; pinyin: s\u00ec d\u00e0 b\u0101), actually referring to a very large number of stews, including chicken, duck, seafood, beef, and mutton.\nThe four delicacies of Tianjin include Goubuli baozi, Guifaxiang Shibajie Mahua (Chinese: \u5341\u516b\u8857\u9ebb\u82b1; pinyin: sh\u00edb\u0101 ji\u0113 m\u00e1hu\u0101), Erduoyan Zhagao (Chinese: \u8033\u6735\u773c\u70b8\u7cd5; pinyin: erduoy\u01cen zh\u00e0 g\u0101o) and Maobuwen Jiaozi (Chinese: \u732b\u4e0d\u95fb\u997a\u5b50; pinyin: m\u0101o b\u00f9 w\u00e9n ji\u01ceozi). Well-known foods include Caoji donkey meat, Bazhen sheep-leg mutton of Guanshengyuan, Luji Tangmian Zhagao, Baiji Shuijiao, Gaogan of Zhilanzhai, Guobacai of Dafulai, Subao of Shitoumenkan and Xiaobao chestnut. These famous snacks are available in Nanshi Food Street, which was a famous calling-card of Tianjin in the aspect of cuisine.\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Airport ===\n\nTianjin Binhai International Airport is located in Dongli District roughly 13 km (8 mi) away from downtown area.

Located in Binhai Economic Zone, a national new economic zone of China, Tianjin harbor is the port of call of international cruises visiting the wider area, including Beijing.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTianjin's harbor area of Binhai/TEDA has a modern, high speed rubber tired tram system, which is the first of its kind in China and Asia. Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.  Construction work on Line 2 and Line 3 was completed in 2012 and the two lines are now in operation. Several new metro lines are planned.\nThere was two rapid transit operators in Tianjin.

It was built in 1888. The station was initially located at Wangdaozhuang (simplified Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u5e84; traditional Chinese: \u65fa\u9053\u838a; pinyin: W\u00e0ngd\u00e0ozhu\u0101ng). The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility and as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project involving Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9 as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-speed rail.\nTianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also major railway stations in Tianjin. There is also Tanggu railway station is located in the important port area of Tanggu District, and Binhai railway station and Binhai North railway station located in TEDA, to the north of Tanggu. There are several other railway stations in the city that do not handle passenger traffic. Construction on a Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail began on July 4, 2005 and was completed by August 2008.\nThe following rail lines go through Tianjin:\n\nJingshan Railway, from Beijing to Shanhai Pass\nJinpu Railway, from Tianjin to Pukou District, Nanjing\nJinji Railway, from Tianjin urban area to Ji County, Tianjin\nJinba Railway, from Tianjin to Bazhou, Hebei\nThe inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system: Cxxxx (C stands for interCity). The train numbers range between C2001\uff5eC2298:\n\nC2001\uff5eC2198: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, directly\nC2201\uff5eC2268: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, with stops at Wuqing Station (\u6b66\u6e05\u7ad9)\nC2271\uff5eC2298: From Beijing South Station to Yujiapu Railway Station of TianjinThe new C trains take only 30 min to travel between Beijing and Tianjin, cutting the previous D train time by more than a half. The ticket price as of Aug 15, 08 is 69 RMB for the first-class seat and 58 RMB for the second-class seat.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\nThere were over 900 bus lines in the city as of 2005.\n\n\n=== Roads and expressways ===\nSome roads and bridges have retained names that hark back to the Republic of China era (1912\u20131949) such as Minquan Gate and Beiyang Road. Like with most cities in China, many roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four cardinal directions.\nTianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections.

        "wiki": "Tangshan (Chinese: \u5510\u5c71; pinyin: T\u00e1ngsh\u0101n) is a coastal, industrial prefecture-level city in the northeast of Hebei province. The city's industrialization began in 1870, when Kailuan Group established coal mines in the region. It's the birthplace of China's first standard-gauge railway, the first railway plant, the first steam locomotive, and the first cement factory. It was hailed as China's \"cradle of industrialization\". Even today, Tangshan is a hub of steel, energy, chemical, and ceramics production. Ping opera, which originated from the city's Luanzhou county, is one of the five most popular Chinese operas.It has also become known for the 1976 Tangshan earthquake which measured 7.8 on the Richter scale, flattening much of the city and killing at least 255,000 residents according to official estimates. The city has since been rebuilt, has become a tourist attraction, and is among the 10 largest ports in China.The city of Tangshan is approximately 149 km (93 mi) east by south east of Beijing. It takes roughly 2 hours by road to get from Tangshan to Beijing and 1 hour by road to reach Tianjin.Tangshan's prefecture population was 7,577,289 at the 2010 census, with 3,187,171 in the built-up (or metro) area made of the 6 urban core districts.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTangshan is named after Dacheng Mountain (\u5927\u57ce\u5c71), which is also called Mount Tang, in the middle of Tangshan city.\nIn A.D. 645, Li Shimin- an emperor of Tang Dynasty and his army were stationed at Dacheng Mountain on his way back from Korean Peninsula. Unfortunately, Caofei, his beloved concubine, died here. In order to commemorate his Caofei, he named the mountain with the name of the state\u2014Tang. Later, the name of the mountain became the name of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nTangshan has a long history, with ancient humans living in the area as early as 4,000 years ago. It fell within the territory of the Guzhu Kingdom (1600 BC) at the time of the Shang Dynasty and later became a part of the State of Yan, one of the seven Warring States (403 \u2013 221 BC). During the Han Dynasty (206 BC \u2013 220 AD) it became part of the ancient province of Youzhou. It was under the jurisdiction of Yongping Province and Zunhua State successively during the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911).\n\n\n=== Tang, Ming and Qing dynasties ===\nTangshan was a village at the time of the Tang dynasty (619\u2013907) and developed further in agriculture, oil exploitation and ceramics during the Ming Dynasty (1368\u20131644).\nDuring the Hundred Days' Reform in the late Qing dynasty, the Kaiping Mining Administration was established in the third year of the Guangxu Emperor (1877). In 1878, Qiaotun town was established at Tangshan and renamed Tangshan Town in 1889. In 1938, Tangshan City was formally founded. The administrative system of Tangshan during the Republic of China Republican era continued to follow the Qing system. In 1929, Zhili Province changed its name to Hebei Province. On January 28, 1939, because of Tangshan's special economic and political position, the East Hebei Autonomous Government established Tangshan City which was initially called \u201cTangshan Municipal Government\u201d and later changed to \u201cTangshan Municipal Office\u201d. After Japan surrendered in 1945, the Chinese Nationalist Party in Peking (now known as Beijing) took over the political control of Tangshan from Japan and set up an Administration Inspectors Office. In April 1946, it was decided at the 132nd Meeting of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee to set up Tangshan City and on May 5 of the same year, the Tangshan Municipal government was founded.\n\n\n=== People's Republic ===\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, Tangshan remained a provincially administered municipality with 12 areas under its jurisdiction.\nIn March 1955, it was decided at the 2nd session of the first People's Congress of Tangshan City to change Tangshan Municipal people's government to Tangshan people's committee without changing its administration areas.\nOn April 28, 1958, the State Council approved the establishment of Tangshan prefecture. On August 29, 1958, it was decided at the Seventh Session of the first People's Congress of Hebei Province to move the Tangshan Commissioner Office from Changli County to Tangshan City.\nThe CPC Central Committee decided to designate Tangshan city as one of the 45 cities open to the world on June 3, 1959. On June 8, 1959, the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee and the Hebei Provincial People's Congress decided to combine the Tangshan Commissioners Office and the Tangshan People's Committee into the Tangshan People's Committee. On April 2, 1960, the State Council officially approved the abolition of Tangshan prefecture. Qinhuangdao city, Qian'an, Changli, Laoting, Baodi, Yutian, Jixian County and Zunhua which were formerly administrated by Tangshan Prefecture were incorporated into the Tangshan Municipality. Luanxian County, Fengrun County (formerly a district) and Baigezhuang Farm were also incorporated into Tangshan Municipality. Meanwhile, Tangshan became a provincially administered municipality.\nOn May 23, 1961, the State Council approved the reinstatement of Tangshan prefecture, which was adopted at the 14th Meeting of the Hebei Provincial People's Committee on  June 3, 1959. Tangshan prefecture and Tangshan municipality were separated again and Tangshan turned into a specially administered municipality.\nThe Tangshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee affiliated to the Revolutionary Committee of Tangshan Region was set up on January 6, 1968, \nOn March 11, 1978, Tangshan turned to be a provincially administered municipality.\nIn October 1982, it was decided at the Seventh People's Congress of Tangshan city to abolish the Tangshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee and set up the Tangshan Municipal People's Government.\nThe State Council approved the move on March 3, 1983 and thereafter implemented the city-governing-county system. On May 13, 1983, the Hebei Provincial People's Government announced the cancellation of the Civic Administration office of Tangshan region, which ceased operation on May 15, 1983.\nOn December 15, 1984, the State Council approved Tangshan city as one of 13 national \u201ccomparatively big\u201d cities.\n\n\n=== 1976 Tangshan earthquake ===\n\nTangshan suffered an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 (7.5 according to official reports) at 3:42 am on July 28, 1976, which resulted in many casualties. The official death toll was 255,000, but many experts believe that the actual number of fatalities was two to three times that number, making it the most destructive earthquake in modern history. As a result of the earthquake, most of the town had to be rebuilt. The earthquake was depicted in the 2010 movie Aftershock.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nTangshan is located in the central section of the Bohai Economic Rim, facing the Bohai Sea to the south. Lying on the North China Plain, Tangshan is adjacent to the Yan Mountains to the north, borders the Luan River and Qinhuangdao to the east, and to the west and southwest borders Tianjin. Because of its location in the northeast of Hebei, it is a strategic area and a corridor linking two China's north and northeast regions. The largest river in the prefecture is the Luan River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTangshan has a monsoon-influenced, humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen Dwa), with cold and very dry winters, and hot, rainy summers. Spring and autumn are short with some rainfall. The monthly 24-hour average temperature in January is \u22125.1 \u00b0C (22.8 \u00b0F), and 25.7 \u00b0C (78.3 \u00b0F) in July, and the annual mean is 11.5 \u00b0C (52.7 \u00b0F). Close to 60% of the annual precipitation of 610 millimeters (24.0 in) falls in July and August alone. The frost-free period lasts 180\u2212190 days, and the area receives 2,600\u22122,900 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n=== Air pollution ===\nAs air pollution in China has worsened in recent years, reports suggest cities in Hebei among the most polluted in the country, with Tangshan being now exception. According to a survey made by \"Global voices China\" in February 2013, 7 cities in Hebei including Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Handan, Langfang, Hengshui and Tangshan, are among China's 10 most polluted cities.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTangshan is an important heavy industrial city in North China. Its output include machinery, motor vehicles, chemicals, textiles, glass, petroleum products, and cement. It has been a coal-mining center since late Qing Dynasty, as Guangdong merchant Tong King-sing opened the first coal mine using modern techniques in Kaiping in 1877. Since the construction of the Caofeidian Project, it has hosted large iron and steel plants, chemical projects, and electricity plants. It is China's largest steel-producing city. Tangshan is also called the \"porcelain capital of North China.\" Modern industry in China first arose in Tangshan.  The second railway in China \u2013 after the abortive Woosung Railway in Shanghai \u2013 was the six-mile track laid between Hsukochuang and Tangshan which opened in 1881; this eventually grew into the Imperial Railroad of North China and China's modern Jingshan and Jingha Railways. The first fire-resistant material manufactory and the first and largest cement manufactory were constructed in Tangshan as well.\nTangshan has experienced near-constant GDP growth in recent years, but has slowed down in the latter-half of the 2010s. In 2008, the GDP of Tangshan was \u00a5353.747 billion, which nearly doubled to \u00a5612.121 billion by 2013, and grew further to \u00a5695.500 billion in 2018. Tangshan's GDP was ranked the 26th largest among Chinese cities according to data from 2017. The city's exports were valued at $7.109 billion in 2016. Government figures for 2017 show that the city's economy was largely dominated by the secondary industry, contributing \u00a5408.14 billion to the city's economy.\n\n\n=== Industrial zone ===\nCaofeidian New Zone.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nGovernment data from 2017 shows that 7.897 million people live in Tangshan, of which, 61.64% live in an urban area. The city's residents had a mean disposable income of \u00a527,786, which was \u00a536,415 among urban residents.\n\n\n=== Ethnic composition ===\nTangshan, like many other locations in China, is largely Han Chinese, who account for 95.25% of the city's population. In Zunhua City, there are 3 ethnic townships and ethnic towns. The following table shows the city's ethnic breakdown:\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe prefecture-level city of Tangshan administers 14 county-level divisions including 7 districts, 4 counties and 3 county-level cities.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities and colleges ===\nNorth China University of Science and Technology (formerly named Hebei United University), which was co-established by Hebei Polytechnic University and North China Coal Medical College in May 2010 \nTangshan Normal University\nTangshan College\nHebei University of Science and Technology Tangshan Branch\n\n\n=== High schools ===\nTangshan No.1 high school (founded 1902), one of the most famous high schools in China\nHebei Tangshan Foreign Language School\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Specialty ===\nDiet\nWanlixiang Roast Chicken (\u842c\u91cc\u9999\u71d2\u96de)\nChessboard pancake (\u68cb\u5b50\u71d2\u200e\u9920)\nHoney sugar candy (\u8702\u871c\u9ebb\u7cd6)\nPeanut crisp (\u82b1\u751f\u9165\u7cd6)\nBig gezhe (\u5927\u683c\u647a)\nSmall gezhe (\u5c0f\u683c\u647a)\nDried Fruits\nChinese chestnut (\u677f\u6817)\nWalnut\n\n\n=== Traditional Arts ===\nPing opera, or Pingju, one of the most popular operas in China\nTangshan Shadow Play (\u5510\u5c71\u76ae\u5f71)\nLaoting drums (\u6a02\u4ead\u5927\u9f13)\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\nEastern Tombs of the Qing Dynasty\nAnti-Seismic Monument, located in Anti-Seismic Square\nTangshan Nanhu Park (Lunan District)\nKailuan National Mine Park (Lunan District)\nTangshan science and Technology Museum (Lubei District)\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nDatang Xingguo Chan Temple (\u5927\u5510\u8208\u570b\u79aa\u5bfa), a Buddhist temple\nJingzhong Mountain, a joint religious shrine for the believers of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism, respectively.\nTwo Christian churches.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nAs of 2017, Tangshan has 18,000 kilometers of roads, of which, 16,000 were in rural areas.

        "wiki": "Tianjin ([t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n.t\u0255\u00edn] (listen)), alternately romanized as Tientsin, is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China on the shore of the Bohai Sea. It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted the East Asian Games, which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as \"National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area\". In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a major fire and explosion accident occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTianjin is located along the west coast of the Bohai Gulf, looking out to the provinces Shandong and Liaoning across those waters, bordered by Beijing 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border,  the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). There is 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. It lies at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the Yan Mountains intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak (\u4e5d\u9876\u5c71) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft).\nThe Hai River forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the Ziya River (\u5b50\u7259\u6cb3), Daqing River (\u5927\u6e05\u6cb3), Yongding River, North Grand Canal, and South Grand Canal, and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in Tanggu District.

It has a four-season, monsoon-influenced climate, typical of East Asia, with cold, windy, very dry winters reflecting the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone, and hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon. Spring in the city is dry and windy, occasionally seeing sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert, capable of lasting for several days. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from \u22123.4 \u00b0C (25.9 \u00b0F) in January to 26.8 \u00b0C (80.2 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.9 \u00b0C (55.2 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 48% in July to 61% in October, the city receives 2,522 hours of bright sunshine annually. Having a low annual total precipitation of 511 millimeters (20.1 in), and nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid zone, with parts of the municipality being humid continental (K\u00f6ppen BSk/Dwa, respectively).Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221222.9 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F) to 40.5 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Measures to improve air quality ===\nIn May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels. These measures included several restrictions on days of severe pollution; halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities.\n\nForeign-born professional sportsmen have made statements regarding Tianjin's air quality, citing it as an impediment to athletic activity and being thick enough to \"taste\".\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nTianjin is divided into 16 county-level divisions, which are all districts.\n\nIn addition, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) is not a formal level of administration, but nevertheless enjoys rights similar to a regular district. At the end of 2017, the total population of Tianjin is 15.57 million.[3]\n\nThese districts and counties are further subdivided, as of December 31, 2004, into 240 township-level divisions, including 120 towns, 18 townships, 2 ethnic townships and 100 subdistricts.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Tianjin is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in the mainland China.\nThe Mayor of Tianjin is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Tianjin. Since Tianjin is a municipality, the Communist Party of China Municipal Committee Secretary is colloquially termed the \"Tianjin CPC Party chief\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTianjin's GDP reached 1.572 trillion yuan in 2014, an increase of 10.0 percent over 2013. The city of Tianjin recorded China's highest per-capita GDP with $17,126, followed by Beijing with $16,278 and Shanghai with $15,847.\n\nMajor industries include petrochemical industries, textiles, car manufacturing, mechanical industries, and metalworking. EADS Airbus is an important manufacturer, and has opened an assembly plant for its Airbus A320 series airliners, operational since 2009. Tianjin also hit the news in 2010, as the current fastest supercomputer in the world, Tianhe-1A, is located at the National Supercomputing Center in Tianjin. GDP in 2009 hit \uffe5750.1 billion, with a per capita of RMB\uffe562,403.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area ===\n\nAs one of the first state-level economic and technological development zones, Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA) was founded on December 6, 1984, with the approval of the State Council. It enjoys relevant state preferential policies with the major task of attracting domestic and foreign investment to develop high and new technology oriented modern industries. As an affiliated organ of the Tianjin Municipal Government, the Administrative Commission of Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area exercises unified administration of TEDA on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal Government and enjoys provincial-level administrative and economic management rights.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Export Processing Zone ===\nTianjin Export Processing Zone is one of the first 15 export processing zones approved by the State Council on April 27, 2000. This is a special enclosed zone where the Customs conduct 24-hour administration on commodities transported into and out of the zone and relevant places. The central government granted this special economic zone special preferential policies to attract enterprises in the business of processing and trade to invest in the zone. Tianjin Export Processing Zone is located to the northeast of TEDA with a planned area of 2.54 km2 (0.98 sq mi). The area developed in the first phase is 1 m2. A permanent wall is built to separate export processing zone and non-export processing zone.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Airport Economic Area ===\nTianjin Airport International Logistics Zone is jointly invested by Tianjin Port Free Trade Zone and Tianjin Binhai International Airport.

By the end of 2008, the zone has 2068 corporations and has 5 industries there including new materials, oil manufacturing, modern machinery manufacturing, and electronic information.\n\n\n=== Tianjin Nangang Industrial Zone ===\nA heavy and chemical industry base and harbor; an important part of the \"dual-city, dual-harbor\"space development strategy of Tianjin, a demonstration zone of circular economy. The total planned area of Nangang Industrial Zone is 200 km2 (77 sq mi), of which the terrestrial area is 162 km2 (63 sq mi).\n\n\n=== Agriculture ===\nFarmland takes up about 40% of Tianjin Municipality's total area. Wheat, rice, and maize are the most important crops. Fishing is important along the coast.\n\n\n=== Resources ===\nTianjin Municipality also has deposits of about 1 billion tonnes of petroleum, with Dagang District containing important oilfields. Salt production is also important, with Changlu Yanqu being one of China's most important salt production areas. Geothermal energy is another resource of Tianjin. Deposits of manganese and boron under Tianjin were the first to be found in China.\n\n\n=== Binhai New Area ===\nTianjin Binhai New Area (TBNA) is located in the juncture of the Beijing-Tianjin City Belt and the Circum-Bohai City Belt. It is the gateway to North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. Lying in the center of Northeast Asia, it is the nearest point of departure of the Eurasian Continental Bridge.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAt the end of 2009, the population of Tianjin Municipality was 12.28 million, of which 9.8 million were residential holders of Tianjin hukou (permanent residence). Among Tianjin permanent residents, 5.99 million were urban, and 3.81 million were rural.

There are also 51 out of the 55 minor Chinese ethnic groups living in Tianjin. Major minorities include Hui, Koreans, Manchus, and Mongols.\n\nThis excludes members of the People's Liberation Army in active service.\n\n\n== Media ==\nTianjin People's Broadcasting Station is the major radio station in Tianjin. Broadcasting in nine channels, it serves most of North China, part of East and Northeast China, reaching an audience of over 100 million.

There are also three English-language magazines: Jin, Tianjin Plus and Business Tianjin, mostly directed at ex-pats resident in the city.\n\n\n=== Previous newspapers ===\nThe first German newspaper in northern China, Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, was published in Tianjin.In 1912 Tianjin had 17 Chinese-language newspapers and 5 daily newspapers in other languages; none of the newspapers in the Tianjin district were trade papers. Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News). Newspapers from Beijing published in Tianjin included Pei Ching Jih Pao, Peking Daily News, and Le Journal de Peking.In 1930, the newspaper Deutsch-Mandschurische Nachrichten moved from Harbin to Tianjin and changed its name to the Deutsch-Chinesische Nachrichten.\n\n\n=== Censorship capital ===\nMore and more, China's leading Internet information providers (usually located in Beijing), including social network Sina Weibo, Douban and the online video website Sohu, tend to relocate their censorship departments to Tianjin, where labor costs are cheaper than Beijing, as censorship is a kind of labor-intensive work. In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived.

Located in Binhai Economic Zone, a national new economic zone of China, Tianjin harbor is the port of call of international cruises visiting the wider area, including Beijing.\n\n\n=== Trams ===\n\nTianjin's harbor area of Binhai/TEDA has a modern, high speed rubber tired tram system, which is the first of its kind in China and Asia. Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.

The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. In January 2007, the station began another long-term restructuring project to modernize the facility and as part of the larger Tianjin transport hub project involving Tianjin Metro lines 2, 3, and 9 as well as the Tianjin-Beijing High-speed rail.\nTianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also major railway stations in Tianjin. There is also Tanggu railway station is located in the important port area of Tanggu District, and Binhai railway station and Binhai North railway station located in TEDA, to the north of Tanggu. There are several other railway stations in the city that do not handle passenger traffic. Construction on a Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail began on July 4, 2005 and was completed by August 2008.\nThe following rail lines go through Tianjin:\n\nJingshan Railway, from Beijing to Shanhai Pass\nJinpu Railway, from Tianjin to Pukou District, Nanjing\nJinji Railway, from Tianjin urban area to Ji County, Tianjin\nJinba Railway, from Tianjin to Bazhou, Hebei\nThe inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system: Cxxxx (C stands for interCity).

Like with most cities in China, many roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four cardinal directions.\nTianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is the closest thing to a highway-level ring road, although traffic is often chaotic.\n\nInner Ring Road (neihuan)\nMiddle Ring Road (zhonghuan)\nOuter Ring Road (waihuan)Tianjin's roads often finish in dao (Chinese: \u9053; lit.: 'avenue'), xian (simplified Chinese: \u7ebf; traditional Chinese: \u7dda; lit.: 'line'). These are most often used for highways and through routes. The terms lu (Chinese: \u8def; lit.: 'road'). Jie (Chinese: \u8857; lit.: 'street') are rare. As Tianjin's roads are rarely in a cardinal compass direction, jing (simplified Chinese: \u7ecf; traditional Chinese: \u7d93; lit.: 'avenue') roads and wei (simplified Chinese: \u7eac; traditional Chinese: \u7def; lit.: 'avenue') roads often appear, which attempt to run more directly north\u2013south and east\u2013west, respectively.\nThe following seven expressways of China run in or through Tianjin:\n\nJingjintang Expressway, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District / TEDA\nJinghu Expressway, from Jinjing Gonglu Bridge to Shanghai (together with Jingjintang Expressway, this is the expressway from Beijing to Shanghai)\nJingshen Expressway, through Baodi District on its way from Beijing to Shenyang\nTangjin Expressway, from Tanggu District, Tianjin, to Tangshan, Hebei\u2014known in Tianjin as the Jintang Expressway\nBaojin Expressway, from Beichen District, Tianjin, to Baoding, Hebei\u2014known in Tianjin as the Jinbao Expressway\nJinbin Expressway, from Zhangguizhuang Bridge to Hujiayuan Bridge, both within Tianjin\nJinji Expressway, from central Tianjin to Jixian CountyThe following six China National Highways pass through Tianjin:\n\nChina National Highway 102, through Ji County, Tianjin on its way from Beijing to Harbin\nChina National Highway 103, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District\nChina National Highway 104, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Fuzhou\nChina National Highway 105, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Macau\nChina National Highway 112, circular highway around Beijing, passes through Tianjin Municipality\nChina National Highway 205, from Shanhaiguan, Hebei, through Tianjin Municipality, to Guangzhou\n\n\n== Religion ==\nResidents of Tianjin participate in indigenous religions, such as the veneration of the goddess Mazu. In addition, Tianjin has a Buddhist Temple of Great Compassion, a Catholic St. Joseph's Cathedral (Laoxikai Church), a Catholic Our Lady of Victory Church (Wanghailou Church). A Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin exists. According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 1.51% of the city's population. Tianjin has been described as a historically \"strong center\" of Islam in China. Northwestern Tianjin is traditionally the location of the Muslim quarter of the city, where they have lived for centuries near the city's huge Great Mosque, Qingzhen si, founded in 1703. Other mosques include the Dahuoxiang Mosque.\n\n\n== Sports ==\nSports teams based in Tianjin include:\nChinese Super League\n\nTianjin TEDA F.C.\nTianjin Tianhai F.C.

Additionally, Tianjin will be one of the host cities for both the 2021 FIFA Club World Cup and the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.\nSince 2014, a WTA international tennis tournament has taken place in Tianjin every year at the Tuanbo International Tennis Center.\n\n\n== Martial arts ==\nTogether with Beijing, Tianjin had been for many centuries considered a center for traditional Chinese martial arts. Many past and present masters of arts such as Bajiquan, Pigua Zhang, Xing Yi Quan, Bagua Zhang and others lived or are living in the city. The districts most famous for martial arts in the city are Hong Qiao and Nankai, and martial artists abound in public green spaces such as Xigu Park and the Tianjin Water Park.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nUnder the National Ministry of Education:\n\nNankai University (founded 1919, one of the most prestigious universities in China)\nTianjin University (founded 1895, oldest university in China)Under the municipal government:\n\nTianjin Academy of Fine Arts\nTianjin Agricultural College\nTianjin Chengjian University\nTianjin Conservatory of Music\nTianjin Foreign Studies University\nTianjin Institute of Physical Education\nTianjin Medical University\nTianjin Normal University\nTianjin Polytechnic University\nTianjin University of Commerce\nTianjin University of Finance & Economics\nTianjin University of Science & Technology\nTianjin University of Technology\nTianjin University of Technology and Education\nTianjin University of Traditional Chinese MedicineUnder the national Civil Aviation Authority:\n\nCivil Aviation University of ChinaUnder the government of Hebei Province:\n\nHebei University of Technology (founded 1903, the earliest institute of technology in China)Foreign institutions:\n\nThe Florida International University Tianjin Center, opened in 2006 as a cooperative venture between the municipal government and the Miami-based university.\nThe Great Wall MBA Program Oklahoma City University Meinders School of Business, established in 1986 on the campus of Tianjin University of Finance & Economics.\nRaffles Design Institute Tianjin is a joint-project between Tianjin University of Commerce, Boustead College and Raffles Design Institute, Singapore.Private:\n\nBoustead CollegeNote: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== High schools ===\n\nTianjin Nankai High School (\u5357\u5f00\u4e2d\u5b66)\nTianjin No.21 High School (\u5929\u6d25\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5341\u4e00\u4e2d\u5b78): Tianjin No. 21 High School, formerly Fahan College (\u6cd5\u6f22\u5b78\u5802; 'French\u2013Chinese (language) College'), was founded in 1895.

        "wiki": "Tianjin ([t\u02b0j\u025b\u0301n.t\u0255\u00edn] (listen)), alternately romanized as Tientsin, is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China on the shore of the Bohai Sea. It is one of the nine national central cities in Mainland China, with a total population estimated at 15,621,200 in 2016. Its built-up (or metro) area, made up of 12 central districts (all but Baodi, Jizhou, Jinghai and Ninghe), was home to 12,491,300 inhabitants in 2016 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro) and 11th-most populous city proper.It is governed as one of the four municipalities under the direct administration of Chinese central government and is thus under direct administration of the State Council.  Tianjin borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality, bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea. Part of the Bohai Economic Rim, it is the largest coastal city in northern China.\nIn terms of urban population, Tianjin is the fourth largest in China, after Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in Mainland China. The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a major seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government. Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. At that time,  numerous European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, many of which are well-preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and Tangshan earthquake, but recovered from 1990s. Nowadays Tianjin is a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the old city) located along the Hai River, which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal; and Binhai, an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the old city, on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. As of the end of 2010, around 285 Fortune 500 companies have set up base in Binhai. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan.\n\n\n== Name ==\nTianjin is the pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters \u5929\u6d25, which mean \"Heavenly Ford\" or \"Ford of Heaven\".\nThe origin of the name is obscure. One folk etymology is that it was an homage to the patriotic Chu poet Qu Yuan, whose \"Li Sao\" includes the verse \"... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ...\" (\u671d\u767c\u8ed4\u65bc\u5929\u6d25\u516e, zh\u0101o f\u0101r\u00e8n y\u00fa Ti\u0101nj\u012bn x\u012b). Another is that it honors a former name of the girl, a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui. A third is that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin. The most common are that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming, who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew the Jianwen Emperor.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe land where Tianjin is located today was created in between 900-1300 CE by sedimentation of various rivers entering the sea at Bohai Gulf, including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in this area at one point. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin begins to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gains importance during the Yuan dynasty. Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a prime location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty. It became a center of commerce and prosperity by the 17th century.\n\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911) Tianjin Prefecture or Zhou (\u5dde) was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later it was upgraded to an urban prefecture or Fu (\u5e9c) before becoming a relay station (\u99d0\u5730) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili.\n\n\n=== Opening up as a treaty port ===\n\nIn 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong flying the British flag and suspected of piracy, smuggling, and of being engaged in the opium trade. They captured 12 men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin were signed, which opened Tientsin (Tianjin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, and Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France, and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia, and even by countries without Chinese concessions such as Austria-Hungary, Italy and Belgium, in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin, each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. These nations left many architectural reminders of their rule, notably churches and thousands of villas.\n\nThe presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one of the most serious violent incidents to date was the Tianjin Church Incident. In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (Church Our Lady's Victories), in Tianjin, built by French Roman Catholic missionaries, was accused of the kidnapping and brainwashing of Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a showdown at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The furious protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate and killed eighteen foreigners including ten French nuns, the French consul himself, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident.\nIn 1885 Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy (\u5929\u6d25\u6b66\u5099\u5b78\u5802) for Chinese army officers with German advisors, as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. The academy was to serve Anhui Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematic and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German officers. Another program was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new army officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese Classics and history were taught at the school. Exams were administered to students. The instruction for Tianjin Military Academy was copied at the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. The 'maritime defense fund' supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy. The Tianjin Military Academy in 1886 adopted as part of its curriculum the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui. Among its staff was Yinchang.\n\nIn June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of much of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang, and were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks.\n\nIn July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tientsin. This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russian, British, Japanese, German, French, American, Austro-Hungarian, and Italian). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902 when the city was returned to Qing control. Eminent Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council.\n\nWestern nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained under strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I, the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured and held as Prisoners of War by Allied Forces while the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison in 1918. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines.\nBecause of the rapid development of industry, commerce and finance, Tientsin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tientsin was the provincial capital of Hopeh, after which it was reestablished as a municipality.\nGarrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall, the \"architect of victory\" in World War II when he was the United States Army Chief of Staff, served at Tianjin in the 1920s as Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew this unit in 1938 and a US presence was maintained only by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing.\n\n\n=== Second Sino-Japanese War ===\nOn July 30, 1937, Tianjin fell to Japan, as part of the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese for the most part respected foreign concessions until 1941, when the American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, there occurred a major crisis in Anglo-Japanese relations with the Tientsin Incident. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded the British concession over the refusal of the British authorities to hand over to the Japanese six Chinese who had assassinated a locally prominent Japanese collaborator, and had taken refuge in the British concession. For a time, the 1939 crisis appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the maltreatment by the Japanese Army of British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in the British press. The crisis ended when the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the current crisis in Europe that it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee, a puppet state based in Beijing.\nOn August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941 the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before this could be accomplished, the Japanese attacked the United States. The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded it to Wang Jingwei's Japan-controlled puppet state. Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II.\n\n\n=== Post World War II ===\n\nIn the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting.  The Communists took Tianjin on January 15, 1949.\nFrom 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the \"Great Leap Forward\" and Tianjin's good industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province and Hebei Province was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a large number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, adversely affecting Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to \"preparation, preparation for disasters\", and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated the provincial capital to Baoding, and the CPC Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so far. In April 1970, in the event that the Central Government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project on the basis of the name of the channel, and build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin.\n\nOn July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake, Tianjin was affected by the shock waves and suffered major loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River and is used to supply water for Beijing, however the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty in the use of water in Tianjin. In the same year, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water use in Tianjin and attract talented individuals to the city's academic centers.\n\nIn 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone's economy began to develop rapidly, However, the overall development speed of Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its strategic industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area with the Tianjin Port as the core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee was convened. The meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening up of the Binhai New Area into the \"Eleventh Five-Year Plan\" and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an \"international port city, a northern economic center, and an \"ecological city\". Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the \"State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area\" was announced and clearly stated: \"In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area.\nIn August 2008, China's first high-speed railway, the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour was opened. In August 2008 Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games. In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos) began to be established in Tianjin and is held every two years. In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked.\nIn October 2013, Tianjin hosted the East Asian Games, which was the first time Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event. In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy. Tianjin was positioned as \"National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area\". In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, and the water availability in Tianjin improved. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank, the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. On August 12, 2015, a major fire and explosion accident occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port, causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nTianjin is located along the west coast of the Bohai Gulf, looking out to the provinces Shandong and Liaoning across those waters, bordered by Beijing 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest, and is surrounded on all sides by Hebei, with the exception of its eastern border,  the Bohai Sea. With a latitude ranging from 38\u00b0 34' to 40\u00b0 15' N, and longitude ranging from 116\u00b0 43' to 118\u00b0 04' E, the total area is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). There is 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. It lies at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China, which connects with the Yellow River and Yangtze River. The municipality is generally flat, and swampy near the coast, but hilly in the far north, where the Yan Mountains intrude into northern Tianjin. The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak (\u4e5d\u9876\u5c71) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei, at an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft).\nThe Hai River forms within Tianjin Municipality at the confluence of the Ziya River (\u5b50\u7259\u6cb3), Daqing River (\u5927\u6e05\u6cb3), Yongding River, North Grand Canal, and South Grand Canal, and enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality, as well in Tanggu District. Major reservoirs include the Beidagang Reservoir in the extreme south (in Dagang District) and the Yuqiao Reservoir in the extreme north in Ji County.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nTianjin has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen BSk bordering on Dwa). It has a four-season, monsoon-influenced climate, typical of East Asia, with cold, windy, very dry winters reflecting the influence of the vast Siberian anticyclone, and hot, humid summers, due to the monsoon. Spring in the city is dry and windy, occasionally seeing sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert, capable of lasting for several days. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from \u22123.4 \u00b0C (25.9 \u00b0F) in January to 26.8 \u00b0C (80.2 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.9 \u00b0C (55.2 \u00b0F). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 48% in July to 61% in October, the city receives 2,522 hours of bright sunshine annually. Having a low annual total precipitation of 511 millimeters (20.1 in), and nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid zone, with parts of the municipality being humid continental (K\u00f6ppen BSk/Dwa, respectively).Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221222.9 \u00b0C (\u22129 \u00b0F) to 40.5 \u00b0C (105 \u00b0F).\n\n\n=== Measures to improve air quality ===\nIn May 2014, the city's administration enacted new laws in an attempt to lower the city's pollution levels. These measures included several restrictions on days of severe pollution; halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities.\n\nForeign-born professional sportsmen have made statements regarding Tianjin's air quality, citing it as an impediment to athletic activity and being thick enough to \"taste\".\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nTianjin is divided into 16 county-level divisions, which are all districts.\n\nIn addition, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA) is not a formal level of administration, but nevertheless enjoys rights similar to a regular district. At the end of 2017, the total population of Tianjin is 15.57 million.[3]\n\nThese districts and counties are further subdivided, as of December 31, 2004, into 240 township-level divisions, including 120 towns, 18 townships, 2 ethnic townships and 100 subdistricts.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nThe politics of Tianjin is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in the mainland China.\nThe Mayor of Tianjin is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Tianjin. Since Tianjin is a municipality, the Communist Party of China Municipal Committee Secretary is colloquially termed the \"Tianjin CPC Party chief\".\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nTianjin's GDP reached 1.572 trillion yuan in 2014, an increase of 10.0 percent over 2013. The city of Tianjin recorded China's highest per-capita GDP with $17,126, followed by Beijing with $16,278 and Shanghai with $15,847.\n\nMajor industries include petrochemical industries, textiles, car manufacturing, mechanical industries, and metalworking.

Of the foreign language newspapers, three were in English and one each was in French and German. Newspapers from Tianjin published in Tianjin included China Critic, Peking and Tientsin Times, The China Times,Tageblatt f\u00fcr Nordchina, L'Echo de Tientsin, China Tribune, Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), Min Hsing Pao, and Jih Jih Shin Wen Pao (Tsientsin Daily News).

In fact, Tianjin has become the censorship capital of Chinese Internet.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nThe city has many sights; its streetscapes \u2013 an assemblage of historic nineteenth \u2013 and early twentieth-century European architecture, juxtaposed with the concrete and glass monoliths of contemporary China \u2013 are its most engrossing attraction. Though wide swaths of the city are being redeveloped, much of the colonial architecture has been placed under protection, and the shopping opportunities, especially for antiques, just about justify a day-trip from the capital, an hour away by train.\nIn the nineteenth century, the port city caught the attention of the seafaring Western powers, who used the boarding of a British ship by Chinese troops as an excuse to declare war. With well-armed gunboats, they were assured of victory, and the Treaty of Tianjin, signed in 1856, gave the Europeans the right to establish nine concessionary bases on the mainland, from which they could conduct trade and sell opium. These concessions, along the banks of the Hai River, were self-contained European fantasy worlds: the French built elegant ch\u00e2teaux and towers, while the Germans constructed red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions between the indigenous population and the foreigners exploded in the Tianjin Incident of 1870, when a Chinese mob attacked a French-run orphanage, and again during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, after which the foreigners leveled the walls surrounding the old Chinese city to enable them to keep an eye on its residents.\nThe dense network of ex-concession streets south and west of the central train station, and south of the Hai River, now constitute the areas of most interest to visitors. Unmistakably remarkable are the ch\u00e2teaux of the French concession, which now make up the downtown district just south of the river, as well as the imposing mansions the British built east of here. Farther east, also south of the river, the architecture of an otherwise unremarkable district has a sprinkling of austere German construction.\n\n\n== Landmarks and attractions ==\n\nAstor Hotel\nBinjiang Avenue shopping street\nDrum Tower\nFive Main Avenues\nFormer Concessions in Tianjin\nTianjin Italian Style Town\nHai River Park\nLuzutang Boxer Rebellion Museum\nMemorial Hall to Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao\nNanshi Cuisine Street\nPeople's Park\nSt. Joseph's Cathedral of Tianjin\nTemple of Confucius Wen Miao\nTemple of Great Compassion\nCentury Clock\nTianjin Ancient Culture Street\nYuhuangge Taoist Temple\nTianjin Eye\nTianjin Museum\nTianjin Binhai Library\nTianjin Art Gallery\nTianjin Natural History Museum\nTianjin Olympic Center Stadium, also known as \"The Water Drop\"\nTianjin Radio and Television Tower\nTianjin Water Park\nTianjin World Financial Center\nTianjin Zoo\nYangliuqing (including Shi Family Grand Courtyard)\nPorcelain House\nNankai University\nNankai Middle School\nTianjin UniversitySights outside the old city urban core area, but within the municipality, including Binhai/TEDA:\n\nHuangya Pass, a section of the Great Wall of China\nMount Panshan\nSino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city\nSoviet Aircraft Carrier Kiev\nTaku Forts\nTEDA Football Stadium, home stadium of Chinese Super League team Tianjin Teda F.C.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nPeople from Tianjin speak the Tianjin dialect of Mandarin, from which it is derived.

Constructed in 2006, this marked a return of the tram to Tianjin, which once had an extensive standard steel-wheeled tramway network. The original Tianjin tram network was constructed by a Belgian company in 1904 and opened in 1906. It was the first citywide tramway system in China. It closed in 1972.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\n\nThe Tianjin Metro is formerly operated by two companies, Tianjin Metro General Corporation and Tianjin Binhai Mass Transit Development Company. However, in 2017, the two companies merged as Tianjin Rail Transit Group Corporation. They are currently under heavy expansion from five to nine lines. Six lines are currently operating both in the City and the Binhai area. As of April 2019, the entire network of Tianjin Metro has 155 stations and 6 lines.\nConstruction work on the Tianjin Metro started on July 4, 1970. It was the second metro to be built in China and commenced service in 1984. The total length of track was 7.4 kilometers (5 mi). The metro service was suspended on October 9, 2001 for reconstruction. The original line is now part of Line 1 of the new metro system. It was reopened to the public in June 2006. The track was extended to 26,188 km (16,272.469 mi) and there are a total of 22 stations.

The station was later moved to Laolongtou (simplified Chinese: \u8001\u9f99\u5934; traditional Chinese: \u8001\u9f8d\u982d; pinyin: L\u01ceol\u00f3ngt\u00f3u) on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position.

The Great Wall actually consists of numerous walls\u2014many of them parallel to each other\u2014built over some two millennia across northern China and southern Mongolia. The most extensive and best-preserved version of the wall dates from the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) and runs for some 5,500 miles (8,850 km) east to west from Mount Hu near Dandong, southeastern Liaoning province, to Jiayu Pass west of Jiuquan, northwestern Gansu province. This wall often traces the crestlines of hills and mountains as it snakes across the Chinese countryside, and about one-fourth of its length consists solely of natural barriers such as rivers and mountain ridges. Nearly all of the rest (about 70 percent of the total length) is actual constructed wall, with the small remaining stretches constituting ditches or moats. Although lengthy sections of the wall are now in ruins or have disappeared completely, it is still one of the more remarkable structures on Earth. The Great Wall was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987.Great Wall of ChinaGreat Wall of China, near Beijing.\u00a9 Digital Vision/Getty ImagesGreat Wall of ChinaGreat Wall of China, eastern Asia, designated a World Heritage site in 1987.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.Large parts of the fortification system date from the 7th through the 4th century bce. In the 3rd century bce Shihuangdi (Qin Shihuang), the first emperor of a united China (under the Qin dynasty), connected a number of existing defensive walls into a single system. Traditionally, the eastern terminus of the wall was considered to be Shanhai Pass (Shanhaiguan) in eastern Hebei province along the coast of the Bo Hai (Gulf of Chihli), and the wall\u2019s length\u2014without its branches and other secondary sections\u2014was thought to extend for some 4,160 miles (6,700 km). However, government-sponsored investigations that began in the 1990s revealed sections of wall in Liaoning, and aerial and satellite surveillance eventually proved that this wall stretched continuously through much of the province. The greater total length of the Ming wall was announced in 2009.ShanhaiguanThe Great Wall of China at Shanhaiguan, Hebei province, China.Daniel Ng ",

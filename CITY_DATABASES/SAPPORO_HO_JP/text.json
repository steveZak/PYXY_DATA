        "wiki": "The Sapporo Snow Festival (\u3055\u3063\u307d\u308d\u96ea\u307e\u3064\u308a, Sapporo Yuki-matsuri) is a festival held annually in Sapporo, Japan, over seven days in February. Odori Park, Susukino, and Tsudome are the main sites of the festival.\nIn 2007 (57th Festival), about two million people visited Sapporo to see the hundreds of snow statues and ice sculptures at the Odori Park and Susukino sites, in central Sapporo, and at the Satoland site. An International Snow Sculpture Contest has been held at the Odori Park site since 1974, and 14 teams from various regions of the world participated in 2008.The subject of the statues varies and often features an event, famous building or person from the previous year. For example, in 2004, there were statues of Hideki Matsui, the famous baseball player who at that time played for the New York Yankees. A number of stages made out of snow are also constructed and some events including musical performances are held. At the Satoland site, visitors can enjoy the long snow and ice slides as well as a huge maze made of snow. Visitors can also enjoy a variety of regional foods from all over Hokkaid\u014d at the Odori Park and Satoland sites, such as fresh seafood, potatoes and corn, and fresh dairy products.Every year the number of statues displayed is around 400 in total. In 2007, there were 307 statues created at the Odori Park site, 32 at the Satoland site and 100 at the Susukino site. A good view of the creations can be had from the TV Tower at the Odori Park site.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Snow Festival began as a one-day event in 1950, when six local high school students built six snow statues in Odori Park. In 1955 the Japan Self-Defense Forces from the nearby Makomanai base joined in and built the first massive snow sculptures, for which the Snow Festival has now become famous. Several snow festivals existed in Sapporo prior to the Sapporo Snow Festival, however, all of these were suspended during World War II.On February 4, 1966, a flight from Sapporo to Tokyo crashed into Tokyo Bay killing all 126 passengers and 7 crew on board. Many of the passengers were returning to Tokyo after visiting the snow festival. Owing to the Energy crisis of 1974, snow statues were built using drums. This was due to the shortage of gasoline caused by the crisis and many of the trucks used to carry snow to the site were unavailable. In the same year, the International Snow Statue Competition started and since that year many snow statues built by teams from other countries have featured; especially from sister cities of Sapporo such as Munich.In years when the accumulated snowfall is low, the Self-Defense Force, for whom participation is considered a training exercise, brings in snow from outside Sapporo. The Makomanai base, one of three main sites from 1965, hosted the largest sculptures, with an emphasis on providing play space for children. Use of the Makomanai site was suspended in 2005 and moved to the Sapporo Satoland site located in Higashi-ku from 2006. In 2009, the Satoland site was moved to the Tsudome (\u3064\u3069\u30fc\u3080, Tsud\u014dmu, Sapporo Community Dome) site. The Tsudome, located close to the Sapporo Satoland, is a dome for multiple sports events.Nakajima Park was established as one of the festival sites in 1990. However, it was removed as a site in 1992. The third site, known as the Susukino Ice Festival (\u3059\u3059\u304d\u306e\u6c37\u306e\u796d\u5178, Susukino K\u014dri no Saiten), is situated in the night-life district of Susukino and includes predominantly ice carvings. The site was approved as one of the festival sites in 1983. Every year, the Susukino Queen of Ice, a female beauty contest, is held at the site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWinter festival\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website  (in English)",

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River.

Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues.

          "One of Hokkaido's historically significant sites and established a Hokkaido Heritage site in 2004, it is the only beer museum in Japan and one of the most beautiful buildings. With its famous red brick and perfectly stacked up beer barrels near the entrance it is indeed one of a",
          "This is certainly a well organised and presented 'museum'. The displays have nearly everything in English and are thoughtfully laid out to take you through the history of the brewery - a more fascinating story than I expected. It's this history that makes the visit worthwhile",

          "Your visit to Sapporo will not be complete with a visit to the Sapporo Beer Museum, eventhough you are not a beer fan. The museum building has an impressive red brick exterior and was a beer factory. The museum is well laid out with easy to see displays. It is a simple museum",
          "Get the free tour. Take time to read all the captions in the museum displays. Best of all, go to the tasting room and order the tasting menu of Sapporo beer. Order cheese on the side. Enjoyable experience!!!",
          "Sapporo Beer is very well-known in Japan, some think it's the best beer in the country. Hokkaido's pure water is said to account for the clean finish. You will see how the beer is made, and you can also get a good meal to go with it. We enjoyed out trip to the beer factory",
          "Just a 200 Yen bus journey from the JR station so easy to reach. The guided tours are in Japanese but there's free entry and sheets in English to tell you the history of beer making in Hokkaido, afterwards relax and sample some of the beers on offer ....",

          "The museum is half about beer and half about the industry development in Sapporo (kaitakushi). One of the major industry they tried to grew was beer. The development part was very interesting to me. Its also interesting to see the history of beer in Japan.",

          "Close to the station and something to do in Sapporo, the beer museum is free (for a self-guided tour) and with English place cards on the side of each display, it\u2019s not too bad! Something different to do and interesting to learn about the history of Sapporo Beer. Recommend if",
          "Very pretty building and grounds but not much to see in regards to museum. Tells the history of the company but nothing about the brewing process. The tasting room was not open during our visit nor was the beer garden. Not what we had hoped for.",
          "Go during winter time when the ground is covered with snow if not it will just be a normal scene. Many people come here for the food and beer. Not cheap though.",

          "Had the BBQ lunch, it was very good, a lot a cabbage, padded out the meat slices. Tasty, but a bit on the expensive side for what you get. Beer is nice and the atmosphere in the dining hall is excellent.",
          "The beer is decent and traditional, which well deserves interest from tourists. However the compound offers no tour to beer making experience and set up and beer is given at no discount at all! The restaurants are nice outlets where, again, there is no discount beer. There are",

          "Not quite as interesting as it might have been. Given my (and many other other's) love of beer, I thought this would be more interesting. It was more of a history lesson than insight into the process and craft that drives the brewing process. Well worth having the 3 taster",
          "A definate on my Sapporo to do list, even though my wife wasn't so keen! We visited on the morning of the Eng v Tonga match in the Rugbh World Cup, so we were there for opening time at 10am. Althohgh there is a bus, we decided to walk from our hotel, which is a nice walk past",
          "We came from Virginia to visit and went for the free self guided tour some is in English and the flip charts are nice learning of the history and seeing how the labels changed throughout the years.. you can translate to English using Google translate and scanning the pictures.",
          "Booked our trip through Klook and we weren\u2019t disappointed. The food is endless, the service is swift and it\u2019s great value for money. Highly recommend oh and the beer is great too. There is some pretty good merchandise to purchase also.",
          "I decided to go here after seeing ads of Hokkaido only Sapporo Classic beer in the airport. The actual place is not that big. The museum is free. You can pay for a premium tour but it\u2019s only in Japanese. When you get back down stairs you\u2019ll be able to sample their 3 famous beers",
          "We went here after doing the Asahi Brewery Tour, the ordinary tour is free but for the Premium (as what they call it) you will pay 500 yen for a 50mins but it's all in Japanese. I tried asking if they have earphones (Translator) but unfortunately they don't. When you enter the",
          "An interesting place to understand some bits of the historical development of beer in Japan. There was guided tour, but we just did a quick walk around the exhibit areas. Paid beer tasting were available at the exit of the exhibit areas. We found the easiest way to get to the",
          "Worth seeing!!! The Sapporo Beer Museum is worth taking a look. My guess it would be better if you take their guided tour. Limited things to see on your own. We weren\u2019t able to get the guided tour as it was closed at that time.",
          "Museum will not take you long to go round but it is interesting. The beer tasting is good. 3 beers to taste, you buy your tasting ticket at the machine (the museum is free).",
          "A free small museum the shows the history and development of the Sapporo beer company. I loved the series of historical posters advertising the beer. It empties out to the tasting room. While you are there you MUST eat at the beer garden restaurant, no reservations during the",
          "Went to visit the museum. Advised that we basically had to have the \"all you can eat and drink lamb buffet\" and that we needed to go there immediately as there was very limited seating. Here are a number of points we experienced:- Was a huge hall that was about half full, The",
          "I went there to visit the museum and have dinner. I was told that I had to have a 2 hours wait. However, if I go to the Buffet right then, they just have 1 table, and only 1, left for me. We hurried over to the buffet restaurant. What a let down. Firstly, there is nothing",
          "Visited on a recent trip during Rugby World Cup. Expected it to be busier than it was, its a large place with several restaurants. We did the genghis khan all you can eat and drink cooking the lamb yourself, great value for money and good fun. Well worth a visit. We went from",
          "There are tours but we simply went there for beer tasting. 3 varieties available in tasting paddles - you can\u2019t go wrong. The grounds of the museum were lovely too. A good a spot on a sunny day! On a cold or wet day - still go though and enjoy the beer Sapporo is famous for.",
          "The #88 bus from Odori Park got us there. Free entry and the tasting for 3 midi beers was 800\u00a5 ($11 AUD). Very nice beer too. A number of restaurants around the place is good. I recommend booking for the flash one as it was sold out. Taxi to the Sapporo Dome to watch the Rugby",
          "Great little tour that is a very walkable distance from Sapporo station (about 15/20 mins). There\u2019s the option of a guided tour which does have an additional element, but because the museum isn\u2019t particularly extensive I can\u2019t imagine that it would add much. Because of the",
          "They have guided tours where they show you about the history of Sapporo beer and you can enjoy 2 types of beer. Their original and their first beer. The English tour is at 12:40/15:40 on every Wednesday. 500 JPY. You have to reserve and arrive before the tour starts. Definitely",
          "Not an operating distillery, but the iconic beer brand speaks for itself. distance to the main sapporo station is at a walkable distance otherwise a short subway ride should get you there. There are nice food places in the area as well.",
          "Grill sheep are recommended to eat with beer.Soft and good taste. There are buffet menu with reasonable price.",
          "The building was beautiful and very picturesque. When you enter, you can choose to do the free self tour or guided tour with fees. The guided tour will grant you access to the restricted area. I did the free one and quite satisfied. The museum is very informative and it",
          "It was free to enter and go around to learn more about the history since more than 100 years ago. I could read the facts at my own paced without feeling rushed by any crowds. At the end there was a shop (like usual) to get some snacks to bring home. And try some beer too.",
          "Take Bus 88, at the front of Tokyu Department Store and be taken directly to the Museum. The museum is very well staged and provides English translations of the history of Sapporo Beer. The surrounding gardens are beautiful. My partner especially enjoyed the Beer tasting.",
          "Very interesting. We tasted the whisky there, and tried a10 year old single caskmalt whisky. It was excellent\uff01it has a museum which explains the history of Nikka whisky. It also shows visitors how whisky is made. Very interesting",
          "... and I am :) We took the self guided tour because as mentioned in the other reviews, the guided tour is only in Japanese. In the museum, one would see a lot of static displays chronicling the curious history of the brewery. One of the more interesting display is the",
          "Interesting history of Sapporo Beer. We were not able to try their restaurant but we were able to drink their beers. If you go there, order Sapporo black label. It's better than the classic",
          "Advertised closes at 8 pm, but final drink service is at 6.30pm. Short in museum facts and features. A beer hall a the end which was ok. Nothing special.",
          "There\u2019s nothing worthy to see here. If you come here, it\u2019s better to go to eat in the restaurant. The food, barbecue type meal, is really delicious. So you don\u2019t have to waste your time to enter this musium.",
          "This is a beautiful building with great amenities like coin lockers and nice displays in English. The tour is only offered in Japanese. So we did the self guided tour thru the displays which after you go thru the free factory tour of Asahi, this just seems ok. They have a",
          "I'm a beer geek so was looking forward to this one. I found the museum well presented but very limited, how about a collection of labels and/or beer glasses? It was all a bit too commercial for me, you even had to punch your beer choice into a pre-pay machine. I got a better",
          "The museum is an interesting one which we can explore for free. Too bad when we finished the tour it was past 7pm and the beer tasting has closed. We didn't try the food but the restaurants look good,make sure you make reservation in advance as they are all full when we were",
          "In farness my review will be based on drinking in the museum bar and visiting the shop. Having said that the Muesum compound was really lovely to look at and they had on e agreat event whilst we were there of dancers etc. We had the sample tasting of 3 different beers, sat,",
          "We enjoyed the experience. The beer has 3 kinds and even if I am not a beer drinker, i happened to like it. I find it light and good. The tour of the museum is in Japanese. Then, we ate in the restaurant with unlimited lamb and beer quite pricey but it was worth the dining",
          "This is a self tour museum especially for foreign visitors and it is FOC but u gotto pay 800 yen to experience tasting 3 different type of Sapporo beer ... my favourite? I must say is the Sapporo black label!",

          "Hokkaido is the birthplace of beer in Japan. Learn about the history of beer in Japan & the process of beer making here. After viewing the exhibits, one can have beer tastings at a small fee. Easy Parking & Pleasant Grounds. Worth a visit!",
          "Learnt a lot of interesting facts about the history for Sapporo beer. Great snacks and samples of beer to try. Put on your must go to list.",
          "The food and drinks are much more attractive than the museum itself. History of the factory provided, information cards in several languages available for selfguiding tour. Sample of beers can be purchased for tasting.",
          "If you like beer this is a great little stop! There's English pamphlets available showcasing the long history of Sapporo Beer. There's free and guided tours available, we just did the free option and it was fine for us! The gift shop has some pretty cool unique Sapporo shirts",
          "The beer museum is not near any subway stops so we walked from the centre of the city. I was looking forward to seeing a bit of Sapporo beer history. I was a little dissappointed that the next tour was much later so we took the self guide option. It was fine, clear",
          "Interesting hour spent at Sapporo Beer Museum which is in lovely old red brick buildings. We didn`t have time to eat at the museum Beer Garden but others told us that it was terrific. At the end of our tour we did try the beer flight which was three glasses with current beer,",
          "Sapporo beer imo is the best beer in Japan. Come here to learn how it is made and you also get to sample their beers with a small fee. Do not bother with the paid tour unless you can understand Japanese",
          "Free entry beer museum but recommended to visit if you had 1-2 hrs to spare in Sapporo. The entire visit will take less than 1 hr and this museum is a short walk from Sapporo Main Station. Comfortable museum with restaurant and a bar ( where you can order the sapporo beer",

          "Not only a museum but also a restaurant. The museum has a beer tasting room the the beir Garten (beer garden) has some great food. Not open on Mondays found out the hard way. If your in Sapporo this is a must stop. Fast and friendly service and very tasty. The tours at the",
          "We did the \u201cfree\u201d self-tour which was not very interesting. I\u2019m sure it would\u2019ve been more informative with a guide. Not much to the museum though. We ate at its Lilac Restaurant/had the crab, cheese and rice tureen which was very good. Too bad the museum doesn\u2019t sell",
          "The museum is small and everything is in Japanese, but it was very fun and offered a beer tasting at the end for cheap. Worth the trip if you are in Sapporo. Sapporo black label (which we couldn't find in any conbinis) was surprisingly good!",
          "Such an intriguing and interesting place. As an avid beer fan, this place ticked all the right boxes. Great history and explanation to how Sapporo beer started off. Lovely beer hall to have a few brews afterwards too. Perfect way to spend a few hours whilst in Sapporo.",
          "The museum was really small and probably needs less than an hour to complete. Nothing much unless you're really interested in the history of Sapporo Beer. The entry is free so that's not too bad as it's not worth the money if we need to pay to get in. There is a for",
          "There's really not much to do here unless you are really keen on the history of Sapporo beer and as expected not much on offer for kids. Museum itself is fairly small and you'll breeze through fairly quickly. There's a choice of a free tour or premium paid tour. Main",
          "I recommend coming by in the fall since the leaves turning give it a great feeling. I took the free tour which was okay, just really short. If I could do it again I'd pay for the guided tour. The beer tasting and shops were good. I was tempted to do the bbq, but I had dinner",
          "Maybe we just came on the wrong day. The free tour was not very impressive and the beer hall was closed. We had a beer in the Garden Grill which was nice.",
          "The free tour museum is so so. I haven\u2019t tried the paid tour. You would save more money if you buy the beer set! It\u2019s pretty delicious. The beer goes really well with Gouda cheese. It was a great experience!",
          "we walked from Sapporo Station; after exiting on the north side, we followed along near the tracks until they veered away; coming to a dead end, we hung a left. After passing the Book Off / Hobby Off, we took a right and came to the entrance. It took about 20 minutes, even in",
          "Whether you are a beer enthusiast or only have a slight interest in beer, I would really recommend checking out this museum while in Sapporo. There is no separate admission fee for the exhibits, and the content ties in really well with some of the modernization developments",
          "I didn't think the visit was all that. This is Japan and everything should be in Japanese, so there really wasn't very much English to read or hear for that matter. The guided tours are all in Japanese as well as are most of the displays. The beer at the end was kind of cool.",
          "You can visit, it's free and a shuttle bus is available from and to the Sapporo station. The guide viait is only in Japanese, but everything is translated in English for the free tour. After the visit you can enjoy different beers (fares apply).",

          "We strolled around this small museum before heading to the beer garden for our dinner reservation. It's small but bigger than the Ebisu one in tokyo. Most of the descriptions are in japanese and we didn't feel the need to ask if there were any english aids at the reception.",

          "I'm not sure what the paid tour was like, I did the solo free tour and wandered around the museum. It was actually quite interesting reading up on the history of Sapporo Beer and how it came to be the beer it was today. I think this may be a tour that is better to do with a",
          "I walked to the Sapporo museum from Sapporo station, it took about 20 minutes and is very easy to reach. The buildings are very picturesque and on arrival will certainly warrant a few photos. I took the free tour of the museum, mainly because the premium tour is only available",
          "Went there pretty late so unfortunately, we missed the beer tasting as it is closed. The museum is free unless you want to join a guided tour. We walk around the museum. Most of the pictures and history is in Japanese. There is chinese, english and korean translations at the",
          "I visited the Sapporo once in 2014, and revisited it again in the Fall of 2018. I noticed they have renovated the museum quite a bit. For starters, the top floor of the exhibition hall has been converted into a screening area. Most of the exhibits are now on the middle floor",
          "Good place to walk around and know about how Sapporo beer came about. At the end of the tour, you can get a taste of the beer at the little pub. The little village around is nice to walk around too",
          "Beautiful building, great presentation on history of sapporo beer! It was snowing when we went and the atmosphere was ambient and lovely. Beer tasting was a nice experience for someone who drank beer for first time \ud83d\udc4d great photo opportunities",

          "As mentioned, you get to know the history of sapporo beer. There are 2 option , uou can either pay Yen500 per person to join the tour with tour guide or you can just learn and read on your own. After that you can get the beer.. pay at the vending machine first. The best is 3",

          "Visited the brewery and museum during a 3-day visit to Sapporo. The tour was a nice walkthrough of the brewery's history and how they produce the beer followed by a nice beer sampling that included some snacks. Note for visitors wishing to enjoy a full meal: the adjacent \"beer",
          "The free tour was nothing to shout about but it is a good place to kill some time before tasting the beers. At the end of the tour, you can purchase the much awaited beer. There are 3 kinds of beer and I found all to be smooth and nice. A good place to go to before the next",
          "There are two types of tours offered. We took the free self guided tour that took about 45 minutes and would give it a 3.5 rating. At the end of the tour you can buy Sapporo Classic Beer on tap. Apparently you can only get the \u201cClassic \u201c in Hokkaido. Some of us really liked",
          "Not the most extensive museum, but the Sapporo Beer Garten was a fun excursion. An easy journey by train, or a short taxi ride from central Sapporo - the museum caters mostly to Japanese tourists (there's not a lot of info in English) but the staff are very welcoming and will do",

          "Lovely grounds and atmosphere. Nice museum inside. They take good care of it. We did the free tour and that was informative enough. Do pay and buy the tasting menu beers by buying tokens from the machine and giving it at the counter where draft beer taps are. The tasting menu",
          "Japan in general does not go out of their way to cater to foreign tourists and the Sapporo Beer Museum shows exactly that. Their museum is all in Japanese, it's not worth going if you don't understand their language. There is no English translation, even their premium tour is",
          "I am positive that the museum has a lot to offer, but there were no tours in English. The display descriptions are laminated A4 papers laminated and hidden in little side pockets, so you had to search hard to find them. And then some of the descriptions were moved to the wrong",

          "The so-called museum is a joke. What you get to see are a few videos of the history of the beer and the factory. You don\u2019t get to see anything left from the past except s huge tank. The guided tour for a fee is conducted in Japanese only. You won\u2019t learn much besides the",

          "The original recipe of Sapporo beer was delicious. I love the building structure, the bricks, the layout, the history. There's a small souvenir store near the taxi/bus stand that's worth checking. We purchased packets of soup there made from corn, pumpkin; very delicious",
          "We probably chose the wrong day of the week and wrong time of day to go. It got pretty crowded especially riding the beer bus that got us to and from the museum. It's a well-kept, pretty complex of old brewery buildings on well-maintained grounds. There is also a shopping",
          "Greatly enjoyed the museum. We did the free tour where you just walk around and read off English placards. Afterwards there is a tasting room where beers are reasonably priced (\u00a5200). Would recommend the Genghis Khan (all you can eat lamb and vegetables) for \u00a52,900pp. Appears",

          "If you expect to experience the inner workings of a brewery, this ain't the place to visit. Some pictorials and gadgets that tell the history of the company - might be interesting if you are a fan of Sapporo beer. The beer tasting which you pay for by the way is not really worth",
          "Came here one afternoon. Did the free tour. Plenty in English to read so not to worry. Tasting room at the end offers 3 beer flight sample which was yummy. Easy access by bus. We walked there and bussed back to our hotel, which was also fine.",

          "If you like beer, it's worth a look around the Sapporo Beer Museum. You can enjoy a few hours of (japanese) beer knowledge, not everything is subtitled in english though. Also, I recommend a visit to the food court, you'll get a nice Jingisukan experience!",

          "We would have given this attraction 3.5 if that were an option. The Sapporo Beer Museum is set in a lovely building. Although small, it attempts to give a good overview of beer history in Japan -- which largely centered around the Sapporo company until post-WWII, when they were",
          "The museum is fairly difficult to get to as the only public transport there is by bus. Walking from the JR Sapporo Station is possible but will take you about 20 minutes, longer during winter. The Premier Tour is only available in Japanese. Foreigners would have to make do",

          "It's not the most exciting of tourist spots, but my friends and I really enjoy beer so this beer museum was in our to-do list early on. It's relatively small and we opted for the self-guided tour. We walked there and arrived at about 6pm. The building is beautifully lit when we",
          "I was anticipating actually watching the beer making process, unfortunately it is just a (small) museum with some history and facts on the Sapporo Beer brand. The positive note is you can get a sampler with 3 types of beer for 600 yen at the end, which is quite affordable for",
          "We did the self-guided tour, which takes you through several floors of the main building. You don't tour the factory, or see beer being made, which is why we rated this a three. Compared to the Yoichi Whiskey factory tour, this was not as engaging for kids nor as interesting for",

          "Very typical beer museum, but I like how the curator put it, and deep looking into understanding the history of Modern development of Hokkaido, marketing of the beer to customers to literature journal of the kind. Bored enough if you aren't a history or social studies lover. But",
          "As Sapporo beer is one of the most well-known beers in Japan, visiting this museum will give you a background idea of what Japanese people like and what makes the beer unique. The place is very clean and staffs were really friendly to us.",

        "wiki": "Moerenuma Park (\u30e2\u30a8\u30ec\u6cbc\u516c\u5712, Moerenuma K\u014den) is a municipal park in Sapporo, Japan. It has playground equipment, outdoor sports fields, and objects that are designed by Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese American artist. Visitors can enter the park and use the parking lot for free. Construction began in 1988; the park opened in 2005. It won a number of awards including the Good Design Award in 2002.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore the construction of Moerenuma Park, the place has been used as a garbage reclaimed ground since 1979. Under the Sapporo Circular Greenbelt Concept, a city planning project that aims at developing the urban areas of Sapporo with greenbelts and parks, construction began in 1982. Sapporo asked Isamu Noguchi to design the park.\nNoguchi's first visit to Sapporo was in March 1988, when the place was still used as a reclaimed ground in part. Impressed with the landscape and the northern skyline, Noguchi contracted the offer from Sapporo government and made the master plan of the park, which includes the concept of \"park that is considered to be one complete sculpture.\" On December 30 in the same year, however, right after making a miniature model of the planned park, Isamu Noguchi died of heart failure in New York City, and the park was constructed with his master plan from 1989.\nIn 1990, land reclamation of garbage was totally closed. It had 71.2 ha and 2,736,000 tons of garbage carried to the place until 1990.In 1997, Moerenuma Park made a park twinning agreement with the Bayfront Park in Miami, United States. The park won the Good Design Award in 2002, 11th Sapporo Urban Scenery Award in 2003, and Hokkaid\u014d Red Brick Architectural Award in 2004. The park was partly open during construction, and on July 1, 2005, the entire construction was completed (although it was initially planned to be complete in 2004). The Sapporo international art festival was held in 2014 and 2017.\n\n\n== Outline ==\nThe name \"Moerenuma\" (Moere marsh) is derived from the word \"Moyre pet\" in Ainu language, which means \"a slowly flowing river.\" Moere marsh was in the place long before the park was constructed. The official name of the marsh is Shinoro New River. It is said that river was made because of perpetual flood in the past. It currently connects to the Kariki New River. The Moere marsh is surrounding the whole area of the park ground.\nThe entire area of the park is 1,888,000 m\u00b2 including the Moere marsh, coming to a total cost of 27 billion yen. The park has 120 pieces of playground equipment, about 3,000 cherry trees, and the parking lots holds 1,500 vehicles. The construction is mainly supervised by Isamu Noguchi Foundation and George Sadao.\nThe biggest symbol of the park is a glass pyramid near the eastern entrance. The pyramid has the nickname \"Hidamari\", which means \"sunny spot\" in Japanese. The nickname was given in 2002 and selected from 2,340 applications. With a floor space of 5,328 m\u00b2, the pyramid has three floors and a roof overlooking a large part of the park. The top floor houses the gallery of Isamu Noguchi and the miniature model of the park. A restaurant and museum shop are on the ground floor. The pyramid has an air conditioning system to cool down inside in summer, using snow stored in a neighbouring storage building during winter. Hidamari is also used for workshops and events including the Prestigious International Conference on Music and Perception with a concert by John Kaizen Neptune in 2008 in the rooms on the ground and second floors.\nThe Tetra Mound, an object with triangle stainless steels (one of the creations of Isamu Noguchi) is placed in the western side. Several events have been held in the square close by. The Mt. Moere occupies large part of the park. It is 62 metres high, which enables visitors to overlook the landscape of the park and northern part of the Sapporo city. More playground equipment is near the Forest of Cherry Trees and the Moere Beach, which is a shallow pond open during summer.\nA 150-metre canal, the Aqua Plaza, is in the centre of the park, and the Sea Fountain is constructed near the canal. The fountain reaches 25 meters high when it jets out, and it is closed during winter. The monument called Music Shell is used as the musical venue. It is shaped to imitate two shells swelling up from the ground \u2014 as the name indicates.\nThe park contains sports grounds such as a tennis court, baseball field and athletic field. These are opened from April to November. Registration to use these facilities is required at the management office. Visitors can rent bicycles. In winter, as some facilities in closed; people can enjoy cross-country skiing in the park instead. Courses are set up, which enable visitors to view objects in the park whilst skiing. Cross-country skiing equipment is lent at the office in the glass pyramid.\n\n\n== Nearby ==\nClose to Moerenuma Park, there is the Sapporo Satoland \u2014 a theme park focusing on agriculture and one of the venues of the Sapporo Snow Festival. The Sapporo Community Dome, an indoor stadium which is often used as a venue for some sports events, and the Okadama Airport are close to the park.\n\n\n== Access ==\nHokkaido Chuo Bus (Higashi69 or Higashi79): 25 minutes from Kanj\u014d-D\u014dri-Higashi Station (T\u014dh\u014d Line) to 'Moere Koen Higashiguchi' bus stop, then a 10-minute walk to the Glass Pyramid.\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nofficial site\nMoerenuma Park - Land + Living (in English)\nMoerenuma Park - Images",

          "This is a huge public park and we wanted to visit the different attractions like the fountain, the hill and the Glass Pyramid. We underestimated our time. We came to the park around 4pm and by the time we walked up to the top of the hill, it was sunset already. The walk up",
          "This spot is far from the center of Sapporo city, it takes 50-minutes by the train and local bus. From the nearest bus stop 'Toyohata' it's a 15-minute walk to the center of the park. In this park, there are white birch trees, artificial hills and a pyramid of glass. You can",
          "This park took my breath away. It was quiet when I visited the park and it was so calming to walk around. Viewpoints from some sculptures were breathtaking. I would go back here in a heartbeat!",
          "Landscape park, the territory is pretty big, so it's a lot of walking or you can rent a bike on site. If you want to see it all - be ready to climb a lot of stairs.",
          "This park is famous as great sculptures park designed by Isamu Noguchi. I love this park since when I was child. It has beautiful mountains, sculptures and playgrounds For children. Unbelievably the entrance fee is nothing. Just free! A little bit far away from Sapporo",
          "This is a sculpture park designed by the American born artist of world renown; Isamu Noguchi. there are kids play areas, and fountain shows long and short (30 min and 15 min), there are also 30 tennis courts and a sports field. Built upon a landfill dump in a swamp, this is",
          "Such a chill place, with beautiful scenic views. Had lots of fun cycling around!! The tranquility I\u2019ve experienced is one that I can never forget.",
          "My fiance and I went here for sightseeing. We wanted to see snow on this area, however, most of the snow has melted because we visited in the closing month for winter season. Nevertheless, the views are great and fresh air awaits. We had alovely time while walking around.",
          "Wonderful, unique park dedicated to a talented artist. Went with my wife, sister, and mother who all enjoyed the experience for the landscape design and overall visit. We\u2019ve been to the Noguchi studio museum in Long Island City, NY and love his aesthetic and work. This is even",
          "The highlight of my trip to Sapporo. What a thoughtfully built park which engages all your senses! This is not to be missed even thought it is not easy to get to and not very clear to get instructions on either. I would recommend a taxi but given that Taxis are super",
          "This park is okay for a bike ride or view from the top of the hill. The best part is the fountain, which sprays in various patterns.",
          "This by far is one of my favorite places in Sapporo. It's a train, bus & a lot of walking away outside Sapporo but you're patience will be rewarded. Beautiful park!",
          "The first impression of the park from the internet was a cool looking park designed by Isamu Noguchi. Once I enter the park, I was delighted to find out that you can rent a bike to ride in the park. This park was huge with a few architectures to see. But for me, as I was",
          "We rented the inexpensive bikes at the park (200 yen for 2 hours) and took a self-guide tour through the park. Though we are average-sized, the bikes were too small. The birch forest to the west of the main entrance were breath-taking, the highlight of our visit",
          "We rented a bike for \u00a5200/2hours and it worthed every pennies of it. The landscape, clean air, relaxing atmosphere we could just escape from all the routine in our life momentarily. The restaurant inside the pyramid was a perfect setting. Close to Sapporo Sato Land Farm Park",
          "The place is nice, can ski very heavy snow. Like the environment, not far just need sit they city bus to reach. Many people come here for ski.",
          "For 200yen you can hire a bike for two hours to ride around the park, which is highly recommended as it's such a huge park to cover by foot. Weather permitting, it's quite a relaxing half day in a very calm setting.",
          "Free to enter. We rented bikes at very reasonable rate (200 yen for 2 hours) at the entrance and helped to move around, which saved our energy for walking up to various higher grounds for most charming views around. We enjoyed the 15 minutes fountain show. Check the schedule",
          "The place is bigger than I expected, and so green! The Isamu Noguchi Glass Pyramid is a must see. Can trail up to grass hills/slopes, nice small hikes. Lovely in summer!",
          "They have bike rentals for 200 yen and I learned how to bike here while admiring the architectural structures around the park! Great place for families to spend an afternoon in the park and to get a great view of Sapporo from the hills here.",
          "I went with my husband who is a wheelchair user. We went early June. Buses 69 and 79 from Kanjodori Higashi station go there. Both buses are wheelchair-friendly. Just tell or show the Japanese name of the place to the driver. The park is spacious. It is also",
          "Something for everyone! There are jungle gyms, mountains to climb, scultures to admire. If you are looking for a fun full morning or afternoon or both - moerenuma park is a lovely way to spend the day. There are multiple outdoor activities such as jungle gyms, scultures,",
          "I visited this park last week. There was still quite a bit of snow on the ground. I was only able to go inside the pyramid to look out but the restaurant, bike rentals and observation point were all closed (this was early afternoon). The bike rentals are closed during the winter",
          "It's a beautiful park, but it is difficult to get to, and in my opinion, it isn't worth the effort for a tourist, particularly if you have limited time available. If you have a lot of time, for sure, take the time to enjoy it and check it all out. There are a lot of other things",
          "It was a heavy snow storm when we were there. Our visit is to take picture , unfortunately it was very heavy snow rain , we waited for 2 hours inside the pyramide building , it was warm and very nice building . After waiting and took some picture around the building we decided",

          "Park is located in approx 20-30 mins bus (No. 69 or 79) from Kanjodori Higashi Station (Toho Subway line) which is a little remote from Sapporo Station. Get off Moerenuma Koen Higashiguchi stop (it means Moerenuma Park east exit) and walk 10-15 mins to the park entrance. It was",
          "The park is easily accessible but bus that is sharp on time. There different structures in the park and activities you can do around. Great place to spend 2 or 3 hours away from the city.",
          "Oct 13 At first glance I told our driver \"Seki\" to skip this park, but we needed a toilet stop. Upon further inspection this park is so futuristic and avant garde. The Glass Pyramid by the artist Noguchi is the centerpiece. It is part of a granite structure that could double",

          "It's very easy to navigate this park. The theme of this park evolve around pyramids. There is glass pyramid here and other pyramid hills. You can go in the glass pyramid but it's close on the first Monday of every month for maintenance. Bicycle rental can be found at the",
          "Having visited this park many years ago (even before it officially opened) I was delighted to return. A great place to bike/run/walk. Rolling hills that you can take at your own pace.",
          "This well-manicured park was built on a trash dumpsite, so it seems to get points for concept. But as far as a place to visit, it's sterile and hard to get to. Plusses are the fountain and wading pool in summer and cherry blossoms in spring. But honestly, I\u2019m not sure why",
          "This designed park is a bit of a way out of the city centre but it is well worth the visit. I went in July 2017 in the early evening and witnessed the sunset on the large mounds. There are a few landscaped hills, skate areas, sports courts, a baseball ground, tree planting",
          "Renting a bike was only 200 yen per person and I think made the scroll through the park much easier and enjoyable. The bikes had a self lock in each one, so it was very easy to leave the bike whenever we wanted to walk around. Great park!",
          "Travelers can easily go to this park via Chuo Bus No.69 or 79 from Kanjodori Higashi Station and return by No.68 from the park's east entrance. In summer, all family members or lovers can enjoy this park since there are several parts which fit for everyone; hills, lawn, mini",
          "Lots to do, i enjoyed the Bicycle art display on the side of the mountain. It was worth the drive to go here.",
          "We had to catch a train and bus to get out here, but it was worth the effort. Such a massive park, with some terrific sculptures and art works. So many people relaxing in the spring sun, on the grass and under the cherry blossom trees. Great place to just wander around, and",
          "With all the excellent, rich food that we've been having, we decided to include physical activity in today's venture. This took the form of renting Porocle bikes then heading out to Moerenuma, a pleasant 11km ride through eastern Sapporo, an area that is a mix of light industry,",
          "Moerenuma Park is an incredible mixed use public park that is suitable for all ages and interests. Mixing sculpture, architecture, public art, and diverse sensory experiences, it is a place that demands repeat visits in various seasons to enjoy the changing scenery. From the",
          "One of the nicest park I've been to! Don't expect flowers like furano though, everything is mostly a wide expanse of green. You can rent a bike and cycle there, but they are quite strict on closing time (last rental before 4? I think). Have a picnic there, climb to the top of",
          "The park is nice and filled with local people spending sunny days. We visited the park during the special decoration from gardeners around the city.",
          "We dedicated our only day in Sapporo to this Park. Great place to pedal with winds in your hair admiring 'manicured lawn' and artistically arranged trees. Best part : all for free (apart from the hired bikes). Recommended only if garden park/scenery is your cup of tea. Not",
          "Moerenuma Park is everything I expected and more. I am a Isamu Noguchi devotee. I have visited the museum in Queens, NYC, the sculpture garden in Mure on Shikoku, his dry garden in Santa Ana California. I own one of his modern classic coffee tables and a 6' Akari lamp and",
          "Our plan was to cycle around the park but we reached there too late. The bicycle kiosk closes at 5pm with the last rental accepted at 4pm. Nevertheless, we had a wonderful time walking around the park, climbing the hills and enjoying the sun while it sets.",
          "This park was a hidden gem in Sapporo. It was not on the top among the most popular tourist sites as it took some time to go there. However it was actually not too difficult or time consuming. I highly recommended people who could spare a day or half a day to go there. It was a",
          "Large open spaces/ lawns for kids to fly kites or play ball, green hills to climb and roll down, pyramids to climb, trees to picnic under - ideal for family fun but is it worth the 50 to 60 min journey from JR Sapporo station for the tourist? If you wish to see how brilliantly a",
          "My fianc\u00e9e and I came here as one of the location for our pre-wedding photography. This park is amazingly large with many cherry blossom and it's also a great place to ride bicycle. Peaceful environment, fresh air and beautify view especially from the top of the hill.",

          "Have been thinking to visit this Park for a long time. Finally I decided to make a visit one Sunday afternoon. I was impressed by the Glass Pyraimd. While you were inside, the clear and blue sky was on top of you and I like the view. This park is big and planted lot of Cherry",
          "Rent a bicycle near entrance of park. 200 yen for 2 hours. It is better to see the park vs walking. Climb the 222 steps up Mt Moere to catch the breeze at the top & a panoramic view of the park. Interesting feature on the architect of the park Izamu Noguchi.",
          "The park was designed by Japanese American artist Isamu Noguchi. Art installations abound, including manmade hills, streams, sculptures, and landscaping. Unlike in other countries, picnicing is encouraged both in and outdoors. The park is child and cycling friendly. It is a",

          "We visited in May 2017. Nice cool weather. We biked around, had picnic, climbed a hill. This is a nice outdoor place to bond with family, without gadgets!",
          "Was very excited to explore the park as it has such amazing reviews and is so well-designed. Because it was winter, was not expecting the bicycle renting experience, but was at least hoping to see a beautiful winter landscape. However, we went on a MONDAY, which is when the park",
          "The design of the park by Isamu Noguchi is intriguing. We loved viewing and going into the glass pyramidal structure to view, as well as walking among the few still blossoming cherry trees. Other areas, especially the huge grass hills looked interesting but we were on foot and",

          "Looking at pictures beforehand, it looks like just a nice park, maybe worth an hour on a lazy afternoon. But in person it's just beautiful. The scale is hard to grasp through pictures alone, and I wish we'd spent a little more time there. It definitely makes sense that they rent",
          "We enjoyed this park immensely! It is so huge you will need at least 3-4 hours to walk it! This park was designed by Isamu Noguchi. We have enjoyed his artwork in Kansas City & Washignton, DC. but this park surpasses everything we have seen before......His designs at this",

          "I went during spring/summer. It was raining, however, I enjoyed the whole thing there. Being person who a little artsy, this is a worth place to visit. Perhaps, it could be less crowded all time, this is a little unusual as compared to the Open Museum at Hakone. The landscape is",

          "Went there on Monday and so would like to remind you all that rental of snow sport equipment is close on that day. Luckily someone left their plastic sled therefore my kids able to slide down the snow sliding track. We went there by bus from a subway station. Cannot remember the",
          "Whatever season you visit Sapporo, be sure to check out Moerenuma Koen. It's absolutely gorgeous in the summer and is a fantastic bike ride. It has a cool musuem and the park has so much to offer for all ages. The fountain show is great.",
          "We visited this park at the last minute, and are so glad to have included it on our visit before leaving Sapporo for Lake Toya. We skipped Otaru to spend more time here. Since we visited in November, we enjoyed the snowless park, the fall colors as the leaves were changing, and",

          "Moerenuma Park is not close from the central Sapporo area. However, It is still accessible by public transportation. The purpose of our visiting the park was sledding so we bought sleds (plastic one) at home center called \"Homac\". It costed about 700 yen each. The glass",
          "We visited during winter since we want to experience how is it like to play in snow. This place did not disappoint us. Since it was a holiday when we visited, there are only a few people there so we are able to explore and take nice photos. Downside is that the park is closed",
          "Took some effort to climb the hill, the scene on the hill is definitely worth for a climb. A good place for the nature lover, family, and for those who love to walk in nature. Enjoy the fountain breeze in this city park.",
          "If your vacation is mainly in the city, it's good to get out here in the open and away from the traffic. The big hill in the middle is good for views and sledding- and we saw a guy climb to the top and ski down. The last 100 meters is actually fairly steep (though not dangerous,",
          "If you like art, it is great place to visit. This park was originally designed by Mr.Isamu Noguchi, who was a famous Japanese-American artist. The main building, glass pyramid, and large designed constructions can be found there. These are really warm and peaceful. The space is",

          "Amazing place. A bit of the way, but totally worth the time and effort. Designed by the American artist and landscape architect Isamu Noguchi is an impressive park full of landscape sculptures and being a sculpture on itself. It is possible to spend a whole day there, walking,",
          "This stunning park is a little bit out of the way, but well worth visiting. More of an art installation rather than averge park. On my trip it was a cloudy day, which actually made the visit quite pleasant as it was cool enough to comfortably traverse the park several times. The",
          "Spent some time just shooting pictures and wandering around with family. Always reminds me of how spacious and free Hokkaido is compared to other parts of the country. A beautiful fountain show on summer evenings, and some neat art galleries too. Plenty of parking and it works",
          "With meticulously-maintained lawns, neatly-kept clusters of trees (like small groves or woods) and beautiful tree-lined paths, I would say with no exaggeration at all that this is one of the best parks I have been to in my life. And yes, there's also the big glass pyramid to go",

          "The installation art is more or less interesting, but it's the art that you are able to play on that makes it cool. Aside from being a nice park to relax at, the cluster of playgrounds is fun for kids. The view from the top of the mountain is especially nice at sunset.",
          "Good place to enjoy the outdoors and run around with the kids. Great views of the surrounding area, city, and mountains.",
          "I rented a bike and rode here along the bike trail on the river from downtown Sapporo. The ride, and the park were both nice. I can't say there was anything spectacularly interesting about the park, though. There were a few steep hills that you could climb, which provided nice",
          "What a great park with awesome views and architecture. All for free on top of that. It wasn't hard to find as the GPS took us around the small streets in residential neighborhoods and all of sudden, there is this huge park. This used to be a dump site and now it is a beautiful",

          "We went there to escape from the hustle of city life in Sapporo. Rented a bicycle for 200 yen and spend about 2 hours exploring the glass pyramid and others except the fountain as its was closed. A well spent morning ride in the park with reasonable access by subway ,bus and 1",
          "I had thought that Tokino Suzuran Park was wide and big; so is Moerenuma. The similarity ends here though. A few, huge sculptures and two (man made?) hills filled the big expanse of green spaces of Moerenuma Park. From a certain point within the park, the view looks like a copy",

          "I thought the design/architecture sounded interesting enough to warrant the roughly one hour of subway and bus travel to warrant going, but we ended up staying longer and had a great time. This is the opposite of an electronic arcade; you make your own fun. The hills, glass",
          "We rented bikes to cycling around the park to save time and really enjoyed it. Beautiful landscape. Could not believe that this place used to be garbage dump site. The fountain show is nice and not to be missed. I lost my glasses somewhere in the park, and got it back from",

          "After I came back from my trip to Moerenuma Park, I shared with the hotel front desk abut my experience & she laughed. It seems that Sapporo citizens know about Moerenuma's desolate & forlorn winter, not the tourists. Here's why: - (1) Strong wind picking up & lifting snow off",
          "I love this park so much, probably the most interesting & fun park I've ever seen. There's a pyramid and a hill to climb, a dome like small hill in front of the pyramid, a glass house to see and small water ponds for children to play with, a nice route for jogging & cycling,",
          "The building and the surrounding area are both very unique. I will visit it again. There are lots of outdoor activities but you may need a sunny and warm day to enjoy it to the fullest. Arts activities and musical performance inside the main building as well. I spent 4 hrs",
          "This is a combination playground, park and art park, with great open spaces and makes a good place for a picnic",
          "To go there, just follow the instructions on their website . The bus stop returning to the subway is across the street from where you get off. Do check the timetable before you enter the park, as you may spend hours in there. You can rent a bike, though we walk. If you hate the",
          "A lovely modern park designed by a famous half British, half Japanese designer. Has huge outdoor spaces with soft lawn that kids seem to love to roll on, plus a wading pool for kids to jump around in, while the parents sprawl out on the surrounding grass watching over them."

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round.

          "Nothing special about this clock tower. Was pretty disappointed with it. Nothing fascinating or anything at all. Don't know why it's such a big deal. Can just take photo from opposite the street. Free admission in but it's all in Japanese. Don't even understand anything. Not",

          "We were disappointed that repairs were being done when we were there and it was not open. It does look impressive but not really that old.",
          "We were treated to a free entrance on a Wed afternoon. Initially, we only intended to take a few photos outside and then move on to Odori Park. However, we stumbled upon a chance to enter the building without paying the usual \u00a5200 fee. We were told later that the place had just",
          "Disappointing! The Clock Tower did not receive guest at the time of my visit. Many visitors including myself were only contended to taking photos outside at the fence.",

          "I was in Sapporo beginning of this month and the clock tower was under construction. It had a huge sheet over it with a nice print of what the clock tower will look like eventually. But still it is a part of Sapporo\u2019s history so I recommend visiting when the work is complete.",
          "It was \u201cclose\u201d. I\u2019m remodalation process at my visit. No much to say about it, only that is near the tv tower and odori park.",

          "I was in Sapporo last week and I had to visit the Clock Tower because I read about it in Tripadvisor and that it is a recommended attraction to visit when in town. I knew that the Clock Tower was closed for renovations, as I had been following the website for some time, but I",
          "We had far too little time to do this justice. The staff were extremely helpful, directing us to the English guide sheets. Fortunately, we got to see it before the renovations started, but it was obvious that the renovations were sorely needed. The outside paint was peeling and",
          "Sadly the clock tower is completely covered during the renovation period. I would not recommend visiting until the renovation is complete.",
          "Easy to miss if visiting on your own as there are no signboard to explain the history of the tower..",
          "The clock tower is under renovation. The perimeter are boarded up so you can't see the building from top to toe. So one can only take a picture of it from across the road.",

          "Easy to miss. An old building and tower . You gave to know this is the clock tower otherwise you could just pass this by .",
          "This is an old building from when Sapporo was originally founded. It has become a symbol of Sapporo, but it kind of gets lost being surrounded by modern skyscrapers towering over it. I guess if you're walking by, it's worth a picture, but if you can't fit this in your schedule,",
          "This old building in the middle of Sapporo is great if you have an English speaking guide like we had. An older volunteer walked with us through the building and had several stories about the history of this clock tower. Very interesting.",
          "We took a leisurely stroll around the city and took a picture outside the Clock Tower. They have a platform outside where you can stand upon and have your photo taken at a better vantage point. There\u2019s a fee to go inside which we didn\u2019t bother as it didn\u2019t really interest us.",

          "You must visit this place when you are in Sapporro. There's even a side step for you to climb to take your pictures with the tower.",
          "This landmark is near by Odori Park. So, if you visit Odori park at Sapporo, don't forget to see this building also. There is clock museum inside but I don't have time to explore more so I'm just took a pic In front of it",
          "Very close to the area of the ice and snow Festival, many interesting artifacts in the small Museum some of which were in English. Several of the guides their spoke English and were able to give a verbal explanation of the building and its purpose when it was first opened.",
          "i revisited the clock tower during winter season! the first one was last spring, and still, it never fails to amaze me! its cute!",
          "A clock tower free for photo shooting. However you need to pay for the entrance fee to enter the Clock tower. Just drop by here right after you visit the Odori Park :)",
          "The Sapporo Clock Tower consider is one of the iconic building in the Sapporo City Centre. It's a walking distance from Odori park. Although the building are not huge but it's a historical building.",
          "We saw the Clock Tower at night so the inside was closed but it still looked beautiful. it\u2019s only a 10 min walk from JR Sapporo Station but we were fortunate to be staying in a hotel nearby.",
          "Just take a few minutes to snap some shots and you\u2019re ready to go. Never entered the clock tower. Do take note that there\u2019s an entrance fee.",

          "This clock tower is close to Odori Park and is a great picture spot. About 10 min.walk from Sapporo TV Tower. Nothing much to see, addition fee 200 \u00a5 The building is well preserved. If you have a time actually not bad, but also not good.\ud83d\ude0a",
          "This is interesting due to its decidedly un-Japanese appearance. Other than that and when it was built there isn't any other information on it.",
          "Being american i was curious about the clock tower. Very popular spot for photos and only $2 to get in. Clock is over a 130 years old and still running. Surprised an american clock would last thst long. Great to see this place here. American restaurant tony romas is right",
          "The Western architecture of the building is a curiosity for Japan, although it would not be out of place in an older US small-town scene. The tower is situated just a few blocks from Odori Park, so it is worth a peek if you have sufficient time in your travel itinerary.",
          "If you are walking past then take your happy snap and selfie and then go. Small museum there if you are keen",
          "If you live in Sapporo town area, this place can be a quick visit to kill time in the evenings, not so much of a must visit. We visited late one evening (8/9pm), took some photos, read up about its history and then went on our way. Nice to see but not a must in my opinion.",
          "I don't know why people take photos infront of this building. Not that interesting and i wouldn't call this place for must see or go place in Sapporo...",
          "This is a historical place which was established in 1878 to educate younger people. However you may might be disappointed with this building because of its design and size. Small and simple white building. I don\u2019t recommend to visit so much. I recommend to use your time to visit",
          "10 mins walk from Sapporo station. Nth much except it look spectacular... didnt go inside.. many took photos of it",
          "it is a turn of the century structure in the middle of modern buildings. it is really a sight to see.",
          "Hitting top popularity in Sapporo, the Clock Tower spot is boring. It\u2019s not even \u201ca must\u201d, unless you\u2019re Japanese. Maybe when staying in a hotel nearby (Nest, Grand) it would be OK to stop by, but as long as you\u2019re not nearby - don\u2019t do it. Especially in other season than late",
          "Well you only need to take pictures outside just so that you can have a remembrance if your stay in Sapporo. You will enjoy if you are a watch enthusiast otherwise just have your picture taken.",
          "Its just a clock...not spectacular enough. But because its the Sapporo icon, we must take a photo here. The location is near Odori park, or may be the part of odori park.",
          "The clock tower has a very special meaning in Sapporo and Hokkaido history. However itself doesn't look very special to tourists. I'd recommend tourists may stop by here when visiting the TV tower and Odori park.",
          "Well within walking distance of JR Sapporo station and Odori park, the clock tower is one of few landmarks in the city. Nice to go for a photo op to show that you have been to Sapporo. They even have a platform on which you can position yourself so that a friend can take a photo",
          "We went hunting for this clock tower, thinking it must be a tall imposing structure, only to miss it several times. When we finally found it, it resembled a small post office. Speaking of disappointment!",
          "A tiny clock tower smacked hidden in central Sapporo amidst the tall buildings, the Clock Tower offers a quiet refuge from the bustling of the city. Originally part of a school, used mainly for military training for its students, this building has been standing at its original",

          "This is a vintage treasure in modern Sapporo. It is the oldest building standing in Sapporo. The clock itself remains in working condition since 1881. You can get a very good tour here as the many the guides speak excellent English and are local historians. They can even explain",
          "There are a lot of modern buildings in Sapporo and you will find this unique vintage building in the middle of the busy city hub.",
          "Nicely tucked in between the sky scrappers, this \"icon\" of Sapporo could be a miss if not for the usual groups of tourists taking the customary images of the small tower.",
          "It's an interesting quick stop while walking in Sapporo. This looks like a building that belongs more in Minnesota than Japan.",
          "We had bikes for the day and stopped off here. Found this very interesting and enjoyed trying to find the 17 stars on the outside of the building. There were staff available at the exhibits inside who could speak English and were happy to chat and show you around.",
          "Very interesting to see how Sapporo looked prior to the skyscrapers!! Clock still works without any modernisation....",
          "This is a western style building built in 1878 so it does standout as different from all the other building around it. It is currently the oldest building in Sapporo, kind of surprising when you think of how old Japan is but Hokkaido was colonized in only the late 1800's. The",
          "Some historical memorials are not enticing to foreigners. Part of historical relics relating to westernization process are an example. This tower, although significant in Japanese history of westernization, is of little interest to me.",

          "It's an icon in Sapporo, so just do it. It's walking distant from Odori Park. Nothing spectacular in my eyes as we came from Memanbatsu down to Sapporo.",
          "Met a very interesting English speaking guide. He was very informative about the history of the clock tower. Worth going inside and seeing the photos of the area.",
          "This Clock tower located near odori park around 300m, Walking distance from Sapporo TV tower & odori Park. in this site there are Photo Spot but in the morning will be full of tourist that want to take photo so please be patient.",
          "One of a kind. Historical and very impressive. The building were turn of the century. I imagined what it must have been like when it was state of the art. Mind blowing.",
          "Other than to take picture, nothing much to do n see. Perhaps u can read some history on the clock tower. You can visit if you have spare time on hand.",
          "We didn't go in to visit the museum. The tower was a bit small. Cute and small. Since we were there we popped by. And it was part of our packaged day tour. Just another check the box thing to do in the city. There are nicer places to visit in the city but I guess this is one of",
          "Just walked by to take some photos. May be winter time is more impressive(?). We went there during day time, nothing really special.",

          "It's quite easy to locate the clock Tower as it's close by to the Sapporo Tower. However if you are in a rush I suggest a miss as it looks quite ordinary from the outside . They charge a fee for going into the clock tower which essentially is located on a wooden bungalow house",
          "True, the \"tower\" itself is only a clock on the 2d floor. But the house is well preserved, and inside is a museum depicting the history of Sapporo. Make sure to visit upstairs to see how the clock works.",

          "I've seen clock towers befor, this one resembles to me a clock you'd expect to find in Boston. Away, not detracting from that it is an historical additional to your education of Sapporo. It is well lit at night to enable night shots. The surrounding trees give it a a feel of",
          "Clock tower is symbol of Sapporo. This tower was 139 years. Today it's a museum. The Clock Tower is four blocks or a ten minute walk south of JR Sapporo Station, and one block north of Odori Park.",
          "This is really a clock tower that sits atop a western style house for nearly 140 years and is still working and giving time . There is a wooden step up area with Sapporo written for picture taking opportunity . Can be accessed also from Odori Park",
          "I expected a high tower with clock, but it looks like a traditional western house with clock. Actually not bad, but also not good.",
          "The clock tower in sapporo was originally an agriculture institute. Its i nicely preserved building.",
          "Small quaint museum. Not a lot here but worth looking at if you are in the area. Try and get there on the hour for the chiming of the clock.",
          "Sapporo Clock Tower (Tokei-dai) - one of thre must see attractions in city - a bit disappointing now as it is surraound by big buildings.",
          "As part of our tour, we visited and got an explanation of the operation and winding of the clock. While it does represent an important point in Sapporo history, the building and clock are not impressive (typical late 19th C mechanism and building), and the small museum",
          "Value for money. Better not go up. Very small but can see sapporo lights. Take your picture by not going up. Its old. Nothing much todo. So better walk odori park n have a nice photo outside n picture whole tower.",

          "Went past the clock tower a few times during our Sapporo stay. I guess it is what it is. A clock tower which you get tourists stopping from time to Time to snap a picture. I wouldn't go all the way just to see it.",

          "Coming from the TV Tower, we were told that we get a bargain if we also purchase the dual ticket for the TV Tower and the Clock Tower. Since we expected that it is really a tower, we purchased the discounted ticket for both attractions. After the TV Tower, we tried looking for",

          "Probably the most famous building in Sapporo, and historically that makes sense, but there really wasn't anything interesting about it to me. It's worth ticking off your list, if only because it's incredibly convenient, and to help understand the history of the city. The former",
          "An iconic structure in this town. It's a nice place to visit especially if it's your first time in Sapporo. Pros: Easy to walk to from the main park and most central locations. It's a beautifully preserved structure. Cons: Nothing really, unfortunately I just didn't find it",
          "If it is on the way to your other itinerary, then it is Ok. I feel that it is just a house with a clock at the top, I think this place is overrated as a must visit tourist spot. Will not visit again,",

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan.

          "Well, yes,many raving reviews about the place but actually I feel that it is a rather overrated, as the exhibits are not that exciting, and with 52 different kinds of houses/buildings, which you cant finish in one visit, it gets kind of boring after some time. There are many",

          "This museum/park is a must for everyone visiting Sapporo and interested in its cultural and historical heritage. Here they collected real houses and buildings that were in use in Hokkaido for at least 150 years. I especially loved the ryokan - as we were staying in such a hotel",
          "It will take at least 1-2 hours to walk through all of the buildings. It shows how people live in 1868 to 1926.",
          "This museum displays the buildings from the old days from schools, hospital, shops to residence houses. I love the details of each house/building. You can easily spend half day in this place.",
          "The village covers 54 hectares in Napporo Forest Park in the suburbs of Sapporo City. There are about 60 structures of the Meiji and Taisho eras which were either restored or the original buildings were transported to the site. I really enjoyed this attraction first thinking",

          "This museum was by far one of the highlights of my trip to Hokkaido. There are a wide range of buildings with different purposes and histories, and in addition to admiring the exterior architecture you also get to wander inside the buildings and examine the interior designs.",
          "It might be a little tricky to get to, depending on how comfortable you are with the Sapporo bus system. It's a great sample of history, in my opinion, and they do a great job of keeping everything in good shape. The docents I met were very knowledgeable and eager to share",
          "This attraction is out of this world. Why? it's truly fantastic that the team managed to transfer each old historic build piece by piece from their original location. As I understand it, 80% of these buildings are the originals and more than 100 years old. The best part is there",
          "Well run with historical buildings relocated from different parts of Japan to the site. It's staffed with many retiree volunteers who were eager to share the stories behind these buildings. A pity we couldn't understand Japanese. Would be great if they could run English guided",

          "It was like a little adventure as one embarked on his first step as there were many houses on both sides of the street waiting to be stepped in, no matter which way you turned. The exhibits inside looked real enough, especially the mannequins & I got a couple of shock as I",

          "This is a collection of buildings from the early period of Hokkaido's *Japanese* history. Hokkaido had a native people -- the Aniu -- who aren't represented here. So this is a collection of buildings from the early settlement (Meiji) period of Hokkaido. Because many of the"

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River. Sapporo has an elevation of 29 m (95 ft 2 in)Sapporo has many parks, including Odori Park, which is located in the heart of the city and hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year. Moerenuma Park is also one of the largest parks in Sapporo, and was constructed under the plan of Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese-American artist and landscape architect.\nNeighbouring cities are Ishikari, Ebetsu, Kitahiroshima, Eniwa, Chitose, Otaru, Date, and adjoining towns are T\u014dbetsu, Kimobetsu, Ky\u014dgoku.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nSapporo has ten wards (\u533a, ku). The color shows the location of each ku in the map below.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSapporo has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa), with a wide range of temperature between the summer and winter. Summers are generally warm, but not overly humid, and winters are cold and very snowy, with an average snowfall of 5.96 m (19 ft 7 in) per year. Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues. The heavy snowfall is due to the Siberian High developing over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low developing over the northern Pacific Ocean, resulting in a flow of cold air southeastward across Tsushima Current and to western Hokkaido. The city's annual average precipitation is around 1,100 mm (43.3 in), and the mean annual temperature is 8.5 \u00b0C (47.3 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe tertiary sector dominates Sapporo's industry.

          "This is a must visit . Even for just a photo . But visiting the observatory would be nicer. Getting a view of Odori park would be better. Their own identity to compare with the Tokyo Tv tower , Auckland sky tower or even the Eiffel Tower of Paris .",
          "You will have to buy the tickets and then head to the elevator to go to the top. There are not many things to do at the top so this place is perfect to a short visit.",

          "My son and I went to the Sapporo TV Tower on July 15th and enjoyed the views from the observation deck. We went early and it wasn't crowded at all. The deck is a bit small, but the views from the deck are quite impressive. You can look directly up Odori Park and also look over",
          "Called in for a beer late evening. Plenty of activity and interesting eating. Nice big glasses of cold beer.",
          "Be warned, for those with a fear of balance or falling rather than \"heights\" the elevator is entirely glass walled! Had a minor panic attack going up so chose to stand dead centre and not look! Once at the top it was fine, great view of Odori Park and the city in general.",

          "Located at one end of the Odori Park in central Sapporo, this iconic tower is hard to miss. We were there on a beautiful late spring morning and it was just beautiful. The joyful atmosphere at the park made this a lively addition to the scene, even though it is a sturdy",
          "We arrived just before sunset. Manage to get a good birds eye view of Sapporo before and after sunset. Great scenery. Recommended to photographers. The tower looks like the Eifel tower in Paris. Worth the cost of the tickets. There are souvenir shops at the viewing deck.",

          "Viewed this tower in both day and night, which would provide you with different vibes. The tower viewed at night was spectacular!",
          "One nice thing about Japan is that attractions like this are not very expensive. This one was (combi ticket with Clock tower) 800 Yen The elevator goes to the fourth floor where you have a 90 meter high view on Sapporo. The view was very clear so we could look very far. Great",

          "A visit to a tower ensures on of a good view of the city ! It gives you a perspective of the whole city as it\u2019s impossible in a short visit to see everything !",
          "We went up to the observation deck mainly to get a view of Odori Park. It\u2019s a small observation platform but there are small seating nooks where you can sit, relax, and enjoy the view. We enjoyed looking around Sapporo City and Odori Park but we didn\u2019t stay too long as there",
          "A symbol of pride for the community with historical value and a scenic view from the observation deck. We just settled at ground level because of the chilling Spring winds",
          "Sapporo is a beautiful city, to see it from up there is just amazing. It was pretty cheap to go up, lots to see up there with 360degrees view and plenty of vending machines up there for a snack and drink. It's all about the view, was brilliant. Go up and see the city",
          "After building a snow man at Odori park, we headed to the TV Tower to view what the park looked like from an elevated perspective. There was no rush, we could take our time to soak in the view. Where possible, when we visit a city for the 1st time, we would try to go to an",

          "We visited Sapporo TV tower at night. It is adjacent to Odori park and we enjoyed the night view from here. It was not so crowded, but you might be disappointed if you expect too much. There are some souvenir shops at the lower floor and you can select \"famous\" souvenirs.",
          "It took a bit of walking to this tower from the JR Sapporo station. We only visit the floor where the souvenir shop is located. Just went there to warm up our body in a cold day.",
          "The TV tower is ok but too expensive. I would recommend the ropecars for this as this is too costly. Do not shop here. This place is situated very near the sapporo station and the park.",

          "Recommended to go around 4.30-5pm to get day and night shots. Do expect a queue at the ticket booth. You can purchase tickets online to skip the queue. There is also a queue for the lift. Skip the queue by climbing up the stairs to go to level 3 to take the lift up the tower.",
          "The scene from the TV Tower was beautiful, if you visit during the month of the snow festival I would recommend travelling up there to see the lights from a birds eye point! However the line up to the top is quite a bit of a wait, had to wait up to around 30 mins before I",
          "Feels like floating when u r up there. View was fantastic, good experience. Snow festival season u could see the fantastic lights. I thought the tower would have been a bit more new. I like the tax free souvenir gift shops. Bought many stuff",
          "Great scenery of Sapporo from the bird's eyes from observation deck floor.I went during the Snow Festival, so was great views of the snow festivsl at Odori park. Suggest you buy your ticket at a tourist information center (there are several in town and you'll save more than",

          "One of the Sapporo landmarks is Sapporo TV Tower which is nice to visit there no matter day time of nice time with a panoramic of Sapporo City and Odori Park",
          "Most people pay a visit at night but I would recommend visiting in the early hours as lesser tourists at this hour. Nice place for pictures...",

          "I wasn\u2019t sure if this was worth it, but it turned out to be a highlight. Great views of Sapporo and the surroundings. Some ways to really enjoy the tower: 1. Discounted tickets are available if you buy them from the tourist information centres. We got ours in the one enroute to",
          "It\u2019s a TV Tower in Odori Park if you are in the area you are gonna see it. I wouldn\u2019t go outta your way for the tower specially but I would for Odori Park and since you are there already well.... why not take a look.",
          "Its practically in the middle of the city of Sapporo. Build in the 1950\u2019s. You can go to the 3rd floor to get a glimpse of what the view can offer. If you want to go to the observation desk you need to buy a ticket on the third floor. You get to see the beauty of Sapporo",
          "Though I came here because of a tour, we came early and hence there was not much people around. Views were great and even in the elevator you could see the views as you ascent/descent. Entrance fee only applies if you want to go all the way to the top to take a look.",
          "This tower usually arise in Gundam fighting movie\ud83d\ude01..its has an iconic value..so we must take a photo here. You can get a good angel for this tower from inside the aqua city park.",
          "This is one of few landmarks in Sapporo. Hence, it provides a good photo op to prove you have visited Sapporo. Otherwise, it is nothing to write home about. I did not pay to ascend the tower.",
          "We didn't pay to enter - thought it was rather pricey. From level 3 (free), you can walk around the tower and have a panoramic view of odori park. It's connected directly via the subway.",
          "Great landmark standing at the Odori Park. Connected to the subway underground shopping and provide 360 view of the Sapporo city. The lighted tower compliments the white illumination during winter also created a great atmosphere to the German Christmas streets.",
          "Beautiful landmark of Sapporo. Sadly it\u2019s winter season and it\u2019s snowing very heavily early this December, views are obstructed. Nevertheless, a classic landmark, worth a photograph no matter what the weather is like.",
          "While you may visit Sapporo TV Tower for free from the outside, making a paid entrance the to observatory 90 metres above ground is a must. Cost is \u00a5720 per adult and multiple price tiers for students. The view is completely different between day and night. If you cannot visit",
          "The view from the top is awesome! You can see Odori Park and the surrounding buildings. It is best viewed at night.",
          "We went there in the early morning, taking photos from Odori park. Relaxing. Night view could be nicer i guess.",
          "I don't think it's worth to go up there. Not because of the USD 7 price. I'd recommend just check it out from the outside. Get an ice cream at the bottom of it.",
          "A little overrated. Good place to take photos of Odori Park and the city. You can buy a two visit ticket for 1100yen so that you can come back in the night and not have to pay the 700yen entry twice. It's still worth visiting but you won't be there long as it's just a view.",
          "This is a nice tower to take pictures of - especially as you walk down the park. I didn't have a chance to go up.",
          "If you are at Odori Park, please make an effort to come up to the Observatory Deck at the TV Tower. A 60-second elevator will bring you up to the observatory deck 90 meters above ground. From here you will have a 360 degree panoramic view of Sapporo. Magnificent. The night view",
          "This a landmark in Sapporo built in 1957 it is 147meters tall. It sits at one end of Odori park so you get a good view of it and the park both during the day and at night. The landscaping in Odori park near the tower is nice with flowers and sculptures. At night the tower is",
          "If your walking the streets at night then I suggest you go see this. But don't plan a trip around it. Very average",
          "The Sapporo TV tower is just beside the Odori park & is just beside Odori subway station. The observation deck (720 yen) provides a great view of the Odori park and its surrounding. A nice place to drop by and snap a few photos",
          "We visited during night time while my short stay at Sapporo. It is like normal tower good to see from outside and have some photo shoot nearby. What we enjoyed here is cultural festival and dancing Japanese people with beautiful music.",
          "The tower is interesting but so much more. It offers a great way to get oriented when exploring downtown Sapporo. You can always look up and find the tower to find your way to any subway stop or your hotel!",
          "We choose to visit the tower at about 5pm in the spring so we get to see the day and night view within 1-2 hours. You do not need to cater a lot of time on the tower as you will want to spend more time in Odori park itself, but still a \"must see\" view for me.",
          "We knew it would be touristy but we went ahead and headed over to the Sapporo TV tower. The kids were able to bungee jump off of the seventh floor of it which was fun. They're a great views from up above although the price to get in is a bit much.",
          "Can see local picnic there. Selling a lot of street foods such as corn, ice cream and Sapporo beer. Very near to odori park.",
          "Located in Odori Park itself we didn't walk to the tower but instead admiring it from a distance. It came to life during night time where the lights made it such a romantic sight to look at when you're walking in Odori Park.",
          "Excellent views of Odori Park at night. During the summer, there is outdoor seating at the base of the tower with people enjoying grilled food. The smells are amazing. This tower offers a more scenic view of Odori Park compared to the more general city view from the JR station",
          "Doesn't need to be // It is a small tower. You can see the entire Sapporo but, remember there are no skyscrapers in Sapporo so what do you wanna see? Perhaps it may be more beautiful at night but during the day, perhaps not so interesting unless you must have a snap view of",
          "Loved the view. Took many beautiful pictures. There was no crowd when I visited, which made the whole experience pleasant. I could take my time getting my best shot. The view of the park was great! Instead of taking the lift, we walked down. The pictures and information",
          "Love the 360 degree view and over head view of odori park. Spotted some other venues that we visited later.",
          "We forgot the local tour after will come here again, so we went there at the first night, and again at day time on the fifth day. Don't compare it with Tokyo/Skytree tower please, but it could show you a great view for the Otori during day time. I will suggest you come at around",
          "if you want to see from top beside mountain, this is another way, but let me remind you, there is nothing here.",
          "Lovely gardens around d tower. Can do picnic or stop for a break with refreshments. Mini bungee jumping for kids & adults.",
          "You can have an overall view of Sapporo city in the evening with light and traffic from the high tower. Enjoy taking photos here. Just a spot you should come when coming to this beautiful city to have nice memory with your family or friends.",
          "Was ok and I thought it would be free but I would not pay to go up again. Same in every country an observation deck. If you've never been before then yeah sure but not really for me.",
          "You will get a good view of the boulevard in which this tower sits. The view at sunsets is excellent on the west facing platform. The entry to the ticket platform is on the third floor where you will find restaurants and gift shops. The lift will take you further up to the top",
          "It is well worth trekking to visit this site at night to see it nicely lit up. You can also climb to the observation deck to take in views of a very nice green belt running through the centre of the city. Take the time to visit while in the city.",
          "The iconic structure in Sapporo best visited in the evening. Though we did not take take the lift to the top the overall surroundings are quite nice",
          "A cool structure to stop for a picture, but it's merely a landmark. Nothing fantastic about it, in my humble opinion.",
          "A must visit when you go to Sapporo especially when you're travelling with elders or kids. It's very accessible as it is smack in the middle of the town. Relax while you stare at the amazing view from up there. View is great on both summer and winter.",

          "Price for going in is reasonable compare to lots more tower across the world. With 720yen to explore Sapporo night view is not a bad price. The lift is surprisingly slow to carry passenger to the top compare to any other tower's lift. There is also a small cafe in the area and",
          "We always enjoy seeing the lights during the White Illumination period and festival of December. This in combination with the German Fest makes it a delightful (how beit cold) time to visit!",

          "Located in the city centre with props of Sapporo alphabets to have great pictures and fronted by the flower garden during spring / summer the place is great for memory pictures . In the nighttime with illuminations it adds to the charm of the place .",

          "Entrance fees are reasonable, friendly staff and you can see good view of odori park and Sapporo from here. Quite a small tower, we spent less than an hour there. There are also shops selling souvenirs but nothing much.",
          "I quite enjoy going up on all these TV towers when traveling in Japan. In general, Japanese are not pro skyscrapers, so normally you can have a great unblocking view to the entire city. You can even see the city of Sapporo surrounded by those mountains as the backdrop. Also a",

          "The entry to the observation deck 90m above Odori Park is good value and the view is pretty good. I have marked it down a little as the trading kiosks on the observation deck have a couple of impacts on visitors. Firstly, the observation deck is not large so consuming important",

          "we actually planned to be at odari park but we stranded here without regrets! we went up and paid a ticket for the entrance and witnessed sapporo from above. so beautiful!",
          "The tower offers an excellent view of the city in all 4 directions. There are many restaurants besides a souvenir shop in the tower.Very close to JR. Taxi ride may only cost 500 yens",
          "Ok, Sapporo is quite short on sights but this still shouldn't be high on the agenda. The whole interior feels dated and, more importantly, the view just isn't much to admire. Also, it's weird that a place like this is cash only. Watching it from outside is enough.",
          "I've been in few \"Towers\" and my expectation level were too high. Tokyo Tower is definitely a WOW as well as few other regional \"towers\" in Japan but this wasn't in that level. It was more of Oodori deck type. I suppose the JR Tower near by this location gets more WOW and nice",

          "This is a good place in winter at night to take photos. The place is scenic with the background of snow with the area lit up with Christmas lights. Some sort of Christmas festival with stalls set up selling food n such a few days before christmas.",
          "This is a small version of so called looked alike Eiffer Towel. It is located at the Odori Park. Easy to find. Best viewed in the night with lights on. Worth to see.",
          "The Sapporo TV Tower is one of the key icons here. With an entrance fee, you can actually ascend to the observatory platform for a 360 degree of the city. Souvenir shops are located at its base.",
          "The tower is around 150m tall. It is located at the eastern end of the Odori park and also near Odori station. The view from the top is that spectacular though as the deck is not located so high. There is a beer garden and Mongolian style grilled in summer time.",
          "Nothing spectacular but it does give you a great view of Sapporo and the sunsets can be quite amazing.",
          "Located at the Odori Park, it is a landmark of Sapporo. Looks common during the daytime, but very beautiful at night. Viewing it from the ground up is enough. It is no need to go up the tower.",
          "This place also in Odori Park, near the Sapporo station, several souvenir shops and food stalls open daily.",
          "Visited the place during the Christmas lighting. The snow, cold temperature and the lighting added to the festivity.",
          "Nothing much to see at day time. Bits beautiful when lights on but nothing to see. Compare to others in thing sapporo TV Tower is just a tower but it's much better than Kyoto Tower which shorter than Sapporo Tower.",
          "The tower is located towards the end of odori park and one could enjoy both tourist attractions at the same time. Apparently it's iconic and One could purchase a ticket to go up to the tower if I'm not wrong. Nice place to sit around and enjoy the atmosphere.",
          "during mid day, it was nothing than a tower clock, but one can absorb the atmosphere of sapporo city perfectly there. guess i have to come back in different season like christmas and see it at night :)",
          "The view up there is not fantastic, not worth paying to go up. Can make do with taking a few pics around the park.",
          "We walked and travelled on public transport a lot during our stay and the iconic TV Tower was a landmark that helped us navigate the city. It's beautifully lit up during the night and forms a bigger lighting display as part of Odori Park. We didn't go up the tower but thoroughly",
          "I didn't go up the tower. I only took picture of the tower from odori park which is very nice to take picture with. If you're in Sapporo, I'd suggest to quckly visit this place. It's 3mins train ride from Sapporo Station or 15m walk from Sapporo Station.",
          "Sapporo TV Tower (\u3055\u3063\u307d\u308d\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u5854 Sapporo Terebi-t\u014d) - Located at Eastern end of the Odori Park. Tickets can be bought at level 3 (22.9m) . I did not get up the observation deck. It's beautiful. If you have extra time, try to see it both during day time and night time.",
          "Sapporo TV Tower may not be the best place to see around Sapporo but if look from Odori park or around at night in winter its decorated very fantastic.",
          "Obviously another well known structure in this town. You will no doubt walk past it or spot it from a distance when exploring Sapporo. Pros: Well known, looks cool - a must see for first time tourists to Sapporo. Nice park surrounding this area too. Cons: Not really much else",
          "It is a tower in Japan where you can see Sapporo in each direction. Notting much to comment, just take out your camera and snap lots of photo. Day and night give you different feeling. So try to be there before sunset then you can enjoy both environment.",
          "Didn't go up the Tower since I'd already done the higher tower where you can see this tower from above, namely the JR Tower just a 10-minute walk north of this tower; but nonetheless, I was impressed by this tall & imposing structure with the shape of the Eiffel Tower on the",
          "Nice observatory located on the Sapporo TV Tower at the end of Odori park. You must visit it during the day & at night,",
          "I and family visit Sapporo TV Tower on snow day. People play in the snow around Sapporo TV Tower. It's very funny.",
          "Good place for photo session. It is located nearby Susukino, Odori and Nijo market. This place often flooded with tourist.",
          "Lovely place with very good garden. You can enjoy view from the top of tower. You can relax and enjoy there!",
          "We went up during the evening hours. The feeling is excellent, though we have to queue for a while. we can see the town at a higher level ,though not the whole town. The town was lit and very colorful. It is a good experience .",
          "I just generally enjoyed the whole experience. The tower was quite busy but the orderly queues and pleasant staff made the short wait for the lift a pleasure. Once at the observation platform the views are impressive, both of the city and beyond. Don't miss the opportunity to",
          "There's really nothing special about the design of this tower, however, it is a really good place to get an overall look of Sapporo and just chill with some people. They have a restaurant in the base of this tower and the surrounding view was just beautifully relaxing.",
          "Went up in the evening during the Ice Festival in January. The views were great.... BUT CROWDED!!! People pushing to get closer to the glass to take pictures. Very annoying. Its worth a visit at night for the city lights. Tower is old.",
          "The TV tower is located at one end of Odori Park close to where the Clock Tower is. From the top you get a bird's eye view of Sapporo city as also look along the length of Odori Park as it stretches across several blocks. In the distance you can see the hills that ring the city",
          "Beautiful day and night. Similar to a smaller version of Tokyo tower. Good to visit for the view and shops. There were some pop up beer garden and restaurant while we were there.",
          "We strolled down Odori Park then walked to the Sapporo TV Tower. The views are beautiful at night when the city lights lit up. The tower also gets lit up and looks beautiful at night. A photo worthy place in Sapporo",
          "Tourist attraction in heart of sapporo. Gives you a good overview of the place. Don't expect to spend too much time. Possibility to rent a room at mid level. Heaps of gift to buy...",
          "Nothing much except the LED lights at night. it's more happening if there's food stalls or other stalls that selling stuff.",
          "The first thing that you want to do when you reach Sapporo City is walk down the beautiful Odori park . In spring you will see a lot of colourful flowers and awesome cherry blossom trees as you walk towards the iconic tower. Once inside there are some cool souvenir shops",
          "Right next to Odori park. I didn't go up but enjoyed looking at it and is certainly a nice place to take some pictures. Next to it they had a beergarden.",
          "I did not make it up to the tower cause but is a good place the grab some photo in the surrounding not far from the tower there is a garden where everyone like to chill out.",
          "The view at the top was beautiful and it is linked underground as well to malls and other places, so easy to avoid the weather.",
          "This is real exciting, we walked up using the staircases and it was very windy, but really fun! We got certificates and drinks, and supporters too! Very challenging. The view is really worth a climb.",
          "My 1st Self-drive (F&E) tour. My 1st visit to Japan. Go round and round to catch the nice view of Sapporo. It is great to catch the night view of Sapporo. I will visit again if I return to Hokkaido.",
          "Easy Access to the Tower and nice view of the City and surrarounding aera. Consider waiting the lift to access the entrance of the tower more than taking the stairs, they are really steep!",
          "If you want a day and night view, go before sunset and have dinner at the beer garden at the base of the tower if weather is good.",
          "Personally been to other places (outside Sapporo) with much better night views. While this is probably one of the only high places to view the night scenery, there's nothing special about this place - it's not particularly high, and can't really see clearly due to the bright",
          "The TV tower can be seen from all over the city. It is fairly cheep to go up the tower to the observation deck and look around. Sapporo is a relatively new city and has been laid out on a grid with wide streets (which is just as well after a heavy snowfall). The view from the",
          "Sapporo is a fairly new city of Japan where the CBD is situated just like checkerboard. Centre of that is TV tower. The city is divided and named North, South, East and West from there. If you are lost and don't have Internet connection for google map, look for TV tower and see",
          "Situated near Susukino and and we walked past the tower daily during our visit. It's was really pretty at night when the lights lit up.",
          "Like many of Japan's towers, going inside is kind of a ripoff. Much better to just take pictures from the outside. During the Snow Festival there are far more interesting things surrounding the tower in Odori Park.",
          "Nice looking tower located in the middle of Odori Park. Colorful lights light up the skies at certain hours of the night. Really beautiful place to shoot a time lapse recording.",
          "This landmark actually looks like a stunted Eiffel Tower, painted in red! One can actually venture up to the 3F without the need of admission fees, albeit only a restaurant, a souvernir shop and the ticketing office is sited on this level. There is no good view from here either.",
          "We went there by foot through the underground shopping mall. Best place to exit is via the stair at Odori station.",
          "Not bad lol for photo taking / sight seeing of buildings and structure :D.... ....... along Odori Park where u get to stroll along the park after the view on the tower",
          "Situated at the end of odori Park. This structure is a good compass when looking for certain places. Different view in the morning and at night.",
          "While staying in Sapporo I saw the tower many times so one morning I decided to go visit and as luck would have it it started raining just as I got there, from street level you take the elevator to level three at no cost. There you will find a shop , restaurant and lots of kids",
          "We got two free tickets as part of a package with a few participating hotels in Sapporo. Otherwise, the price is 720 yen per adult per admission. If I was paying for this, it would still be okay considering the Tokyo Skytree (although a lot higher up is over 2,000 Yen with",
          "I didn't go up the tower, but it looks nice during the day or night. You can just pass by it when you move around Sapporo city.",
          "Night view of the city covered in snow, there's a small souvenir shop there too, but all the shop in the entire building pretty much sells almost the same thing..so if u missed out any up here. U can just get them at other floors.",
          "Just go for the experience of riding up the historical elevator to the top to catch a bird's eye view of the city. You can get a professional picture by the photographer and you have the option to purchase your photo. Overall a small area with a souvenir shop and you can",
          "While clearly not the tallest building in Sapporo any more there is much more to see from here than from the JR tower at the station. If there is no queue you can be up and down again in about 45 minutes after inspecting the park and surrounding city from the small observation",
          "A must do when in Sapporo. The view of Odori park and Sapporo at the summit is one of the most iconic views in Hokkaido. So you gotta check it out. Went here twice actually. First during the afternoon. However, because of the heavy snowfall that day visibility was not that",
          "I was here the day prior to snow festival - it was great to see the last preparation works for the festival. Just a small cafeteria was missing - one shall bring own drink upstairs",
          "it is a bit pricey, but the view is absolutely fabulous. The street with all the parks as well as the skyline of Sapporo (which feels incomplete, because the TV tower is no longer part of it) can be well seen.",
          "We recently visited the Sapporo Snow Festival, and the TV Tower was right in the middle of the festivities. Although there were many tourists, the queue did not take too long. The queue at the bottom of the tower is to buy a ticket - and then you catch an elevator to the",
          "Great view of the snow festival at night. Pretty crowded though with long lines. Typical tourist type of thing where they take your photo like the Empire State Building.",
          "There is not much to see in this tower. It was just a typical tower one can find in their own countries with the view of the city. However, during the ice festival in Odori Park, this complemented the picturesque surroundings with the ice carvings in display. It was beautiful to",
          "This is a mini-Eiffel tower built right in the middle of town. It is higher than it looks and you get a great view. The price seemed about right to me. The lower levels are free but you have to pay to go to the top. Take the stairs or the lift as far as you can go and then you",
          "Nice view of the light up on Odori Street during Christmas period. Easily accessible. There's a cafe in the tower.",
          "The view is stunning but the deck is quite small. The perfect spot for photo shooting is the one located facing the Odori park where you'll find a lot of photographer with pricey camera that will just stand there forever. If you have a better plan and not a big fan of a view",
          "The tower is located at Odori Park, above odori station. If you walk from sapporo station to Odori station, you will pass through underground Arora Town with lots of shops and restaurants along the way. Will prefer visitors to visit at night when the lights are turn on to admire",
          "It's just a tower. Take some photos and move on. To be fair, we didn't go up the tower which offers a view of the city but time permitting, a trip to the Olympic Ski Jump Stadium would be a lot better.",
          "As we'd never gone to the top of the TV Tower on previous trips, made a point of doing so this time. There were no crowds at all when we visited (7pm ish), so we had most of the tower to ourselves. Ride up in the elevator short, but fun. Kids enjoyed it. The view from the 360",
          "Nothing interesting. Difficult to take photo as it's just a short stretch of walkway. And it's quiet especially after 9pm",
          "Very nice and already cold with seldom light snow. Can come in december as the snow will start fully in 2nd week of december",
          "This tower is a great landmark to visit especially you are trying to get a good aerial photo of Odori and the surrounding area. I just wished though that there were English narration, especially while ascending in the elevator.",
          "This a Sapporo landmark located in Odori Park. The view is awesome and should not be missed. The fee is 720 yen for the elevator ride to the observation deck. Check your hotel lobby where all the tourist brochures are for a discount leaflet.",
          "You can get discount coupon from some magazines at the hotel. You might get 1 if you're lucky. The attraction itself is average, typical viewing point from high ground. The window frames for viewing purpose are not big enough, thus it's not as awesome. Other than that, nothing",
          "Went up to 3rd floor. Pretty good restaurant for a drink with a view. Nice selection of souvenirs. Would return at night to see the sights.",
          "We went there because we had bought a \"2 attraction + Mt Moiwa\" pass and we didn't have the time to use it at more interesting place. The tower is extremely expensive and nothing interesting at all. It is very small so the view is so so. Just a tourist trap",
          "So.. I've been to Paris's Effiel Tower a couple of times.. Been to the very top (when they weren't on strike), and absolutely fell in love with Paris and the girl I brought up there.. Well this TV tower in Sapporo didn't quite give me the same sentiments.. Well.. It does look",
          "If you want some good exercise, walk up to the souvenir level and have some refreshment. Amazing array of sake from all over the country which you can buy. Head also to the basement of the tower for some good izakaya food.",
          "Take the elevator to the top. It is worth the 700 yen. The view is pretty, but probably only if there is snow on the ground. It definitely doesn't have the same pizzazz as Tokyo Tower or many of the others, but it's definitely worth a look. Check it out and see all the beauty",
          "One must be up there 70m higher to appreciate the grandeur of Odori Park at night. Unfortunately you can't really take good pictures up there because of the reflections on the protective glass screens.",
          "Small German Christmas market and food vendors for the first 2/3 of December. Light illuminations run through Dec, Jan, and Feb I believe. The park is good any time. The Tower serves as a useful landmark. Snow festival is also held in front of it during February. Enjoyable",
          "I was here in December and it was decorated like a Christmas tree with its many colorful lights. It was beautiful. I recommend seeing this tower from a distance since the view to the tower matches the green colored Odori park in front the tower well.",
          "Sapporo's Television Tower is a beloved landmark in the city. It's been around for years, and perhaps has seen better days. But on a good day, one can really get a bird's eye view of the city, and the park below. There are plenty of kitschy souvenirs to buy, if one is into that",
          "Good for a snapshot, and some souvenir shopping on the fourth (?) floor, but I see no reason to go up to the observatory if you've been to other NHK TV \"tower\" attractions in a Japanese city. The view of Sapporo at night from Mt. Moiwa (on a clear eve) or even that at the",
          "Japanese simply loves TV towers. This tower can be seen from different part of Odori park. In the day, it is an icon at the part. At night, It lights up the dark sky.",
          "I went there in winter after the Sapporo Snow Festival so the view wasn't as good as seen in others' photos. But nonetheless, it is a landmark in Sapporo. It is located at Odori Park and thus, easily accessible by the Sapporo Municipal Subway.",
          "This TV Tower is probably a Sapporo landmark. You can access to the top of the TV Tower and it will gives a sweeping view of Sapporo City. We didn't go up this time, because we will be viewing the Sapporo city from Mt Moiwa :) It is tall enough for us to see the TV Tower's",
          "This tower is tall enough to enable visitors to enjoy the magnificent views of the city with distant mountains clearly visible from the top. This is also due to a few taller buildings in Sapporo. The tower is located at one end of Odori Park which looks beautiful under sunlight.",
          "Yes, it's a tourist trap. The TV tower is one of the famous buildings in Sapporo and as a tourist one simply has to visit it. Just like many other towers it is jam packed with gift shops and the proprietors try to squeeze every last penny out of the visitors. That said, the",
          "The older, smaller cousin of Tokyo Tower offers excellent views of downtown Sapporo. The view is 360 degrees, and the cost is less than 1000 Yen. The time it would take to visit is under 30 minutes. There were no crowds or waiting times during our visit which was at a weekend.",
          "We went in the afternoon and was greeted by the view of the whole stretch of Odori Park. With the blue sky as background, it was a picture prefect view.",
          "A not so tall tv tower...lol It's easily access from odori park or nijo market. There is a clock on the tower and admission fees is needed to enter the observatory level.",
          "Great photo place if u stand a bit further away as it is a landmark and easy to navigate using it as landmark.",
          "Sapporo Tower is built in 1957, is a 147.2 metre high TV tower with the height of 90.38 metres. Around the Sapporo Tower is located in the Odori Park. While we went up the Sapporo Tower you will find many souvenir that we can buy and a very beautiful views to look at.",
          "This tower located at the end of the Odori park is a nice example of steel structures. You can see it from a distance and it is a well known landmark of the city.",
          "One can see this Landmark from far and it does not get any more impressive getting close. Shops, restaurants and observation deck \u2013a mini Effel Tower. Average.",
          "Nothing much but just for photography and nicer to take it from far too. Basically just another must visit in Sapporo.",
          "We went to Sapporo on our Honeymoon, so TV tower gives off a little of the Romantic ambience of Paris. Great for couples.",
          "If you want to see the Sapporo famous view , you should visit. Also in the summer time, there was Beer Garden in front of the tower. The meat was very good so you should try. But if you ever visited Tokyo Tower, Tokyo Sky Tree, this Sapporo TV tower is very normal.",
          "I didn't go up to the observatory deck but it is quite relaxing to hang around the small park and have some food at the restaurant.",
          "On of the most popular place for tourists. very nice view on Odori park. Nice all seasons. in winter time you can see snow sculptures.",
          "The \"low cost\" eiffel tower is not that beautiful indeed. Nevertheless it turns charming at night with the illumination. You can enjoy the view point in the top of it (not free) by the sunset, worth going.",
          "Here is another lame Japanese tower that is not worth your time or your money. Give this place a skip and do something better with your time. Seriously, have you ever heard anyone tell you how amazing the sky line or cityscape of Sapporo is? I didn't think so.",
          "Built in 1957, this is a Sapporo icon. It's situated within Odori park. You can't miss it. Entrance is reasonable and you get a really good view of Sapporo from the observation deck. I went in the summer during the Lilac festival so the view was quite nice. On a good day you",
          "We had just completed our ski trip to Niseko and we're looking forward to spending 4 nites in Sapporo to wind down. The Sapporo TV tower wasn't a top priority but since it's just there at Odori Park, it didn't make sense to skip it. On the day we walked to Odori park , we were",

          "I ended up going with a group of friends because they were keen to check it out, and I didn't mind going along. There is an extensive souvenir shop on the floor you line up for the elevator that takes you up to the top, so if you're in need of more Shiroi Koibito's, or just",
          "Located in the center of towm ideal for panoramic views of city. Even better when the Snow Festival is on. Worth the trip up - tip - put your camera on movie and film through the glass side walls as you go up.",
          "We just happened to walk by on our first day of exploring Sapporo and thought we should check it out. It was a common attraction I came across online while researching the city so it seemed like a good idea. We were at the TV tower for only around 10 minutes, it was a nice view",
          "Definitely worth a visit wonderful views across Sapporo can be seen on a clear day, I think arriving early in the day is probably best",
          "Definitely a tourist trap. Visited on first day of Snow Festival. Nice views, but the set-up for moving people through the tower made it feel like we were being rushed and herded.",
          "The view of Sapporo city from the Sapporo TV Tower is beautiful. From the tower, you can have a nice view of Odori Park, mountains and ofcourse Sapporo city. I visited the tower at night and enjoyed the Sapporo city all lighted up. You can spend an hour plus taking photos or",

          "We went to Sapporo last Dec to see the TV Tower by night at winter time. It was completely different when visit here in other time and you would enjoy the joyful atmosphere around despite of the cold weather at night. Highly recommend you to come here in time for the White",

          "Went up to the top of this just 3 days after going up in the Eiffel Tower. So it sort of suffers by comparison, but on the other hand: 1) No crowds, no waiting, no ordering tickets months in advance 2) Much cheaper I had just wandered over (was strolling through Odori Park",
          "Compared to other \"tower\" type attractions in Japan, this one certainly isn't anything special. But, it is kind of fun to visit an older tower to see what was all the rage in the 1960's. Of course, there is a nice view of Odori park and the rest of Sapporo, but if you are",
          "Looks so much like the Tokyo Tower. It is beautifully litted at night, and changes into various colour. Sapporo TV Tower is located in Odori Park, within a stone's throw from Sapporo's other famous tourist attractions.",
          "Not so tall, but worth spending half an hour to see. As i've got, it's remarkably old (1957?), but looks like it's the reason of specific atmosphere there. Very nice.",
          "Located on the eastern end of the Odori Koen park this is a 147m tower which I believe is trying to mimic the Eiffel tower, although somewhat poorly. I saw it briefly while visiting Odori park and found it fairly underwhelming. I wouldn't recommend people loose sleep if their",
          "Definitely worth checking out, both in daytime and nighttime. Perhaps even more in nighttime, as the lit-up Odori Park and other streets looks really nice in the dark. Also a great place to the see the cherry blossoms or autumn colours if u are visiting during either of those",
          "The Sapporo TV tower is at the east end of Odori Park. The observation deck gives a spectacular view of Sapporo's East., North, South and West sides. One can see Mt. Moiwa and the Ski Jump Station in the distance. The observation deck is a little crowded with so many souvenir",

          "A smaller version of the Eiffel Tower. You get a good view of Odori Park westwards with the Okura Ski Jump in the distance. But that's about it. The view from the JR Tower is better, in my opinion. If you intend to visit the Tower and Mt Moiwa for high level views of Sapporo,",
          "We have got up the TV tower during the day, the weather was nice and sunny so we could see the city and the surroundings. The view of Odori park is nice, you can take pictures of the city, cars and people. From the tower we noticed the ferry wheel which we didn't know about",
          "This TV Tower dates from the 1960's when every Japanese city of any merit was putting up towers. No better than most, a little expensive for just the view which can be enjoyed from one of the top floor restaurants or bars at one of the nearby hotels for free. Invest the price",
          "The entrance fee was pretty steep and unfortunately all the commentary in the elevator was in Japanese. I went up during the Snow Festival. The view of Odori Park and Mt Moiwa was really pretty.",
          "the tv tower isnt very high up, but given that it is located in the middle of odori park, it gives a very nice overall view of central sapporo. It had a great view of the sapporo white illumination in december and i can imagine the wonderful view it will have during the snow",
          "It's another tower in another city. The excitement level can only get so high. You are able to see the lights of Odori Park from the air which is nice but otherwise, this is not the highest of towers. I would not repeat this again. I think the price should be less than half",
          "It's pretty standard for the genre of attractions. Just a viewing platform with the gift shop taking up most of the viewing area. Still its nice, and the staff was nice and put the elevator commentary on in English. We went up at Night and the Ski Jump and other lights were",
          "You can see the view of Odori park from here and also sapporo city view. They have TV family(Terebi kazoku) characters inside. so cute.You can also get the clock tower coin from the vending machine on the observatory deck.",
          "Did not go up to the top level but from the bottom, it resembles any other tv tower in Japan. It would be better at nights with the lightings on the tower.",
          "I travelled with my husband and 10 year old daughter. The view is quite amazing and we especially enjoyed the look over the Park as everything was getting ready for the Snow Festival. Staff here were very friendly and went out of their way after my daughter left her gloves on",
          "It was drizzling when I visited the TV Tower. As such, the visibility was not great. However, still managed to get a great view of the Odori Park",
          "It is a nice tower just next to Odori Park . Marvellous View of the tower from Odori Park at night.Especially in winter, the view is nicer."

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River.

Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues.

          "Hokkaido University began as the Hokkaido Agricultural College. The gardens, established in 1886, are the second oldest botanical gardens in Japan. They are a joy to visit. As an Australian, I'm not accustmed o these trrees and plants from colder regions. There have a rose",
          "The gardens are quite pleasant for a stroll, but not overwhelmingly beautiful. Nice roses and other flowers.",
          "There is so much more that just gardens here - there are also a few small museums with information on the history of the Ainu people, animals of region, and local history. If you like gardens, you'll probably go here anyway, but even if you don't, it is a lovely calm spot in the",
          "Such a beautiful place!!! You can walk the inner trail or outer trail, or wonder as you please. The only thing not maintained is the rose garden. Everything else was great. They also have an assortment of green houses. We really enjoyed the 2 museums inside as well. It was only",
          "Was a little disappointed with our visit, it isn't well maintained and most areas just looked over grown and messy. There were a few nice plants and its a nice place to stroll around but not really somewhere to pay for. Expect it is better at certain times of the year when",
          "Fairly poorly maintained. Lacked much interest and of little design merit. Possibly of interest if you are a botanist with some unusual varieties of plant species. It is a nice place to take a stroll and have a chat but otherwise little going for it.",
          "Who would think that there would be a small forest just a couple of blocks away from Odori Park? The transition from an urban setting to a shangri-la of forest cover was almost startling. We enjoyed some needed downtime as we strolled through wooded trails among endemic trees",
          "Decided to take a walk to the Botanic Gardens in Sapporo. 420 yen per person per entry! Gardens not taken care of. Total shambles and in disarray. Waste of time and money. First time I have given such a Low rating for anything in japan. Quite unexpected. Save your money for",
          "And they have a little poster showing what's in bloom and what section it's in. It's possible to walk around the whole garden and see everything. Don't miss the roses.",
          "We spent a very pleasant warm autumn morning strolling in the botanic gardens. Some late blooming roses were in flower. The gardens have lots of interesting foliage, including a Canadian rock garden and a hot-house; the water lilies were flowering.. Do not expect a formal",
          "We were very underwhelmed with our visit to the Botanical Gardens. There are so many beautiful parks and gardens in Japan an this just didn\u2019t compare to others we\u2019ve been to.",
          "Pretty in May, although we missed most of the cherry blossoms (a few were still blooming). We visited all the small museums, too, which we liked. It's fun to see the schoolkids, old and young, and a few salarymen and artists - just locals hanging out for the afternoon. Low",
          "Based on what we saw, the gardens must be beautiful in the summer months. Everything was bright green and the cherry blossoms were in full bloom.",
          "Visited in early August and there were not a lot of flowers. There was a lot of green grass and big trees and many well marked paths to walk. If you like to walk this is great place to go. There was a nice rock garden and a couple of small museums that had interesting",
          "These botanic gardens, which include an arboretum, natural woodland, and two small museums, are well worth a visit and make a pleasant morning or afternoon's walk.",
          "Whenever we travel we love to see the local botanical gardens. This one was incredibly disappointing--it had nothing special. in fact, the nicest flowers were in a bed outside of the front gate. It cost a bit to get in for our large group and we were wishing we had walked",
          "A very relaxing garden with beautiful trees surrounding the pond. I notice that there are some koi fishes swimming freely in the pond. Another season of beautiful blooms with vibrant colours.",
          "We spent about two hours here in the morning, an easy walk from our hotel in Sapporo. It was relaxing and enjoyable, with labels on the trees and plants and with a museum that focused largely on animals and birds rather than plants. Some interesting old buildings. Not a great",
          "There were not many flowers in the Botanic Garden of Hokkaido University when I visited on 23 May 2017, although the lilacs were supposed to be in season. However, the greenery still made for a pleasant stroll. I was also surprised and pleased to see a small Ainu museum within",
          "This is a beautifully laid out garden with a small but very engaging museum of the Ainu and other northern peoples in the garden grounds. Even if it is accused of being off the track for visitors, it shouldn't be. Though small and less formal, this is one of best gardens we",
          "If being away from the tourist trail appeals, then I could recommend this garden. Highlight was the small but informative Ainu museum, which showcased various well preserved artifacts of the northern indigenous Ainu people. The gardens are well kept and worth strolling around.",
          "When we visited all the places was covered by snow and give us a sense o Christmas! Incredible. We meet a professor of the University that explain how to circulate in the space of University.",
          "It was a nice walk from Sapporo station eve though it was cold and rainy. The park was closed so we didn't get to walk inside the park but viewed from outside. It was worth it.",

          "These gardens were not at their best in mid autumn but there was enough autumn colour to give a good idea that they would be even prettier at other times of year. They are relatively extensive however, and very pretty for a central city area. There are several museum/collection",
          "Had some super super fresh and delicious sushi. Small stall in Nijo market. The owner meticulously prepare the sushi and we just chow it down in less than 5sec! Not to be missed!",

          "My rating reflects a superb tiny museum located on this garden's grounds rather than the 33-acre Botanic Garden itself. The Northern Peoples Museum focuses on the culture of the Ainu, Japan's indigenous people. Its one room includes displays of beautiful garments and a",
          "I rarely give less than four rings but this doesn't deserve more than two. It was uncared for, unkempt and not representative of the high quality parks in Sapporo. I was tempted to start weeding the shrubbery first then the ethnobotanical area, both were in poor state. Flowering",
          "I visited the gardens in mid/late June. I was interested in the little Ainu museum there, so seeing that and having a park to wander around in afterwards made it a great way to spend the morning. Park maps are available in English and Japanese; I can't remember if any other",
          "It's a nice place to walk, rather quiet except for the birds. Can be a nice way to spend an hour or two. Entrance fee is JPY420 per person. Do bring mosquito repellents though. I guess it's a summer thing.",
          "Walking through this garden is a real inspiring event. For one finds the number of unique plants, flowers and trees here as an inspiration for quiet meditation.",
          "We had a whole day before leaving for the airport so we chose to spend the morning at this Botanical Garden at Hokkaido University. What a treat!!!! Loved seeing all the roses, lotus and water lily flowers, and the tropical foliage. Not only was it a Botanical garden, but",
          "Of you're onterested in plants or just want to relax a bit from the city around, this garden is worth a visit. We visited on start of May, when not many flowers were visible yet. But there are some cherry trees, which were full of flowers at that time. Entrance fee is ca. 400",
          "This is a lush and well laid out garden with nice trails and two museums, both rather small. One has a collection of Ainu artifacts. the other has a set of taxidermy animals and documentation of a historic trip to the arctic with sled dogs.",
          "Wanted to go and wander around tha park but it was closed for the winter months, apparently it closes in November and opens the end of April and seems it is always closed on a Monday. We took the opportunity and walked around the fence line to see as much as possible, a lot of",

          "We visited the Botanic Gardens in Sapporo to waste some time just prior to leaving. But after visiting, we wonder why this wasn't more highly recommended to us. The gardens are a decent size and show off all the typical Hokkaido trees and shrubs marked with their various names",
          "With a Y420 entry fee it would have been nice if it was a better park. On my visit the autumn colours were on display and the large trees made the ground quite relaxing. However, the whole park didn't quite seem to work well - possibly because it is a botanic garden/park and",
          "This is a large and interesting garden which is typical of a city centre garden in Japan. It has a great deal of trees and walkways and worthwhile visiting but nothing special",
          "The garden itself was lovely and the western style buildings dotted around were a nice addition to the scenery.",
          "Amazing park! I prefer the inside the building flora. Good location, work not all days in year. have to visit!",
          "We have visited this garden on 29 April and this is the first day the garden re-opens after the long winter. As such, this is not the best time to see garden species despite that you have to pay 400 yen as entrance fee to this garden. Apart from the greenhouse, rose garden and",
          "3-1/2 stars We spent a leisurely hour in the gardens on a mid-summer's morning. The small Ainu exhibit (i.e. Northern Peoples Museum) was a worthwhile for its exposition (however limited) of native tools, clothing, and customs. The gardens themselves were pleasant but seemed",
          "Our kayaking trip as canceled because of the weather so we went to the botanic gardens for a couple of hours, hoping that the rain would hold off that long. Compared to gardens of historical importance in Kyoto and elsewhere on Honshu, it is a bit disappointing. The rose garden",
          "True to its nature, this botanic garden is more of a teaching garden than a show garden. No much done to make the place attractive; a good variety of trees and plants for interested visitors. Clear labels and tags for all plants everywhere, but in Japanese only except for the",
          "A great little garden in the middle of the city. Interesting museum on the Ainu people and history on the local botanists of Sapporo. No wow factor, but worth a stroll around if you're visiting.",
          "These gardens set in the centre of Sapporo are worth a visit. There are many sections to the gardens, a map is provided when you pay the entrance fee, which is minimal . There are many large trees and one we had not seen before was the Dove tree with its interesting flowers. The",
          "This garden encompasses a city block, so the size is manageable. We spent about an hour walking the paths on a recent rainy day. The roses were still in bud, but many shrubs and flowers were in bloom. Plants are marked in Japanese and also with their Latin names. The Canadian",
          "From the reviews on TA and elsewhere, I was expecting a beautiful garden, what I got what just average. It is lush and green, with many labeled plants, shrubs, trees, flowers, herbs, but much of it is under cared for, overgrown, under watered where it needed it. It was a",
          "There is an interesting museum with some stuff local animals (wolves and bears), and an exhibit about some minority people. The gardens themselves were a bit run down, and to be honest, not that interesting. You have to buy your ticket from a machine, then give the ticket",
          "Having been to many botanical gardens I have to say this one is pretty average. Maybe it is the time of the year, but I was definitely not impressed. For example, the 'Rock Garden' was literally piles of rubble with some shrubs. I expected something more manicured, reminiscent",
          "I particularly enjoyed the rose garden, but it was lovely to simply ramble around the grounds and get lost. Everything was lush and green, and it wasn't overly crowded with tourists. Interesting historical museum and exhibit of local wildlife (wolves, owls, etc).",
          "This was the one place visited which was poor as their was an entrance fee and the free gardens were better maintained.Most of the plants in the greenhouse were dead or dying ,flower beds overgrown with weeds.cannot recommen",

          "Hokkaido University Botanic Garden is near Keio Plaza Hotel where we stayed. Once we decided to came there and did not regretted. There are many kinds of flora in limited space. We liked little museum that is in the garden territory. I recommend to come there in hot summer day.",

          "The Garden is well maintained, very clean, as expected in Japan. A variety of plants blossom over many months. One can spend a few relaxed hours there for a reasonable entrance fee.",
          "fun to walk through in the winter. the big area wasn't open so only the greenhouse, but for sure worth going to if you're a fan of plants. the full experience will surely be better in non-winter months",
          "Very beautiful garden, with a small Ainu musium and a greenhouse. We've spend a couple of hours wandering around. Absolutely worth the visit",
          "Walking distant from Hokkaido University or from Former Hokkaid\u014d Government Office. Nice quiet with different plant zones and a small beautiful rose garden.",
          "A beautiful experience among trees, flowers, fountains and peaceful silence.\nHere you can find a beautiful museum of Japanese animal species too, including the Ezo Okami (Canis Lupos Hattai Kishida), the extinct endemic Japanese wolf.\nIf you are looking for nature, history, silence and meditation, this is the right place!!!",

          "It\u2019s got 2 really interesting museums, on Ainu and one on animals and live in Hokkaido 100 years ago. The ethno section of plants is also I retesting. The greenhouse is small but cute and the overall park pleasant to walk through. Garden and plants could be kept up better",
          "Two small greenhouses with many plants and cute succulents, available in winter.",
          "Cool place for nature lovers. The museum looked small but the exhibit is large enough to appreciate the wildlife. The park is big but the summer blossoms are too little. I have seen enough real Christmas trees but I am looking for more colorful flowers, such as roses and tulips.",

          "I came during the summer so there were interesting plants and flowers available to see. Touring the entire place would take about an hour and a half, so llan your trip wisely. \n\nWhat I didn't like about this place though was there was minor English translations for the plants as well as the exhibits in the museums.",

          "Really peaceful garden area. Nicely curated and tended collection of plant species. Big trees, with lots of shade in the summer.",
          "Beautiful park with an incredible array of old trees. The history of Hokkaido's benefactors can be felt here. A nice stop in the morning from 9:00 am before catching your flight home. Museums on site need some sprucing up with a few more \u2026",
          "Beautiful and well kept. There's an alpine garden, canadian rock garden, tropical house, shrubbery garden, rose garden, herbs garden and much more. I easily spend two hours here and enjoy watching the crows taking a bath in the small rivers and ponds.",

          "Joyous feeling when I was there! Entrance to the free open space area gives off the feel of being at a theme park. I found the toy musuem inside the building (second floor) to be enjoyable, displaying toys from the past (my generation). And of cos the shop area to buy the food",
          "It reminds me of the first time I entered Disneyland Tokyo. Though not as intricate but it does the same, send you back to a different time and place.",
          "Everything looks so pretty at Shiroi Koibito Park. The park is free. However, the factory tour cost 600 yen which is ok. Plenty of pretty photo opportunities and to spend a couple of hours in Sapporo. There\u2019s also a shop in the park that you can purchase chocolates, ice",
          "We visited on July 12 which was supposedly the first day all the renovated areas were open. It was a beautiful mini theme park, tudor architectures, beautiful flower garden. We took the premium factory tour not knowing what it was. The premium tour started with a short video",
          "We didn\u2019t know what to do and where to go on our second day in Sapporo. I found this place randomly on Google and decided to pay a visit. And little did we know it was a free park. Yay! When we enter, the entrance was under construction. It was hot and humid day, but not a huge",
          "A park that is really a big shop with nice decorations, when we visited the chocolate factory was not open so there was nothing much except take photos and buy chocolates, we stayed for 30 min and kids found it less interesting",
          "Good place to visit for Familiy ! No admission fee for Visitors, has many Photo spots for IG Mania, each Hour the Clock tower will have Puppet sing a performance thou is recording, many Flowers and background for Photo, has Cafe inside",
          "Shiroi Koibito Park is a chocolate and confectionery factory but the grounds where the factory stands has been turned into a beautiful park filled with seasonal flowers. For now it's roses. It is English-themed with mock Tudor architecture. We stayed for the performance of",
          "Nothing wow like Disney but for free it was ok. The store was closed but a smaller temporary gift shop was opened. I wished the had more places to sit and enjoy the roses.",
          "Beautiful Theme Park! Kids will like it! Good places for phototaking! Once here is enough! The ice cream and cakes tasted normal.",
          "Site under construction & there were not much flowers in the garden. Not much to do except there were some good photo-taking spots. The temporary gift shop is very small & pathetic. Can skip.",
          "Made a trip to this park only to find that the gift shop was under renovation and wil be open only in July. The temporary gift shop was really small. Not worth the trip. We ended up buying the soft serve ice cream because the weather was really hot. Too hot even for photo",
          "My second visit. The first one was quite interesting, having many good photo spots. This visit, however, is not interesting. The site is under construction. Few flowers especially in the main garden area. Nothing much to do when there is no flower.",
          "Took the Tozai Line and alighted at Miyanosawa station. From there, there were clear signages to reach Shiroi Koibito Park within a 10 minutes walk. Shopping mall, Seiyu is along the way. There were still many interesting sights for photo-taking and to see, despite the closure",
          "This is a theme-park like garden, and as the Chocolate factory is temporarily closed for renovations, only the garden is open to visitors. Once you enter the garden, you feel like in America. The design, setting, layout and architecture are all western in style. There is nothing",
          "As of 6APR19 the shop is moved to small temporary building and it's very disappointing... in APR and MAY it's yet too early to see rose gardens. Don't waste your time here. Wait until early July when the renovations will be completed.",
          "CLOSED FOR RENOVATION UNTIL JULY. Only outside garden open and hardly worth the effort. Don\u2019t come here until past July",
          "If your interest is to make chocolates and various pastries, then this place is for you. Shiroikoibito park is located in Miyanosawa, Sapporo, in Hokkaido. This park is not just a typical chocolate shop. It's actually a chocolate factory. If you're familiar with Charlie and the",
          "It is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered by travelers. It is good to know and what not to miss. The location is close to the Miyanosawa station, exit 5. There are many locations to take photo. Visitors will see confectionery production process and taste or shop.",
          "Take the Tozai subway line to the Miyanosawa stop. If you come out the front of the station, take a right and another right at the corner and you will see the Chocolate Factory. The park is right next to it. It cost 600 Yen for the factory tour, however the factory was closed",
          "It\u2019s a simple place, but managed very well. The customers are mainly foreign with a more aggressive manner than typical for Japan. This is a popular cookie in Japan, and I highly recommend getting your picture put on one of the cookie tins.",
          "The factory was closed so we could only see the museum. It's a perfect place for children. They have a big shop with many of their sweets which are very famous. Only sold in Hokkaido.",
          "The Park promotes Hokkaido\u2019s most famous heart shaped cookies. We came in a snowy night when the park was glamorously illuminated. Super crowded with mainland Chinese tourists. Even long lines to pay for gifts pick up from the shelves. As we came in late and did not have time to",
          "Beautiful and nice park to visit. Even more beautiful when lights are lit in snowfall. Unfortunately we couldn't visit the chocolate factory. A must-visit in Sapporo and don't miss to try the specialties in the cafe upstairs. The staff is very helpful and detailed in explaining",
          "the name of the park is shiroi kobito park and there is ishiya chocolate factory that sell value price chocolate originated sapporo that is very delicious. u can also make chocolate box with ur picture in it in various size and in many form for around 1.000 yen up. the park",
          "We loved the chocolates, candies & snacks there. So tasty & delicious. But the place was very crowded with tourist jostling to take pictures and buying chocolates..",
          "The outdoor is quite pretty to take photo but it is so crowded. There are some snacks which is only sold in the shop. Too crowded to walk properly inside. Can go to the 2nd floor for the cafe and to try ice cream.",
          "Park has a charm to it but it lacks something. The factory was under construction when we visited. The sweets, biscuits, and products of the factory is cheap and they have a tax free cashier too.",
          "I've been here..or anywhere in japan..since 20yrs ago.... .. japan is a must place to come every once a year for my family..but..for the 1st time ever..i came acrossed a very rude staff at the counter..she just dont understand english.. she think we want to eat the tax fee",
          "The factory is currently under renovation. So we cannot see the production line. Entrance is free There is a small park at the back which is good for photography. Young kids will love the small houses which they can only fit in. A 5mins walk from the train station. And",
          "I went there with a friend. We took train from Nakajima Koen Station, taking the GREEN Namboku Line to Odori Station. Then, we took the ORANGE Tozai Line to Miyanosa Station. From Miyanosawa station, we walked through a mall and had an approximately 10mins walk to get ourselves",
          "Well, the factory is under renovation. Hence, no production line visiting is provided. Small park which is a nice place for photography. Their ice cream, marshmallows and chocolate drink are great! Good place to shop for Shiroi Koibito products as they provide an array of items",
          "I\u2019m a big fan of the biscuit since young and have saw a lot of pictures of the actual factory . Always on my bucket list to come here.Finally I\u2019m here to visit! Dream came true. I reached at around 1pm...I came from Otaru via JR and stopped at Hassamu JR Station . It\u2019s abt",
          "Our 2 year old was over the moon with this place. There are many little wooden houses kids can go in and out of to entertain themselves. We opted to skip the chocolate lounge and go for cookie decorating once inside. We didn't have a reservation but they were able to get us in",
          "It ws nice to see how the chocolates were made and also the park has many sculptures and winter Christmas decorations during Dec.",
          "We didn\u2019t spend a long time here. Factory is under renovation so nothing much to really view. Mainly shopped at the retail stores. It\u2019s a short walking distance to reach there from the station.",
          "The setting is children friendly and the whole outer area of this Park is filled with colourful flowers and grren plants. The only regret is the Chocolate Factory was closed for maintenance so we missed the chance to see the production. It's a very unique and nice for taking",
          "I was unsure about visiting this place as my research just mentioned its a factory and a rose garden. I'm glad we decided to go as the Garden turned out to be really nice, with little wooden houses in every nook and corner which my young kids enjoyed it very much. We were lucky",
          "This is a park made for families. Nice for photo ops. Place was colourful enough. Don\u2019t miss out the rose garden and having watched a show around 5 pm at the tower. Even though the chocolate factory and exhibit was close during our visit I find time to be amazed at how this park",
          "Famous factory of cookies & cakes is located in the park. Explore the building with a restaurant on top & exhibits inside. At certain times of the day, there are shows on the tower. The park is beautiful, full of flowers",
          "My wife and I visited Shiroi koibito Park in July, we could enjoy many photos taken inside and outside the park! The tour to study is the history of chocolate making was so fun!",
          "Visited this place for its flower and well known garden. The place is very colourful due to the flowers. The flowers were blooming so nicely until at first sight I thought they were fake. Do try their soft serve ice cream after walking and taking photos at the garden. If you nv",
          "We took a chuo-bus tour that included the shiroi koibito park. The production line was being renovated so the tour company provided us with a box of cookies. We happen to be there for the music show at 4pm with mechanics and cute animals. It was interesting but better when",
          "You could almost forget you were in Japan on entering this amazing Chocolate park with the buildings reminiscent of German influence. What a fabulous area for kids & adult choc-a-holics to visit. The outside area is visually charming with a rainbow of colour to entice you to",
          "Good place for kids as well as getting the famous chocolate from Hokkaido. The entire place is well decorated for the kids and there is the cafe that serves dessert as well. Kids will enjoy it for sure and I guess some ladies who love chocolate will love this place as well.",
          "We felt that this place was some sort of Disneyland for chocolates and cookies. Every nook and cranny of this park is visually charming. Children and adults alike will enjoy this enchanting place. I\u2019m glad that this was included in our itinerary, we really had fun.",
          "Good place to bring children. For a small fee you can decorate your own biscuit with chocolate. Good activity for children of all ages. The Rose garden was really beautiful and the hourly music and bubbles Show was nice.",
          "Shops, cafe and their cookies making classes are still opened, free admission until the renovation is complete. There are limited editions of their cookies which are only available there and not anywhere else.",
          "We went and it was nice to see the grounds and all the flowers, and have dessert in the cafe. We also make cookies and decorated them by joining special classes. We all enjoyed it. But then we were done in 90 mins. The manufacturing section is under renovations. We took the",
          "Read that this is one of a popular visit place in Sapporo but possibly its meant mostly for young children. The buildings are more a fantasy \"disney\" type buildings. There is really nothing much for season travelers. The cookies and white chocolate for sale is one of the main",
          "I went during a rainy day but it doesn't kill the great view of the park. Although the rose exhibition just over, but it was still there, not so great, but bearable. I particularly like the ice cream and parfait served at the top floor where you can watch the clock tower show at",
          "Very touristy but still worth a visit. It's the factory of the famous snack Shiroi Koibito (\u767d\u8272\u604b\u4eba) showcasing their development and production line. Normally an entrance fee applies but that day when we went, the production line area was closed for renovation so we didn't have to",
          "I visited hokkaido in May with my husband. There we got information from the our tour guide that Shiroi Koibito is a pretty famous chocolate in Hokkaido because the tastes so good. Curiosity led us to go visit there. At that time weekend so many visitors who come. The first",
          "The park has the many facilities such as cookies making, visit the assembly line, many architectural buildings around, museums, musical parades, sweet, ice cream biscuits to taste and eat, flowers and small garden to take photo. A place for the family, need to spend at least 1-2",
          "This place is good for photo takings. Around certain timings, they had musical parades.everything was sweet in here, be it food or visuals. Candy ferris wheel (self paid), Shiroi Koibito ice cream, chocolates, candies, museum, dining place. mmmmmm",
          "it is a gem of place for sweets and treats.. there is a cake factory and a choclate place and a sweet candy place.",
          "My family and I had a great time at this place. There\u2019s a museum on how their famous cookies are produced (factory is closed for renovations now so cannot view production line). Can take the tram to go round the park (interesting for young children). Best of all, you can take",
          "Definitely a place where you can spend time taking lots and lots of photos both inside and outside. Even has a play area for children on the 2nd floor of the building. As the production line is under renovation, there is no factory tour. Only a gallery tour where you learn how",
          "Last minute decided to add this place to our itinerary and it was a right choice. We were on route to Otaru from Sapporo. Since we didnt have breakfast in the hotel, I decided to drop by this place for breakfast as well as to visit the souvenir shops. In the end, we spent close",
          "There are a lot of chocolates that is only sold in Shiroi Koibito Park. Should buy everything here because you will not see them in anywhere else except in this park. They are so good so tasty so delicious!",
          "We were there last week. The factory level is closed for renovations so the park is free. The kids still got to try their hands on cookie making (cookie dough rolling and cutting or baking and icing around 1000yen each child.parent can go in for free to help young child). The",
          "My family read about this place and decided to visit this chocolate factory. It was about 10 minutes from the nearest subway station. We paid for a great 1 hour cookie-making experience. There were also many nice photo taking opportunities if you are a fan of this delicious",
          "Admission is free now as the factory is currently closed for renovation. Still good to visit their retail shops as they have items that is avail only at Shiroi Koibito Park. Prices of biscuits are same across many places such as airports, hotel lobby shops etc. Some photo op at",
          "Amazing place and alone good enough a reason to return to Sapporo with the whole family' from the hourly spiel of the clock tower to the cookie baking and the museum this place is fun' some of the restaurant staff needs customer training however' only reason this turns out to be",
          "This place is great for taking so many photos for your keepsake of your trip to Sapporo. The buildings are very picturesque and they have lots of beautiful flowers in the pocket areas, the biggest of which is near the entrance. They have a lot of miniature houses scattered",
          "The factory name is not thought of by chance. As the founder was pondering about the name, he saw the white snow pouring fown and a romantic lovers in sillouhette \u2014 and then became shiroi (white) and koibito (lovers). A visit to shiroi koibito park and factory gave a light",
          "It's an interesting visit, and what could be enjoyable than to get the shiroi koibito famous cookies from the factory itself. The park has a huge open air puppet theatre set up on the estate to entertain visitors, and across the street, it extends its wings with a football pitch",
          "Nothing you would expect unless it was a movie. This place was wonderful, amazing and fun. A history of the chocolate made in Japan along with a history collection of magical stuff. It should be a museum but it's a chocolate factory.",
          "I went on the evening of Christmas Eve. The park was decorated with beautiful lights in the garden, and was also very festive inside. Inside you can see the history of Shiroi Kobito, and see the chocolates being made in the factory. There are also some workshops where children",
          "We had a great time. My kids age 5 & 8 loved it. We took the train there, it was super convenient with a blue sign from the station showing us all the way to the chocolate factory. Walking inside a shopping mall to the nearest exit was a great deal of help that day. As it was",
          "We experienced the most magical and spectacular moments half an hour before its closing. There was this musical light performance whereby the outdoor park became alive! It was very suitable and exciting for children.",
          "Traveled from Odori Station to Miyanosawa Station via the Tozai Subway Line and walked for about 10 minutes to reach Shiroi Koibito Park. No other tourist attractions nearby as it is situated in a quiet residential/industrial area filled with grey buildings and houses plus small",
          "Both the adults and children loves the place. It feels like a amusement park outside the factory. Inside the factory, you can see how the famous Hokkaido snacks are made. At the end, you can buy these souvenirs back. There is a pastry shop where you can sit and relax with a cup",
          "The chocolate factory is a bit way off from the nearest station, a small factory. The chocolate wafer is super nice but it is available everywhere in Sapporo, need not be here to buy. The only things unique here perhaps are the customized box that you can take it back as a",
          "Visiting this place is a sweet treat for the palate and a feast for the eyes. On the way in, you'll appreciate the classic European-style architecture and the decor. The flower gardens and fountain area just so lovely with gargantuan roses of different colors. Inside, you can",
          "Nice design for last Christmas, beautiful during night time when all the lights are switched on. Must go for the parfait and the tea set. The chocolate drink is so rich that my family enjoyed it so much\ud83d\ude0d. Crowded with tourist will recommend to come early :) You need to pay for",
          "One star because it\u2019s nothing exciting and on top of that, u have to pay entrance fee for nothing that value add. I actually love to eat Shiroi Koibito Snacks, just that this can be easily bought anywhere. And there were tonnes of rude tourists around which didn\u2019t make the",
          "If you've got kids, or aren't so interested in a) old cups and boxes b) pretty boring explanations of chocolate making c) a distant look at a sleepy factory production line....skip the tour. The shop/the gardens (in any season) and of course the cafe and DIY kitchen on the top",
          "Shiroi Koibito is a famous chocolate factory at Sapporo. Beside the chocolate factory have a amazing small park for all visitor to have fun and take photo.",
          "We went to the Shiroi Koibito Chocolate Factory and museum as a must see on our trip to Sapporo. It was very interestng with a wonderful collection of antique chocolate cups, and of-course the chocolate production. Several photo opportunities, including a potrait reproduced on",
          "Great park with a Giant Snowman at winter, We visited their Ishiya Chocolate factory too... very entertained park n factory ... must visit place while you\u2019re in Sapporo ... \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",
          "Visited around 10am and there was not much crowd. Went to the cookie hands on workshop and enjoyed the time there. Able to take many photos. The cafe served yummy food. Make sure to order the hot chocolate drink. Bought many souvenirs. Do not skip their famous shiroi koibito",
          "The place is patterned after an European mishmash of castles. Clearly, the place is designed for kids and a nice place to have your pictures taken. They also sell yummy treats and the famous white biscuits \u201cshiroi kobito\u201d that Sapporo is very famous for. There is also a huge",
          "Good for families coz kids can play and make cookies. But need to reserve for classes. Quaint and authentic items on display. Cafe has great sweets and tea sets",
          "Second time to visit this chocolate factory park. This time we had more time to visit as we came not by tour group but we took subway to reach there . Very close to the subway on foot and once we got out from the station it was very heavy snow rain . We visited until dark around",
          "Shiroi koibito Park has many attractions are worth photographing. Especially during winter session, the outdoor section does have nice sculptures against the white snowy background. Making it fantastic for photos. The indoor section, is more of an educational self service",
          "Worth to visit while in Sapporo The illumination in the evening is very beautiful May also visit the factory",
          "Nice building and self serving tour with a lots of tourists. The simple they gave you is good and you can buy more at the store . On the third floor there is a restaurant for sweets but it was full with a long waiting line. Outside was a nice park with illuminations and a show",
          "It's a must visit place when you are in Hokkaido or Sapporo and must try the white chocolate. They have schedule when the toys in the garden are playing & moving, so cute....",
          "As a chocolate factory tour it was disappointing, yet the park itself was great for my son and the bars and cookie making classes very enjoyable. Make sure you book the class in advance and enjoy the sweets!",
          "Went in mid Dec 17. A lovely park layout, plenty of scenes for photo posing & taking. Fluffy snow everywhere, the kids were so happy to grab & play. You can go into the shopping area to heat up from the cold and buy chocolate cookies for gifts.",
          "The chocolate factory has many amenities and activities designed for family and kids. Kids will surely enjoy themselves here in the theme park. We only had time to visit the shop and customized a box of chocolate cookie with our own picture with Mt. Yotei taken a few days back",
          "Arrive early morning to avoid crowds. We went there late April, the garden still looked pretty bare. Nevertheless, it still has many nice photo spots. We also enjoyed the hot chocolate and Shiroi Koibito soft serve at the restaurant. Its famous langue de chat are sold at many",
          "It's an ok place to visit if you're a big fan of their chocolates. Th e most interesting part to us was the toy museum. Parking is free, chocolate samples are delicious and you can get confectionaries which you don't usually get at the airport. Recommend a visit if you have an",
          "This is a bit of a must-go on many websites. The route there is so well sign-posted from the subway, it speaks of its popularity. We like the chocolates, but we didn\u2019t quite see the point of the factory. The displays themselves are pretty, but don\u2019t show you very much of the",
          "Building is europa Style inside give toys museum a cake/candy and souvenir shop Must try some cookies a chocolate a home Made soft ice cream",
          "Place is well decorated for photo collection. Did not do the factory tour as there is fee and my kids are beyond that to be excited. Interesting toy museum collection if you can relate to them. Main shop lobby packed with tourist to buy their famous cookies. Anyway, these can",
          "I thought this would be just for kids, but I'm loving it! I enjoy the tour especially the beautiful cups, deco, cakes make from chocolates and the musical display at the park. Try out the pop corn flavors, is good. And of course, the chocolate biscuit is tasty! We went to a",
          "Easy access using public transport. Need to look out for timing for lesson, but can be expensive as it is mainly decorative type but it the experience for kids. The cafe is located with a nice view and if during 6pm can see the clock tower show from a different angle. The so",
          "It's a good experience for the kids. Nice decor for photo shooting. Got workshop for kids to do cookies but not cheap",
          "I was really excited to visit this museum since I\u2019m a big fan of chocolate and particularly of langue de chat were produced from this factory. Everytime my dad visited us in Canada from Japan, he would by a box of langue de chat. You need to take the Tozai line to go to",
          "Facade of the park was breathtaking. Very nice especially at night time. There was even a musical show played at the clock tower. Funny though, the chocolates available at the ground floor were limited. I mean, most of it were just choices of the usual chocolate covered",
          "Beautiful exterior decoration. Limited choice of cholocate & confectionery. There is a small museum on 2nd floor. And a very aquarium with many beautiful angel like sea creature \"clione\"",
          "30 mins train from Sapporo JR train station. The snow covered garden is beautiful. The chocolate factory self tour is average but there's a wide selection of souvenirs from candies to chocolate biscuits at the end that you can purchase. A must visit for your trip to Hokkaido.",
          "Visited during winter and the views outside were fun, along with the hourly music played at the clock tower. Inside the museum has a collection of antiques and also a walkway displaying how chocolate cookies were made in the past (with english subtitles). Another great",
          "We took a train there and initially worried if its hard to find. This is by far the easiest as there are signs everywhere to tell you where to go. thumbs up !! hope they can do more for other attractions. kids enjoyed. worth a visit.",
          "We stopped at this place on our way back to Sapporo from Otaru. It was a visit well worth. We were awed by its Christmas lightings and decorations. There are many good spots for photo takings. My kids were delighted!",
          "The park is beautiful but it was snowing. Children couldn't play. This is inside the Ishiya Chocolate Factory.",
          "First i think somehow like a theme park But when i got there, there is a factory of shiroi koibito with mini garden Great views",
          "The chocolate factory is not a big attraction. It is better suit for family with little children. There is a big playground at the main entrance. My family spent about two hours there, having delicious ice cream for lunch.",
          "The Christmas lights exhibition was perfect when we went here, especially when Libera\u2018s songs were playing in the background. It was made all the more perfect because it was snowing when we went here! TIP: go here at around 4pm to see the Christmas lights exhibition. It is nice",
          "Firstly, the park was great when you enter it. With beautiful decorations and many picture worthy places, it was rather cute. The reception was welcoming and they even give you a free welcome biscuit after you buy your ticket. The walkthrough of the history of chocolate was",
          "Opinions differed and I am sure there's plenty of people who love this park and make it their number one visit for Sapporo. Different strokes for different folks. I am not really much into dessert, and most of the their items can be obtained elsewhere in Sapporo and airport",
          "Even if you\u2019re not familiar with the cookies or want to do the formal tour, a visit around the noon hour can be interesting since there\u2019s an animatronic show outside in the clock tower and nearby buildings. Free and fun!",
          "We arrived at 5.40pm and missed the tour in the chocolate Factory. The last tour was scheduled at 5pm. But we saw the lighting outside the Factory. It was pretty with a big Christmas tree.",
          "I don't know why it's listed in shopping, it's only a small shop, the rest of the factory is an attraction so it should be a thing to do, and in my opinion it's the most amazing thing to do in Sapporo. I felt like Charlie in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. The self-guided tour",
          "A must-visit for Hokkaido confectionery lovers. You can buy Ishiya products here and visit factory at the same time. There is a lovely park out side which is crowded during Christmas. Try chocolate soft ice cream.",
          "Came here during rainy day... planned to take lots of pics but unfortunately that day was totally wet, so we couldnt get as many pics as possible. We had an afternoon tea inside the factory, the ice cream was nice but the financier ande brownie were dry. I personally didnt",
          "What not to love about this place. This is a perfect place to go when you are in Sapporo town. Either for alone, couples and even family with kids ad eldery. Great museum and property. The garden are beautiful and the cafe is so delicious. You should definitely try their",

          "The title \"park\" is a bit misleading, since this is a small complex of attractions, centred around the main drag, which is the Ishiya cake factory. If you, like me, are not Japanese this brand of cakes/biscuits is probably unknown to you, but they seem to be famous throughout",

          "I am not a person so much into chocolate, so I didn't find this place much impressive. The place tells you how they make their signature Shiroi Koibito chocolate. It was not boring but not that enjoyable for me. Anyway, you'd love it if you are chocolate lovers. In summer, there",

          "The factory visit is a little overrated and overpriced. 600yen for such a short visit is not exactly worth it. Taking pictures of the exterior is more interesting than the self tour of the factory. Souvenir prices are not factory prices as well. Same as what you pay outside.",

          "I LOVE IT!! Thought we'd only spend about 2 hours there but it wasn't enough (for 4 adults) cause we went to sign up for more workshops and spend lots of time checking out the garden area! Definitely worth the visit and it's a Must to go for the cookie workshop!!",
          "I am not a lover of chocolate, especially, white chocolate, since it is not really chocolate.  Anyway, this place would be great for kids, young ladies who love this brand.  But, not for tourists who look for nature or culture.",

          "A bit crowded. It has became a tourist trap already. In my opinion, the LeTao cookies taste better than the Ishiya cookies. Ever way, it's a fun experience to roam around the area and explore it. It's like a mini theme park.",

          "A very nice themepark for local chocolate brand \u767d\u8272\u604b\u4eba. Don\u2019t miss the garden musical shows at 10am sharp. Buy above 5,400 yen to get tax refund.",

        "wiki": "Asahiyama Memorial Park (\u65ed\u5c71\u8a18\u5ff5\u516c\u5712, Asahiyama Kinen K\u014den) is a park located in Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan. The park\u2019s peak, at 137.5 metres (451 ft) above sea level, offers a great panoramic view of Sapporo, and the Sea of Japan beyond.\n\n\n== History ==\nPrior to the construction of Maruyama Park, the area was the site of a farm, and later Sapporo Onsen. In 1946 ownership of the property was donated to Sapporo city. Twenty years later, in 1966, the park was taking form, when over 5,500 trees were planted. The park was finally opened in 1970 to commemorate Sapporo\u2019s 100th anniversary.\nSince 2004 the park was closed for redevelopment; the entire fountain and the square around it, were built in those years; it was reopened on April 29, 2009.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nLocated in the western extremity of Sapporo, the park\u2019s lookout, located 137.5 mt above sea level, is surrounded by sculpted gardens with a large lawn, fountain, a terraced Italian flowerbed, French geometric garden and Chinese arbor. Surrounding these are the Learning Forest, which offers hiking paths, with the background of Ezo alder, Ezo spruce, magnolia and false acacia trees.\nThe Asahiyama Memorial Park also contains a rest house, food and drink stands, a hanging bridge, playground, and space for kids. At night the illuminated fountain and lights of the buildings in central Sapporo beyond, create a popular spot for couples to enjoy the night views of Sapporo.\nThe park is also the venue of the Sapporo Asahiyama Music Festival held every year in July, with the background of the Toyohira Hanabi.\n\n\n== Access ==\nJR Bus (Nishi13): 15 minutes from Maruyama-K\u014den Station (T\u014dzai Line) to Asahiyama Koen-mae Bus stop, plus 5 minutes walk.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nwelcome.city.sapporo\nrera-sapporo",

          "I visited Mt. Moiwa during winter and it was disappointed to see fogs and could't see anything during at night. So this activity is not recommended to visit during Winter unless you wanna play ski there.",
          "An amazing experience to ring the \" Bell of Happiness\" at Summit Observatory. Much more if you attached a \" Love padlock\" to the fence of \" Bell of Happiness\". Spectacular panoramic view of Sapporo City from Summit.",
          "Japanese towns usually have one viewpoint on top of their biggest hills and Mt Moiwa is special in that it has two sections to it, the second half being with special half size cable cars that allow more people to see the nature around them than the normal ones. That said, we did",
          "Everything is made accessible, from street cars, to the shuttle bus to the ropeway and cable car going up the peak. A stunning view of Sapporon",
          "Getting to My Moiwa was a breeze. Alighting from Ropeway Iriguchi street car stop is a 3-min walk to the free shuttle bus to the cable car station. However, in winter, waiting for the bus could be challenge with little protection from the wind. Summer on the other hand was nice.",
          "Drove up to the mountain - mid point, before walking up the remaining 200 m. It is 660 Yen for the toll. It was extremely difficult to find the entrance, maybe I was searching for the wrong place. Only found the toll highway leading up to the mid-point on my third attempt,",
          "Boasts of a spectacular night view of the city. Going up with the 2 cable car rides is relatively quick even as we went in mid June 2019. There is a souvenir store but most visitors did not linger there. The cafe was closed when we were there at around 9 pm. Coming down took",
          "My finance and I had a great time here. It was one of the coldest spots we visited during the closing of winter season. Really cold! my fiance didn't like the cold so much so she mostly stayed inside to absorb some here. But the views here are great as you get to see a 360 view",
          "Beautiful scenery but long waiting for boarding ropeway. Went there about 8pm but nothing much to eat.",

          "If you have not experienced riding up a hilltop in an aerial ropeway cable car, this is the place to try it. If you have had that experience before, this is nothing new. In daytime, the view from the top is just commonplace. Nothing special. To make the trip worthwhile, it is",
          "Excellent views from the top. Highlight of Sapporo. Take the Mt Moiwa Ropeway. But don\u2019t expect to have a drink at the bar as you wait for sunset. Pretentious expensive restaurant has the best views, but no bar. Best to BYO.",
          "Despite the super long queue & cold weather when I visited, I enjoyed riding on the cable cars and the night view of sapporo is really pretty..",
          "Decided to do this in the late afternoon so I could see the sunset + night view. A definite recommendation but really start early! And don't stay too late! I was there during the Golden Week holidays in Japan and it was loaded with tourists. Loaded like the lines to go in at 7",
          "We went up Mt Moiwa during the day in late March when there was still snow on the ground. There is a free shuttle bus from the bottom of the hill (near the tram stop) to where you pick up the cable car. It's only a short journey, but it's steep! The ticket, round trip, to the",
          "Despite low visibility, we went up Mt Moiwa. Instead of a magnificent view, we were treated with great snowy fun. The lunch at the restaurant was also great!",
          "I'm not overly keen on views, but my wife pulled me here and it was worth it. Fantastic view and great atmosphere! Its a little pricey and we had to queue for a bit for the tram down. Still, a nice romantic stop.",
          "The city view is very nice but too many visitors on Sunday night. They were packed in like sardines in cable car, cannot move. Recommend to arrive 4-5 pm so that can see day and night versions of city view. I arrived at night and it's too difficult to take nice photo due to no",
          "Go to Mt. Moiwa for one of the best night views that you can get in Sapporo. Would recommend you to take a taxi there if you stay near to Sapporo station. It is much more convenient and doesn't cost too much. The ropeway and cable car towards the summit tends to get crowded, but",
          "Our group of four went there just as it opened in winter at 11am. Getting the tram from Sapporo, there's a complementary shuttle service to the rope-way a 50m walk from the stop which I would highly recommend taking advantage of in winter. In summer I assume the walk to the",
          "I went there on a winter and and everything was so white and pristine... Beautiful place! You go up and down Mt Moiwa in a cable car. There's even a free shuttle service that takes you to the take off point. You shouldn't miss this place..",
          "Great view of Sapporo. We gladly paid to use the ropeway and the rail car to go to the top of the mountain. The star projection in the little movie theater at the top of the mountain is not really interesting for people who don't understand Japanese.",
          "With a big family in tow, it was quite a struggle to go up to Mt. Moiwa. There were several transfers before reaching the place but it was worth it! It might not be as high up as the mountains we went up to in Switzerland with cable cars, but Mt. Moiwa has its own charm. Before",
          "The place offers you an amazing view of Sapporo city and Ishikari bay. I visited the place in January with my family .you can enjoy the perfect view in the evening time . Situated in the heart of the city , it is very convenient place to visit with family ( small kids). You can",
          "Last December 18 my family went to Mt Moiwa, it was an awesome experience, the view was so beautiful, the trip on the way itself was a beautiful experience. We rode the tramp for the first time, The driver was so polite and kind to us. After the tramp we took the free shuttle",
          "We visited on Dec 26th, taking a taxi from Okurayama Ski Jump. It was a short 6km ride costing approximately 1500yen for 4 of us. We left OSJ around 4.30pm, timing it such that we would get to Mt.Moiwa when it was dark. We read that the night views, because of the city lights",
          "The views from the top was fantastic. Worth going up for the views. Taking the cable car up the top was a great ride. The usher bow to u when U are getting out of your cable car. That's the respect you get .. the feeling was great. Will go back again..",
          "It is a nice spot to enjoy Sapporo citylights. Just be aware that during winter, the view are often blocked by blizzard. JPY 1700 for roundtrip cable car ride.",
          "I personally like the ropeway and the view at the summit. It was breathtakingly beautiful and we were playing with a lot of snow at the summit. Great fun overall!",
          "Windy and cold during winter. It also depends on luck. Sometimes there are snow or fog blocking. See the photo attached to have a idea. Download vouchers to get some discount.",
          "Learn from my bad experience going to Mt Moiwa in the cold Dec month at night. Paid \u00a51700 all the way to the top only to witness spots of lights among the vast darkness in sub zero temperature and strong wind blowing in your face. Would rather do something else more meaningful",
          "Free shuttle bus from the streetbus (tram) station Ropeway Iriguchi. Also a good opportunity to try other local restaurants in the neighborhood away from the usual tourist areas like Sapporo train station, Odori or Susukino. Mount Moiwa is a very popular tourist spot, even",
          "We visited Mt Moiwa on our first night in Sapporo. We decided to go there at night so we could view the bright city lights. We visited on an autumn night and it was pretty chilly so if you're doing the same thing,be sure to dress warmly. We took as many photos as we can, rang",
          "Mount Moiwa offers great views of the Sapporo city. Went during the winter and the weather was so cold compare to other places. Only take half day/quarter day trip here.I went around 6pm and back around 9pm.The ride up and down on the ropeway was also enjoyable. Free shuttle bus",
          "There is free shuttle bus near tram station to ropeway entrance. In the tram, there are leaflets stand which provides tram map and roapway discount coupons which will save your roapway fee 200 yen per person.",
          "Mt. Moiwa boasts the best spot to view the city of Sapporo, and it did draw lots of people even on a rainy, humid August night. As you might have already learned, you need to take two different gondolas to get to the top. As the gondola sent us upward, the nightly cityscape",
          "Mt Moiwa can be reached by a cable car. It is one of highest mountains in the Sapporo area.The peak has a bell, which lovers can ring to ensure eternal love, and also attach a padlock to the railing. The view from Mt Moiwa is gratifying. The peak is over 500 metres (1640 feet)",
          "Don't really know what the fuss is about...to get there u need to get into a street tram, then get on a shuttle bus, then pay to get on a ropeway (which is basically a cable car) to the middle level, then a transfer to a smaller cable car to get to the summit. You do get a nice",
          "Charming night scenery of sapppro. it looks like sea of \ud83c\udf1f. Also they have free shuttle bus. 1st thing should do in sapppro at \ud83c\udf03!",
          "Cloudy day on visit nearing sunset. The view was nothing wow, ticket to the top was not worth the experience. City view was so-so, everything is so tiny. Might as well skip this and Google sapporo City view instead. Lover's Sanctuary is kinda gimmicky. These are one of the",
          "Easy way to get there is to take the tram (streetcar). There\u2019s only one tram line and it makes a loop through the city. The Ropeway Iriguchi tram stop where you want to get off is about half way around the loop if you get on where most tourists do: on the street above the",
          "We hiked up this mountain, using directions provided from an internet search. The hike up took us slightly more than an hour on a well-marked and we'll-travelled trail, past many Buddhist statues and local residents also hiking. The trail was slightly muddy due to recent rain.",
          "So you can take the cable car if you want to, but I went with a group of people hiking up the trail. The trail is super well maintained and should be doable for all ages as long as you're physically fit enough to hike uphill. The top is a very beautiful view. I went in the",
          "View from top is not that good. It is partially obscured by forest on the mountain. I would prefer mount Hakodate instead.",
          "Went here on a weekday afternoon and the place was PACKED! The cable car ride up wasn't too pleasant as we had to squeeze with many other tourists, although they run frequent enough that we could have waited for the next one (but who knows if it would be the same). Great views",
          "I did a hike up to the summit (great view of the city!) There are 5 routes to the summit (google it for more information) but I went up via the route from the Jodoshukanon Temple (starting from Kanonji Parking lot on google map) It is quite a short hike, took about 2 hours round",
          "I brought my two sons and my daughter-in-law to Sapporo for a few days in July and we planned on going to Mt. Moiwa on July 14th. However, the rainy weather forced us to cancel those plans because the cloud cover was very bad on that day and the weather forced us to go",
          "MT. Moiwa makes it possible to appreciate the extent and beauty of Sapporo City area. It is best accessed by car and then the Gondula. There is food and gift shop with wrapping service but best of all is ringing the bell to celebrate your arrival or any thing else you wish to",
          "I'm glad we took this little side adventure. Mount Moiwa offers great views of the entire city. It was windy and cold on our visit to the top, but that probably kept the crowd sizes down. Actually, there weren't many people there at all. There's a little caf\u00e9 area at the",
          "Use the circular city tram to get there. If you are romantic couple buy the padlock at midway station (or bring your own) to put on the roof thingy shown in the picture.",
          "Very simple attraction with very friendly staff. You get a nice view of the city and there is a restaurant to dine at if you want. Do it if you are bored.",
          "We visited the place on a foggy day. It wast difficult to find and there is a free shuttle bus service from the bus stop to the cable car stn (return trip too). The person selling the ropeway tickets advised us abt the poor visibility but we still bought the tickets. At the peak",
          "I didn't know night view of Mt. Moiwa is top three night scenic view in Japan. You can see 360 degrees from the peak. 1.9 milion people living city light is shining beautifully. Top of the montain is windy. You need to bring a jacket even the temperature is over 20 degrees.",
          "To avoid too many people we went to the top before sun set. Unfortunately, the weather was not with us and it was windy and raining. The shuttle bus from the tram station is relatively small so it will not be able to cope with large input of guests. The day view from the",
          "We drove and took the mini cable car up to the mt moiwa. Need to pay for parking (toll) and also for the mini cable car. We went in the afternoon, it was quite windy. Nice view of Sapporo. We rang the bell of happiness for good blessings. Should have brought a padlock to place",
          "need to take two times of cable car to reach the hill top. good panoramic view of Sapporo city. was told it\"s beautiful at night.",
          "Well worth a visit - Mt Moiwa is easy accessible via streetcar then courtesy shuttle bus to the lower Ropeway (Cablecar) station. Spectacular views over Sapporo.",
          "Me & my friends went there on January arround 8pm, we took the tram & free shuttle. When we finally on the top, the weather was soooooooooooo cold & snowy. We only there for like 5mins to saw the view and took picture, then we went back inside. Beautiful view... but not",
          "Sunset worthy spot, but however, after sunset hours, the cable car to go down will take 1-2 hours. There is a total of 2 cabins and limited pax going up and down. Be prepared to wait.",

          "Took a trip here at night and was able to see the whole of Sapporo spread out in front of us. Amazing sight.",
          "The reason why you should go to the top of Mt. Moiwa is that there is not really any reason why you should not. Not every city has a ropeway up a hill from which you can get a great view, but Sapporo does. So why not go up there and enjoy the view? It is very convenient to get",
          "Although it was hazy the view was stunning and well worth the trip to the top. Of course had to ring the bell for many many years of love!",
          "We were attracted by the advertisement for the beautiful night scenery from the peak (the one with the bell). The bell looks beautiful particularly at night, but we just cannot manage to take any photos with the same angle as the advertisement. What we can capture in the photo",
          "I am not sure if it's worth the 5 minute view to have to spend a good two hours round trip for that. the lines -when the weather is decent and there is actually something to see- are CRAZY. you spend 5 minutes at the top because it's amazingly cold ( I visited in May) and you",
          "Great experience ascending/descending the mountain using the cable car, beautiful view from the top, must go places when you are in Sapporo.",
          "If your time schedule allows, do not miss this tourist attraction. You can get there by tram and a free shuttle bus. Overlooking the city of Sapporo, by day or night is spectacular. Don't miss it!",
          "I always wanted to visit Sapporo, Hokkaido for their cute food and beer even though I dont drink. Some people say that they have good parks. So I prepared for parks itinerary while in Sapporo. But when I touched down Sapporo last week, I read review that Mt. Moiwa is one of best",
          "It's a must write for me on the early part of the Mt. Moiwa trip. We slighted at the station of Ropeway Iriguchi to take the free shuttle bus to the ropeway. The attendant there is more than fantastic. 10mins of waiting time he was polite and courteous and friendly. To every",
          "This place is a must see regardless of crowd. We went there in early October. Do bring warm clothes because it is cold and windy up there. We took the street car (tram) from Susukino to Ropeway Iriguchi station (170 yen). From there there is a free shuttle bus that goes to the",
          "Wasnt that easy to find the route up considering its one of the main tourist attractions. There were no signage of directions from the nearest streetcar stop (Denshajigyosho-Mae). However, once you've braved the 15 minutes trek to the ropeway building, it's a nice ride up to",
          "We visited here at night right after the sunset (I wish we could have seen the sunset). It was an incredible experience. Riding the ski lift to the top of the mountain, you could see all of Sapporo with all the buildings and lights. There is so much life in Sapporo! The first",
          "Good view of the City. We got special discounted rates by buying from tourist center office in Tanukikoji. =)",
          "Highley recomeneded, I suggest going up about 30 minutes prior to sunset. The day/night view are both spectacular.",
          "We chose this ski resort because it was close enough to our hotel in Sapporo to get a taxi there and back in a day, and because we have novice skiers with us, so we didn\u2019t need a more up market resort. The beginners slope is not as well arranged for learners as other ski fields",
          "I heard of this place through here and I just had to check it out. I went close to 9 pm this past Wednesday night, hoping there would be a smaller crowd. We made it before the last free shuttle and we were rewarded with spectacular views! I recommend a good jacket for this time",
          "You can access the peak of Mt. Moiwa by riding the ropeway and then transferring to the cable car. The ropeway that departs from Moiwa Sanroku Station travels 1,200 meters in five minutes. The ride includes the stunning view of Ishikari Bay in the distance past the cityscape,",

          "Unfortunately I didn't manage to go up to this attraction. That is because I went in the middle of Febuary with the initial thought of going to see the snow festival with a few add on things. But if you do wish to go up here as I heard the view is fantastic, then please check",
          "The night view from Mt. Moiwa near Sapporo, so beautiful that it has been listed as one of the \u201cthree best night views of Hokkaido.Place for lovers.It only takes about 30 minutes from Sapporo station, and is a very important sightseeing spot.",
          "Visited here toward the end of the day and watch the sun go down. Its gorgeous to watch the lights come on over the city as the place turned dark. Seemed like Christmas in February!",
          "One of the best place to try for foreigners & locals alike. If you happen to be in sapporo city, Don't forget to include this tourist spot on your schedule. You will love the breathtaking view of the whole sapporo city from the top of this mountain. Very accessible from sapporo",
          "We visited this mountain on a cold February evening. The view was spectacular and well worth the trip, but very, very cold. You couldn't stay out long but ringing the bell gave a nice photo opportunity . Cable car was cramped ,but if you were by the window you had a good view.",
          "We took the cable car and rope car to the top of Mt Moiwa. Lots of snow but the views are incredible. Watched the 3D movie which was interesting although it was Japanese which was to be expected of course but still got the gist of it. Had an ice-cream which seems to be the norm",
          "Worth to visit while in Sapporo Nice view of Sapporo from the top of the mountain A bit cold in the evening",
          "Those going during winter may want to keep a lookout for the shuttle to the ropeway base station near the streetcar stop instead of walking because it can get really cold trekking up the hill. The views are good up there if you go on a clear day (during winter). We also saw",
          "interesting way to get up to mount moiwa. you have to take the streetcar first then hop on the shuttle bus. finally the ropeway and cable car brings you to the top of the mountain. great view but it can be cold! we went in winter. great way to spend the evening after sunset.",
          "It was snowing but the view was great. Fir direction going there local people where so friendly and very accomodating",

          "We went here on a lark before our flight, and were blown away by the spectacular view from the top. The mountains all around Sapporo are beautiful, but the coolest thing was seeing Ishikari Bay spread out below to the west. The map of Hokkaido felt like it had come to life in",
          "I think that it's almost a must visit in Sapporo. The view of the city is spectacular, the facilities on the top are comfortable, and the hike through the park is great (one needs basic gear to take a hike - poles and preferably - spikes, if in the winter).",
          "Amazing Night Scenery but Too Cold During Autumn/Winter. We visited during December 2017 and though this is Autumn, being on top of such a high mountain made the climb and end destination a freezing experience. We didn't stay at the lookout for too long because of the cold air",
          "Took the Ropeway going up, definitely worth the trip! You can see the whole Sapporo, plus the great view beyond Sapporo. Stayed here for about two hours, we wanted to take the trail going down back to the main lobby at street level but we weren't wearing any proper trekking",

          "This is one of the cool places of Sapporo, great view especially during night time. Lighting of the city is amazing. There is some fee's involved but it's much worth it. 360 degree view awesome.",

          "there was a photo taking service which provided you a doll character of the hill. It was a cold night with only 8 degree celcius in June! And there was a free shuttle bus service so it was quite convenient to go there. You can go hiking to reach there if your do not want to take",
          "Definitely a must visit spot with great views of Sapporo. I have been to this place both winter and autumn. Probably better on autumn",
          "Worth doing in the late afternoons and evenings, since it provides for a good, if not spectacular panorama of the city and its surroundings. Otherwise, it is rather unexciting, and stuck in an area where there is nothing else to do",
          "I hiked by myself in an attempt to catch the sunset view. I only saw 3 or 4 people on the whole hike and there were warning signs everywhere about bears. I was very worried as I didn't have a bear Bell but I made it! I'd advise getting a bear bell just to have a peace of mind.",

          "We were lucky as we did not have to wait very long to get up Mt Moiwa (~4.30pm on weekday) and we deliberately plan to get up the Mt before dawn. Knowing the time for sunset will help you plan your trip and you will be able to see both the day & night view.",
          "Do it properly and hike up. It's not a particularly long or hard climb (an hour up at most), and makes the views at the top even better. I went up the mountain the day after I went up the JR T38 tower. and the views over the city are even better! with the bonus of being able to",

          "Amazing view of Sapporo at night. It can get a bit congested with tourists, but the staff are helpful at moving people along. There's free parking at the base of the ropeway, and if you're looking for something to do after dinner, I'd strongly recommend a visit.",
          "We visited Mt. Moiwa in the late afternoon with the intent of watching the transformation of the day view to the night view. Public Transportation to the Ropeway is very convenient. You just need to do a little research on how to get there. It got a bit chilly, so dress",
          "Went up to Mount Moiwa in the late afternoon. If you had been to other cities e.g. New York, frankly this view was forgettable. That said, strolling around the park / garden and doing the short trekking nearby was a nice experience.",
          "Went to Mt Moiwa on a lovely clear day. There's a free shuttle bus dropping you off at the cable car entrance near the street car stop. Then need to catch 2 separate cars to get to the top. As they charge separately for the 2 cars, you can decide not to go to the top if you",
          "A long expensive trip for a view of Sapporo from on high. Maybe we are just jaded but it did not seem worthwhile. Perhaps the restaurant would be nice when it is open on the top.",
          "Visited on a week day morning with our son who lives and works in Hokkaido. First time up Mt. Moiwa for all of us and we caught the first train at around 10ish I think. Pretty easy to find and park the car (at the time of writing this was free and is located directly opposite",

          "This is like the mountain in the backyard of Sapporo. It offers a magnificent view of the city and the surrounding mountains. You can also chose to hike up fr mid mountain. I saw someone jog up the trek. Either way you do it, we'll worth the efforts and enjoy the view. Tip:",
          "Went there during early summer, Took the cable car to go on top. View is nice but nothing much to do.. 1 visit is enough..",
          "I went here during the day and the view of the city was lovely. I can only imagine how beautiful it is at sunset. I took a street tram to the Mt Moiwa shuttle bus stop and then took the free shuttle up to the building. I thought that the tickets for the ropeway and cable car",
          "We were in Sapporo in late April and although the weather was warming up there was still a lot of snow around. Coming from a warm area in Australia it was wonderful to visit Mt Moiwa and see it covered in snow on a beautiful sunny clear day (it was still very cold in our",
          "Magic view of the city, good basic night out although not too many facilities at the top. Impressive location.",
          "Getting here was easy enough they offer a free shuttle bus from Iriguchi stop, which is a street car stop. The bus ride is about 5 minutes to the ropeway station. Then it's up to the 4th floor for tickets. There are 2 tickets one only hoes half way up and the other is to the",
          "We unfortunately went there on a cloudy day but the flip side was it was not at all crowded and we thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of being amidst clouds. The vending machine has hot cocoa and on top of Mt. Moiwa it was simply heavenly !",
          "Ascend the mount by foot to make your trip a little more memorable - that's what I did. Then descend with the ropeway after taking in the city view.",
          "Go before the sunset and return when it is totally dark. This way you will be able to see the beautiful Sapporo in the day time and enjoy its lights at night time. There is also a restaurant there with nice view so you can have a good quality time with your companions.",
          "The view is great. We went during the afternoon, so we didn't get to see the bright lights of the Sapporo landscape, which is rated as top 3 in all of Japan. We recommend a total of 1.5 hours for this trip. You may have dinner there, but the food is average. They are selling",
          "I'm going there at noon during the cloudy day, so nothing much to see. I suggest to go there at night so you can see the view better, but it depends on the weather.",
          "Was expecting it to be a bit underwhelming but well worth the trip. Straight up and down in 45 mins from the Base station. DON'T GO EARLY. The first car up is at 10.30 am.",
          "We came here on a cold day, got to the desk to buy tickets and was so sad when we were told that the views up the top were very foggy and we wouldn't be able to see anything. They have live cam (which it turns out is pretty accurate). We had taken the tram and then the mini bus",
          "As the no 1 thing to do in Hokkaido, we made it a must go item even at 7pm, but after 20 mins just to get to ticketing counter on 2nd floor of the starting point, it was an ominous sign. Still we preserved. Then another 20 mins to the first tram. Then when we reached the top,",
          "Maybe my opinion is not 100% correct because when I visited there, it's raining and in the winter. The night view of the city was not that good compared to HK.",
          "Was there previous night but it was already closed by around 9:15pm. Hence went again the morning and it was great view from there.",
          "Nice place to go to get a good view of Sapporo and some of the surrounding mountains. Doesn't hope until 10:30 in the morning. A visit in the evening would probably be better.",
          "Definitely recommend this hike while in Sapporo. Took us about an hour to go up; slow and steady with no stops. The same going back down. The views at the top were fabulous. Could see the Sea of Japan from the top, and heaps of snow capped peaks in the distance. The trailhead",
          "Its a must see for everyone who comes to Sapporo its a breathtaking view of the city especially after sunset .",
          "If you are in Sapporo City, you must take in Mt. Moiwa.......It offers a panoramic view of Sapporo City. I would suggest you take in a late afternoon visit. We took the city streetcar & fee shuttle bus to get to the \"mountain top\" attraction........suggest you take the Mt.",
          "Stayed at Mercure. Took the tram which is located 5 minutes from hotel. Pay 200yen and get off at Ropeway Iriguchi. Get down, turn left and the free shuttle service is located about 100m from the tram station to the location is available. Cost is 1700 yen for a visit to the",
          "Instead of going up a tall tower to view the city, this is possibly best option you could get as it allows you to see pretty much the whole Sapporo metro area. My friends and I were actually planning to go up here the night before but since the train arrival was delayed, we",
          "After a beautiful sunny day in Sapporo the rain set in but with high hopes we caught the streetcar to Mt Moiwa ropeway and a few metres to the left the free shuttle bus was waiting to take passengers up to the ropeway. Disappointingly the clouds had rolled in and there was zero",
          "A good place to go for a great view of Sapporo. We went here in the morning and we regret that we didn't go here at night. Transportation going there is easy - just ride the streetcar.",
          "I wanted to run up there, but in april, on the north face you need more than just sneakers Still you can walk to the bhuddist temple 15 min upwards The 1700 yen are worth the view and at night even better",
          "Went up the Mt. Moiwa by Bus. The night view of Sapporo city is breathtaking. You won't able to capture nice pictures unless with DSLR camera. The is love bell lighted up. I did que up to take picture but not sure the significant of its :)",
          "Mt. Moiwa was neat during the day, but I wish we would have went at night to see the monument lit up and the city lights. The funicular ride to the top was fun. You can take a bus from near where the city bus drops you off, but we just walked.",
          "Beautiful scenery on the way to the top by ropeway.. Night view of the city so beautiful... If possible, go up before sunset so can have 2 different views of Mt. Moiwa",
          "Nice view from the top. Mt Hakodate was too far away so we opted to go Mt moiwa & we were not disappointed. The ticketing staff asked if we have the discount coupon for tickets but we didn't have so we paid the full price. It got very windy & cold in the late afternoon and the",
          "Definitely worth a visit, we went up at about 18:00 in April, just as the sun was setting. It looked amazing. Its a bit expensive 1700yen for a round trip to the very top, but if you have booked via JTB, you might get a pamphlet full of discount tickets, as we did. With the jtb",
          "Cool place to stop by on an evening in Sapporo. Beautiful view of the landscape, and there's a nice coffee shop and restaurant at the summit.",
          "Took Mt. Moiwa ropeway. It was snowing that day.. You can see the whole city of Sapporo from the peak level..",
          "This is definitely worth the cost of admission. The views are spectacular. Be sure to arrive in time for sunset and stick around to see the city light up. Warm up at the visitor center with a beer or hot chocolate.",
          "It is a second attempt for us to go this place. On the first night, we tried to use google map to search Mt. Moiwa and it guided us to go by the expressway (toll road), unfortunately it is blocked till the week after we visit there. The next night we drive to the ropeway",
          "Worth the trip for the views alone. The beginning of the ropeway is easy to get to from the centre of the city via the Ropeway Iriguchi streetcar stop and the ropeway itself runs every 15 minutes. You get a short talk pointing out famous landmarks on the way up (Japanese only",
          "Is very easy access by using the Streetcar from Susukino. You will get the free shutter bus at \"Ropeway Iriguchi\" station that take you to the lower ropeway station.",
          "Clear sky with sunset and full moon view... you defiantly need to visit this place when you at Sapporo else you will regret for life",
          "Went without a reservation for dinner. Nonetheless, the small take out counter settled dinner but it's only sandwich and hot drinks. The view is great and kids had some fun in a snowball battle the same evening. Take the full ride all the way up. Usual price is JPY1.7k but",
          "About 30 minute by the streetcar and another 15 minutes to entrance. Signage not too good after streetcar. Interesting ride on ropeway, cable car to tower. Beautiful view and restaurant offers decent food for very reasonable price. Sledge carriage is an experience too as it",
          "It's fabulous up there! I visited there @winter time. Everything was white and so peaceful. The nature surrounding... Allt to explore. I remembered running and lying on the snow. Unforgettable memories. There's a red cart u can drive on (I forgot the fee). It's fun cart.. Must",
          "Wonderful view during the night, especially during cold winter night but please wear thick layers of clothes!",
          "Got lost going to the place as the bus driver did not drop us at the right stop. But when we reached the peak of Mt Moiwa and had our tons of pictures taken, the exhaustian disappeared. The place reminded me of my Switzerland (Zermat trip).",
          "This viewing deck may not be within central Sapporo, but going here is worth it. The experience going up the mountain via ropeway and tramway is already relaxing and enjoyable. Once you reach the top, you can see Sapporo city from a bird's eye view. This is a must especially",
          "Visited Mt. Moiwa in the winter while in Sapporo for the Snow Festival. Very easy access taking the city's only street car and then the free shuttle bus to the cable car station. As roads can be quite icy, it is highly recommended to take the shuttle bus during the winter than",
          "Can't compare with other seasons but its really cold in Winter. Catch the ropeway for JPN1700. Midstation for the shop and the top station for the views and 3D movie. Its really beautiful with the whole Sapporo City blanketed with snow. Nothing much on the top though except",
          "Went up Mt Moiwa in February 2017. It is freaking cold. However, there are still some Japanese oldies who came up the hiking trail. I respect these people. Not much activities up at the mountain other than observing the city. It would be a nice place to see the city at night but",
          "The ropeway and cable car rides provides a teaser to the panoramic views of Sapporo. I think the SnowFestival gives the traveller amazing views of the city of lights. Mt Moiwa has a restaurant and a cafe where you can just sip on your hot drink, eat and relax and be simply",
          "Should go during the time of sunset. Very pretty mountains at the side and when the sun sets the whole of Sapporo lights up, and it is a very beautiful sight.",
          "Mt Moiwa (Moiwayama) is right inside Sapporo with two lifts, hiking trails, skiing, and neat views of the whole city. How to get there: from the central city, take a streetcar to the Ropeway station. You can walk about 600m to the entrance - turn left when you see the sign",
          "Great place to view the city and surroundings. But in winter everything is grey and white.Take the tram or street car to a stop called Ropeway Iruguchi. Once you get off at the stop around 100-150 meters is the shuttle bus that will take you to the base of the cable car station",
          "It is best to hop on a streetcar and get off at Ropeway Iriguchi stop for 170 yen (one way). You may purchase a one day pass (Dosanko Pass 310Y) for the streetcar if you are travelling during weekend or holidays for unlimited ride for a day. From Ropeway Irigiuchi, the free",
          "It's quite pricey to get up there just to get a night view. Out of curiosity we did that but we won't do that again unlike the hilltop night view form Mt Hakodate which is much more amazing. We got there by street car follow by a free transfer by bus then cable car to the hill",
          "The best view would be going down the ropeway during sunset where you can have the panoramic of Sapporo city. A must place to visit when in Hokkaido. We just loved the winter view. The kids definitely enjoyed the ropeway rides.",
          "Get on the streetcar and alight at the Ropeway iriguchi stop. Hint: you can get on at any station as the streetcar goes in a loop, 170 yen flat rate. There's a discount coupon in the streetcar (right behind the driver seat) which entitles you to 1500 yen ticket instead of",
          "It is indeed cold once you get up there but the clear views of the city down below distracts you from the cold for a few minutes. After dark it was difficult to see the beauty of the mountains just behind the city views but I reckon at daytime it will be stunning. Night views",
          "We went there in winter and the whole place was covered with thick snow. As it was snowing very heavily on the day we went, we actually couldn't see any view. But the place just looked so romantic in snow.",
          "A good short day trip for a fantastic view of the city . In winter, views maybe covered by bad weather, but a nice restaurant to enjoy lunch or coffee with your love ones is nice. Getting there is easy, take the tram car and get on to the free shuttle.",
          "It was a nice ride up in a ropeway ( Cable car) and tram ( finnicular). The views are fantastic of snowed over mountains and Sapporo! You can trek down on a snowed over path if you are up to it. Cold at wintertime up there.",
          "I went on a friday night to see the city views and was easy to get to from Susukino, I used the streetcar and free shuttle. The views are really great but its very cold in January and be sure to wear warm clothes for the ride up and to spend a decent amount of time outside",
          "When we visited Mt.Moiwa, it was slightly snowy. The floor of ticket counter, there was a board that tells you the condition of top of the mountain. Unfortunately, it says \"unclear view\". However, we decided to take a risk. We paid 1,700 yen for return tickets. The rope-way was",
          "The ropeway and cable car experience up MT Moiwa was unforgettable for our 2 boys. Be there just before 4 pm to catch both daylight, sunset and the amazing night views of the city.",
          "Very easy to reach by taking the streetcar from susukino to the ropeway stop. Then turn right to go to the bus stop where the free shuttle bus will take you to mt moiwa station. On a good clear day, the best time to visit is about an hour before sun down so that you can",
          "Free shuttle every 30 minutes to the main entrance. Otherwise 15 minutes walk uphill. \u00a51,600 return ticket for cable car to the mountain top. There is a souvenir shop, vending machine, restaurant and a kiosk.",
          "Worth a visit to view Sapporo from top. The only dissapoint aspect is the cabel car. They put as many people posibble in the cabel car. Saw 1 old lady fall from the cabel car.",
          "The location offers a good view of the city. Either during the day where you see all of sapporo or in the evening when the city lights are on. you pay for the ticket (inclusive of the cable car rides) to go to the top. A good place to spend an hour.",
          "Went to mount Moiwa is really worth the trip. Our family enjoyed the cool weather of Sapporo. Highly recommended for family traveling together. Getting to the area is easy, take the street car either at Odori or Susukino then drop off at the ropeway station then there is a free",
          "This is my second time to Sapporo but my first to Mt Moiwa. Breathtaking views!! It's also very easy to access from Susukino. Definitely worth the visit!",
          "I have been to mount Moiwa for few times, either solo or recommend to my friends. The scene on the observatory of Mount Moiwa is amazing in every season. You will see green during summer, yellow/red during summer, or white landscape during winter. However, the most important is",
          "Took a tram and alighted at the ropeway stop. There is a shuttle bus nearby just behind one of the tram stop. The intervals are about 15 mins between each trip. View from the top of the mountain is beautiful . You can see the city and the mountains in the background. There is",
          "This place is definitely worth going. The view from the top was amazing, the view while riding the cable car up was equally breathtaking. My siblings and I had a great time having snow fights and building snowmen there, hiking trails were also available for those who are more",
          "Reminds me of The Peak in Hong Kong. An accessible mountain in a city. Buy the tickets up to the top and enjoy the view of Sapporo city. Can be done in an hour if there's no crowd.",
          "The ropeway is a great way to have a view of the city - the view from the top is quite lovely, and they have a small couples activity at the top (you ring a bell...). There is a stop midway, where you change cars, where there is a souvenir shop, and access to the outside. There",
          "The views from the top are second to none of the Sapporo area and beyond. You can catch the local bus right to the door. Take bus #11 from Maruyama Koen, which is a stop on the Tozai line subway. It was \u00a51700 each to the top. There is a stop halfway up where you change cableway.",
          "2 stage ropeway, beautiful view of Sapporo up there, it's very cold even in October, not far from Center of Sapporo",
          "My trip to Mount Moiwa was a memorable one! The cable car station was easily accessible and the going up the mount via the cable car followed by the tram was an adventure in its own right. Do note that due to it altitude, the outdoor viewing platform tends to be very windy and",
          "Convenient ride by Tram and shuttle up and experience two type of 'lifts' up the mountain top. Feel the air and love, Also wait til its darker and have a night view of the spectacular city and you tell me what you think !..... Remember to lock your love away too.",
          "We went up the Mt. Moiwa ropeway all the way up to the observatory. Really easy to get to and a fast trip. It was pretty cold though so you don't want to spend too much time out on the deck. Beautiful views at night, but I think I might've preferred to see it in the daytime.",
          "This is the right place if you want to see the Sapporo city view. To reach the place, you need to take a street car to Ropeway Iriguchi station. From there, you can either walk to the base station or take a shuttle bus (which is running every 15 minutes). At the base station,",

          "I visited in late October when the Mt Moiwa Ropeway was closed. Thanks to that I could experience my visit there in complete solitude. Beautiful park covers the slopes of the mountain, and this time of the year the autumn colours were at their peak. Nice place for a relaxing",
          "We visited during Autumn weather meaning just a jacket was sufficient for a nice walk. There is a restaurant but take a picnic and have lunch on the grass at the top. Also if you intend to lock a padlock on the gate at the top and ring the bell... Buy one from the town first as",
          "Its been done up since I last went up but the new setup is much nicer. The view of Sapporo is one of the best probably besides Mt Teine.",

          "Drove here from Sapporo, about 15-20mins drive. Plenty of parking. If you have the discount coupons (check with your hotel or look around in JR stations or in the airport when you arrive), it is a little cheaper. Do bring a jacket as it gets chilly and there are some strong",

          "On our last day in Sapporo, we went to Mt Moiwa. Unfortunately, it was rainy and did not get much view of the area. From the photo gallery, we saw what we missed out on. There was some 3D sessions on Sapporo which was quite good, just that they were all in Japanese.",
          "We went to Mt. Moiwa for the night view of Sapporo. It was quite nice but was very crowded (I think it was a public holiday at the time). I believe there is a free shuttle from downtown Sapporo that takes you to the cable car station at the bottom of the mountain. We travelled",
          "I personally like the whole concept of reaching the mountain top observatory with a cable car. The view from the top was just unbelievably stunning. As we reached the top at around 8PM, the lights that decorate Sapporo just looked fantastic. Practically everyone in the cable car",
          "It's the panoramic place of the city. It's nice during the sunset, however is not a fantastic view; there aren't particular things to see, just the city, lights... Expensive",

          "Despite some intense heat and humidity, this was a very enjoyable half day trip. Getting to Mt. Moiwa is very easy with the street cars. From the street car stop, it is a 400m walk to the rope way or there is a shuttle bus across the street that can take you right to the door. I",
          "Amazing sunset and evening view of Sapporo. What a beautiful scenery from the top of Mt. Moiwa. Be sure to rag up as it can become very windy and cold.",
          "When its not busy, this place is very peaceful. There's 2 stations and the cable car prices vary depending on which station you wish to stop at. We went all the way up to the top (JPY1700 p.p return). There's gift shops, a restaurant, small cafe kiosk and a planetarium theater",
          "We drove to this location instead of taking the ropeway/cable car. JPY660 per entry that brings you to the cable car station. From there its a short hike up to the top. Much has been said of Mt Moiwa...views from all ends simply breath-taking. Great attraction.",
          "We have not heard about Mount Moiwa before. We were introduced to it by a helpful staff at the Sapporo Tourist Information Center at JR Sapporo Station. This was where we gathered most of the travelling details about Hokkaido's tourist attractions. To Mt Moiwa, we took a",
          "I wouldn't call this a must-see attraction, but if you want a great view of Sapporo and the surrounding snow-capped mountains it is well worth a visit. We went during the week and only saw four other people the entire time we were there. Only two people went up on the ropeway",
          "The view is spectacular and try to go there at night since the view will be much better. Really enjoy the view and the weather up there.",
          "Very picturesque, costs 1700 yen round trip per person to the summit. We took the subway to Susukino, then transferred to the streetcar/tram above ground, and stopped at the ropeway station. There, a block away, was a free shuttle to the bottom of Mount Moiwa. We went at 9pm and",
          "Went there at 7.00pm right after dinner during March, the weather is still cold with occasional showers. Had to go up by tram. Went we reach the top of the observatory, the view was completely spoilt due to the cold weather and there was a blizzard which clouded all the lights",
          "Great for taking in the view of the city. Worth going all the way to the top and seeing the lookout. Reasonable value for money",
          "I went up there on a whim after my summer course after researching it briefly on the internet. The night view is brilliant but the crowd is a bit too much to bear for me. A lot of local and international tourist taking photographs so one might need to squeeze right to the front",
          "we catch tram from susukino to the Ropeway stop. 2 minutes walk from tram stop, and there's free shuttle bus to the mt Moiwa ropeway (they start at 10.15am, and the bus come in every 15 minutes). it's a great scenic view from the top. we are very lucky because it was very clear",
          "Nothing much to do there, except taking the cable car ride up to the peak. Even in the day, its offers such amazing views. Breathtakingly beautiful Hokkaido.",
          "There are many beautiful places in Hokkaido, Mt Moiwa is one i visited. Was here 2nd week dec. It was snowing heavily that day I visited, lucky the ropeway and moris car were still working I got the glimpse of the white city view from the rope way up to Moris car station. we",
          "Take the tramway to the top of the mountain to enjoy a great night view of Sapporo city! Nothing else to do besides enjoying the view but it was well worth it.",
          "This is a must do. Easy to use the street car from central Sapporo, to get to the free shuttle bus. The views from the to are too good to be true. In winter, the snow is soft, the curry in the restaurant warm and cheap. A saw many people hiking up, but that looks to be for",
          "Definitely recommend. The cable car there was in itself a short tour of the city. The view from the top was stunning.",
          "We took the tram (called ropeway in Japanese) to the top. What a lovely park and what great views of the city of Sapporo! Especially fantastic were the trees turning beautiful colors in the Fall.",
          "Recheable by tram and a free shuttle. Nice view of the city from the top and on the way up. But probably not worth the 1700 yen to go up. Better to go to the ski jump observatory instead.",
          "From Mt Moiwa, you can enjoy the beautiful view / scenary of Sapporo city. Highly recommended. Worth the money and effort to reach there. The view is breathtaking! From Sapporo main station, I walked to Odori (near Odori Park) to get to the Nishi Yon Chome street car / tramp",
          "You take the street car at the suskino side of town, pay 170 yen and get off at the iriguchi stop. Cross the street and you'll see the free shuttle bus stop which leaves for the rope way station every fifteen minutes. Or you can just walk up, it should take you five minutes. The",
          "Some of the best city views that Japan has to offer - easily worth the money and effort. There's also a very nice restaurant at the top of the mountain - very nice atmosphere and service there (paired with the fabulous views of course).",
          "Very easy to get to by public transport and very efficient cable car and funicular to get you to the top. Some members of staff seemed to be employed to do little more than bow to the passengers at the start and end of the cable car journey! I generally don't like cable cars but",
          "It's a rainy day when we are there. This is really disappointed as we can't see a clear night view. But fortunate when we are at the peak, it's snowing. We are happy to see snow as in our country it's not possible to enjoy snow fall. Overall if it's a bad weather and you have",
          "Getting to Mt Moiwa observatory was quite easy - just take the tram and get off at the Ropeway Iriguchi stop. From there, look for the free shuttle bus stop. The visit was unfortunately marred by poor weather and strong winds. It was due to the strength of the wind that the",
          "I took the streetcar from Susukino to the shuttle bus stop, then took the free shuttle to the bottom of the ropeway, It was around 4 pm and the sun was just about to set. The view going up the ropeway was gorgeous. You can see most of Sapporo city enveloped in snow. The mini",
          "I went there when it was about 3pm plus & still sufficiently bright so I managed to see the city in daylight as I was going up the cable car. Then when I got to the top where the observatory was, it was dark, so I got to see 2 beautiful views with only 1 entry price! The night",
          "The view here was breathtaking. It was open air so it was freezing during winter time when i was there, but the view was spectacular and one could take many amazing photographs without the usual reflections u get in a covered observatories. I noticed some people wondering on",
          "This is a must see place in Sapporo. It offers fantastic views of Sapporo. The rope way and then mini cable car is very quick to ascend and descend the mountain. The views from the top of the mountain are breathtaking. It is worth going to the mountain about 45-60 minutes",
          "I expected less from this attraction, but instead I found myself wishing that I bought the season pass. Had this been full of tourists, I would have hated it. As it turned out, I only saw 4 other tourists in the 3+ hours that we were there. Do not worry if there is a",
          "i walked up the mountain with my school in summer, it was a hard walk but only took 1 and a half hours and the view was gorgeous. Once we got to the top i couldn't believe what i was seeing the view was breath taking of the city i absolutely loved it and highly recommend it!! we",
          "The lift gets very full If you go up at dusk you get the day time view and the lights at night",
          "If you are staying in Mercure Sapporo hotel, be sure to take the free shuttle to Mt Moiwa Ropeway, and take the discount coupon to purchase the round trip Ropeway tickets to go up to Mt. Moiwa. The view is lovely, but be sure to stay warm cos it can get cold easily at night. I",
          "Fantastic night view from top of the Mountain. They even provide a free shuttle from the streetcar station to the ropeway.",
          "I think this is the only place where you can observe Sapporo in 360 degree manner. Worth the money you pay to get up to Mount Moiwa with the furnicular and mini cable car. But first of all, you need to take the street car from Susukino. The view is breathtaking And you will",
          "My in-laws took me here a couple of time. My father-in-law likes to bike up the mountain. Mt. Moiwa offers the best view of sapporo. In the winter this place doubles as a ski slope."

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River. Sapporo has an elevation of 29 m (95 ft 2 in)Sapporo has many parks, including Odori Park, which is located in the heart of the city and hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year. Moerenuma Park is also one of the largest parks in Sapporo, and was constructed under the plan of Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese-American artist and landscape architect.\nNeighbouring cities are Ishikari, Ebetsu, Kitahiroshima, Eniwa, Chitose, Otaru, Date, and adjoining towns are T\u014dbetsu, Kimobetsu, Ky\u014dgoku.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nSapporo has ten wards (\u533a, ku).

Summers are generally warm, but not overly humid, and winters are cold and very snowy, with an average snowfall of 5.96 m (19 ft 7 in) per year. Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues. The heavy snowfall is due to the Siberian High developing over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low developing over the northern Pacific Ocean, resulting in a flow of cold air southeastward across Tsushima Current and to western Hokkaido. The city's annual average precipitation is around 1,100 mm (43.3 in), and the mean annual temperature is 8.5 \u00b0C (47.3 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe tertiary sector dominates Sapporo's industry. Major industries include information technology, retail, and tourism, as Sapporo is a destination for winter sports and events and summer activities due to its comparatively cool climate.The city is also the manufacturing centre of Hokkaido, manufacturing various goods such as food and related products, fabricated metal products, steel, machinery, beverages, and pulp and paper.Hokkaido International Airlines (Air Do) is headquartered in Ch\u016b\u014d-ku. In April 2004, Air Nippon Network was headquartered in Higashi-ku. Other companies headquartered in Sapporo include Crypton Future Media, DB-Soft, Hokkaido Air System, and Royce'.\nGreater Sapporo, Sapporo Metropolitan Employment Area (2.3 million people), had a total GDP of US$84.7 billion in 2010.In 2014 Sapporo's GDP per capita (PPP) was US$32,446.\n\n\n== Culture and entertainment ==\n\n\n=== Music ===\n1934 \u2013 The International Contemporary Music Festival was held by Akira Ifukube, Fumio Hayasaka, Atsushi Miura, and Isamu Ifukube (30 September)\n1936 \u2013 Russian composer Alexander Tcherepnin visited Sapporo\n1960 \u2013 The Sapporo Symphony Orchestra founded\n1962 \u2013 John Cage and David Tudor visited Sapporo\n1966 \u2013 Berliner Philharmoniker with Herbert von Karajan performed Brahms's Symphony No. 2 at Sapporo Shimin Kaikan (April)\n1974 \u2013 Maria Callas last public performance at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan (11 November)\n1986 \u2013 The Sapporo Art Park include the Outdoor Stage and Art Hall (27 July)\n1990 \u2013 The Pacific Music Festival (PMF) started\n1997 \u2013 The Sapporo Concert Hall Kitara opened\n2018 \u2013 The Sapporo Community Plaza is set to open in October\n\n\n=== Art ===\nThe Hokkaido Museum of Modern Art represents Hokkaido artists like Eien Iwahashi, Kinjiro Kida, Nissho Kanda, Tamako Kataoka, and especially glass objects of Ecole de Paris\nThe Hong\u014d Shin Memorial Museum of Sculpture hosts a collection of over 1,800 works by the artist Hong\u014d Shin.\nThe Sapporo Art Park contains Art museum featuring outdoor installations & a sculpture garden, and the old house of Takeo Arishima.\nThe Moerenuma Park including the Glass Pyramid, designed by Isamu Noguchi\nThe Migishi Kotaro Museum of Art\nThe Hongo Shin Memorial Museum of Sculpture\nThe Miyanomori Art Museum\nThe Sapporo Odori 500-m Underground Walkway Gallery\nMember of UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a Creative City of Media Arts since 2013\nSapporo International Art Festival (2014/2017)\n\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe Hokkaido Museum of Literature\nTakeo Arishima Residence in Sapporo Art Park\nJunichi Watanabe Museum of Literature\n\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Idiot (1951 film) by Akira Kurosawa\nThe Northern Museum of Visual Culture\nTheater Kino\nThe Sapporo International Short Film Festival and Market\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\n\nRegistered Tangible Cultural Properties in Sapporo\n\nThe former Hokkaid\u014d government office building\nThe Sapporo Clock Tower\nThe Hokkaid\u014d Shrine\nHokkaido Museum\nHistorical Village of Hokkaido\nSapporo Buried Cultural Property Center\nThe Sapporo City Archive Museum\u3000(Former Sapporo Court of Appeal)\nThe Edwin Dun Memorial Hall\nThe Hokkaido University & Hokkaido University Museum\nThe Sapporo Beer Museum & Sapporo Factory\nThe Sapporo TV Tower\nThe Sapporo Convention Center\nThe Sapporo Salmon Museum in Makomanai Park\nThe Sunpiazza AquariumSapporo JR Tower adjacent to Sapporo Station.Sapporo Ramen Yokocho and Norubesa (a building with a Ferris wheel) are in Susukino district.

          "When I mentioned to friends that I was going to the historical village, they suggested I include the Hokkaido museum. So glad I did. It gives a great back ground and history to the island, with many translations in English and other languages.",
          "A brief history of the Ainu people is well laid out and presented, with enough English signs to provide interest - apparently you can download an app to supplement this but unfortunately time did not allow us to do this. Broader aspects of local history are also touched on, and",
          "This is an excellent museum, particularly its coverage of the Ainu and early colonial period. It also has many archaeological artifacts. The English captions are very good, you may want to get an audio guide, but that does not seem necessary. The museum seems out of the way,",
          "a stunning building too! This museum tells you everything one needs to know about the Island- the grond floor covers the efornmation , climate and geology of the island0 it is so clear, so informative and easy, there is even a good section on tracing the impact of tsunamis. On",

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city.

When Simon Rattle visited with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 1998, he described the hall as \"the best modern concert hall in the world\".\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe building was built on July 4, 1997. Prior to its construction, the nickname for the concert hall \"Kitara\" had been chosen in March 1995. The nickname is derived from \"Kithara\", an ancient Greek musical instrument in the zither family, and also the term \"Kita\", which means \"north\" in Japanese. The building area covers 8,383,291 m\u00b2 in total, the number of floors is 3 above ground and 2 underground, and the Hokkaido Engineering Consultants Co.,Ltd is the main builder for the concert hall.The concert hall is home to the Sapporo Symphony Orchestra, and its regular concert is held in the hall each year. The hall is one of the venues of the Pacific Music Festival (PMF), an event started with the idea of Leonard Bernstein in 1990.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nThe building of the Sapporo Concert Hall houses a large main hall, small chamber music hall, and rehearsal rooms. A restaurant, nursery room, and museum shop are also located in the building.\nThe arena-style large main hall has a capacity of 28,800 m\u00b3, and installs 2,008 seats for audiences. Above the main hall, a huge pipe organ is installed. The organ was manufactured by an organ builder, Alfred Kern & Fils Manufacture D'Orgues based in Strasbourg, France, and annually an exclusive organ player is invited from overseas. Having 4,976 pipes, the pipe organ is modelled after needle leaved trees in Hokkaid\u014d prefecture.The shoebox style small chamber music hall has seating capacity of 453. The restaurant with terrace is located on the ground floor, and a bar, cafe, are open during the concert. The main concert hall and the small chamber music hall also have seats designed for handicapped audiences.\n\n\n== Organists ==\n1998-1999 Pascal Marsault \n1999-2000 Yves Lafargue\n2000-2001 Laszlo Fassang (HUNG)\n2001-2002 Juan Mar\u00eda Pedrero (ESP)\n2002-2003 Monica Melcova (SLOV)\n2003-2004 Jean-Philippe Merckaert (BEL)\n2004-2005 Matthieu Magnuszewski \n2005-2006 Jens Korndoerfer (GER)\n2006-2007 Ghislain Leroy \n2007-2008 Sylvain Heili \n2008-2009 Cindy Castillo (BEL)\n2009-2010 Laurent-Cyprien Giraud \n2010-2011 Coralie Amedjkane \n2011-2012 Florent Galliere \n2012-2013 Maria Magdalena Kaczor (POL)\n2013-2014 Octavian Saunier\n2014-2015 ***\n2015-2016 John Walthausen (USA)\n2016-2017 Davide Mariano (IT)\n2017-2018 Martin Gregorius (POL)\n2018-2019  Simon Bollenot\n2019-2020  Adam Tabajdi (HUNG)\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of concert halls\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSapporo Concert Hall Kitara English version (in English)\nSapporo Concert Hall Kitara Japanese version (in Japanese)",

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River. Sapporo has an elevation of 29 m (95 ft 2 in)Sapporo has many parks, including Odori Park, which is located in the heart of the city and hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year. Moerenuma Park is also one of the largest parks in Sapporo, and was constructed under the plan of Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese-American artist and landscape architect.\nNeighbouring cities are Ishikari, Ebetsu, Kitahiroshima, Eniwa, Chitose, Otaru, Date, and adjoining towns are T\u014dbetsu, Kimobetsu, Ky\u014dgoku.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nSapporo has ten wards (\u533a, ku).

Summers are generally warm, but not overly humid, and winters are cold and very snowy, with an average snowfall of 5.96 m (19 ft 7 in) per year. Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues. The heavy snowfall is due to the Siberian High developing over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low developing over the northern Pacific Ocean, resulting in a flow of cold air southeastward across Tsushima Current and to western Hokkaido. The city's annual average precipitation is around 1,100 mm (43.3 in), and the mean annual temperature is 8.5 \u00b0C (47.3 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe tertiary sector dominates Sapporo's industry.

          "This was a stop on an afternoon bus tour of Sapporo. We spent about an hour here, which was plenty of time considering the frigid weather. I checked out the view, took photos of the statue of the revered Dr. Clark, crawled inside an igloo, visited the Sapporo Snow Festival",

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River. Sapporo has an elevation of 29 m (95 ft 2 in)Sapporo has many parks, including Odori Park, which is located in the heart of the city and hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year. Moerenuma Park is also one of the largest parks in Sapporo, and was constructed under the plan of Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese-American artist and landscape architect.\nNeighbouring cities are Ishikari, Ebetsu, Kitahiroshima, Eniwa, Chitose, Otaru, Date, and adjoining towns are T\u014dbetsu, Kimobetsu, Ky\u014dgoku.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nSapporo has ten wards (\u533a, ku). The color shows the location of each ku in the map below.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSapporo has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa), with a wide range of temperature between the summer and winter. Summers are generally warm, but not overly humid, and winters are cold and very snowy, with an average snowfall of 5.96 m (19 ft 7 in) per year. Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues.

          "Maybe I'm just not that interested in this history, but the things on display weren't interesting at all. Not much English text so I couldn't understand most of what I was seeing. You could probably just go to the park surrounding the building for a nice walk- which is honestly",

          "Seeing the former Hokkaido Government building covered in snow was a sight to behold. The red building with the flag of Hokkaido flying over it makes you wonder how life there used to be. Lots of history in that place, from governors to Ainu artifacts. And do you know what's the",
          "Without the \u201cWelcome to Hokkaido\u201d sign in front of it this pretty building would be worth only a 2-minute look from the sidewalk. The sign makes a good selfie spot though so queue up with the other tourists to take your new profile picture.",

          "The free admission is great but make sure you get an english guide from the person in charge otherwise you might be wandering aimlessly around the house. The guide (more like a map) will show you where each room is and the significant historical events that surrounds it. Good",

          "This is an interesting site to visit with plent on show but not much in elnglish. This is not a problem and it tells the story of when Sapporo was fist established and of the local indiginous peoples of the area. The building itself is also interetsing to look at. Well worth",
          "It was late November and the largest tree here which was in the middle has gone to yellowish orange and started to fall, while the other trees around it has nearly all shed off its leaves, thus the grounds was also in yellowish orange. The man made lake was just a view and",

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988.

          "This is the most depressing place ive been too and i would like to credit the animals, especially the birdlife, for not committing suicide. Built by people who dont value animals as having intrinsic rights. I shudder at the thought of there being tinier zoos in Japan.",
          "Small zoo but has some highlights: Penguin parade, polar bears, owls and many Hokkaido native animals. Some animals have small living spaces and don't seem very happy.",
          "Walked quite a distance from the park and got the tickets without any hassle. Spent around 2 hours there until closing at 4pm. 2 hours is about right to enjoy your time there if you skip the eateries around. The enclosure is rather small for some of the animals, hope there",
          "Decided to visit this zoo. Walk for 1.2km from the nearest train station. We had a good time though it was quite small place compare to other zoo i visited. But good for half day activities. The entrance \u00a5600 per person. Quite affordable for families. The cages were quite small",
          "We went during relatively low peak season, so there isn't a lot of visitors, but all animals are available except penguins (maybe we missed them). The animals looked lively and were making their rounds when we visited. Children loved the interactions though there were no animal",
          "Quite a walk from the subway station, but you can walk through the park and enjoy some view. Entrance ticket was quite cheap. The wolfs were beautiful. They have polar bears and quite lively too. But the red pandas are adorable! They have some activities with the red panda too",
          "This zoo features the animals from Hokkaido such as the Ezo Momonga, Hokkaido Squirrel, Japanese Rat Snake, Japanese Glass Lizard, Japanese Odd-tooth Snake, Mamushi Pit-viper, Japanese Forest Rat Snake, Japanese Striped Snake, Ezo salamander, Japanese Tree Frog and Ezo Brown",
          "This was a spur of the moment visit as we were in Maruyama Park and my mom wanted to check out the zoo. We had a great time there and enjoyed seeing animals we couldn't normally see at other zoos, like the red pandas, giraffe, and meerkats. We spent a few hours walking around",
          "Unfortunately, our visit was on a Monday so we didn't get to see the zoo :( We'll come back anyway! During Mondays, the zoo is closed.",
          "The zoo is really small and we finished it in 1 hour as the zoo was about to be closed. Animal enclosure does not seem to have proper enrichment activities and the space is not enough as well. Savannah animals at the zoo such as lions, zebras and giraffes were kept in a small",
          "The location of the Zoo may be inconvenient when taking public transport. It is easily a good 10-15 mins walk from the nearby subway station. Requires to walk through the park before arriving at the zoo entrance. Spent a good 3-4 hours around the Zoo. There is a petting zoo",
          "This very small zoo is recommended for families with children - good place for them to run around for a few hours. Access is a pain, I suggest taking a taxi from the city instead of the train and bus as it\u2019s just not worth the hassles. No comparison to Asahikawa",
          "The zoo is of decent size for a 1-day trip. My son enjoyed the wolf and the seals. The venue is super clean. Good balance of indoor-outdoor displays.",
          "The main highlight of this zoo was the polar bear and I wasn't disappointed as I got to see the polar bear in action in its big den. The only bad side of this zoo is the foul odor in a lot of the animal homes. I have been to a lot of zoos and this is by far the smelliest of them.",
          "My visit made me depressed. I think zoos should focus on a few interesting animals and create living spaces for these animals that don't make them apathetic. Seeing giraffes in cages where they can barely turn around is really a shame. The ostriches looked stressed, the sad",
          "Visited the Zoo during winter after spending the morning wandering around the Hokkaido Shrine at Maruyama Park. It's very easy to get to, you can walk the scenic wood path through the forest though in winter make sure you're rugged up. Once you reach the entrance you purchase",
          "Easy access just by taking the green line. Suggest you allot at least 2-3 hours to fully enjoy the zoo. Has polar bears and penguins and tropical animals too. Entrance is only 700 yen. From the zoo, there is also the Hokkaido Shrine and Maruyama park. Wear comfortable shoes",
          "It was a good visit. My 11 year old truly enjoyed her day. Many different selection of animals to see. Even free wifi for tourist. Easy to get to by train. From the zoo we took the same train to the end of the line to visit the Ishiya Chocolate Factory. Time well spent.",
          "Went on a weekday, not crowded at all. Entrance fees 600yen for adults and children under 12 is free on charge. It was a snowing day and the zoo provide umbrella to all visitors. 15mins walk from the station. There r so much to see in the zoo. But due to cold weather, some",
          "Less crowded and you can spend time as much time you like with your fav animal. Not like Asashiyama Zoo that you need to fight for a sport to take pic with some animal. I went in winter and African animal are locked in the indoor exhibition room, like lion. It just stand right",
          "Zoo of a different kind. Looks like some cages are empty but actually due to the cold weather, the animals could be outdoor or indoor. Loved watching the red panda walked around the tracks at ceiling level. We bumped into a playful seal whom my daughter could conduct it's",
          "Unless u have a car, this zoo is about 1km from the nearest subway station. Some of the exhibits did not have any animals in them..and those which did only had 1 animal in the compound. Nevertheless, it's good for the kids..make sure you bring some lunch or titbits cos not",
          "I have never been to a zoo in Japan before, despite visiting three times, so we decided to visit Maruyama Zoo, which is a few subway stops outside of central Sapporo. Like much of Japan, it is a mix of ancient and modern. They've obvious done a lot to bring the zoo up to world's",
          "So the positives are that this is cheap, it's moderately sized, and you can get a pretty close view of some pretty cool animals. The negatives... Some of the enclosures feel like they're straight out of the 1980's. The monkeys especially looked kind of sickly and the bears and",

          "Its a pretty big zoo and got various zones. The animals are quite chilled and the set up makes it easy to find them/ watch. Particularly love the sheep area as they are open for all visitors to interact with. The only disappointment is didnt see the giraffe around during my",
          "Animals are well looked after, big and nice place filled with snow during the December period. The Zoo is well maintained and clean.",
          "A very inexpensive zoo, with a large variety of animals. Zoo is well-maintained, animals are well-fed, and the toilets are clean. However, the indoor enclosures are a little too small, resulting in some of the animals pacing about repeatedly and looking frustrated. I suppose",
          "What an experience, walking through a glass tunnel and seeing two polar bears and a number of seals swimming over you (they are separated in to different pools so don't worry about seals becoming a meal for the bears). And this is only one of the exhibits at the zoo. But don't",
          "A nice day trip with kids to see different animals (especially rare ones like polar bears and lions). There\u2019s also an indoor play area near the main entrance with a nice cafe to chill out. Not the most convenient with public transport, but it\u2019s a short taxi ride from Central",
          "There was a lovely selection of animals at the zoo, and a lot of the enclosures were great because you could really get up close with the animals. We also went in the snow and this was just lovely for taking photos. However I felt the winter/indoors enclosures for the animals",
          "Small Zoo easily reachable by public transportation and a short walk. I went during this past winter for the Sapporo ice and snow festival and took a day trip to the zoo, it was snowing and cold but many of the animals were still available for viewing since a lot of the exhibits",
          "Came here despite snowing winter and totally love the experience. Much lesser crowd and still get to see the animals. The place isnt too big with plenty of restrooms and a couple of rest areas/restaurants/shops... Its a good place for couples, family and kids and to build",
          "If you are a zoo addict, there aren't super phenomenal stuff so you might be disappointed, but if it's a nice day out nd you would like to see some animals it is great! Because of the snow, a bit harder if you are bringing people on a wheelchair. Try to go on a good sunny",
          "Went here with my husband January 2018. The enclosures are really well made and beautiful (except for where they kept the seals), but unfortunately most of the enclosures were extremely small and the animals were bored and restless. They need to expand the enclosures and give",

          "It\u2019s a very nice zoo with a good collection of animals. Was probably my first time seeing a polar bear; wish it had snowed so I could see the animals more in the natural habitats. Some buildings for tropical animals have heating system all \u2026",
          "WOOOOW....Probably the best zoo i have ever been to. Smell? the only thing i could smell was how clean it was.  Bonus...you can actually been in the same room with the Red Pandas.  I really wanted to pet one but the little guy sure let me \u2026",

          "Pristine environment and cool weather",
          "It's a tad bit smaller in comparison to the other zoos and the enclosures are really small with barely enough space for the animals to roam. Considering that they have large walking paths for visitors, I do hope that they'll consider \u2026",
          "Quite like this zoo located in the east of Sapporo. Despite its small size, it has quite a lot of different animal species and most of them has indoor resting/sleeping area and outdoor exercising area. \nThe newly just re-opened elephant \u2026",

          "I went during winter, most of the wild animals were caged inside the buildings. It was a great experience though. Saw the bear, no polar bear, snakes, flamingo, a very old ape. Sorry no pictures now. Will upload some pictures when I visit this month.",
          "Most animals were lively at time of our visit. Place well kept. Nice that we can bring our own food and many indoor places to have a picnic.",
          "our daughter was very happy as she got to see several unique animals. especially the snow leopard, which she had been dying to see for a while.\n\nother highlights were the red pandas and the pretty awesome polar bear exhibit. the latter is \u2026",
          "We went during the end of winter, some of the animals were in their sheds. We were allowed to go inside the shed thru the back. There was some renovation going on so we had to walk around some of the places. Good for 2-3 hours.",

          "Very worth for 600 yen",
          "Lovely zoo to do if you have time.",
          "This was one of my favorite zoos! It's worth it for the red pandas alone. The entrance fee is very reasonable too, and you're able to see the animals pretty closely. I only take a star off because, like many zoos, some enclosures seemed too small/in need of upkeep.",
          "The zoo was extensive with plentiful opportunities to interact with animals through the exhibit and through a petting area. But it is hard to ignore the obvious conditioning the animals are subjected to and the quality of the cages. \u2026",
          "Great place for kids and near subway station.You'll through beautiful park before arrive at the zoo",

          "Awesome place to bring the family",
          "Came to Sapporo for the Yuki Matsuri and got excited about the polar bears. Not worth it to be fair. Because it's cold most of the animals are indoors, in cages. And fof the few that are outside, are either sleeping or freezing. Might be better in a different time of the year though.",
          "We had a wonderful cold weather day touring the zoo. Friendly staff and fun programs for the children.",

          "This place is fairly amazing though it is small. But I don't recommend it for winter travelers and I'd say not to got there until next year. Went there recently and whilst the tiger wa sick, many other animals were NOT in their enclosure \u2026",

          "Winter season is the best!",
          "This is one of our favorite zoos. It has many rare animals you can't see anywhere else. It is renovating its buildings to provide better glimpses of animals up close and personal. We think the animals are less stressed here. ",

          "Even though there was a slight lack of activity due to the off-season weather, we still had an excellent time at this zoo. Some of the animals were a bit isolated due to temperature considerations, but the polar bears were super comfortable in the snow. \n\nIn particular I found the reptile house excellent.",
          "A lovely zoo, worth visiting if you have an afternoon to spare and love animals. Highlights of the zoo are the seals, and polar bears, amongst other animals rarely found in tropical zoos.",

          "Go to this area is a must try. Some shops open till late and Don Quijote open 24hrs. There's a lot of tax free shop. You can find anything in this area. We visited this shopping area few times as our hotel just nearby and too tiring to do in a day!",
          "Although it doubles as shop for snacks and confectionaries and suchlike, Calbee Plus really scores with its line-up of Poterico and soft ice cream. With the Poterico Salad, there\u2019s no reinvented wheel here, but everything\u2019s exactly as it should be: the chips have an exceptional,",
          "This is a sheltered open air pedestrian walking street. It is about 7 blocks long with shops and restaurants on both sides of the street. The shops looked rather plain and simple. Many of them seemed to be selling the same things. I didn\u2019t feel any excitement or liveness",
          "If you have been to other parts of Japan, this shopping street is just the same as others. If you are into shopping, maybe you can spend more time here. One can use the underground walkway to reach here from Sapporo station.",

          "We shop in there a lot of time when we stayed at Sapporo because it's near to our hotel. We buy many souvenirs and we love there.",
          "Really nothing much. Most shops repeat themselves, game arcade booths and shops that sell Japanese tidbits and souvenirs. There was a pet shop with sale of puppies and kittens that was more interesting. A long street with 6-7 sections. The underground pole town separates it into",
          "Well sheltered stretch of shopping areas. You will find lots of stuff here, from food to souvenirs. Good to walk, regardless of the weather, there are seats for you to rest during your breaks. You will definitely be spoiled with choices. Most items are at good buys. Truly, shop",

          "Such streets are or look quite typical of Japanese shopping street. This one spans a few roads, and is covered, except when you have to cross the roads. We came here a couple of times, just for the clothes/bags/shoes bargain and also the big Mega Don Quixote store, which opens",

          "Loved this shopping arcade. From the restaurants (where I had delicious pig liver and chives in a Korean place, and pasta in another) to the ice cream and many stores. Be sure to look for the used clothing stores for great bargains, especially the one where you go down narrow",

          "Kinda touristy but on our first night, we got into our hotel a little later than expected so having this shopping arcade near our hotel made it easy to find many eating choices. I wish I got the name of this Irori grill. We had a great dinner. They had the 980 yen all you can",

          "It was not as fanciful as those found in the mega cities like Osaka and Tokyo. The shops seen here are usually restaurants or drug and cosmetics stores and apart from that, there really isn't anything special about this shopping street.",

          "When compared to shopping streets seen in other Japanese cities, Tanukikoji is not very impressive. There is a good selection of restaurants and \u201csouvenir\u201d type shops, but the street lacks in real shopping or street food, which we found to be the highlights in other cities.",
          "Sure, see it. It's in the area. But this is nothing to write home about if you have been to a few shopping arcades during your travels within Japan or put of Japan. Some food joints, souvenir shops, clothes shops etc. Kyoto, Osaka and Tokyo do these arcades way better!",

          "This was once a wonderful shopping arcade. Sadly (or happily) the shopping has moved underground to the stores and arcades there where it's warm and bright year round What's left at Tanukikoji is a mostly deserted shell of what was once a thriving shopping area.",
          "In the afternoon on a winters day this is not such an attractive spot. It\u2019s undercover but cold with tacky shops.",
          "Was quite disappointed with this streets shopping, 90% are selling cosmetic. Unless you are here for group purchases of cosmetic, other than that I don't see ironic case to come to this street.",

          "Stopped by Tanukikoji Shopping Street to buy wrapped food and biscuit gifts for friends. The shop gives 10% off and they help to pack the food into big boxes to bring home. This is the longest covered shopping street in a Sapporo. Many hotels, restaurants and drug stores here",
          "Tanukikoji might be the most lively spot in Sapporo. It's roofed shopping street spans for a few blocks from west to east. It hosts duty free stores, pharmacies (which open until 10pm), budget hotels, and izakayas. Nice place to enjoy night in Sapporo.",

          "Went to the Tanukikoji shopping arcade and it have many interesting shop such as Calbee and KIt Kat, also souvenir shops that you can buy local goodies , Buscuits and chocolates lavender , horse oil soap , handcream and so on . There is a total of 7 streets , took me abt 2 hours",
          "This place has many stalls selling cheaper and outdated stuff. If you are looking at higher end goods or clothings, better to head off to the Malls around Sapporo station. The fashion there are closer to the latest fashion in Tokyo but not this place though.",

          "Cool place to wander around in. A covered shopping arcade with everything you could imagine, want, or need. When I started feeling like I was in the same shop as I was 5 minutes ago, I know it was time to button it up. It can get very repetitive.",
          "A busy undercover shopping strip with residents and drugstores, as well as a Don Quijote which sells delicious baked sweet potato for 108yen. The beauty is that this step connects to the underground Pole Town shopping strip, which connects to multiple other shopping strips. Very",
          "If you have never visited any Japanese shopping streets, then it might worth to visit. But i have ever visited shopping streets in Kyoto and not impressed for this. Take namhuk line and get off at suzukino street. (or you can get off in front of street from the tram.) Not",
          "It\u2019s a long stretch of restaurants and shops. And it\u2019s usually crowded with tourists. The street is also covered, so it\u2019s a great option to spend your time there if it\u2019s raining. Also a really good place to buy souvenirs as well as beauty products at their drug stores.",
          "Tanukikoji is one linear kilometer ( three-quarters of a mile) of non-stop shops. The shops are in an enormous variety, but it's not like the Ginza in Tokyo or Dotonbori in Osaka, the shops tend to be a tad downmarket. This will not prevent the dedicated shopper from spending at",
          "Right across from nijo market.... It's a long street of shops...plenty of cosmetics and pharmacies but the shopping streets of Osaka and Tokyo are better. This one is supposed to be the oldest shopping street in Sapporo...",

          "lots os small caf\u00e9s and restaurants not to mention so many shops selling all kinds of things I don\u2019t want to buy. There was a shower so it was fun to stroll inside and watch the hustle-bustle of the locals doing their thing",

          "My family and I hit the Tanukikoji Shopping Street on July 15th, the only rainy day on our Sapporo Trip. We had a great time walking the seven blocks of the shopping area, looking at the shops, restaurants and even a hotel or two. We hit the Donki Store and spent some time in",

          "I went there with family with the seniors. We enjoyed the shopping street very much. This place is all in one service ranging from eating like local in a small izakaya to the proper dinner. For shopping , the underground shopping street is fabulous. For the souvenirs, there",
          "This is a nice complement to the underground pedestrian walk between Susukino and Sapporo Station. They also intersect. Even though it's not climate controlled inside this covered arcade line of shops, the \"roof\" makes all the difference. I don't know how cold it is in here",

It is the only national government park in the northern island of Hokkaido.  The park area spreads over 395.7 hectares of hilly country and ranges in altitude between 160 and 320 m above sea level.  Currently, 192.3 is accessible to the public.  The park grounds are separated into six zones: the Mountain Stream Zone, Central Zone, Lodging Zone, Forest Experience Zone (planned to be open in 2009), Nature Observation Zone (planned to be open in 2010), and Preservation Zone (not open to the public).  During the winter season, the park operates as the \u201cTakino Snow World\u201d, providing visitors with a wide variety of winter outdoor activities.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1975, the Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau set up a committee to select a possible location for a national government park in Hokkaido.  In 1976, the committee chose the current site, and the construction of the park was officially decided in 1977.  In 1983, the park, with approximately 30 hectares of the planned 395.7 hectare area opened to the public, begins its operation as the fifth national government.\n\n\n== Access ==\n\n\n=== By train ===\nFrom Sapporo, take the Sapporo Municipal Subway Nanboku Line to Makomanai Station and transfer to the Chu\u014d Bus Takino Line; get off either at Suzuran K\u014den Higashi-guchi Stop or Atsubetsu no Taki Stop.\n\n\n=== By car ===\nDrive on the Central Hokkaido Expressway and exist at the Sapporo South Interchange; head for Makomanai/Takino and follow the road signs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.takinopark.com/11_FOREIGN/index_e.html English Official park website\nhttp://www.takinopark.com/ Official park website",

        "wiki": "Sapporo Teine (\u30b5\u30c3\u30dd\u30ed\u30c6\u30a4\u30cd) is a recreational center in Teine-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It comprises many facilities, such as the ski resort (with other facilities, besides ski), the Teineyama Ropeway, and the Sapporo Teine Golf Club fields.\nThe ski resort has a summit elevation of 1,023 metres (3,356 ft), located on Mt. Teine, in western Sapporo. Currently skiing and snowboarding can be performed here. In 1972, Mt. Teine was the site of the first Winter Olympic Games in Asia and hosted the giant slalom and slalom events in alpine skiing.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nSapporo Teine ski resort is separated into the Highland Zone, and the Olympia Zone. Also, connecting the 2 zones is the Rainbow Course, a super long course with a maximum run length of 5.4 km (3.4 mi) from the summit. Other facilities at the ski resort are Highland Ski Center (with lift ticket sales, rental gear, shop, restaurant, coin lockers, nursery, etc.), Olympia House and North Maple (restaurants), Hot Caf\u00e9 1024 (cafeteria), the General Information Booth, and Pandaruman (kid's winter park; snow play, skiing, etc.).\nThe Highland Zone comprises various kinds of courses for all levels of skiers. Here is also the place to enjoy a great view over the city and the sea of Japan on sunny days.\nThe Olympia Zone, includes both intermediate and advanced levels courses. At this zone is located the Olympic flame-holder, exactly as it did during the games.\nBoth zones are open to the public (for skiing and snowboarding practice), between early December and late March, every year.\n\n\n== 1972 Winter Olympics ==\nThe 1972 Winter Olympics were held 48 years ago in Sapporo, and Mount Teine hosted the alpine skiing (giant slalom and slalom only), bobsleigh, and luge events (Note: The bobsleigh and luge tracks used for these Winter Olympics were separate tracks.).\n\n\n=== Alpine skiing ===\nThe first skiing courses were constructed between 1968 and the end of 1970. The slalom courses had an elevation difference of 300 metres (980 ft) while the elevation differences for the men's and women's giant slalom were 400 and 300 metres (1,310 and 980 ft), respectively. Requiring additional vertical drop, the downhill events were run on Mount Eniwa.\nAfter the Olympics, Teine has held many important ski events such as; Winter Universiade, Asian Winter Games, and other FIS official competition (the International Miyasama Ski Games), as well as being one of the main facilities for regional and national ski competitions.\n\n\n=== Bobsleigh and luge tracks ===\nThe tracks were constructed between October 1969 and January 1972. Costing \u00a5 433 million to complete, the bobsleigh track was constructed of reinforced concrete, which took 60 ice workers twenty days to create ice that was 13.5 cm (5.3 in) thick. A total of 127 lamps were used to highlight the course for night runs. Costing \u00a5 277 million to complete, the luge track was constructed of reinforced concrete and took 1000 man-days to create ice.\nNo turn names were given for the tracks.\nAfter Nagano was awarded the 1998 Winter Olympics in 1991, the tracks were dismantled.\n\n\n== Access ==\nJR Bus: 20 minutes from Teine Station (JR Hokkaido) to Teine Olympia mae Bus stop.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Japanese)\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River. Sapporo has an elevation of 29 m (95 ft 2 in)Sapporo has many parks, including Odori Park, which is located in the heart of the city and hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year.

Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues. The heavy snowfall is due to the Siberian High developing over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low developing over the northern Pacific Ocean, resulting in a flow of cold air southeastward across Tsushima Current and to western Hokkaido.

          "We were spoiled by all that Tsukiji Market had to offer in Tokyo. So, these smaller \"fish markets\" in other cities don't impress. Obviously they have fresh fish (more crab here), but we found better deals on hunks of sashimi at the underground supermarket in Susukino. So, we",

          "Went to Nijo Market with my family about 2 weeks ago. Convenient as the Tanuki Koji Shopping Arcade is just across the road. Susukino and Odori Park are also within walking distance of 15 - 20min. Love the fresh seafood, though the variety may not be as comprehensive as Hakodate",

          "Opens in the morning till late afternoon. Suggest to go early to catch a glimpse of their operations. The dried scallops are beautiful but sure to bargain with the shops for a better price. They also sells fresh seafood for dining in. I didn\u2019t stay Long as I can\u2019t stand the",

          "What a great place to see all of the local fish and seafood. Several offered samples of dried or smoked fish. We ate at one of the shops recommended by our tour guide. The grilled crab legs were amazing. Needless to say we left the restaurant stuffed!",

          "If you want to try the famous Hokkaido snowcrab or King crab this is the market to visit. They also serve huge scallop, tasty uni and oysters. The snow crab and King crab are not cheap, if you are going for the live one but its worth a try... they are just yummy!!!",
          "It was to our surprise, we went on a weekday at lunch hours during the Easter holiday, there were only a few people, not even much tourist. We walked around some shops, brought some dried scallops and strawberry basically most of the shops put their prices up high and when u",
          "Come here if you are a fan of chirashi bowl and seafood. They have a variety of stalls selling fresh seafood as well as dry scallops for you to buy back as gifts. Stop by one of the shop for lunch and remember to take pictures as memory.",
          "We stayed for three nights at an AirBnB apartment just next to Nijo Market. Stalls are mostly selling fresh seafood and there were also some restaurants, pubs and cafes around the area. Prices at the market were generally a bit higher as can be expected for a place catering to",

          "It\u2019s a fish market around two blocks. There are shops selling both fresh and dry seafood, and seafood restaurant: sashimi rice bowl, grill sea urchins and clams, all kinds cooking of crabs which Sapporo is famous for. Sashimi scallop is extraordinary fresh which you can\u2019t",
          "Costly but totally worth it, coz it was super sweet n super fresh. Would recommend to go for the live crabs rather than the frozen or \u201cdead\u201d ones that are displayed, worth every bit you spend. Sea urchin was above expectation, no fishy \u201curine\u201d smell",
          "From our Nest hotel, it was a 10 minutes is need to walk around the market if you were did not stopping to look at things. We had a 2 person seafood meal which include 3 different kinds of crabs - hairy crab, snow crab and king crab, sea urchin, salmon roe, yellow roe and 4 raw",
          "Enjoyed my time walking around here. If you like seafood this is the place. I thought prices were reasonable for fresh seafood. Fresh fruits available also. I will go back when I visit Sapporo again.",
          "There are many shops selling a wide range of products, though many sell seafood. You can buy grilled oysters or sea urchins directly from the shops selling the produce. There are little restaurants selling seafood items like king crab bowls and sashimi.",
          "You can expect costs to be higher since this is a market for tourist, no doubt it's still fresh for the seafood and fruits. This is esp so for the stall facing the main road... if you go inner side of the market, you should find some steals.",
          "This is where you can have the best seafood Hokkaido can offer, the king crabs are live! The freshest scallops, oysters and uni! They also have live hairy crabs! We come here every December just before Christmas to have these delicacy. And we will be coming back for more!",
          "For fresh king and snow crab lovers, Nijo market is a must go. Price is so reasonable compare to where I come from. Boil or BBQ both are tasty and sweet. I would recommend to go for the first stall, they guy is so friendly and good business guy.",
          "We bought 1 whole crab go back hotel eat, very shiok!! Fruits are fresh.. Quite an interesting place",
          "So so. We went around 4pm and most of the shops were still opened. Tourist spot and not a must to go if you have no time. Not crowded.",
          "I fried some of the shrimp, sea urchin, scallop and oysters they are extremely fresh and rejoicing in your mouth. We kept coming back for breakfast in 2 days. They also serve not coffee with Hokkaido milk in the bottle, it taste very smooth",
          "Do go early as the fresh supplies reduce as the day passes and some items maybe sold out before the end of the day. Fresh seafood can be selected and cooked at the restaurant. A great place to savour the local fresh seafood supplies, from King Crab to Sashimi.",
          "Fresh seafood and loads of crabs. It\u2019s a touristy spot and many of the shop owners speak fluent English. Recommend to walk around and take in the sights and the prices! Nevertheless a wonderful experience.",
          "Great place to \"see\" seafood :-), a lot of Fresh seafoods to choose from, there are shops, too, selling dried seafoods. Shopped here for really yummy dried seafoods that we took home. You can even have fresh seafoods cooked for you, stores actually have their own restaurants",
          "We went there because a friend recommended it to us especially for uni so we went there and ate the donburi. The uni and ikura were so fresh and tasty. If you like sashimi then this is the place to go in Sapporo, they have many types of sashimi.",
          "If you're a fan of seafood, this is one place you must visit. Not as touristy as the one in Tokyo, but a good place to buy fresh crabs and other creatures which taste good in garlic butter. Check out Ohiso - small bowls of urchin / salmon/ roe/ sashimi rice that won't fill you",
          "Centrally located in the Sapporo City which allow easy access to the market. Fish looks quite fresh and the dried seafood looks good too. My mum bought some scallop at 4500 yen. But the market is too small to make it a trip worthy of travel so visit only if you are near the",
          "If in Sapporo plan a visit to Nijo Market to see, smell, taste, king crab(Tarabagani), hairy crab( kegani), and rare Hanasaki crabs on ice. There is a myriad of other fresh and dried, smoked seafood products such as sea urchins(uni), scallops(hotate), shrimp(ama ebi), Okhotsk",

          "The Nijo market is right beside the Tanukikoji Shopping Arcade, easily accessible by a short walk. We went there on a weekday afternoon. The place was quiet and no queues for restaurants (great!). The sashimi they have are the freshest ones I've ever had in my life. Very",
          "This is 1 of 2 seafood markets in Sapporo. This being the closest to city center & more touristy. Not as big as the wholesale market. Still worth a stop though. Always like walking around morning markets in Japan. Lots to see, try & buy. Also a great stop for some fresh seafood",
          "The market is not difficult to find, walk by all the stores that are displaying all the seafood to get an idea of the pricings. We picked one store as shown in the pictures n selected crab legs to be lightly grilled. We were given a discount n were directed to a small shop",
          "Very small seafood market, where you can buy fish, crabs and some fruits. Quite expensive and not much of choice. If you come from Far East where seafood is not an exotic, it is not worth going to Nijo",
          "We came for a stroll through the market and couldn't say no to trying some of the Hokkaido king crab. It's not cheap but a must do for seafood lovers. I would recommend the J Soul Brothers shop which is right on the corner and they have a restaurant across the road. We ordered a",
          "It's a small neighborhood \"fish market\" with fresh seafood of all types. I've bought packaged dried snacks here to bring back as gifts and eaten their fresh sashimi abalane and tuna. So deelish!",
          "If you would like to see live seafood in water tanks, Nijo market will disappoint you. It's a small market with almost no live seafood in tanks. We did see about 2 stalls with live seafood but the selectionnis pathetic. As we had been to Curb Market innour earlier trip, Nijo",
          "Come here first for breakfast before going for shopping in the alley. I didn't expect the market to be so small but despite that, there are lots to choose from. Mainly tourists here. We had our snow crab here and it was delicious. Donburi is also very good here. Go in",
          "Now it's about tourists. (I'm Japanese) and I saw lots of visitors outside of Japan. They told me they can pack and send to outside like Hong Kong. So you can purchase them here without worrying about how to carry it back. I was told that business with tourists are smaller",
          "Not a very big market, and because we visited during the end of winter, it was a little wet and messy. Though, it's not very crowded and it's a good place for souvenir purchasing. Other than seafood, you will also get to buy chocolates and various kind of Japanese snacks here.",
          "Delicious fresh seafood, well-worth a visit. Go early and have an amazing breakfast! Food was very affordable and delicious.",
          "Must visit Nijo Market when you are in Hokkaido, Japan. This market is easy to access from Sapporo City center. Since the market is located in the center of Sapporo, this market attracts visitors who are looking for fresh crabs, shrimp, scallops and so many other seafoods caught",
          "Nijo Market is quite small when compared to the Tsukiji Market, but its size adds to the market's charm. It is less crowded and very central to the city center. We found a small family owned restaurant to have our first Kaisendon. Very tasty...if you're into raw seafood, you'll",
          "If your time in Sapporo city is limited , then Nijo market is the place to head to as it's located in the city center . It's located very near to the Sapporo Tower about 150m away . It is primary a seafood wet market selling fresh giant crabs and all sorts of fresh seafood .",
          "There are alot of such markets all over Japan . This one is small compared to others, especially in Hakodate. There are some dining outlets within but generally not very interesting. However, it is always worth a visit to \"new\" attractions, as one never know what to expect",
          "The number of shops and selection of goods is better here than the Central Wholesale Market. Its location near the main Sapporo city area makes this the better alternative for seafood in Sapporo.",
          "Compared to the fish markets in various cities, this one us definitely very touristy. The usual colourful displays of fishes, crabs and sea urchins were the but the food seems over priced. Nothing special about this place. Can skip if you don't have time in sapporo.",
          "Nijo market is just 2 blocks east of Tanukikoji Shopping street in easy walking distance. The market is large enough to offer good variety & competitive prices and small enough to be an enjoyable leisurely experience for 4 seniors exploring Sapporo for the first time. We",
          "There are many food stalls and stalls were selling fresh seafood here. We tried the hokkaido grilled scallop and it was extremely great and fresh ! We also bought a fresh hokkaido king crab and brought it to the restaurant! definitely a must visit market in hokkaido",
          "we visited at around 8am (as recommended), but it was a 5 minutes visit. not to much to see, but its located in the center, so worth the 5 minutes visit.",
          "Japan is the land of my favorite cuisine mainly because of sashimi. I went to Nijo Market in Sapporo hoping to get my fill of fresh Hokkaido scallops and crab and it definitely went above and beyond my expectations. First restaurant I tried there was Ohiso, the second one was a",
          "We visited at about 3pm in the afternoon on a Fiday. The market is supposed to be still open as it is not a morning market. However, while almost every shop was still open, the whole ambience is not lively. Not what one might expect from a market of this size. Could it be",
          "The market itself is quite small, but oh my goodness the size of those snow crabs. It's not cheap to eat here, considering the fact that it is a market. Also can be a bit touristy. However, we had incredible fresh seafood donburi here. Uni-don, chirashi, and the snow crab",
          "Nijo Fish Market is opposite Tanukikoji Shopping Arcade Section 1. The stalls mainly sell fresh seafood, some of which can be cooked on the spot. One of the more outstanding stalls sold a crab-related set consisting of crab gratin, steamed crab bun, and crab miso soup. Using",
          "Typical tourist must see place. I find the Curb Market, slightly off the beaten track, near the Soen JR station with better vibes & slightly more authentic as a wholesale seafood market.",
          "First time to visit Sapporo, also our first family trip, don't want to miss some seafoods that's why Nijo Market is on our list. Not bad for a 1000 Yen per bowl, i can say we're satisfied & definitely will go back again. Next time we will try the Ramen.",
          "This is a small market with a good range of local seafood, including some small, friendly and well-priced restaurants. The place is a bit run down and not as lively as many I have visited in Japan but not far off the beaten, shopping path. Visit if only for a great lunch of",
          "Nijo market is comparatively smaller than some other markets we visited, but nevertheless there is a good range of seafoods & dried foodstuff to choose from. The foods are fresh, however, we do find it a little pricy. If you are also visiting Hakodate, I would recommend the",
          "If you're planning to stay at Sapporo by winter Dec-Feb, you must visit Nijo Market. From Tanukikoji Chrome 7 shopping district may takes 10 minutes walk. The best place for Alaskan giant crab hunting; cost around MYR380-MYR600. But worth of money spend here. For once in a life",
          "As I said, I think you can get better deals overall at Otaru. But if you are not going to Otaru, you can bargain and get decent prices since there are enough stalls for competition for your business. Restaruants - we ate directly across the street on the corner, small",
          "As it is located near odori park and other tour points, this market is very convenient to access easily within 10 minutes by walk. There are some fish don restaurants and many fish markets. You can enjoy real fresh seafoods and fish don here. Very good location !",
          "Nijo market is situated on one end of Tanuki-koji pedestrian street. However, no much foods outlets/restaurants and the price of seafoods seem to be much higher than Sapporo city. Environment wise, smelly and not so hygenic; I could prefer to eat in restaurants or food outlets",
          "We visited Nijo Market 2 times in 2 days ! We enjoyed our rustic dining experience at Nijo Market. You can select your own Hairy Crab, Scallops & Clams & have them steam & also grill it for you & eat it there! A very special tasty experience. The live crabs, scallops and",
          "Vacations cholesterol doesn't count! The seafood are so fresh and so sweet that they are worth every penny! Yes, they are not cheap, but at least money well spent. Recommend to come here by public transport, we drove and it was tough getting a carpark lot in peak hours.",
          "The fish market is a series of individual seafood stall holders selling a wide array of seafood. Crab is king and there is a variety of crab species to choose from. We chose our King Crab legs to be cooked and 10 minutes later they were delivered to restaurant across the road.",
          "A must see if you like seafood. Seafoods here are cheaper than in restaurants. Almost all shops offers to cook the seafood for you and you will eat it just in the side of the street.",
          "Not big comparing with other fish market in Japan. So it's not very interesting if you visit here just for looking.",
          "The must visit market in Sapporo, morning Nijo market. We have breakfast here and the first time eat giant crab and love the sweet strawberry. Many items we can buy but suggest to eat kind of seafoods.",
          "A nice seafood market with many hidden shops in the alleys behind it. You'd be surprised at the number of small shops hidden in the back alleys, where they cook and serve the fresh seafood. Interesting place to see and discover new places to eat. The front is where all the",
          "Compared with the Tsukiji Outer Market and the Curb Market in Sapporo, Nijo Market is tiny. There are the usual vendors with fresh seafood that can be bought and cooked on the spot, but relatively few vendors of fresh fruits/vegetables and dried goods. The whole market probably",
          "We visited Nijo Market, hoping for various snack items in sight but the place was actually a literal wet market. We didn't eat at all. We just walked and looked around.",
          "A seafood market located in central area of Sapporo. There are many shops selling fresh seafood (crab, prawn, fish, sea shell etc), and they can cook them for you there. The price is cheaper comparing to Tokyo and Osaka.",
          "The seafood is not as fresh as those in otaru. If you're going otaru, can skip the seafood here. Can still go nijo to have a look, nothing much tho'.",
          "Seems to me the sole purpose of Nijo market was just built for tourist. No doubt the seafood was fresh but this is in Hokkaido! I wouldn't expect anything less than fresh! Prices weren't cheap and nothing really much to see.",
          "Nijo market is located at one end of the Tanukikoji shopping arcade. Stores selling seafood, fruits etc can be found and they are open from 7am to 6pm. All seafood looks delicious and fresh. You could choose your desired seafood and let them cook for you or if not, patronized",
          "This market have lots of shops selling fresh/dry seafood and fruits. Instead of going to the restaurant on the main street, e went to a restaurant in the small alley way and Seafood bowl rice for breakfast and a restaurant for dinner. It is a little expensive when compare to",
          "Good place to visit while in the city. It's a small market that's easy to get to. Most stores sell the same things but may be of different quality (e.g. dried scallops). Make sure you shop around. In some sense the stores do seem to cater towards tourists rather than locals.",
          "We went here at 7 am and the lengthy walk at subzero temperatures was worth it. The sushi is fresh and there are a bunch of restaurants where you can get a variety of seafood that is otherwise harder to find in the rest of meat-loving Sapporo. It's also nice to wander around the",
          "Visited Nijo Market twice during my tour in Sapporo. Mainly we were there for the seafoods that there could offer specially the King Crabs. If you go in a group of said... 4 - 5 persons and order plenty of seafoods and divide out the bills. It's actually not that pricey after",
          "Visited Nijo Market consecutively 2 years during the month of April, the seasonal produce at the time as Asparagus, Corns, Strawberries and more... If you'll like to experience and get premium + high quality local produce at the most affordable price, this is the place! Also",
          "Was here on 3rd Feb 2017 and had a steamed king crab and some other dishes. Excellent fresh seafood. Be aware some shops do not let you take photographs.",
          "Wasn't a pleasant experience, few variety and no variations between the stalls. They are all selling the same thing - snow crabs, oysters, dried scallops etc. Not cheap and you get people trying to sell you something at every stall. I did not feel comfortable and wanted to",
          "If eating exotic seafood is your thing this is the place. Four different kinds of crabs for you to try. - KIng Crab. Snow Crab, Hairy Crab and Hanasaki Crab. Freah Sea Urchin, Oysters, Scallops, Snails, Whelk are swimming in the water tank.",
          "Offers a lot of variety of seafood. You can also buy little souvenir while waiting for your hairy/king crab to be cooked by the vendors. They even offer you mega discounts if you happen to shop few minutes before they close shops :)",
          "Had a walked towards Nijo market on Wednesday morning. Wasn't impress at all. Very few variety and the shops were too few and unexciting. Seafood looked normal. Had some and can't even remember the name of the restaurant, but the food was so so and not worth the price we paid.",
          "We had the best seafood here. There are so many choices and the prices are reasonable. The main thing is that seafood is so fresh here.",
          "What am I going to do with a $100 USD frozen King Crab?? Eating places WAY WAY over priced, nothing worthy hear, and that includes the so-called Sapporo Wholesale Market.",
          "This market is filled with Seafood like king crab, scallop, octopus, etc. The stall holder will automatically give you discount on certain products as there are so many competitors. Should try your raw seafood - salmon, marlin, sea urchin, etc. The king crab is awesome, fresh,",
          "This is the only place we could find breakfast (didn't want to eat hotel breakfast) They serve yummy sashimi, crab, oysters and etc",
          "We got lots of fresh seafood and produce over here. Perhaps we were there during holiday - Dec 30 - so there weren't many selection or variety like we have hoped (compared to a few days earlier in Hakodate). But still had good quality stuff, all the famous Japanese seafood are",
          "Going here is via Tohoe subway line then exit at ODORI station. Upon exit you will see the Odori Park, facing Odori park, just cross one time to the other street then just go straight for about 5mins. We turned to WAZE for directions since NO SIGNS FOR DIRECTIONS TO THE NIJO",
          "Love the fresh seafood. If you love crabs, you must visit this market where you can pick the crab and have it freshly cooked. Most shops sell similar things. Not as busy as Tsukiji in Tokyo where you have battle your way through. Worth a visit",
          "Just stay near Nijo market whenever you visit Sapporo. It's the best place *period* Have been to other parts of Japan and you just can't beat the quality and price here. Note that I am referencing to feeding a family of 7 (2 teenagers whom can eat a mountain). The seafood here",
          "Many shops selling fresh fish, different types of crabs, clams mussels oysters... Also has shops selling dried scallops and other food stuff. These are quite reasonably priced if you look around first before buying it there. Has restaurants there too. Most serving donburi.",
          "I recommend a trip to Nijo market in the early morning followed by a walk at Tanukikoji (shopping street) in the late morning. Thereafter, you can enjoy a 5 star lunch at Ohiso (see my review of this restaurant) before taking a stroll at Odori Park. This takes up more than half",
          "A short walk from the Odori Station, this market is small, most of them selling crabs such as snow crab and flower crab, scallops and sea urchins. Some of the stalls offer free samples or sell the seafood cooked in front of you. Some of the stalls also sells dried scallops and",
          "This is the seafood market of Sapporo. Unlike the tsusuki market in Tokyo, this place is much smaller. However, you can still find all the seafood that you need at this market. There are a number of eateries selling seafood as well. They do have dried seafood products on sale",
          "Although there have a variety of seafood, the highlight of this place are the crabs. There's a few variety but the most popular is the king crab however for me, the best is the flower crab because it's the sweetest and most flavourable of the crabs there. Check with the shop as",
          "Was there yesterday 7th Dec, small market with limited live seafood. Ate 6 pieces of sashimi at a small stall with lots of name card and foreign currency.Very inflated price compared to other locations. Must do some research and ask prices before order.",
          "One of the best crab and seafood market! It is quite small, but best snow crabs! Reasonable price and friendly staff. We visited the first store in the corner, you can have a warm seating place across the street if you purchase from that shop. Loved it!!!",

          "Nice place to sample local catch and seafood. Can be quite pricy for a bowl of rice but its definitely worth a visit.",
          "Food is ok. Pretty small place overall. Sankaku @ Otaru is way better. But in the November rain, the sheltered walkway all the way is welcomed.",
          "It was located within walking distance from my hotel (Tsubaki Premier Hotel) and opens up from 7.30am onwards. If you are into freshly harvested salmon roe, sea urchin, scallops, expensive snow crabs and rock melon, do pay a visit to this neighbourhood market. Language is not",
          "There are lots of stalls along the front of the market selling fresh seafood - served fresh or cooked on the spot. Just be careful about the prices advertised for the crabs - they are indicative only and can be negotiated down.",
          "Had my breakfast here in one of the seafood shop, easily the most expensive breakfast in my life. Typical Hokkaido seafood street with tanks outside displaying crabs of all sorts and if you are ready to splurge, they can prepare you a shashimi out of the crab of your choice on",
          "Just 2 stretch of shops and a few restaurant. Nothing compared to Tokyo tsukiji n hakodate market. Had breakfast in one of the restaurant and they have a good gesture of taking photo with crab for us",
          "If you love going to explore local culture and you love markets, then you must go here early in the morning. While it may be a small fish market compared to others in Japan, it is very historic and full of happy people selling crabs and all sorts of live and fresh fish. The",

          "Although I don't eat seafood I was interested in taking a look at this market. It is quite small but very interesting, with lots of fresh crabs, either whole or legs for sale and strangely lots of melons for sale - the prices of these were astounding, I will never complain at",
          "Went there for lunch and was very for the range of fresh seafood on offer. You can go for the most expensive live snow crabs or just a crab miso for a few hundred yens. The shops selling dry goods are typical buyers beware. Some offering huge discounts (before you open your",

          "This is an unpretentious seafood market just at the end of Tanikokuji shopping street. Best place to have fresh crabs, chirashi, grilled scallops, uni, ebiko and an assortment of sashimi & sushi. Value for money considering the price.",
          "Getting very excited to visit this unique place , we went very early at around 7am. Unfortunately , it was just too early , only 2 stalls opened and the other fews just get preparation. Did not see any restaurant opened, does no venture. Still be able to see a few varieties",
          "This is a very small market. Went to Keiran which is at the corner of the market . Had the chutoro sushi ( 370 yen per sushi) . It was excellent . Tried their specialty grilled hamachi with salt . It was so so good . Should try it (780 yen ) . It is limited on a daily basis .",
          "We went in Jan 2016, it was very Sapporo but because we were stayed very close to the hotel, so it only took us 10 mins to walk to Nijo Market. We went to the market at around 11 am, only a few restaurants were opened ( it was a big market market anyway). We did not have any",
          "Small selection of stalls selling produce and a number of them selling seafood. There are some stalls that offer sashimi or BBQ if you buy the seafood on the spot. There is also a stall that allows you to select the crabs within the tanks with spaces for dining on the spot, as",
          "Never have I seen a live king crab before. We were fortunate to come across a friendly lady of a stall where we spotted the sea creatures in tank. She offered to cook for us to taste the sweet delicious meat of the crabs including a hairy crab and scallops. Not only that, we had",

          "Nothing much to see in this market for us as my children don't like seafood. Just few shop selling same seafood products. Good for those who like seafood products. Few blocks from the Sapporo tv clock tower and exit from odori subway underground no.35. Use Google map, easy to",

          "I tried some restaurants around Nijo Market and it was impressive. Sushi was really good with reasonable price.",
          "We went here twice during our 3 weeks trip in Hokkaido. Definitely worth a visit for those who want to eat sashimi and king crab. Don't forget to bargain if you plan to buy the crab. They can cut thousands of yen if you're buying a whole crab.",
          "It's a small morning market @ sapporo and nothing if you compare it against Tsukiji market in Tokyo or Nishiki market in Kyoto. However having said that, I will still recommend to pay a visit to this market as you will find bargains on food that you cannot find in Honshu island",
          "Great fish market taking up about a block in downtown Sapporo. There is a vast quantity of all different sorts of fresh seafood from shellfish, crustaceans, mollusks and fish. All appear very fresh and are beautifully displayed on ice or live in tanks. Too bad we don't get",
          "Not much here. Disappointed with the number of retailers and choices. Not much atmosphere. All retailers keen to offer discounts",
          "Pasar ini sangat kecil sekali, harga yg ditawarkan juga sangat mahal, you can have better quality and cheaper price of food even in the citose airport, so just skip it, and find another place to go",
          "This is one of our favorite breakfast/brunch spot in Sapporo. Find Donburi-chaya and check out their \"today's special\". Price is decent, quality is above good. Been here Dec 2014 and June 2016. Never fails to satisfy.",
          "We went too early in the day, and not many shops were open. The ones we went past were quite pricey, and hence it was quite disappointing. Definitely go later in the day if you can",
          "Had breakfast there.. It's a very touristy market. Not so authentic. The food is not cheap either. It's OK to stop there for a couple of hours but don't expect too much",
          "Not big and spectacular but it's worth a visit. Some store staff are friendly . For eg this shop ( see photo) I would recommend . Friendly staff and even if you don't patronise they let you try boiled blue crab/ king crab :)",
          "Again we have visited Nijo Market by early June. The market stalls were more or less the same since our visit last year. However, we found that the prices have risen. Anyway, tourists would go to this market and purchased their dried seafood back home and tried the fresh",

          "My first interaction with Nijo Fisk Market was the restaurant on the leftmost edge of Nijo. They had an array of fresh seafood meal options and I just had to try the 5 part meal including 3 small donburi (seafood on rice) bowls with ikura (salmon roe), scallops, and sea urchin,",
          "It is only a row of shops selling the normal seafood items, nothing to shout about and prices are not cheap. Better to buy at Hachinoche or Hakodate market",

          "This market is very small and has only a few stalls and hardly any eateries. Very pathetic place. Not worth visiting",
          "We went here for breakfast. Had seafood donburi and crab miso soup. Cost $40 for two people. The crab was tasteless and proportions small. Save you money for other parts of Japan. Sapporo is an overpriced tourist trap in general and this market is really nothing much.",
          "We missed both the Tsukiji market in Tokyo and the morning market in Hakodate but wanted to get one experience of a Japanese seafood market. It's very small and there's not much other than to buy seafood to take away or eat in one of the restaurants, and we did the latter at",
          "I visited this place about 15 year's ago and remembered it was bigger and people were more friendly. But now, its a bit smaller than I remembered and it seemed to miss the fish market atmosphere which made it a unique place to visit. A bit disappointed. But it still has some",
          "How can you come sapporo without coming here for the seafood experience! No reason not to visit, it's just mouth watering looking at all the seafood freshly caught sold and prepared to your appetite here with a real reasonable price !! Best to visit between 6-8am :)",
          "This small market has stalls selling fresh seafood and seafood restaurants. I did not eat any seafood here because the prices appears higher than those in Hakodate where I was a few days earlier. I noticed they sell octopus eyes too. Guess its a local delicacy? Overall, I spent",
          "This is certainly the place to go for fresh seafoods. King crabs and giant scallops abound, the fresh catch offered never seems to end. But be careful when selecting your seafood stall or restaurant to enjoy yourself. There are a few seafoods business there that take advantage",

          "Get the freshest choices of seafood at this market. Furthermore, a few restaurants within serve fantastic Shashimi.",
          "Went there early in the morning at 7am. The seafood shops are not as many as in Tokyo Tsukiji Market. Great to visit if you prefer quiet market. Tourists are advised to walk through the shops first and check the price tags before buying. Some shops allow price bargaining and",
          "not much to see compare to tsukiji. the freshly open sea urchin also not the best quality. theres a few souvenir shops instead of fresh seafood and restaurants.",
          "There's a lot of fresh seafood (scallop,sea urchin, crabs,raw fish etc) you can choose to either eat them raw or cooked! Price mostly from 1900 yen to 3000 yen per set.Worth to pay a visit as you can see lots of big fresh seafood there! And I even saw a stall selling whale meat.",

          "A lot of people might say its touristy but come to think of it, the location is awesome and for people who do not have luxury to travel far away to find some other markets, this could be the only best site to visit, so why not? Open almost daily from 6AM, the market, despite",
          "I think one of the other reviewers summed this up, when the place is full of tourist and hardly any locals is this really the fish market to go to? Prices seem to be steep as well. 2 King crab legs cost 5000 yen. Have to say they cooked them well and cut them perfect, all the",

          "This market can be easily visited since it is centrally located. Here, most produce and seafood are repetitively sold by the stalls that lined the market. Overall it was an enjoyable experience since there were hardly any tourist during our visit. However, we did notice that the",
          "Staff from the establishments were very friendly, though not all of them are well-versed in English I was much taken aback when a male staff gave copious amount of king crab meat for us to sample! However, we ate king crab at another establishment as it was apparently more",

          "Choices of stalls are limited. Prices are over rated. If you see more tourists than locals in a fish market, my advise is do not buy anything there. You'd be shocked to see for something similar with a price tag 2 to 3 times higher. That's if you realize it.",
          "Excellent slabs of sashimi served. We tried the salmon sashimi, fatty tuna sashimi (excellent, a must-order dish), grilled squid, buttered scallop, scallop sashimi (excellent, a must-order dish), king crab don (not so good, can give it a miss), uni mix with crab and tuna don.",
          "Nijo market is small but still plenty to see and eat. Many of the stores are linked to restaurants so you can pick out the crabs you want and have them cooked for you. You can also have oysters shucked there and eat them. There's also some fresh produce. There are eateries",

          "We have visited this market for two times during our trip in sapporo. You can find a restaurant nearby to enjoy Sashimi Rice Bowl, or to buy a fresh crab for taking away. We proposed to buy a crab in one of the shop, however we are not sure where we can cook it. The shop keeper",
          "The fresh seafood market is pretty small, smaller than what it looks like in the photos. Since every stalls here sells almost the same thing, so decided to hop into one of it with uni, scallop and king crab on the menu! The price was affordable, way affordable than eating the",
          "This is a great Japanese fish market selling fresh crabs, seafood, sea urchin, seaweed, salmon etc. The Hokkaido crabs look sensational and the stall holders are happy to freshly cook the crabs at the spot so you can enjoy it straight away. The price is so much cheaper compared",

          "The store at the corner closest to the traffic light, who has a small eatery acorss the road, which gave free crab samples. We bought the whole red flower crab, but found out later that half the red flower crab was stale and tasteless. Only half was served fresh and juicy !",
          "It's a small market. Not many shops for shopping, besides, mostly were dried products, fishes, crabs, and fruits. Guess just not a suitable place for foreign tourists but probably okay for local people. After all, some products might not be able to be carried back to some",
          "This was our first fish market so we went in without any expectations. We were blown away. We sampled salmon jerky, bought fresh sashimi, cracked open fresh uni, and ate a beautiful salmon donburi at one of the many small restaurants that are interspersed between fish stands.",
          "Went to this market with high expectation was left a bit disappointing, the platform I was comparing was Hakodate so I would give this one a skip, Sapporo Jyogai Market is better then this one IMO. More stores and more lively.",

          "Sapporo's Nijo Fish market is smaller than the Tsujiki Fish Market in Tokyo, but it's also less crowded, making it possible to take your time and enjoy the market at your own pace (tasting samples, chatting with the vendors, taking pictures, etc.). This is also an advantage",
          "We visited on a Wednesday around 11:30am and a lot of the stalls in the market were closed. Of the stalls opened, there were plenty of King Crab and Uni available for great photos. On another Trip Advisor contributor's recommendation, we walked into the heart of the market",
          "If you love sashimi this is the place for you! You can get a very very fresh and big scallop for 300 to 600 JPY and ask them to prepare the sashimi for you. Other items are good too. Some shop has a cut of Otoro (maybe around 300g) with a price of 2,500 JPY! I've tried it the",

          "I have visited the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo on multiple occasions so was a bit skeptical about Nijo given the small size. It turns out that this is its greatest advantage as we were able to enjoy huge portions of unbelievably fresh seafood without the long waits of Tuskiji.",

          "For those expecting Tsukiji tuna auctions and magnitude, think again. It's just a small market selling fresh seafood and one of the few places in Japan where bargaining with the vendors is not frowned upon. Prices aren't exactly cheap, but hey, at least the seafood is guaranteed",
          "The store owners didn't push us to buy anything. We found a small restaurant inside and they serve really fresh and delicious seafood. We even tried steamed whale milt! We spent less than USD100 for 3 of us and we had sea urchin, salmon roe, salmon, scallop, dried hoke fish,",
          "Go early for the fish/seafood market action. Surrounding it is shops that sell fresh seafood. Hokkaido crabs are humongous and plenty of fish, roe, dried squid, grilled squid, etc for sale. Plenty of restaurants serving the fresh seafood too. Must try their crabs, urchin, toro,",
          "Things are expensive here. Go to the central wholesale market instead of this place. Surprised that the store owners are not friendly.",
          "After we been to hakodate market, we felt this place is boring. The vendors are quite intimidating too and we dare not even go near. Not worth the visit unless this is your first time exploring such market in hokkaido.",

          "This market is small but it is close to city center. You can even walk back to the JR station from here and it would take you less than half an hour. We had a snow crab, conches, sea urchins and scallops. The seafood was delicious as they were fresh. Cooking was simple -",
          "The main reason people come to this market is because it sells fresh seafood material such as scallop and king crab. The other reason? you can bargain the price, if you are good enough you can even get a half price over the original price it's written. so don't forget to",

          "I read the Japanese review on this website. Most of them lamblasted this market but I don't think it deserves the bad reputation. I went there on a late Sunday morning, & gasps, the market was deserted. It certainly was not as crowded as Curb Market. And it was very small.",
          "Been here twice for lunches and I really doubt there is any other place in the world that can offer you the same Japanese crab varieties, seafood freshness and value. This time we had an interesting find, two different types of Ikura (Salmon roe) which are marinated",

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River. Sapporo has an elevation of 29 m (95 ft 2 in)Sapporo has many parks, including Odori Park, which is located in the heart of the city and hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year.

Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues. The heavy snowfall is due to the Siberian High developing over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low developing over the northern Pacific Ocean, resulting in a flow of cold air southeastward across Tsushima Current and to western Hokkaido.

          "The park can be reached by riding a train from Sapporo Station and a bus. Travel time is less than an hour. The park is filled with man made features like Mount Moere a 62 meters tall and offers great views of the park and the surrounding area and a Louvre like pyramid",
          "The spacious park includes art installents, hilld, many walking and cycling trails and and much more. Cycling is the best option. It offers great views of the city if you climb to the top of the hills.",
          "Got here in the evening, so only managed to visit the pyramid, and walk around a little. The pyramid is beautiful, with lovely views from the top. The park is also lovely, with lots of sculptures, if only I had more time.",
          "We went here by city bus and got lots of help from fellow passengers to find it. it is one of our most prominent memories of sapporo, and indeed of japan in general. do NOT miss the fountain show, preferably the one that occurs after dark.",
          "This is a huge public park and we wanted to visit the different attractions like the fountain, the hill and the Glass Pyramid. We underestimated our time. We came to the park around 4pm and by the time we walked up to the top of the hill, it was sunset already. The walk up",
          "This spot is far from the center of Sapporo city, it takes 50-minutes by the train and local bus. From the nearest bus stop 'Toyohata' it's a 15-minute walk to the center of the park. In this park, there are white birch trees, artificial hills and a pyramid of glass. You can",
          "This park took my breath away. It was quiet when I visited the park and it was so calming to walk around. Viewpoints from some sculptures were breathtaking. I would go back here in a heartbeat!",
          "Landscape park, the territory is pretty big, so it's a lot of walking or you can rent a bike on site. If you want to see it all - be ready to climb a lot of stairs.",
          "This park is famous as great sculptures park designed by Isamu Noguchi. I love this park since when I was child. It has beautiful mountains, sculptures and playgrounds For children. Unbelievably the entrance fee is nothing. Just free! A little bit far away from Sapporo",
          "This is a sculpture park designed by the American born artist of world renown; Isamu Noguchi. there are kids play areas, and fountain shows long and short (30 min and 15 min), there are also 30 tennis courts and a sports field. Built upon a landfill dump in a swamp, this is",
          "Such a chill place, with beautiful scenic views. Had lots of fun cycling around!! The tranquility I\u2019ve experienced is one that I can never forget.",
          "My fiance and I went here for sightseeing. We wanted to see snow on this area, however, most of the snow has melted because we visited in the closing month for winter season. Nevertheless, the views are great and fresh air awaits. We had alovely time while walking around.",
          "Wonderful, unique park dedicated to a talented artist. Went with my wife, sister, and mother who all enjoyed the experience for the landscape design and overall visit. We\u2019ve been to the Noguchi studio museum in Long Island City, NY and love his aesthetic and work. This is even",
          "The highlight of my trip to Sapporo. What a thoughtfully built park which engages all your senses! This is not to be missed even thought it is not easy to get to and not very clear to get instructions on either. I would recommend a taxi but given that Taxis are super",
          "This park is okay for a bike ride or view from the top of the hill. The best part is the fountain, which sprays in various patterns.",

          "We rented the inexpensive bikes at the park (200 yen for 2 hours) and took a self-guide tour through the park. Though we are average-sized, the bikes were too small. The birch forest to the west of the main entrance were breath-taking, the highlight of our visit",
          "We rented a bike for \u00a5200/2hours and it worthed every pennies of it. The landscape, clean air, relaxing atmosphere we could just escape from all the routine in our life momentarily. The restaurant inside the pyramid was a perfect setting. Close to Sapporo Sato Land Farm Park",

          "For 200yen you can hire a bike for two hours to ride around the park, which is highly recommended as it's such a huge park to cover by foot. Weather permitting, it's quite a relaxing half day in a very calm setting.",
          "Free to enter. We rented bikes at very reasonable rate (200 yen for 2 hours) at the entrance and helped to move around, which saved our energy for walking up to various higher grounds for most charming views around. We enjoyed the 15 minutes fountain show. Check the schedule",
          "The place is bigger than I expected, and so green! The Isamu Noguchi Glass Pyramid is a must see. Can trail up to grass hills/slopes, nice small hikes. Lovely in summer!",
          "They have bike rentals for 200 yen and I learned how to bike here while admiring the architectural structures around the park! Great place for families to spend an afternoon in the park and to get a great view of Sapporo from the hills here.",
          "I went with my husband who is a wheelchair user. We went early June. Buses 69 and 79 from Kanjodori Higashi station go there. Both buses are wheelchair-friendly. Just tell or show the Japanese name of the place to the driver. The park is spacious. It is also",
          "Something for everyone! There are jungle gyms, mountains to climb, scultures to admire. If you are looking for a fun full morning or afternoon or both - moerenuma park is a lovely way to spend the day. There are multiple outdoor activities such as jungle gyms, scultures,",
          "I visited this park last week. There was still quite a bit of snow on the ground. I was only able to go inside the pyramid to look out but the restaurant, bike rentals and observation point were all closed (this was early afternoon). The bike rentals are closed during the winter",
          "It's a beautiful park, but it is difficult to get to, and in my opinion, it isn't worth the effort for a tourist, particularly if you have limited time available. If you have a lot of time, for sure, take the time to enjoy it and check it all out. There are a lot of other things",
          "It was a heavy snow storm when we were there. Our visit is to take picture , unfortunately it was very heavy snow rain , we waited for 2 hours inside the pyramide building , it was warm and very nice building . After waiting and took some picture around the building we decided",

          "It's very easy to navigate this park. The theme of this park evolve around pyramids. There is glass pyramid here and other pyramid hills. You can go in the glass pyramid but it's close on the first Monday of every month for maintenance. Bicycle rental can be found at the",
          "Having visited this park many years ago (even before it officially opened) I was delighted to return. A great place to bike/run/walk. Rolling hills that you can take at your own pace.",
          "This well-manicured park was built on a trash dumpsite, so it seems to get points for concept. But as far as a place to visit, it's sterile and hard to get to. Plusses are the fountain and wading pool in summer and cherry blossoms in spring. But honestly, I\u2019m not sure why",
          "This designed park is a bit of a way out of the city centre but it is well worth the visit. I went in July 2017 in the early evening and witnessed the sunset on the large mounds. There are a few landscaped hills, skate areas, sports courts, a baseball ground, tree planting",
          "Renting a bike was only 200 yen per person and I think made the scroll through the park much easier and enjoyable. The bikes had a self lock in each one, so it was very easy to leave the bike whenever we wanted to walk around. Great park!",
          "Travelers can easily go to this park via Chuo Bus No.69 or 79 from Kanjodori Higashi Station and return by No.68 from the park's east entrance. In summer, all family members or lovers can enjoy this park since there are several parts which fit for everyone; hills, lawn, mini",

          "We had to catch a train and bus to get out here, but it was worth the effort. Such a massive park, with some terrific sculptures and art works. So many people relaxing in the spring sun, on the grass and under the cherry blossom trees. Great place to just wander around, and",
          "With all the excellent, rich food that we've been having, we decided to include physical activity in today's venture. This took the form of renting Porocle bikes then heading out to Moerenuma, a pleasant 11km ride through eastern Sapporo, an area that is a mix of light industry,",
          "Moerenuma Park is an incredible mixed use public park that is suitable for all ages and interests. Mixing sculpture, architecture, public art, and diverse sensory experiences, it is a place that demands repeat visits in various seasons to enjoy the changing scenery. From the",
          "One of the nicest park I've been to! Don't expect flowers like furano though, everything is mostly a wide expanse of green. You can rent a bike and cycle there, but they are quite strict on closing time (last rental before 4? I think). Have a picnic there, climb to the top of",
          "The park is nice and filled with local people spending sunny days. We visited the park during the special decoration from gardeners around the city.",
          "We dedicated our only day in Sapporo to this Park. Great place to pedal with winds in your hair admiring 'manicured lawn' and artistically arranged trees. Best part : all for free (apart from the hired bikes). Recommended only if garden park/scenery is your cup of tea. Not",
          "Moerenuma Park is everything I expected and more. I am a Isamu Noguchi devotee. I have visited the museum in Queens, NYC, the sculpture garden in Mure on Shikoku, his dry garden in Santa Ana California. I own one of his modern classic coffee tables and a 6' Akari lamp and",
          "Our plan was to cycle around the park but we reached there too late. The bicycle kiosk closes at 5pm with the last rental accepted at 4pm. Nevertheless, we had a wonderful time walking around the park, climbing the hills and enjoying the sun while it sets.",
          "This park was a hidden gem in Sapporo. It was not on the top among the most popular tourist sites as it took some time to go there. However it was actually not too difficult or time consuming. I highly recommended people who could spare a day or half a day to go there. It was a",
          "Large open spaces/ lawns for kids to fly kites or play ball, green hills to climb and roll down, pyramids to climb, trees to picnic under - ideal for family fun but is it worth the 50 to 60 min journey from JR Sapporo station for the tourist? If you wish to see how brilliantly a",
          "My fianc\u00e9e and I came here as one of the location for our pre-wedding photography. This park is amazingly large with many cherry blossom and it's also a great place to ride bicycle. Peaceful environment, fresh air and beautify view especially from the top of the hill.",

          "Have been thinking to visit this Park for a long time. Finally I decided to make a visit one Sunday afternoon. I was impressed by the Glass Pyraimd. While you were inside, the clear and blue sky was on top of you and I like the view. This park is big and planted lot of Cherry",

          "The park was designed by Japanese American artist Isamu Noguchi. Art installations abound, including manmade hills, streams, sculptures, and landscaping. Unlike in other countries, picnicing is encouraged both in and outdoors. The park is child and cycling friendly. It is a",
          "The park is big, so renting a bicycle was a good option to enjoy this well maintained and lovely park. Cherry blossoms were beautiful. 2 hours of bike rental only cost 200 Yen. It is highly recommended.",
          "We visited in May 2017. Nice cool weather. We biked around, had picnic, climbed a hill. This is a nice outdoor place to bond with family, without gadgets!",
          "Was very excited to explore the park as it has such amazing reviews and is so well-designed. Because it was winter, was not expecting the bicycle renting experience, but was at least hoping to see a beautiful winter landscape. However, we went on a MONDAY, which is when the park",
          "The design of the park by Isamu Noguchi is intriguing. We loved viewing and going into the glass pyramidal structure to view, as well as walking among the few still blossoming cherry trees. Other areas, especially the huge grass hills looked interesting but we were on foot and",
          "Touted as one of the landmark sakura viewing places in North Japan and certainly in Sapporo we were shocked to find utter desolation due to unseasonal rains when sakura should have been at their peak on 6th May ..It was a great disappointment having gone to North japan to view",
          "Looking at pictures beforehand, it looks like just a nice park, maybe worth an hour on a lazy afternoon. But in person it's just beautiful. The scale is hard to grasp through pictures alone, and I wish we'd spent a little more time there. It definitely makes sense that they rent",
          "We enjoyed this park immensely! It is so huge you will need at least 3-4 hours to walk it! This park was designed by Isamu Noguchi. We have enjoyed his artwork in Kansas City & Washignton, DC. but this park surpasses everything we have seen before......His designs at this",

          "Went during the snow . We had to travel a long distance from the hotel, When we enetered there was no clear directions in the Zoo. No helpers and no one inside showing the directions etc.",
          "Went there on Monday and so would like to remind you all that rental of snow sport equipment is close on that day. Luckily someone left their plastic sled therefore my kids able to slide down the snow sliding track. We went there by bus from a subway station. Cannot remember the",
          "Whatever season you visit Sapporo, be sure to check out Moerenuma Koen. It's absolutely gorgeous in the summer and is a fantastic bike ride. It has a cool musuem and the park has so much to offer for all ages. The fountain show is great.",
          "We visited this park at the last minute, and are so glad to have included it on our visit before leaving Sapporo for Lake Toya. We skipped Otaru to spend more time here. Since we visited in November, we enjoyed the snowless park, the fall colors as the leaves were changing, and",

          "We visited during winter since we want to experience how is it like to play in snow. This place did not disappoint us. Since it was a holiday when we visited, there are only a few people there so we are able to explore and take nice photos. Downside is that the park is closed",

          "If your vacation is mainly in the city, it's good to get out here in the open and away from the traffic. The big hill in the middle is good for views and sledding- and we saw a guy climb to the top and ski down. The last 100 meters is actually fairly steep (though not dangerous,",
          "If you like art, it is great place to visit. This park was originally designed by Mr.Isamu Noguchi, who was a famous Japanese-American artist. The main building, glass pyramid, and large designed constructions can be found there. These are really warm and peaceful. The space is",

          "This stunning park is a little bit out of the way, but well worth visiting. More of an art installation rather than averge park. On my trip it was a cloudy day, which actually made the visit quite pleasant as it was cool enough to comfortably traverse the park several times. The",
          "Spent some time just shooting pictures and wandering around with family. Always reminds me of how spacious and free Hokkaido is compared to other parts of the country. A beautiful fountain show on summer evenings, and some neat art galleries too. Plenty of parking and it works",
          "With meticulously-maintained lawns, neatly-kept clusters of trees (like small groves or woods) and beautiful tree-lined paths, I would say with no exaggeration at all that this is one of the best parks I have been to in my life. And yes, there's also the big glass pyramid to go",

          "The installation art is more or less interesting, but it's the art that you are able to play on that makes it cool. Aside from being a nice park to relax at, the cluster of playgrounds is fun for kids. The view from the top of the mountain is especially nice at sunset.",
          "Good place to enjoy the outdoors and run around with the kids. Great views of the surrounding area, city, and mountains.",
          "I rented a bike and rode here along the bike trail on the river from downtown Sapporo. The ride, and the park were both nice. I can't say there was anything spectacularly interesting about the park, though. There were a few steep hills that you could climb, which provided nice",
          "What a great park with awesome views and architecture. All for free on top of that. It wasn't hard to find as the GPS took us around the small streets in residential neighborhoods and all of sudden, there is this huge park. This used to be a dump site and now it is a beautiful",

          "We went there to escape from the hustle of city life in Sapporo. Rented a bicycle for 200 yen and spend about 2 hours exploring the glass pyramid and others except the fountain as its was closed. A well spent morning ride in the park with reasonable access by subway ,bus and 1",
          "I had thought that Tokino Suzuran Park was wide and big; so is Moerenuma. The similarity ends here though. A few, huge sculptures and two (man made?) hills filled the big expanse of green spaces of Moerenuma Park. From a certain point within the park, the view looks like a copy",

          "How could you not come Sapporo and not visiting this piece of art! We love to walk around the park and we didn't mind the distance to come here. If we didn't have time constraints, we could've enjoyed the whole park slowly! But nevertheless we really love the time spent here, it",

          "This is a really excellent space for kids, with several playgrounds (on the east side of the park), huge lawns broken up by wooded areas, a couple of big hills to climb and good views of the Sapporo area. On the other hand I wasn't blown away by the sculpture and it's quite far",

          "Pretty great park to take a walk. Lots of locals bring their pets and kid there to enjoy the quiet and nature. Wanna visit a park close to the city with a forest inside? Just go there and you won't regret.",

          "Moerenuma Park was designed by Isamu Noguchi in the late 80's but wasn't opened until 2005, long after his death. The entire park is considered a sculpture but there are several 'attractions' within the park itself. The most prominent is Mt Moere, a man made mountain rising 62m,",
          "Easy to access and generally a nice and quiet park only a couple of minutes away from down town Sapporo.",
          "Take your own food if you go; we arrived at 1.15 and the only restaurant was full. The only other food place was the coffee shop which had sold everything except some paper bags of cold soggy fries. So nothing to eat and no lunch. The park is a re claimed waste disposal site.",
          "Visited the park after reading reviews on the site & I wasn't disappointed. Took bus 68 (for some reason tourist map doesn't mention this) from subway for about 35 minutes & it was a fairly easy journey. I hired a bike for 200 yen for 2 hours. Great value. Beach was shut on",
          "Getting to the park from downtown took almost an hour. Read couple of reviews on TA describing the various modes of transport to/from the park. What I came to realise is that Bus 6 plies only on weekends and weekdays from 19 July to 17 Aug...so it wasn't an option for us. We",
          "We absolutely loved this park. It is about a one hour ride from the city and I have to state up front that I don't think it is for everybody. It's a massive park with truly gigantic 'sculptures' designed by the famous Japanese-American artists. We were somewhat familiar with his",
          "We had some free time in the afternooon and were eager to visit this park designed by a well known sculptor in Japan. Eventhough early April is not a very ideal time to enjoy the space(the grounds are quite saturated with melting snow), we were not disappointed! The whole park",
          "I went to the park in a Saturday and even it was in weekend it wasn't very crowded. If you rent a bike it will be easier to travel inside of the park. The price of one hour rent is 100 yen. You can also take your tent and have a little camp for the day. There is also a little",
          "Impressive park. Nothing else like it. Go there. The sculpture is incredible. Take lunch with as cafe is limited if you don't want a sit down meal.",
          "The Moerenuma Park is located north east of Sapporo not so convenient to reach. From the Sapporo station you can take the bus number 59 to the last station. From there it si a 10minutes walk. The Park offers a great combination of sculptures, which are actually more buildings",
          "I thought the design/architecture sounded interesting enough to warrant the roughly one hour of subway and bus travel to warrant going, but we ended up staying longer and had a great time. This is the opposite of an electronic arcade; you make your own fun. The hills, glass",
          "We rented bikes to cycling around the park to save time and really enjoyed it. Beautiful landscape. Could not believe that this place used to be garbage dump site. The fountain show is nice and not to be missed. I lost my glasses somewhere in the park, and got it back from",
          "This was a great park for walking and relaxing. It is a wonderful People watching park that is well used by the local Sapporans. It is also close the shopping and restaurants. It also has music venues and at the time of our visit it had a flower festival going on with many",
          "We obtained a 1-day subway and bus pass for Sapporo and headed straight to Moerenuma Park. The park is gorgeous and not to be missed! Some of the playgrounds and sculptures were designed by Isamu Noguchi. Fantastic views at the top of \"Play Mountain\" and \"Mt. Moere\". We",
          "After I came back from my trip to Moerenuma Park, I shared with the hotel front desk abut my experience & she laughed. It seems that Sapporo citizens know about Moerenuma's desolate & forlorn winter, not the tourists. Here's why: - (1) Strong wind picking up & lifting snow off",
          "I love this park so much, probably the most interesting & fun park I've ever seen. There's a pyramid and a hill to climb, a dome like small hill in front of the pyramid, a glass house to see and small water ponds for children to play with, a nice route for jogging & cycling,",
          "The building and the surrounding area are both very unique. I will visit it again. There are lots of outdoor activities but you may need a sunny and warm day to enjoy it to the fullest. Arts activities and musical performance inside the main building as well. I spent 4 hrs",
          "This is a combination playground, park and art park, with great open spaces and makes a good place for a picnic",
          "To go there, just follow the instructions on their website . The bus stop returning to the subway is across the street from where you get off. Do check the timetable before you enter the park, as you may spend hours in there. You can rent a bike, though we walk. If you hate the",
          "A lovely modern park designed by a famous half British, half Japanese designer. Has huge outdoor spaces with soft lawn that kids seem to love to roll on, plus a wading pool for kids to jump around in, while the parents sprawl out on the surrounding grass watching over them."

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River. Sapporo has an elevation of 29 m (95 ft 2 in)Sapporo has many parks, including Odori Park, which is located in the heart of the city and hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year. Moerenuma Park is also one of the largest parks in Sapporo, and was constructed under the plan of Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese-American artist and landscape architect.\nNeighbouring cities are Ishikari, Ebetsu, Kitahiroshima, Eniwa, Chitose, Otaru, Date, and adjoining towns are T\u014dbetsu, Kimobetsu, Ky\u014dgoku.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nSapporo has ten wards (\u533a, ku). The color shows the location of each ku in the map below.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSapporo has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa), with a wide range of temperature between the summer and winter. Summers are generally warm, but not overly humid, and winters are cold and very snowy, with an average snowfall of 5.96 m (19 ft 7 in) per year. Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues. The heavy snowfall is due to the Siberian High developing over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low developing over the northern Pacific Ocean, resulting in a flow of cold air southeastward across Tsushima Current and to western Hokkaido. The city's annual average precipitation is around 1,100 mm (43.3 in), and the mean annual temperature is 8.5 \u00b0C (47.3 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe tertiary sector dominates Sapporo's industry.

In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round.

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round.

        "wiki": "The Sapporo Snow Festival (\u3055\u3063\u307d\u308d\u96ea\u307e\u3064\u308a, Sapporo Yuki-matsuri) is a festival held annually in Sapporo, Japan, over seven days in February. Odori Park, Susukino, and Tsudome are the main sites of the festival.\nIn 2007 (57th Festival), about two million people visited Sapporo to see the hundreds of snow statues and ice sculptures at the Odori Park and Susukino sites, in central Sapporo, and at the Satoland site. An International Snow Sculpture Contest has been held at the Odori Park site since 1974, and 14 teams from various regions of the world participated in 2008.The subject of the statues varies and often features an event, famous building or person from the previous year. For example, in 2004, there were statues of Hideki Matsui, the famous baseball player who at that time played for the New York Yankees. A number of stages made out of snow are also constructed and some events including musical performances are held. At the Satoland site, visitors can enjoy the long snow and ice slides as well as a huge maze made of snow. Visitors can also enjoy a variety of regional foods from all over Hokkaid\u014d at the Odori Park and Satoland sites, such as fresh seafood, potatoes and corn, and fresh dairy products.Every year the number of statues displayed is around 400 in total. In 2007, there were 307 statues created at the Odori Park site, 32 at the Satoland site and 100 at the Susukino site. A good view of the creations can be had from the TV Tower at the Odori Park site.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Snow Festival began as a one-day event in 1950, when six local high school students built six snow statues in Odori Park. In 1955 the Japan Self-Defense Forces from the nearby Makomanai base joined in and built the first massive snow sculptures, for which the Snow Festival has now become famous. Several snow festivals existed in Sapporo prior to the Sapporo Snow Festival, however, all of these were suspended during World War II.On February 4, 1966, a flight from Sapporo to Tokyo crashed into Tokyo Bay killing all 126 passengers and 7 crew on board. Many of the passengers were returning to Tokyo after visiting the snow festival. Owing to the Energy crisis of 1974, snow statues were built using drums. This was due to the shortage of gasoline caused by the crisis and many of the trucks used to carry snow to the site were unavailable. In the same year, the International Snow Statue Competition started and since that year many snow statues built by teams from other countries have featured; especially from sister cities of Sapporo such as Munich.In years when the accumulated snowfall is low, the Self-Defense Force, for whom participation is considered a training exercise, brings in snow from outside Sapporo. The Makomanai base, one of three main sites from 1965, hosted the largest sculptures, with an emphasis on providing play space for children. Use of the Makomanai site was suspended in 2005 and moved to the Sapporo Satoland site located in Higashi-ku from 2006. In 2009, the Satoland site was moved to the Tsudome (\u3064\u3069\u30fc\u3080, Tsud\u014dmu, Sapporo Community Dome) site. The Tsudome, located close to the Sapporo Satoland, is a dome for multiple sports events.Nakajima Park was established as one of the festival sites in 1990. However, it was removed as a site in 1992. The third site, known as the Susukino Ice Festival (\u3059\u3059\u304d\u306e\u6c37\u306e\u796d\u5178, Susukino K\u014dri no Saiten), is situated in the night-life district of Susukino and includes predominantly ice carvings. The site was approved as one of the festival sites in 1983. Every year, the Susukino Queen of Ice, a female beauty contest, is held at the site.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWinter festival\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website  (in English)",

        "wiki": "The Mitsubishi Lancer (A70) is the first generation version of Mitsubishi's long-running Lancer nameplate. When introduced in 1973, it filled the gap between the Minica kei car and the considerably larger Galant. It was a replacement for the Colt 1200, last sold in 1970. Although sedan production ended in 1979, vans continued on until 1985. This Lancer also formed the basis for the Lancer Celeste sports coup\u00e9 of 1975 through to 1981. These Lancers were sold under a multitude of names in different markets.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== 1973\u20131976 ===\nThe Lancer A70 was launched in February 1973 in two- and four-door sedan form. It proved to be particularly successful in rallies, a claim that it retains to this day. The Lancer served to fill a gap in Mitsubishi's lineup in the small to lower-medium segment of the growing Japanese market. Twelve models were launched, ranging from a basic 1.2-litre sedan to a more powerful 1600 GSR model, successful in rallying.\n\nThere were three body styles (four if the Celeste liftback/coup\u00e9 is included), two- and four-door sedans and a rarely seen five-door station wagon introduced in September 1973. In October 1975 the smallest engine was replaced by another 1.2-litre four, the 80 hp 4G36. In November, the entire engine lineup lost around eight\u2013nine percent of its power, as a result of the stricter emissions standards for 1976. Reflecting a popular appearance during the 1970s, the Lancer adopted \"coke bottle styling\" on the sedan and wagon for this entire generation.\nOriginally, the Lancer received an OHV 1.2-litre Neptune 4G42, an OHC 1.4-litre Saturn 4G33 or the larger 1.6-litre 4G32. Power outputs were 70 PS (51 kW), 92 PS (68 kW), and 100 PS (74 kW) respectively for what was called A71, A72 and A73 models. The 1600 GSR, introduced in September, used two Mikuni-made twin-barrel Solex carburetors for 110 PS (81 kW) at 6,700 rpm.\nThis vehicle was sold as the Colt Lancer in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other European countries. In some Latin American countries, as for example, in El Salvador, the car initially was known as the Dodge Lancer. This reluctance to use the Mitsubishi brand in many export markets stemmed from a fear of buyer resistance amongst those who could still remember fighting Japanese pilots in Mitsubishi A6M Zeros.\nIn the Australian market, the first generation models were initially sold under the Chrysler Valiant Lancer name, with approximately 11,800 units sold between late 1974 and 1979. The original LA series was released in September 1974 in two levels of specification, a basic two-door EL and the four-door GL sedan which offered a higher level of equipment. Only one engine was offered, the 1,439 cc single cam, alloy-head four-cylinder engine rated at 92 hp (68.6 kW) at 6,300 rpm. This could be paired with either an all-synchromesh four-speed manual, or a three-speed automatic.European market Lancers received the 1.2, 1.4 and 1.6-litre Saturn 80 engines, with claimed output of 55 PS (40 kW), 68 PS (50 kW), and 82 PS (60 kW) DIN (GSR). The 1.6-liter engine was reserved for the two-door version, while four-door sedans only received the 1.4. Top speeds were 150, 155, and 165 km/h.\n\n\n=== 1976\u20131979 ===\n\nIn November 1976 the Japanese market models received a facelift, losing the previous L-shaped/upright rear lamps in favor of wide rectangular units. Front indicators were enlarged and moved, and new bigger rubber bumpers were also added, and new grilles were introduced. This generation gradually became the A140-series in Japan, reflecting the introduction of new engines. Since it kept the 4G32 engine, the GSR was referred to as an A73 until the very end in spite of having received all of the bodywork modifications.\nAs a response to the new emissions standards taking effect in 1978, the 1.2-litre Saturn engine was replaced by the new 70 PS Orion G11B (1,244 cc) in April 1977. This was the new lean-burning MCA-Jet engine, which was added to the existing Saturn 4G33 and 4G32 engines in June. Power for these (now G33B/G32B) was reduced to 82 PS (60 kW) and 86 PS (63 kW).\nIt was this series that emerged in the United States as the Dodge Colt for the 1977 model year (Plymouth Colt in Canada), taking over from a badge-engineered Mitsubishi Galant from the previous year. It was offered for one more model year before the Dodge Colt name was gradually transferred to the front wheel drive Mitsubishi Mirage. The very large safety bumpers used in the American market were added to certain models in the domestic range in March 1978 (GL Extra, GSL, GSR) as part of one last minor facelift. This facelift also introduced the larger 1.4-litre Orion engine (G12B), of 80 PS (59 kW).\nApril 1977 saw the introduction of the facelift model in Australia, designated locally as the LB series. This was discontinued in May 1979, having lost most of its market share to the bigger, locally built Chrysler Sigma.\n\n\n=== 1600 GSR ===\nThe high-performance Mitsubishi Lancer 1600 GSR sold as the Colt Lancer 1600 GSR in Europe, was developed by Mitsubishi Motors to further their aspirations in off-road racing, especially the Safari Rally of Kenya. Thanks to repeated triumphs in what was the most gruelling rally in the world, it earned the nickname \"King of Cars\" in Africa.\n\nIn rally spec, the GSR produced 126 kW (171 PS; 169 hp) at 7800 rpm and 162 N\u22c5m (119 lb\u22c5ft) at 5500 rpm. Street versions originally developed 110 PS (81 kW), but this dropped to 100 PS (74 kW) when tighter emissions standards were introduced for 1976.\nAfter sporadic successes with the Colt and Galant rally cars in previous years, Mitsubishi decided to develop a Lancer model specifically to tackle the notorious Safari Rally. Run over 6,000 km of arduous terrain under searing equatorial temperatures, the race was regarded as the toughest in the world, and typically only one car in five which set off from the start would manage to reach the finish line in Nairobi. Mitsubishi sanctioned official factory teams for the 1974\u201377 events, building for itself an enviable reputation for durability when only one of thirteen cars failed to finish in those four attempts. The high point was a clean sweep of the podium places in 1976.The car had previously demonstrated similar qualities in 1973, with its debut in the Australian Southern Cross Rally being rewarded with a clean sweep of the top four places. Works driver Andrew Cowan would go on to dominate this race in the '70s, winning five consecutive titles from 1972 to '76. Cowan and Joginder Singh also scored a 1\u20132 finish for the Lancer GSR at the 1977 Rallye Bandama C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.Even after production ended it remained a popular car with privateers into the 1980s. However, the decline of endurance rallying and the rise of the Group B class eventually signaled its demise.\n\n\n== Van/Wagon ==\nAs there was no station wagon version of the Lancer EX, the first generation Lancer Van (wagon) continued in production for the home and select export markets until February 1985, by which time the car was conspicuously outmoded. When the 1.2-litre pushrod was replaced in 1975, Vans for the domestic market retained the old Neptune engine for an extra year, and the 1238/1439 cc Saturn engines weren't replaced by Orions until March 1979. The smaller Orion engined version (1.2 L A141V) continued to be available in Greece and Kenya into the eighties. Wagon versions for export received updates on the same schedule as did export sedans/coup\u00e9s. The domestic market vans received yet another update in October 1981, again to clean emissions, meaning that a new set of chassis numbers were assigned. The home market vans were available in Standard (only 1200), EL, and GL trim levels. The Lancer Van was finally replaced by the new front-wheel drive Mirage/Lancer Wagon and Van in February 1985.\n\n\t\t\n\n\n== Celeste ==\n\nIn February 1975, the Lancer was complemented by a hatchback coup\u00e9 called the Mitsubishi Lancer Celeste (A70-series). It succeeded the Galant FTO, which never did very well in the marketplace due to confusion with the Galant GTO and carrying too high a price. It was also called the Mitsubishi Celeste or Colt Celeste in some markets; and sold as the Chrysler Lancer Hatchback in Australia, the Dodge Lancer Celeste in El Salvador, the Plymouth Arrow in the United States, and the Dodge Arrow in Canada. Sitting on the same 2,340 mm wheelbase as the Lancer, length was up to 4,115 mm.The Celeste was originally available with 1.4- and 1.6-litre options, a bigger 2.0-litre model was added later. The 1979\u201380 Plymouth Fire Arrow came with an even larger (2,555 cc) four-cylinder, but strangled by American emissions regulations it only offered 105 hp (78 kW), no more than the Japanese market 2000 GT. Along with receiving a light facelift in July 1977, including new taillights and the cleaner (but lower powered) MCA-Jet engines, new model codes (A140-series) were introduced. There was another facelift in April 1978; square headlights and bigger, less integrated bumpers heralded the coming eighties. Named accordingly, a top-of-the-line GT System 80 version had appeared in November 1977, including every possible extra and special black and gold paintwork. This was trumped by the 105 PS (77 kW) 2000 GT introduced in June 1979, with a version of the 2-litre Astron engine already used in export since October 1975. Production of the Lancer Celeste ended in July 1981 and it was replaced by the front-wheel drive Cordia in early 1982.\nBecause of the Arrow's long, narrow, aerodynamic, lightweight design and rugged suspension, it was used extensively in various types of racing including SCCA road racing, rally and drag racing.  The Arrow body design was used on pro stock and funny cars in the late 1970s by noteworthy racers such as Ray Godman, Don Prudhomme, Bob Glidden  and  Raymond Beadle.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\n\nThe 1.6-liter Celeste was sold in Australia as the Chrysler Lancer Hatchback  as part of the LB series from April 1977. It featured sports instrumentation and a 55-kilowatt (74 hp) version of the 4G32. The final LC iteration arrived in May 1979 with a rationalised model range which saw the sedan body variant deleted. Changes were as for 1979 Celestes, comprising rectangular headlamps, redesigned tail-lamps, black painted metal bumpers, a new five-speed manual transmission, and a belt driven SOHC version of the 4G32 engine called the G32B. During 1981, the Chrysler was rebranded Mitsubishi Lancer in the Australian market, lasting until August the same year.Some of the Australian cars featured had \"arrow\" decals on the hood and stripes on the flanks, depending on the body colour. These were less flamboyant than on those sold in the North American market.\n\n\n=== North America ===\n\nChrysler introduced the Plymouth Arrow as a captive import of the Celeste in January 1976 as an extension to the Dodge Colt lineup. It was also known as the Dodge Arrow in Canada. It was also sold as the Dodge Celeste in Puerto Rico.\nThe Arrow was a rear-wheel drive car utilizing a solid rear axle and leaf springs in the rear, with MacPherson struts in the front. Transmission types included four and five-speed manual transmissions and a three-speed automatic. A 1.6 L inline-four engine was standard with an optional 2.0 L I4. It was produced in various trim levels including the 160, GS and GT. The first year Arrow is easily identified from later years because its quarter-window louvers have two slats in the center, which were changed to three on all later years. The 1976 Arrow also came with a single windshield-wiper fluid nozzle on the hood, which was changed to dual nozzles for 1977 and remained that way for all later year Arrows.\nSporty exterior finishes were also offered, such as the Arrow Jet package, first offered in 1978.  The Arrow Jet paint package was an eye-catching two-tone finish, typically in spit-fire orange and black.  The entire car was spit-fire orange, but the entire bottom half of the car was covered in a solid flat black stripe with the words \"Arrow Jet\" stenciled out of the stripe on the doors so that the underlying body color showed through.  This color combination of spit-fire orange and flat black seems to pay tribute to one of the design inspirations for the Plymouth Arrow, that being the Plymouth Barracuda. In 1971, the Barracuda was offered with a \"billboard\" decal option, which was a large, solid flat black decal that covered the entire back half of the car on both sides (often in a red and flat black color combination).\n\nFor 1979, the styling was freshened with the addition of flush bumpers, a more horizontal grille with rectangular headlights and hidden turn signals, chrome strips on the tail-lamps, and larger rear glass for the hatchback. Inside, the steering wheel previously found only in the Arrow GT was now standard while the heater provided more output. The rear axle was also extended 2.5 inches for better traction. A sporty variant called the Fire Arrow was first offered this year, which had special decals and a sporty interior, as well as a 2.6 L I4 engine and four-wheel disc brakes. The Fire Arrow had one of the best horsepower/weight ratios among U.S. production cars at the time because of its light weight. The 2.6 was also optional on the GS and GT models, and was only offered in conjunction with disc brakes all around. For 1979 and the succeeding year, the lineup began with the base Arrow (where the 2.0 L I4 engine was a new engine option), followed by the GS, GT, and the Fire Arrow on top.The styling changes of the 1979 models carried over to 1980. The Fire Arrow however, was changed significantly. The 1980 Fire Arrow was now available with two new paint schemes: tan with a darker caramel-colored hood, and blue with a dark blue hood. These colored models were available with the smaller 1.6 engine and, like the base-model Arrows, had bumpers that were chrome instead of body color. The white Fire Arrow was also changed, and now had a matte-black hood and cowl, with the black paint continuing along the tops of the fenders and doors and ending under the quarter-windows. Unlike the colored versions, the white/black Fire Arrow had only one engine option, the 2.6 I4.\nThe Arrow was discontinued after the 1980 model-year and was replaced by the Plymouth Sapporo/Dodge Challenger which was larger, heavier and had more amenities. The Sapporo/Challenger retained rear-wheel drive and was itself the forerunner to the Mitsubishi Starion. A pickup version of the Arrow was released in 1979 which was also available with the 2.6 L engine, but they shared few, if any parts.  The Arrow's styling influence can clearly be seen in the Plymouth Arrow Truck and its cousins; the Dodge D-50 and Mitsubishi Mighty Max pickups.\nThe Harry Nilsson song, Me and My Arrow (from The Point!) was used in television commercials in the United States promoting the Plymouth Arrow during the 1970s.\nOne of the more interesting options available for the Arrow was a small tent.  When the rear seats were lowered and the tent was clipped over the open hatchback, it would allow the back of the car to be used for camping. General Motors would borrow this design many years later for the Pontiac Aztek.\n\n\n== Specifications and timeline ==\nData tables expand.

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round.

          "Museum is set over two floors at the bottom of Okurayama Ski Jump. Good information on past Olympics with lots of memorabilia. On the lower level there are a lot of hands on activities which are great for both adults and kids. There is a shuttle bus that goes from Maruyama Koen",
          "Went here in February, when it was extremely cold and snowy. As it is the site of the Sapporo Olympics it did let you have an idea of what it would have been like for the athletes! It is cold and very very snowy up here. The museum is next to the ski jump which you can also go",
          "...and still decided to give this it this rating. Believe me, I\u2019m a huge fan of the Olympics and so looked forward to this visiting this museum. By my choice, it took a bit of effort to get there as well as I walked from the subway station. I only went into the museum as it",

          "We used a 900yen coupon for both the lift and museum that we got on the bus from the train station. We got an ice cream cone at the top which helped us cool off from the humidity. The ski-lift ride up was relaxing and enjoyable.",
          "Very hard to find. Thanks to locals I found my way. Worth it though. Get the combo lift ticket / museum. Go to the third floor outside to get tickets. Do the lift then go to the second floor and do museum. I didn't realize til after I left the restaurant specialized in lamb.",

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River. Sapporo has an elevation of 29 m (95 ft 2 in)Sapporo has many parks, including Odori Park, which is located in the heart of the city and hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year. Moerenuma Park is also one of the largest parks in Sapporo, and was constructed under the plan of Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese-American artist and landscape architect.\nNeighbouring cities are Ishikari, Ebetsu, Kitahiroshima, Eniwa, Chitose, Otaru, Date, and adjoining towns are T\u014dbetsu, Kimobetsu, Ky\u014dgoku.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nSapporo has ten wards (\u533a, ku). The color shows the location of each ku in the map below.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSapporo has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa), with a wide range of temperature between the summer and winter. Summers are generally warm, but not overly humid, and winters are cold and very snowy, with an average snowfall of 5.96 m (19 ft 7 in) per year. Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues. The heavy snowfall is due to the Siberian High developing over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low developing over the northern Pacific Ocean, resulting in a flow of cold air southeastward across Tsushima Current and to western Hokkaido. The city's annual average precipitation is around 1,100 mm (43.3 in), and the mean annual temperature is 8.5 \u00b0C (47.3 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe tertiary sector dominates Sapporo's industry.

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River. Sapporo has an elevation of 29 m (95 ft 2 in)Sapporo has many parks, including Odori Park, which is located in the heart of the city and hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year. Moerenuma Park is also one of the largest parks in Sapporo, and was constructed under the plan of Isamu Noguchi, a Japanese-American artist and landscape architect.\nNeighbouring cities are Ishikari, Ebetsu, Kitahiroshima, Eniwa, Chitose, Otaru, Date, and adjoining towns are T\u014dbetsu, Kimobetsu, Ky\u014dgoku.\n\n\n=== Wards ===\nSapporo has ten wards (\u533a, ku). The color shows the location of each ku in the map below.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSapporo has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfa), with a wide range of temperature between the summer and winter. Summers are generally warm, but not overly humid, and winters are cold and very snowy, with an average snowfall of 5.96 m (19 ft 7 in) per year. Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues. The heavy snowfall is due to the Siberian High developing over the Eurasian land mass and the Aleutian Low developing over the northern Pacific Ocean, resulting in a flow of cold air southeastward across Tsushima Current and to western Hokkaido. The city's annual average precipitation is around 1,100 mm (43.3 in), and the mean annual temperature is 8.5 \u00b0C (47.3 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe tertiary sector dominates Sapporo's industry. Major industries include information technology, retail, and tourism, as Sapporo is a destination for winter sports and events and summer activities due to its comparatively cool climate.The city is also the manufacturing centre of Hokkaido, manufacturing various goods such as food and related products, fabricated metal products, steel, machinery, beverages, and pulp and paper.Hokkaido International Airlines (Air Do) is headquartered in Ch\u016b\u014d-ku. In April 2004, Air Nippon Network was headquartered in Higashi-ku.

        "wiki": "Japan (Japanese: \u65e5\u672c, Nippon [\u0272ippo\ua71c\u0274] (listen) or Nihon [\u0272iho\ua71c\u0274] (listen)) is an island country of East Asia in the northwest Pacific Ocean. It borders the Sea of Japan to the west and extends from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and Taiwan in the south. Japan is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire and comprises an archipelago of 6,852 islands covering 377,975 square kilometers (145,937 sq mi); its five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, and Okinawa. Tokyo is the country's capital and largest city; other major cities include Osaka and Nagoya.\nJapan is the 11th most populous country in the world, as well as one of the most densely populated and urbanized. About three-fourths of the country's terrain is mountainous, concentrating its population of 126.2 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is administratively divided into 47 prefectures and traditionally divided into eight regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with more than 37.4 million residents.\nThe islands of Japan were inhabited as early as the Upper Paleolithic period, though the first mentions of the archipelago appear in Chinese chronicles from the 1st century AD. Between the 4th and 9th centuries, the kingdoms of Japan became unified under an emperor and imperial court based in Heian-ky\u014d. Starting in the 12th century, however, political power was held by a series of military dictators (sh\u014dgun), feudal lords (daimy\u014d), and a class of warrior nobility (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted a foreign policy of isolation. In 1854, a United States fleet forced Japan to open trade to the West, leading to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of imperial power in 1868. In the Meiji era, the Empire of Japan adopted a Western-style constitution and pursued industrialization and modernization. Japan invaded China in 1937; in 1941, it entered World War II as an Axis power. After suffering defeat in the Pacific War and two atomic bombings, Japan surrendered in 1945 and came under an Allied occupation, during which it adopted a post-war constitution. It has since maintained a unitary parliamentary constitutional monarchy with an elected legislature known as the National Diet.\nJapan is a great power and a member of numerous international organizations, including the United Nations (since 1956), the OECD, and the G7. Although it has renounced its right to declare war, the country maintains a modern military ranked as the world's fourth most powerful. Following World War II, Japan experienced high economic growth, becoming the second-largest economy in the world by 1990 before being surpassed by China in 2010. Despite stagnant economic growth ever since the Lost Decade, the country's economy is still the third-largest by nominal GDP and fourth-largest by purchasing power parity as of 2019. Japan is a global leader in the automotive and electronics industries and has made significant contributions to science and technology. Ranked the second highest country on the Human Development Index in Asia after Singapore, Japan also has the world's second-highest life expectancy, though it is currently experiencing a decline in population. Culturally, Japan is renowned for its art, cuisine, music, and popular culture, including its prominent animation and video game industries.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name for Japan in Japanese is written using the kanji \u65e5\u672c and pronounced Nippon or Nihon. Before it was adopted in the early 8th century, the country was known in China as Wa (\u502d) and in Japan by the endonym Yamato.  Nippon, the original Sino-Japanese reading of the characters, is favored today for official uses, including on banknotes and postage stamps. Nihon is typically used in everyday speech and reflects shifts in Japanese phonology during the Edo period. The characters \u65e5\u672c mean \"sun origin\", in reference to Japan's relatively eastern location. It is the source of the popular Western epithet \"Land of the Rising Sun\".The name Japan is based on the Chinese pronunciation and was introduced to European languages through early trade. In the 13th century, Marco Polo recorded the early Mandarin or Wu Chinese pronunciation of the characters \u65e5\u672c\u570b as Cipangu. The old Malay name for Japan, Japang or Japun, was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect and encountered by Portuguese traders in Southeast Asia, who brought the word to Europe in the early 16th century. The first version of the name in English appears in a book published in 1577, which spelled the name as Giapan in a translation of a 1565 Portuguese letter.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistoric to classical history ===\n\nA Paleolithic culture from around 30,000 BC constitutes the first known habitation of the islands of Japan. This was followed from around 14,500 BC (the start of the J\u014dmon period) by a Mesolithic to Neolithic semi-sedentary hunter-gatherer culture characterized by pit dwelling and rudimentary agriculture. Clay vessels from the period are among the oldest surviving examples of pottery. From around 1000 BC, Yayoi people began to enter the archipelago from Kyushu, intermingling with the J\u014dmon; the Yayoi period saw the introduction of practices including wet-rice farming, a new style of pottery, and metallurgy from China and Korea. According to legend, Emperor Jimmu (grandson of Amaterasu) founded a kingdom in central Japan in 660 BC, beginning a continuous imperial line.Japan first appears in written history in the Chinese Book of Han, completed in 111 AD. Buddhism was introduced to Japan from Baekje (a Korean kingdom) in 552, but the subsequent development of Japanese Buddhism was primarily influenced by China. Despite early resistance, Buddhism was promoted by the ruling class, including figures like Prince Sh\u014dtoku, and gained widespread acceptance beginning in the Asuka period (592\u2013710).After defeat in the Battle of Baekgang by the Chinese Tang dynasty, the Japanese government devised and implemented the far-reaching Taika Reforms. It nationalized all land in Japan, to be distributed equally among cultivators, and ordered the compilation of a household registry as the basis for a new system of taxation. The Jinshin War of 672, a bloody conflict between Prince \u014cama and his nephew Prince \u014ctomo, became a major catalyst for further administrative reforms. These reforms culminated with the promulgation of the Taih\u014d Code, which consolidated existing statutes and established the structure of the central and subordinate local governments. These legal reforms created the ritsury\u014d state, a system of Chinese-style centralized government that remained in place for half a millennium.The Nara period (710\u2013784) marked an emergence of a Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in Heij\u014d-ky\u014d (modern Nara). The period is characterized by the appearance of a nascent literary culture with the completion of the Kojiki (712) and Nihon Shoki (720), as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired artwork and architecture. A smallpox epidemic in 735\u2013737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population. In 784, Emperor Kanmu moved the capital from Nara to Nagaoka-ky\u014d, then to Heian-ky\u014d (modern Kyoto) in 794. This marked the beginning of the Heian period (794\u20131185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged. Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem \"Kimigayo\" were written during this time.\n\n\n=== Feudal era ===\n\nJapan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the samurai. In 1185, following the defeat of the Taira clan in the Genpei War, samurai Minamoto no Yoritomo established a military government at Kamakura. After Yoritomo's death, the H\u014dj\u014d clan came to power as regents for the sh\u014dguns. The Zen school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the Kamakura period (1185\u20131333) and became popular among the samurai class. The Kamakura shogunate repelled Mongol invasions in 1274 and 1281 but was eventually overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji in 1336, beginning the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573). However, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (daimy\u014ds) and a civil war began in 1467, opening the century-long Sengoku period (\"Warring States\").During the 16th century, Portuguese traders and Jesuit missionaries reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct commercial and cultural exchange between Japan and the West. Oda Nobunaga used European technology and firearms to conquer many other daimy\u014ds; his consolidation of power began what was known as the Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period (1573\u20131603). After Nobunaga was assassinated in 1582 by Akechi Mitsuhide, his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi unified the nation in 1590 and launched two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597.\nTokugawa Ieyasu served as regent for Hideyoshi's son Toyotomi Hideyori and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, Ieyasu defeated rival clans in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600. He was appointed sh\u014dgun by Emperor Go-Y\u014dzei in 1603 and established the Tokugawa shogunate at Edo (modern Tokyo). The shogunate enacted measures including buke shohatto, as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimy\u014ds, and in 1639 the isolationist sakoku (\"closed country\") policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the Edo period (1603\u20131868). Modern Japan's economic growth began in this period, resulting in roads and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as futures contracts, banking and insurance of the Osaka rice brokers. The study of Western sciences (rangaku) continued through contact with the Dutch enclave at Dejima in Nagasaki. The Edo period also gave rise to kokugaku (\"national studies\"), the study of Japan by the Japanese.\n\n\n=== Modern era ===\n\nIn 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry and the \"Black Ships\" of the United States Navy forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the Convention of Kanagawa. Similar treaties with Western countries in the Bakumatsu period brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the sh\u014dgun led to the Boshin War and the establishment of a centralized state nominally unified under the emperor (the Meiji Restoration). Adopting Western political, judicial, and military institutions, the Cabinet organized the Privy Council, introduced the Meiji Constitution, and assembled the Imperial Diet. During the Meiji era (1868\u20131912), the Empire of Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia and as an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence. After victories in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894\u20131895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905), Japan gained control of Taiwan, Korea and the southern half of Sakhalin. The Japanese population doubled from 35 million in 1873 to 70 million by 1935.The early 20th century saw a period of Taish\u014d democracy (1912\u20131926) overshadowed by increasing expansionism and militarization. World War I allowed Japan, which joined the side of the victorious Allies, to capture German possessions in the Pacific and in China. The 1920s saw a political shift towards statism, the passing of laws against political dissent, and a series of attempted coups. This process accelerated during the 1930s, spawning a number of Radical Nationalist groups that shared a hostility to liberal democracy and a dedication to expansion in Asia. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria; following international condemnation of the occupation, it resigned from the League of Nations two years later. In 1936, Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Nazi Germany; the 1940 Tripartite Pact made it one of the Axis Powers.\nThe Empire of Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945). In 1940, the Empire invaded French Indochina, after which the United States placed an oil embargo on Japan. On December 7\u20138, 1941, Japanese forces carried out surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, as well as on British forces in Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and declared war on the United States and the British Empire, beginning World War II in the Pacific. After Allied victories during the next four years, which culminated in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, Japan agreed to an unconditional surrender. The war cost Japan its colonies, China and the war's other combatants tens of millions of lives, and left much of Japan's industry and infrastructure destroyed. The Allies (led by the United States) repatriated millions of ethnic Japanese from colonies and military camps throughout Asia, largely eliminating the Japanese empire and its influence over its conquered territories. The Allies also convened the International Military Tribunal for the Far East to prosecute Japanese leaders for war crimes.\nIn 1947, Japan adopted a new constitution emphasizing liberal democratic practices. The Allied occupation ended with the Treaty of San Francisco in 1952, and Japan was granted membership in the United Nations in 1956. A period of record growth propelled Japan to become the second-largest economy in the world; this ended in the mid-1990s after the popping of an asset price bubble, beginning the \"Lost Decade\". In the 21st century, positive growth has signaled a gradual economic recovery. On March 11, 2011, Japan suffered one of the largest earthquakes in its recorded history, triggering the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. On May 1, 2019, after the historic abdication of Emperor Akihito, his son Naruhito became the new emperor, beginning the Reiwa era.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nJapan comprises 6,852 islands extending along the Pacific coast of Asia. It stretches over 3,000 km (1,900 mi) northeast\u2013southwest from the Sea of Okhotsk to the East China and Philippine Seas. The county's five main islands, from north to south, are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu and Okinawa. The Ryukyu Islands, which include Okinawa, are a chain to the south of Kyushu. The Nanp\u014d Islands are south and east of the main islands of Japan. Together they are often known as the Japanese archipelago. As of 2019, Japan's territory is 377,975.24 km2 (145,937.06 sq mi). Japan has the sixth longest coastline in the world (29,751 km (18,486 mi)). Because of its many far-flung outlying islands, Japan has the eighth largest Exclusive Economic Zone in the world covering 4,470,000 km2 (1,730,000 sq mi).About 73 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous and unsuitable for agricultural, industrial or residential use. As a result, the habitable zones, mainly in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities: Japan is one of the most densely populated countries. Approximately 0.5% of Japan's total area is reclaimed land (umetatechi). Late 20th and early 21st century projects include artificial islands such as Chubu Centrair International Airport in Ise Bay, Kansai International Airport in the middle of Osaka Bay, Yokohama Hakkeijima Sea Paradise and Wakayama Marina City.\n\nJapan is substantially prone to earthquakes, tsunami and volcanoes because of its location along the Pacific Ring of Fire. It has the 15th highest natural disaster risk as measured in the 2013 World Risk Index. Japan has 108 active volcanoes, which are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring from the mid-Silurian to the Pleistocene as a result of the subduction of the Philippine Sea Plate beneath the continental Amurian Plate and Okinawa Plate to the south, and subduction of the Pacific Plate under the Okhotsk Plate to the north. Japan was originally attached to the Eurasian continent; the subducting plates opened the Sea of Japan around 15 million years ago.  During the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged, including Sh\u014dwa-shinzan on Hokkaido and My\u014djin-sh\u014d off the Bayonnaise Rocks. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in tsunami, occur several times each century. The 1923 Tokyo earthquake killed over 140,000 people. More recent major quakes are the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake and the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake, which triggered a large tsunami.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Japan is predominantly temperate but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: Hokkaido, Sea of Japan, Central Highland, Seto Inland Sea, Pacific Ocean, and Ryukyu Islands. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a humid continental climate with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. Precipitation is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter. In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the foehn. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the Ch\u016bgoku and Shikoku regions shelter the Seto Inland Sea from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round. The Pacific coast features a humid subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu and Nanp\u014d Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.The average winter temperature in Japan is 5.1 \u00b0C (41.2 \u00b0F) and the average summer temperature is 25.2 \u00b0C (77.4 \u00b0F). The highest temperature ever measured in Japan, 41.1 \u00b0C (106.0 \u00b0F), was recorded on July 23, 2018. The main rainy season begins in early May in Okinawa, and the rain front gradually moves north until reaching Hokkaido in late July. In late summer and early autumn, typhoons often bring heavy rain.\n\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n\nJapan has nine forest ecoregions which reflect the climate and geography of the islands. They range from subtropical moist broadleaf forests in the Ry\u016bky\u016b and Bonin Islands, to temperate broadleaf and mixed forests in the mild climate regions of the main islands, to temperate coniferous forests in the cold, winter portions of the northern islands. Japan has over 90,000 species of wildlife, including the brown bear, the Japanese macaque, the Japanese raccoon dog, the large Japanese field mouse, and the Japanese giant salamander. A large network of national parks has been established to protect important areas of flora and fauna as well as 37 Ramsar wetland sites. Four sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for their outstanding natural value.\n\n\n=== Environment ===\n\nIn the period of rapid economic growth after World War II, environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, environmental pollution was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s. Responding to rising concern, the government introduced several environmental protection laws in 1970. The oil crisis in 1973 also encouraged the efficient use of energy because of Japan's lack of natural resources.As of 2015, more than 40 coal-fired power plants are planned or under construction in Japan, following the switching-off of Japan's nuclear fleet following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Prior to this incident, Japan's emissions had been on the decline, largely because their nuclear power plants created no emissions. Japan ranks 20th in the 2018 Environmental Performance Index, which measures a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability. As the host and signatory of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change. Current environmental issues include urban air pollution (NOx, suspended particulate matter, and toxics), waste management, water eutrophication, nature conservation, climate change, chemical management and international co-operation for conservation.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nJapan is a unitary state and constitutional monarchy in which the power of the Emperor is limited to a ceremonial role. He is defined in the Constitution as \"the symbol of the state and of the unity of the people\". Executive power is instead wielded by the Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet, whose sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people. Naruhito is the current Emperor of Japan, having succeeded his father Akihito upon his accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne on May 1, 2019.\n\nJapan's legislative organ is the National Diet, a bicameral parliament. It consists of a lower House of Representatives with 465 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and an upper House of Councillors with 245 seats, whose popularly-elected members serve six-year terms. There is universal suffrage for adults over 18 years of age, with a secret ballot for all elected offices. The Diet is currently dominated by the conservative Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which has enjoyed near-continuous electoral success since 1955. The prime minister is the head of government and is appointed by the emperor after being designated from among the members of the Diet. As the head of the Cabinet, the prime minister has the power to appoint and dismiss Ministers of State. Following the LDP victory in the 2012 general election, Shinz\u014d Abe replaced Yoshihiko Noda as the prime minister.Historically influenced by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, since the late 19th century, the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. In 1896, Japan established a civil code based on the German B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch, which remains in effect with post\u2013World War II modifications. The Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947, is the oldest unamended constitution in the world. Statutory law originates in the legislature, and the constitution requires that the emperor promulgate legislation passed by the Diet without giving him the power to oppose legislation. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts.\n\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n\nJapan is divided into 47 prefectures, each overseen by an elected governor, legislature, and administrative bureaucracy. Each prefecture is further divided into cities, towns and villages. In the following table, the prefectures are grouped by region:\n\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n\nA member state of the United Nations since 1956, Japan has served as a non-permanent Security Council member for a total of 22 years. It is one of the G4 nations seeking permanent membership in the Security Council. Japan is a member of the G7, APEC, and \"ASEAN Plus Three\", and is a participant in the East Asia Summit. Japan signed a security pact with Australia in March 2007 and with India in October 2008. It is the world's fifth largest donor of official development assistance, donating US$9.2 billion in 2014. In 2017, Japan had the fifth largest diplomatic network in the world.Japan has close economic and military relations with the United States; the US-Japan security alliance acts as the cornerstone of the nation's foreign policy. The United States is a major market for Japanese exports and the primary source of Japanese imports and is committed to defending the country, having military bases in Japan for partially that purpose.Japan's relationship with South Korea has been strained because of Japan's treatment of Koreans during Japanese colonial rule, particularly over the issue of comfort women. In December 2015, Japan agreed to settle the comfort women dispute with South Korea by issuing a formal apology and paying money to the surviving comfort women. Today, South Korea and Japan have a stronger and more economically-driven relationship. Since the 1990s, the Korean Wave has created a large fanbase in East Asia: Japan is the number one importer of Korean music (K-pop), television (K-dramas), and films. Most recently, South Korean President Moon Jae-in met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the 2017 G20 Summit to discuss the future of their relationship and specifically how to cooperate on finding solutions for North Korean aggression in the region.Japan is engaged in several territorial disputes with its neighbors. Japan contests Russia's control of the Southern Kuril Islands, which were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1945. South Korea's control of the Liancourt Rocks is acknowledged but not accepted as they are claimed by Japan. Japan has strained relations with China and Taiwan over the Senkaku Islands and the status of Okinotorishima.\n\n\n=== Military ===\n\nJapan maintains one of the largest military budgets of any country in the world. The country's military (the Japan Self-Defense Forces) is restricted by Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. Japan is the highest-ranked Asian country in the Global Peace Index.\nThe military is governed by the Ministry of Defense, and primarily consists of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, and the Japan Air Self-Defense Force. The Maritime Self-Defense Force is a regular participant in RIMPAC maritime exercises. The forces have been recently used in peacekeeping operations; the deployment of troops to Iraq marked the first overseas use of Japan's military since World War II. The Japan Business Federation has called on the government to lift the ban on arms exports so that Japan can join multinational projects such as the Joint Strike Fighter.The Government of Japan has been making changes to its security policy which include the establishment of the National Security Council, the adoption of the National Security Strategy, and the development of the National Defense Program Guidelines. In May 2014, Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe said Japan wanted to shed the passiveness it has maintained since the end of World War II and take more responsibility for regional security. Recent tensions, particularly with North Korea, have reignited the debate over the status of the JSDF and its relation to Japanese society.\n\n\n=== Domestic law enforcement ===\n\nDomestic security in Japan is provided mainly by the prefectural police departments, under the oversight of the National Police Agency and supervised by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the National Police Agency. As the central coordinating body for the Prefectural Police Departments, the National Police Agency is administered by the National Public Safety Commission. The Special Assault Team comprises national-level counter-terrorism tactical units that cooperate with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads.Additionally, there is the Japan Coast Guard which guards territorial waters. The coast guard patrols the sea surrounding Japan and uses surveillance and control countermeasures against smuggling, marine environmental crime, poaching, piracy, spy ships, unauthorized foreign fishing vessels, and illegal immigration.The Firearm and Sword Possession Control Law strictly regulates the civilian ownership of guns, swords and other weaponry. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, among the member states of the UN that report statistics, the incidence rate of violent crimes such as murder, abduction, forced sexual intercourse and robbery is very low in Japan.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nJapan is the third largest national economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity. As of 2017, Japan's public debt was estimated at more than 230 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world. The service sector accounts for three quarters of the gross domestic product.As of 2017, Japan's labor force consisted of some 65 million workers. Japan has a low unemployment rate of around three percent. Around 16 percent of the population were below the poverty line in 2013. Housing in Japan is characterized by limited land supply in urban areas.Japan's exports amounted to US$5,430 per capita in 2017. As of 2017, Japan's main export markets were the United States (19.4 percent), China (19 percent), South Korea (7.6 percent), Hong Kong (5.1 percent) and Thailand (4.2 percent). Its main exports are transportation equipment, motor vehicles, iron and steel products, semiconductors and auto parts. Japan's main import markets as of 2017 were China (24.5 percent), the United States (11 percent), Australia (5.8 percent), South Korea (4.2 percent), and Saudi Arabia (4.1 percent). Japan's main imports are machinery and equipment, fossil fuels, foodstuffs (in particular beef), chemicals, textiles and raw materials for its industries. By market share measures, domestic markets are the least open of any OECD country.Japan ranks 34th of 190 countries in the 2018 ease of doing business index and has one of the smallest tax revenues of the developed world. The Japanese variant of capitalism has many distinct features: keiretsu enterprises are influential, and lifetime employment and seniority-based career advancement are relatively common in the Japanese work environment. Japanese companies are known for management methods like \"The Toyota Way\", and shareholder activism is rare. Japan also has a large cooperative sector, with three of the ten largest cooperatives in the world, including the largest consumer cooperative and the largest agricultural cooperative in the world.Japan ranks highly for competitiveness and economic freedom. It is ranked sixth in the Global Competitiveness Report for 2015\u20132016.\n\n\n=== Agriculture and fishery ===\n\nThe Japanese agricultural sector accounts for about 1.4% of the total country's GDP. Only 12% of Japan's land is suitable for cultivation. Because of this lack of arable land, a system of terraces is used to farm in small areas. This results in one of the world's highest levels of crop yields per unit area, with an overall agricultural self-sufficiency rate of about 50% on fewer than 56,000 square kilometers (14,000,000 acres) cultivated. Japan's small agricultural sector, however, is also highly subsidized and protected, with government regulations that favor small-scale cultivation instead of large-scale agriculture. Rice, the most protected crop, is subject to tariffs of 777.7%. There has been a growing concern about farming as the current farmers are aging with a difficult time finding successors.In 1996, Japan ranked fourth in the world in tonnage of fish caught. Japan ranked seventh and captured 3,167,610 metric tons of fish in 2016, down from an annual average of 4,000,000 tons over the previous decade. In 2010, Japan's total fisheries production was 4,762,469 fish. Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch, prompting some claims that Japan's fishing is leading to depletion in fish stocks such as tuna. Japan has also sparked controversy by supporting quasi-commercial whaling.\n\n\n=== Industry ===\n\nJapan has a large industrial capacity and is home to some of the largest and most technologically advanced producers of motor vehicles, machine tools, steel and nonferrous metals, ships, chemical substances, textiles, and processed foods. Japan's industrial sector makes up approximately 27.5% of its GDP. Some major Japanese industrial companies include Canon Inc., Toshiba and Nippon Steel. The country's manufacturing output is the third highest in the world.Japan is the third largest automobile producer in the world and is home to Toyota, the world's largest automobile company.  Despite facing competition from South Korea and China, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is expected to remain strong through an increased focus on specialized, high-tech designs.\n\n\n=== Services and tourism ===\n\nJapan's service sector accounts for about three-quarters of its total economic output. Banking, insurance, real estate, retailing, transportation, and telecommunications are all major industries, with companies such as Mitsubishi UFJ, Mizuho, NTT, TEPCO, Nomura, Mitsubishi Estate, \u00c6ON, Mitsui Sumitomo, Softbank, JR East, Seven & I, KDDI and Japan Airlines listed as some of the largest in the world. Four of the five most circulated newspapers in the world are Japanese newspapers. The six major keiretsus are the Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Fuyo, Mitsui, Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Sanwa Groups.Japan attracted 19.73 million international tourists in 2015 and increased by 21.8% to attract 24.03 million international tourists in 2016. In 2008, the Japanese government set up Japan Tourism Agency and set the initial goal to increase foreign visitors to 20 million in 2020. In 2016, having met the 20 million target, the government revised up its target to 40 million by 2020 and to 60 million by 2030. For inbound tourism, Japan was ranked 16th in the world in 2015. Japan is one of the least visited countries in the OECD on a per capita basis, and it was by far the least visited country in the G7 until 2014.\n\n\n=== Science and technology ===\n\nJapan is a leading nation in scientific research, particularly in the natural sciences and engineering. The country ranks second among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index. Nearly 700,000 researchers share a US$130 billion research and development budget, which relative to gross domestic product is the third highest budget in the world. The country is a world leader in fundamental scientific research, having produced twenty-two Nobel laureates in either physics, chemistry or medicine and three Fields medalists.Japanese scientists and engineers have contributed to the advancement of agricultural sciences, electronics, industrial robotics, optics, chemicals, semiconductors, life sciences and various fields of engineering. Japan leads the world in robotics production and use, possessing more than 20% of the world's industrial robots as of 2013. Japan boasts the third highest number of scientists, technicians, and engineers per capita in the world with 83 per 10,000 employees.The Japanese consumer electronics industry, once considered the strongest in the world, is currently in a state of decline as competition arises in countries like South Korea, the United States and China. However, video gaming in Japan remains a major industry. Japan became a major exporter of video games during the golden age of arcade video games, an era that began with the release of Taito's Space Invaders in 1978 and ended around the mid-1980s. Japanese-made video game consoles have been popular since the 1980s, and Japan dominated the industry until Microsoft's Xbox consoles began challenging Sony and Nintendo in the 2000s. As of 2009, $6 billion of Japan's $20 billion gaming market is generated from arcades, which represent the largest sector of the Japanese video game market, followed by home console games and mobile games at $3.5 billion and $2 billion, respectively. Japan is now the world's largest market for mobile games; in 2014, Japan's consumer video game market grossed $9.6 billion, with $5.8 billion coming from mobile gaming.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is Japan's national space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and aviation research, and leads development of rockets and satellites. It is a participant in the International Space Station: the Japanese Experiment Module (Kib\u014d) was added to the station during Space Shuttle assembly flights in 2008. The space probe Akatsuki was launched in 2010 and achieved orbit around Venus in 2015. Japan's plans in space exploration include building a moon base by 2030. In 2007, it launched lunar explorer SELENE (Selenological and Engineering Explorer) from Tanegashima Space Center. The largest lunar mission since the Apollo program, its purpose was to gather data on the moon's origin and evolution. It entered a lunar orbit on October 4, 2007, and was deliberately crashed into the Moon on June 11, 2009.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\nJapan's road spending has been extensive. Its 1.2 million kilometers (0.75 million miles) of paved road are the main means of transportation. As of 2012, Japan has approximately 1,215,000 kilometers (755,000 miles) of roads made up of 1,022,000 kilometers (635,000 miles) of city, town and village roads, 129,000 kilometers (80,000 miles) of prefectural roads, 55,000 kilometers (34,000 miles) of general national highways and 8,050 kilometers (5,000 miles) of national expressways. A single network of high-speed, divided, limited-access toll roads connects major cities on Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu (Hokkaido has a separate network). Cars are inexpensive; car ownership fees and fuel levies are used to promote energy efficiency. However, at just 50 percent of all distance traveled, car usage is the lowest of all G8 countries.Since privatization in 1987, dozens of Japanese railway companies compete in regional and local passenger transportation markets; major companies include seven JR enterprises, Kintetsu, Seibu Railway and Keio Corporation. Some 250 high-speed Shinkansen trains connect major cities and Japanese trains are known for their safety and punctuality. A new Maglev line called the Ch\u016b\u014d Shinkansen is being constructed between Tokyo and Nagoya. It is due to be completed in 2027.There are 175 airports in Japan; the largest domestic airport, Haneda Airport in Tokyo, is Asia's second-busiest airport. The largest international gateways are Narita International Airport, Kansai International Airport and Ch\u016bbu Centrair International Airport. Nagoya Port is the country's largest and busiest port, accounting for 10 percent of Japan's trade value.\n\n\n=== Energy ===\n\nAs of 2017, 39% of energy in Japan was produced from petroleum, 25% from coal, 23% from natural gas, 3.5% from hydropower and 1.5% from nuclear power. Nuclear power was down from 11.2 percent in 2010. By May 2012 all of the country's nuclear power plants had been taken offline because of ongoing public opposition following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in March 2011, though government officials continued to try to sway public opinion in favor of returning at least some to service. The Sendai Nuclear Power Plant restarted in 2015, and since then several other nuclear power plants have been restarted. Japan lacks significant domestic reserves and so has a heavy dependence on imported energy. Japan has therefore aimed to diversify its sources and maintain high levels of energy efficiency.\n\n\n=== Water supply and sanitation ===\n\nThe government took responsibility for regulating the water and sanitation sector is shared between the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in charge of water supply for domestic use; the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in charge of water resources development as well as sanitation; the Ministry of the Environment in charge of ambient water quality and environmental preservation; and the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in charge of performance benchmarking of utilities. Access to an improved water source is universal in Japan. 97% of the population receives piped water supply from public utilities and 3% receive water from their own wells or unregulated small systems, mainly in rural areas.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nJapan has a population of 126.3 million, of which 124.8 million are Japanese nationals (2019). Honsh\u016b is the world's second most populous island and has 80% of Japan's population. In 2010, 90.7% of the total Japanese population lived in cities. The capital city Tokyo has a population of 13.8 million (2018). It is part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the biggest metropolitan area in the world with 38,140,000 people (2016).Japanese society is linguistically, ethnically and culturally homogeneous, composed of 98.1% ethnic Japanese, with small populations of foreign workers. The most dominant native ethnic group is the Yamato people; primary minority groups include the indigenous Ainu and Ryukyuan people, as well as social minority groups like the burakumin. Zainichi Koreans, Chinese, Filipinos, Brazilians mostly of Japanese descent, Peruvians mostly of Japanese descent, and Americans are among the small minority groups in Japan. In 2003, there were about 134,700 non-Latin American Western (not including more than 33,000 American military personnel and their dependents) and 345,500 Latin American expatriates, 274,700 of whom were Brazilians, the largest community of Westerners.Japan has the second longest overall life expectancy at birth of any country in the world: 83.5 years for persons born in the period 2010\u20132015. The Japanese population is rapidly aging as a result of a post\u2013World War II baby boom followed by a decrease in birth rates. In 2012, about 24.1 percent of the population was over 65, and the proportion is projected to rise to almost 40 percent by 2050. On September 15, 2018, for the first time, one in five Japanese residents was aged 70 or older. 26.18 million people are 70 or older and accounted for 20.7 percent of the population. Elderly women crossed the 20 million line at 20.12 million, substantially outnumbering the nation's 15.45 million elderly men. The changes in demographic structure have created a number of social issues, particularly a potential decline in workforce population and increase in the cost of social security benefits. A growing number of younger Japanese are not marrying or remain childless. Japan's population is expected to drop to 95 million by 2050.Immigration and birth incentives are sometimes suggested as a solution to provide younger workers to support the nation's aging population. Japan accepts an average flow of 9,500 new naturalized citizens per year. On April 1, 2019, Japan's revised immigration law was enacted, protecting the rights of foreign workers to help reduce labor shortages in certain sectors.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nJapan has full religious freedom based on its constitution. Upper estimates suggest that 84\u201396 percent of the Japanese population subscribe to Shinto as its indigenous religion (50% to 80% of which considering degrees of syncretism with Buddhism, shinbutsu-sh\u016bg\u014d). However, these estimates are based on people affiliated with a temple, rather than the number of true believers. Many Japanese people practice both Shinto and Buddhism; they can either identify with both religions or describe themselves as non-religious or spiritual, despite participating in religious ceremonies as a cultural tradition. As a result, religious statistics are often under-reported in Japan. Other studies have suggested that only 30 percent of the population identify themselves as belonging to a religion. Nevertheless, the level of participation remains high, especially during festivals and occasions such as the first shrine visit of the New Year. Taoism and Confucianism from China have also influenced Japanese beliefs and customs.Christianity was first introduced into Japan by Jesuit missions starting in 1549. Today, fewer than 1% to 2.3% are Christians, most of them living in the western part of the country.  As of 2007, there were 32,036 Christian priests and pastors in Japan. Throughout the latest century, some Western customs originally related to Christianity (including Western style weddings, Valentine's Day and Christmas) have become popular as secular customs among many Japanese.Islam in Japan is estimated to constitute about 80\u201390% of foreign-born migrants and their children, primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. Many of the ethnic Japanese Muslims are those who convert upon marrying immigrant Muslims. The Pew Research Center estimated that there were 185,000 Muslims in Japan in 2010.Other minority religions include Hinduism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith; since the mid-19th century numerous new religious movements have emerged in Japan.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nMore than 99 percent of the population speaks Japanese as their first language. Japanese writing uses kanji (Chinese characters) and two sets of kana (syllabaries based on cursive script and radical of kanji), as well as the Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals. Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well as English language courses.Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan languages (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), also part of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but in recent years local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which is a language isolate, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido.\n\n\n=== Education ===\n\nPrimary schools, secondary schools and universities were introduced in 1872 as a result of the Meiji Restoration. Since 1947, compulsory education in Japan comprises elementary and junior high school, which together last for nine years (from age 6 to age 15). Almost all children continue their education at a three-year senior high school. The two top-ranking universities in Japan are the University of Tokyo and Kyoto University. Japan's education system played a central part in the country's recovery after World War II when the Fundamental Law of Education and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the standard school system. Starting in April 2016, various schools began the academic year with elementary school and junior high school integrated into one nine-year compulsory schooling program; MEXT plans for this approach to be adopted nationwide.The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of Japanese 15-year-olds as the third best in the world. Japan is one of the top-performing OECD countries in reading literacy, math and sciences with the average student scoring 529 and has one of the world's highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 4.1 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 5.0 percent. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth.  In 2017, the country ranked third for the percentage of 25 to 64 year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 51 percent. In addition, 60.4 percent Japanese aged 25 to 34 have some form of tertiary education qualification and bachelor's degrees are held by 30.4 percent of Japanese aged 25 to 64, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.\n\n\n=== Health ===\n\nHealth care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance. Japan has a high suicide rate; suicide is the leading cause of death for people under 30. Another significant public health issue is smoking. Japan has the lowest rate of heart disease in the OECD, and the lowest level of dementia in the developed world.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nContemporary Japanese culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. Traditional Japanese arts include crafts such as ceramics, textiles, lacquerware, swords and dolls; performances of bunraku, kabuki, noh, dance, and rakugo; and other practices, the tea ceremony, ikebana, martial arts, calligraphy, origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.\n\n\n=== Art and architecture ===\n\nJapanese sculpture, largely of wood, and Japanese painting are among the oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating to at least 300 BC. The history of Japanese painting exhibits synthesis and competition between native Japanese esthetics and imported ideas. The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example ukiyo-e prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as Japonism, had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on post-Impressionism. Japanese manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.Japanese architecture is a combination between local and other influences. It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. The Shrines of Ise have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture. Largely of wood, traditional housing and many temple buildings see the use of tatami mats and sliding doors that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, modern, and post-modern architecture into construction and design. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after World War II that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenz\u014d Tange and then with movements like Metabolism.\n\n\n=== Literature and philosophy ===\n\nThe earliest works of Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b poetry anthology, all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (hiragana and katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative. An account of court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Sh\u014dnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu is often described as the world's first novel.During the Edo period, the ch\u014dnin (\"townspeople\") overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of Saikaku, for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while Bash\u014d revivified the poetic tradition of the Kokinsh\u016b with his haikai (haiku) and wrote the poetic travelogue Oku no Hosomichi. The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. Natsume S\u014dseki and Mori \u014cgai were the first \"modern\" novelists of Japan, followed by Ry\u016bnosuke Akutagawa, Jun'ichir\u014d Tanizaki, Yukio Mishima and, more recently, Haruki Murakami. Japan has two Nobel Prize-winning authors \u2013 Yasunari Kawabata (1968) and Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce (1994).Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of both foreign, particularly Chinese and Western, and uniquely Japanese elements. In its literary forms, Japanese philosophy began about fourteen centuries ago. Confucian ideals are still evident today in the Japanese concept of society and the self, and in the organization of the government and the structure of society. Buddhism has profoundly impacted Japanese psychology, metaphysics, and esthetics.\n\n\n=== Performing arts ===\n\nJapanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many instruments, such as the koto, were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The popular folk music, with the guitar-like shamisen, dates from the 16th century. Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of Japanese culture. The imperial court ensemble Gagaku has influenced the work of some modern Western composers. Notable classical composers from Japan include Toru Takemitsu and Rentar\u014d Taki. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of J-pop. Karaoke is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan.The four traditional theaters from Japan are noh, ky\u014dgen, kabuki, and bunraku. Noh and ky\u014dgen theater traditions are among the oldest continuous theater traditions in the world.\n\n\n=== Customs and holidays ===\n\nIshin-denshin (\u4ee5\u5fc3\u4f1d\u5fc3) is a Japanese idiom which denotes a form of interpersonal communication through unspoken mutual understanding. Isagiyosa (\u6f54\u3055) is a virtue of the capability of accepting death with composure. Cherry blossoms are a symbol of isagiyosa in the sense of embracing the transience of the world. Hansei (\u53cd\u7701) is a central idea in Japanese culture, meaning to acknowledge one's own mistake and to pledge improvement. Kotodama (\u8a00\u970a) refers to the Japanese belief that mystical powers dwell in words and names. There are many annual festivals in Japan, which are called in Japanese matsuri (\u796d). There are no specific festival days for all of Japan; dates vary from area to area, and even within a specific area, but festival days do tend to cluster around traditional holidays such as Setsubun or Obon.\nOfficially, Japan has 16 national, government-recognized holidays. Public holidays in Japan are regulated by the Public Holiday Law (\u56fd\u6c11\u306e\u795d\u65e5\u306b\u95a2\u3059\u308b\u6cd5\u5f8b, Kokumin no Shukujitsu ni Kansuru H\u014dritsu) of 1948. Beginning in 2000, Japan implemented the Happy Monday System, which moved a number of national holidays to Monday in order to obtain a long weekend. The national holidays in Japan are New Year's Day on January 1, Coming of Age Day on Second Monday of January, National Foundation Day on February 11, The Emperor's Birthday on February 23, Vernal Equinox Day on March 20 or 21, Sh\u014dwa Day on April 29, Constitution Memorial Day on May 3, Greenery Day on May 4, Children's Day on May 5, Marine Day on Third Monday of July, Mountain Day on August 11, Respect for the Aged Day on Third Monday of September, Autumnal Equinox on September 23 or 24, Health and Sports Day on Second Monday of October, Culture Day on November 3, and Labor Thanksgiving Day on November 23.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nJapanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on seasonality of food, quality of ingredients and presentation. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of regional specialties that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. Seafood and Japanese rice or noodles are traditional staple of Japanese cuisine, typically seasoned with a combination of dashi, soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, sugar, and salt. Dishes inspired by foreign food\u2014in particular Chinese food\u2014like ramen and gy\u014dza, as well as foods like spaghetti, curry, and hamburgers have become adopted with variants for Japanese tastes and ingredients. Japanese curry, since its introduction to Japan from British India, is so widely consumed that it can be called a national dish. Traditional Japanese sweets are known as wagashi. Ingredients such as red bean paste and mochi are used. More modern-day tastes includes green tea ice cream.Popular Japanese beverages include sake, which is a brewed rice beverage that typically contains 14\u201317% alcohol and is made by multiple fermentation of rice. Beer has been brewed in Japan since the late 17th century. Green tea is produced in Japan and prepared in various forms such as matcha, used in the Japanese tea ceremony.\n\n\n=== Media ===\n\nTelevision and newspapers take an important role in Japanese mass media, though radio and magazines also take a part. Over the 1990s, television surpassed newspapers as Japan's main information and entertainment medium. There are six nationwide television networks: NHK (public broadcasting), Nippon Television (NTV), Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS), Fuji Network System (FNS), TV Asahi (EX) and TV Tokyo Network (TXN). Television networks were mostly established based on capital investments by existing radio networks. Variety shows, serial dramas, and news constitute a large percentage of Japanese television shows. According to the 2015 NHK survey on television viewing in Japan, 79 percent of Japanese watch television daily.Japanese readers have a choice of approximately 120 daily newspapers, with an average subscription rate of 1.13 newspapers per household. The main newspapers are the Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, Nikkei Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun. According to a survey conducted by the Japanese Newspaper Association in 1999, 85.4 percent of men and 75 percent of women read a newspaper every day.Japan has one of the oldest and largest film industries in the world; movies have been produced in Japan since 1897. Ishir\u014d Honda's Godzilla became an international icon of Japan and spawned an entire subgenre of kaiju films, as well as the longest-running film franchise in history. Japan has won the Academy Award for the Best Foreign Language Film four times, more than any other Asian country. Japanese animated films and television series, known as anime, were largely influenced by Japanese manga and have been extensively popular in the West. Japan is a world-renowned powerhouse of animation.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\n\nTraditionally, sumo is considered Japan's national sport. Japanese martial arts such as judo, karate and kendo are also widely practiced and enjoyed by spectators in the country. After the Meiji Restoration, many Western sports were introduced. Baseball is currently the most popular spectator sport in the country. Japan's top professional league, now known as Nippon Professional Baseball, was established in 1936 and is widely considered to be the highest level of professional baseball in the world outside of the North American Major Leagues. Since the establishment of the Japan Professional Football League in 1992, association football has also gained a wide following. Japan was a venue of the Intercontinental Cup from 1981 to 2004 and co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. Japan has one of the most successful football teams in Asia, winning the Asian Cup four times, and the FIFA Women's World Cup in 2011. Golf is also popular in Japan.Japan has significant involvement in motorsport. Japanese automotive manufacturers have been successful in multiple different categories, with titles and victories in series such as Formula One, MotoGP, IndyCar, World Rally Championship, World Endurance Championship, World Touring Car Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the IMSA SportsCar Championship. Three Japanese drivers have achieved podium finishes in Formula One, and drivers from Japan also have victories at the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in addition to success in domestic championships. Super GT is the most popular national series in Japan, while Super Formula is the top level domestic open-wheel series. The country also hosts major races such as the Japanese Grand Prix, Japanese motorcycle Grand Prix, Suzuka 10 Hours, 6 Hours of Fuji, FIA WTCC Race of Japan and the Indy Japan 300.\nJapan hosted the Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 1964 and the Winter Olympics in Sapporo in 1972 and Nagano in 1998. Further, the country hosted the official 2006 Basketball World Championship. Tokyo will host the 2020 Summer Olympics, making Tokyo the first Asian city to host the Olympics twice. The country gained the hosting rights for the official Women's Volleyball World Championship on five occasions, more than any other nation. Japan is the most successful Asian Rugby Union country, winning the Asian Five Nations a record six times and winning the newly formed IRB Pacific Nations Cup in 2011. Japan also hosted the 2019 IRB Rugby World Cup.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nIndex of Japan-related articles\nOutline of Japan\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\n Government\n\nJapanGov \u2013 The Government of Japan (in English)\nPrime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet Official website (in English)\nThe Imperial Household Agency, official site of the Imperial House of Japan\nNational Diet Library General information\n\nJapan from UCB Libraries GovPubs\nJapan Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica entry\nJapan profile from BBC News\nJapan from the OECD\n Geographic data related to Japan at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "The Nissan Motor Company, Ltd. (\u65e5\u7523\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e, Nissan Jid\u014dsha kabushiki gaisha) trading as the Nissan Motor Corporation and usually shortened to Nissan (US: , UK:  or AU/NZ: ; Japanese pronunciation: [\u0272issa\u0274]), is a Japanese multinational automobile manufacturer headquartered in Nishi-ku, Yokohama. The company sells its cars under the Nissan, Infiniti, and Datsun brands with in-house performance tuning products labelled Nismo. The company traces its name to the Nissan zaibatsu, now called Nissan Group.\nSince 1999, Nissan has been part of the Renault\u2013Nissan\u2013Mitsubishi Alliance (Mitsubishi joining in 2016), a partnership between Nissan and Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, with Renault of France. As of 2013, Renault holds a 43.4% voting stake in Nissan, while Nissan holds a 15% non-voting stake in Renault. From October 2016 onwards, Nissan holds a 34% controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors.In 2013, Nissan was the sixth largest automaker in the world, after Toyota, General Motors, Volkswagen Group, Hyundai Motor Group, and Ford. Taken together, the Renault\u2013Nissan Alliance would be the world's fourth largest automaker. Nissan is the leading Japanese brand in China, Russia and Mexico.In 2014, Nissan was the largest car manufacturer in North America.Nissan is the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, with global sales of more than 320,000 all-electric vehicles as of April 2018. The top-selling vehicle of the car-maker's fully electric lineup is the Nissan LEAF, an all-electric car and the world's top-selling highway-capable plug-in electric car in history.\nIn January 2018, Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa announced that all Infiniti vehicles launched from 2021 will be hybrid vehicles or all-electric vehicles.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Beginnings of Datsun brand name from 1914 ===\n\nMasujiro Hashimoto founded the Kaishinsha Motor Car Works (Kaishinsha jid\u014dsha k\u014dj\u014d, A Good Company Automobile Manufacturer) on 1 July 1911 in Azabu-Hiroo district of Tokyo. In 1914, the company produced its first car, called the DAT.The new car's model name was an acronym of the company's investors' surnames:\n\nKenjiro Den (Den Kenjir\u014d)\nRokuro Aoyama (Aoyama Rokur\u014d)\nMeitaro Takeuchi (Takeuchi Meitar\u014d)It was renamed to Kaishinsha Motorcar Co., Ltd. in 1918, and again to DAT Jidosha & Co., Ltd. (DAT Motorcar Co.) in 1925. DAT Motors built trucks in addition to the DAT and Datsun passenger cars. The vast majority of its output were trucks, due to an almost non- existent consumer market for passenger cars at the time, and disaster recovery efforts as a result of the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake. Beginning in 1918, the first DAT trucks were produced for the military market. At the same time, Jitsuyo Jidosha Co., Ltd. (jitsuyo means practical use or utility) produced small trucks using parts, and materials imported from the United States.Commercial operations were placed on hold during Japan's participation in World War I, and the company contributed to the war effort.\nIn 1926 the Tokyo-based DAT Motors merged with the Osaka-based Jitsuyo Jidosha Co., Ltd (Jitsuy\u014d Jid\u014dsha Seiz\u014d Kabushiki-Gaisha) a.k.a. Jitsuyo Jidosha Seizo (established 1919 as a Kubota subsidiary) to become DAT Jidosha Seizo Co., Ltd Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (\u30c0\u30c3\u30c8\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u88fd\u9020\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e, DAT Jid\u014dsha Seiz\u014d Kabushiki-Gaisha) in Osaka until 1932. From 1923 to 1925, the company produced light cars and trucks under the name of Lila.In 1931, DAT came out with a new smaller car, called the Datsun Type 11, the first \"Datson\", meaning \"Son of DAT\". Later in 1933 after Nissan Group zaibatsu took control of DAT Motors, the last syllable of Datson was changed to \"sun\", because \"son\" also means \"loss\" in Japanese, hence the name \"Datsun\" (\u30c0\u30c3\u30c8\u30b5\u30f3, Dattosan).In 1933, the company name was Nipponized to Jidosha-Seizo Co., Ltd. (Jid\u014dsha Seiz\u014d Kabushiki-Gaisha, \"Automobile Manufacturing Share Company\") and was moved to Yokohama.\n\n\n=== Nissan name first used in 1930s ===\nIn 1928, Yoshisuke Aikawa (nickname: Gisuke/Guisuke Ayukawa) founded the holding company Nihon Sangyo (\u65e5\u672c\u7523\u696d Japan Industries or Nihon Industries). The name 'Nissan' originated during the 1930s as an abbreviation used on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for Nihon Sangyo. This company was Nissan \"Zaibatsu\" which included Tobata Casting and Hitachi. At this time Nissan controlled foundries and auto parts businesses, but Aikawa did not enter automobile manufacturing until 1933.The zaibatsu eventually grew to include 74 firms and became the fourth-largest in Japan during World War II.In 1931, DAT Jidosha Seizo became affiliated with Tobata Casting and was merged into Tobata Casting in 1933. As Tobata Casting was a Nissan company, this was the beginning of Nissan's automobile manufacturing.\n\n\n=== Nissan Motor organized in 1934 ===\nIn 1934, Aikawa separated the expanded automobile parts division of Tobata Casting and incorporated it as a new subsidiary, which he named Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. (\u65e5\u7523\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca, Nissan Jid\u014dsha). The shareholders of the new company however were not enthusiastic about the prospects of the automobile in Japan, so Aikawa bought out all the Tobata Casting shareholders (using capital from Nihon Industries) in June 1934. At this time, Nissan Motor effectively became owned by Nihon Sangyo and Hitachi.In 1935, construction of its Yokohama plant was completed. 44 Datsuns were shipped to Asia, Central and South America. In 1935, the first car manufactured by an integrated assembly system rolled off the line at the Yokohama plant. Nissan built trucks, airplanes, and engines for the Imperial Japanese Army. In November 1937 Nissan's headquarter was moved to Hsinking, the capital of Manchukuo. In December the company changed name to Manchuria Heavy Industries Developing Co (MHID).In 1940, first knockdown kits were shipped to Dowa Jidosha Kogyo (Dowa Automobile), one of MHID's companies, for assembly. In 1944, the head office was moved to Nihonbashi, Tokyo, and the company name was changed to Nissan Heavy Industries, Ltd., which the company kept through 1949.\n\n\n=== Nissan's early American connection ===\n\nDAT had inherited Kubota's chief designer, American engineer William R. Gorham. This, along with Aikawa's 1908 visit to Detroit, was to greatly affect Nissan's future. Although it had always been Aikawa's intention to use cutting-edge auto making technology from America, it was Gorham that carried out the plan. Most of the machinery and processes originally came from the United States. When Nissan started to assemble larger vehicles under the \"Nissan\" brand in 1937, much of the design plans and plant facilities were supplied by the Graham-Paige Company. Nissan also had a Graham license under which passenger cars, buses, and trucks were made.In David Halberstam's 1986 book The Reckoning, Halberstam states \"In terms of technology, Gorham was the founder of the Nissan Motor Company\" and that \"young Nissan engineers who had never met him spoke of him as a god and could describe in detail his years at the company and his many inventions.\"\n\n\n=== Austin Motor Company relations (1937\u20131960s) ===\n\nFrom 1934 Datsun began to build Austin 7s under license. This operation became the greatest success of Austin's overseas licensing of its Seven and marked the beginning of Datsun's international success.In 1952, Nissan entered into a legal agreement with Austin, for Nissan to assemble 2,000 Austins from imported partially assembled sets and sell them in Japan under the Austin trademark. The agreement called for Nissan to make all Austin parts locally within three years, a goal Nissan met. Nissan produced and marketed Austins for seven years. The agreement also gave Nissan the rights to use Austin patents, which Nissan used in developing its own engines for its Datsun line of cars. In 1953, British-built Austins were assembled and sold, but by 1955, the Austin A50 \u2013 completely built by Nissan and featuring a new 1489 cc engine\u2014was on the market in Japan. Nissan produced 20,855 Austins from 1953 to 1959.Nissan leveraged the Austin patents to further develop their own modern engine designs past what the Austin's A- and B-family designs offered. The apex of the Austin-derived engines was the new design A series engine in 1966. In 1967, Nissan introduced its new highly advanced four-cylinder overhead cam (OHC) Nissan L engine, which while similar to Mercedes-Benz OHC designs was a totally new engine designed by Nissan. This engine powered the new Datsun 510, which gained Nissan respect in the worldwide sedan market. Then, in 1969 Nissan introduced the Datsun 240Z sports car which used a six-cylinder variation of the L series engine, developed under Nissan Machinery (Nissan Koki Co., Ltd. \u65e5\u7523\u5de5\u6a5f) in 1964, a former remnant of another auto manufacturer Kurogane. The 240Z was an immediate sensation and lifted Nissan to world-class status in the automobile market.\n\n\n=== 100 Day Strike of 1953 ===\n\nDuring the Korean War, Nissan was a major vehicle producer for the U.S. Army. After the Korean War ended, significant levels of anti-communist sentiment existed in Japan. The union that organized Nissan's workforce was strong and militant. Nissan was in financial difficulties, and when wage negotiations came, the company took a hard line. Workers were locked out, and several hundred were fired. The Japanese government and the U.S. occupation forces arrested several union leaders. The union ran out of strike funds and was defeated. A new labor union was formed, with Shioji Ichiro one of its leaders. Ichiro had studied at Harvard University on a U.S. government scholarship. He advanced an  idea to trade wage cuts against saving 2,000 jobs. Ichiro's idea was made part of a new union contract  that prioritized productivity. Between 1955 and 1973, Nissan \"expanded rapidly on the basis of technical advances supported \u2013 and often suggested \u2013 by the union.\" Ichiro became president of the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers Unions and \"the most influential figure in the right wing of the Japanese labor movement.\"\n\n\n=== Merger with Prince Motor Company ===\n\nIn 1966, Nissan merged with the Prince Motor Company, bringing more upmarket cars, including the Skyline and Gloria, into its selection. The Prince name was eventually abandoned, and successive Skylines and Glorias bore the Nissan name. \"Prince,\" was used at the Japanese Nissan dealership \"Nissan Prince Shop\" until 1999, when \"Nissan Red Stage\" replaced it. Nissan Red Stage itself has been replaced as of 2007. The Skyline lives on as the G Series of Infiniti.\n\n\n=== Miss Fairlady ===\nTo capitalize on the renewed investment during 1964 Summer Olympics, Nissan established the gallery on the second and third floors of the San-ai building, located in Ginza, Tokyo. To attract visitors, Nissan started using beautiful female showroom attendants where Nissan held a competition to choose five candidates as the first class of Nissan Miss Fairladys, modeled after \"Datsun Demonstrators\" from the 1930s who introduced cars. The Fairlady name was used as a link to the popular Broadway play My Fair Lady of the era. Miss Fairladys became the marketers of the Datsun Fairlady 1500.In April 2008, 14 more Miss Fairlady candidates were added, for a total of 45 Nissan Miss Fairlady pageants (22 in Ginza, 8 in Sapporo, 7 in Nagoya, 7 in Fukuoka).In April 2012, 7 more Miss Fairlady candidates were added, for a total of 48 Nissan Miss Fairlady pageants (26 in Ginza, 8 in Sapporo, 7 in Nagoya, 7 in Fukuoka).In April 2013, 6 more Miss Fairlady candidates were added to Ginza showroom, for a total of 27 48th Ginza Nissan Miss Fairlady pageants.\n\n\n=== Foreign expansion ===\n\nIn the 1950s, Nissan decided to expand into worldwide markets. Nissan management realized their Datsun small car line would fill an unmet need in markets such as Australia and the world's largest car market, the United States. They first showed the Datsun Bluebird at the 1958 Los Angeles Auto Show. The company formed a U.S. subsidiary, Nissan Motor Corporation U.S.A., in Gardena, California in 1960, headed by Yutaka Katayama. Nissan continued to improve their sedans with the latest technological advancements and chic Italianate styling in sporty cars such as the Datsun Fairlady roadsters, the race-winning 411 series, the Datsun 510 and the Datsun 240Z. By 1970, Nissan had become one of the world's largest exporters of automobiles.\n\nIn the wake of the 1973 oil crisis, consumers worldwide (especially in the lucrative U.S. market) began turning to high-quality small economy cars. To meet the growing demand for its new Nissan Sunny, the company built new factories in Mexico (Nissan Mexicana was established in the early 1960s and commenced manufacturing since 1966 at their Cuernavaca assembly facility, making it their first North American assembly plant), Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, United States (Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corporation USA was established in 1980) and South Africa. The \"Chicken Tax\" of 1964 placed a 25% tax on commercial vans imported to the United States. In response, Nissan, Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. began building plants in the U.S. in the early 1980s. Nissan's initial assembly plant Smyrna assembly plant (which broke ground in 1980) at first built only trucks such as the 720 and Hardbody, but has since expanded to produce several car and SUV lines, including the Altima, Maxima, Rogue, Pathfinder, Infiniti QX60 and LEAF all-electric car. The addition of mass-market automobiles was in response to the 1981 Voluntary Export Restraints imposed by the U.S. Government. An engine plant in Decherd, Tennessee followed, most recently a second assembly plant was established in Canton, Mississippi. In 1970, Teocar was created, which was a Greek assembly plant created in cooperation with Theoharakis. It was situated in Volos, Greece and its geographical location was perfect as the city had a major port. The plant started production in 1980, assembling Datsun pick-up trucks and continuing with the Nissan Cherry and Sunny automobiles. Until May 1995 170,000 vehicles were made, mainly for Greece.\nBy the early 1980s, Nissan (Datsun) had long been the best selling Japanese brand in Europe. In order to overcome export tariffs and delivery costs to its European customers, Nissan contemplated establishing a plant in Europe. Nissan tried to convert the Greek plant into one manufacturing cars for all European countries. However, due to issues with the Greek government not only did that not happen but the plant itself was closed. A joint venture with Italy's then state-owned Alfa Romeo was also entered in 1980, leading to Italian production of the Nissan Cherry and an Alfa-badged version, the Alfa Romeo Arna. After an extensive review, Nissan decided to go it alone instead. The City of Sunderland in the north east of England was chosen for its skilled workforce and its location near major ports. The plant was completed in 1986 as the subsidiary Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK) Ltd. By 2007, it was producing 400,000 vehicles per year, landing it the title of the most productive plant in Europe.\n\nIn 2001, Nissan established a manufacturing plant in Brazil. In 2005, Nissan added operations in India, through its subsidiary Nissan Motor India Pvt. Ltd. With its global alliance partner, Renault, Nissan invested $990 million to set up a manufacturing facility in Chennai, catering to the Indian market as well as a base for exports of small cars to Europe.\nNissan entered the Middle East market in 1957 when it sold its first car in Saudi Arabia. Nissan sold nearly 520,000 new vehicles in China in 2009 in a joint venture with Dongfeng Motor. To meet increased production targets, Dongfeng-Nissan expanded its production base in Guangzhou, which would become Nissan's largest factory around the globe in terms of production capacity. Nissan also has moved and expanded its Nissan Americas Inc. headquarters, moving from Los Angeles to Franklin, Tennessee in the Nashville area.\n\n\n=== Corporate unrest ===\nIn June 2001, Carlos Ghosn was named chief executive officer of Nissan. In May 2005, Ghosn was named president of Nissan's partner company Renault. He was appointed president and CEO of Renault on 6 May 2009. Nissan's management is a trans-cultural, diverse team. In February 2017, Ghosn announced he would step down as CEO of Nissan on 1 April 2017, while remaining chairman of the company. He was replaced as CEO by his then-deputy Hiroto Saikawa. On 19 November 2018, Ghosn was fired as chairman following his arrest for the alleged underreporting of his income to Japanese financial authorities. After 108 days in detention, Ghosn was released on bail, but after 29 days he was again detained on new charges (4 April 2019). He had been due to hold a news conference, but instead, his lawyers released a video of Ghosn alleging this 2018-2019 Nissan scandal is itself evidence of value destruction and Nissan corporate mismanagement. In September 2019, Saikawa resigned as CEO, following allegations of improper payments received by him. Yasuhiro Yamauchi was appointed as acting CEO. In October 2019, the company announced it had appointed Makoto Uchida as its next CEO. The appointment would be made \"effective\" by 1 January 2020 at the latest. On 1 December 2019, Uchida became CEO.In the U.S., Nissan has been increasing its reliance on sales to daily-rental companies like Enterprise Rent-A-Car or Hertz. In 2016, Nissan's rental sales jumped 37% and in 2017 Nissan became the only major automaker to boost rental sales when the Detroit Three cut back less profitable deliveries to daily-rental companies, which traditionally are the biggest customers of domestic automakers.In late July 2019, Nissan announced it would lay off 12,500 employees over the next 3 years, citing a 95% year on year net income fall. Hiroto Saikawa, CEO at the time, confirmed the majority of those cuts would be plant workers.\n\n\n=== New technologies ===\nNissan's first final assembly robots were installed in the Murayama plant (where the then-new March/Micra was assembled) in 1982. In 1984 the Zama plant began to be robotized; this automation process then continued throughout Nissan's factories.Nissan electric vehicles have been produced intermittently since 1946. In 2010 the Nissan Leaf plug-in battery electric vehicle was introduced; it was the world's most sold plug-in electric car for nearly a decade. It was preceded by the Altra and the Hypermini. Until surpassed by Tesla, Nissan was the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, with global sales of more than 320,000 all-electric vehicles as of April 2018.\n\n\n=== Relationships with other car companies ===\n\nLuxgenLuxgen and Nissan partner to assemble vehicles in the Philippines with its affiliate Nissan Motor Philippines Inc. (NMPI).\nFord Motor CompanyIn Australia, between 1989 and 1992, Nissan Australia shared models with Ford Australia under a government-backed rationalisation scheme known as the Button Plan, with a version of the Nissan Pintara being sold as the Ford Corsair and a version of the Ford Falcon as the Nissan Ute. A variant of the Nissan Patrol was sold as the Ford Maverick during the 1988\u201394 model years.\nIn North America, Nissan partnered with Ford from 1993 to 2002 to market the Ohio built Mercury Villager and the Nissan Quest. The two minivans were virtually identical aside from cosmetic differences. In 2002, Nissan and Ford announced the discontinuation of the arrangement.In Europe, Nissan and Ford Europe partnered to produce the Nissan Terrano II and the badge-engineered Ford Maverick, a mid-size SUV produced at the Nissan Motor Ib\u00e9rica S.A (NMISA) plant in Barcelona, Spain. The Maverick/Terrano II was a popular vehicle sold throughout Europe and Australasia. It was also sold in Japan as a captive import, with the Nissan model marketed as the Nissan Mistral.\n\nVolkswagenNissan licensed the Volkswagen Santana. Production began in 1984, at Nissan's Zama, Kanagawa, and ended in May 1990.\nAlfa RomeoFrom 1983 to 1987, Nissan cooperated with Alfa Romeo to build the Arna. The goal was for Alfa to compete in the family hatchback market segment, and for Nissan to establish a foothold in the European market. After Alfa Romeo's takeover by Fiat, both the car and cooperation were discontinued.\n\nGeneral MotorsIn Europe, GM and Nissan co-operated on the Light Commercial vehicle the Nissan Primastar. The high roof version is built in the NMISA plant in Barcelona, Spain; while the low roof version is built at Vauxhall Motors/Opel's Luton plant in Bedfordshire, UK\nIn 2013, GM announced its intentions to rebadge the Nissan NV200 commercial van as the 2015 model year Chevrolet City Express, to be introduced by end of 2014. Holden, GM's Australian subsidiary, sold versions of the Nissan Pulsar as the Holden Astra between 1984 and 1989.\nLDVLDV Group sold a badge engineered light commercial vehicle version of the Nissan Serena as the LDV Cub from 1996 to 2001. The Nissan equivalent was marketed as the Nissan Vannette Cargo.\n\n\n=== Alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi ===\n\nIn 1999, facing severe financial difficulties, Nissan entered an alliance with Renault S.A. of France.Signed on 27 March 1999, the Renault-Nissan Alliance was the first of its kind involving a Japanese and French car manufacturer, each with its own distinct corporate culture and brand identity. In the spring of 2000, Yanase, Japan's premier seller of imported automobiles, cancelled its licensing contract with Renault, and Nissan took over as the sole licensee.\nThe Renault-Nissan Alliance has evolved over the years to Renault holding 43.4% of Nissan shares, while Nissan holds 15% of Renault shares. The alliance itself is incorporated as the Renault-Nissan B.V., founded on 28 March 2002 under Dutch law. Renault-Nissan B.V. is equally owned by Renault and Nissan.Under CEO Ghosn's \"Nissan Revival Plan\" (NRP), the company has rebounded in what many leading economists consider to be one of the most spectacular corporate turnarounds in history, catapulting Nissan to record profits and a dramatic revitalization of both its Nissan and Infiniti model line-ups. Ghosn has been recognized in Japan for the company's turnaround in the midst of an ailing Japanese economy. Ghosn and the Nissan turnaround were featured in Japanese manga and popular culture. His achievements in revitalizing Nissan were noted by the Japanese Government, which awarded him the Japan Medal with Blue Ribbon in 2004.On 7 April 2010, Daimler AG exchanged a 3.9% share of its holdings for 3.9% from both Nissan and Renault. This triple alliance allows for the increased sharing of technology and development costs, encouraging global cooperation and mutual development.On 12 December 2012, the Renault\u2013Nissan Alliance formed a joint venture with Russian Technologies (Alliance Rostec Auto BV) with the aim of becoming the long-term controlling shareholder of AvtoVAZ, Russia's largest car company and owner of the country's biggest selling brand, Lada. The takeover was completed in June 2014, and the two companies of the Renault-Nissan Alliance took a combined 67.1% stake of Alliance Rostec, which in turn acquired a 74.5% of AvtoVAZ, thereby giving Renault and Nissan indirect control over the Russian manufacturer.  Ghosn was appointed chairman of the board of AvtoVAZ on 27 June 2013.\nTaken together, the Renault\u2013Nissan Alliance sells one in ten cars worldwide, and would be the world's fourth largest automaker with 2013 sales of 8,266,098 units.\n\n\n=== Other alliances and joint ventures ===\nIn 2003, Nissan and Dongfeng Motor Group formed a 50:50 joint venture with the name Dongfeng Motor Co., Ltd. (DFL). The company calls itself \"China's first automotive joint venture enterprise with a complete series of trucks, buses, light commercial vehicles and passenger vehicles,\" and \"the largest joint-venture project of its scale.\"\nOn 7 April 2010, Daimler AG exchanged a 3.1% share of its holdings for 3.1% from both Nissan and Renault. This triple alliance allows for the increased sharing of technology and development costs, encouraging global cooperation and mutual development.\nOn 12 December 2012, the Renault\u2013Nissan Alliance formed a joint venture with Russian Technologies (Alliance Rostec Auto BV) with the aim of becoming the long-term controlling shareholder of AvtoVAZ, Russia's largest car company and owner of the country's biggest selling brand, Lada. Carlos Ghosn was appointed chairman of the board of AvtoVAZ on 27 June 2013. Nissan exited the AvtoVAZ venture in September 2017.\nNissan is in an alliance with Ashok Leyland in India, producing light commercial vehicles.\nTogether with Mitsubishi Motors, Nissan develops mini cars which are produced at Mitsubishi's Mizushima plant in Kurashiki, Okayama, Japan. In May 2016 Nissan bought a controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors for an estimated US$2.3 billion.\n\n\n== Leadership ==\nPresidents and chief executive officers of Nissan:\n\n1933\u20131939: Yoshisuke Aikawa\n1939\u20131942: Masasuke Murakami\n1942\u20131944: Genshichi Asahara\n1944\u20131945: Haruto Kudo\n1945\u20131945: Takeshi Murayama\n1945\u20131947: Souji Yamamoto\n1947\u20131951: Taichi Minoura\n1951\u20131957: Genshichi Asahara\n1957\u20131973: Katsuji Kawamata\n1973\u20131977: Tadahiro Iwakoshi\n1977\u20131985: Takashi Ishihara\n1985\u20131992: Yutaka Kume\n1992\u20131996: Yoshifume Tsuji\n1996\u20132001: Yoshikazu Hanawa\n2001\u20132017: Carlos Ghosn - CEO until 1 April 2017.

In 1984 the Datsun brand was phased out and the Nissan brand was phased in. All cars in 1984 had both the Datsun and Nissan branding on them and in 1985 the Datsun name was completely dropped. In July 2013, Nissan announced the relaunch of Datsun as a brand targeted at emerging markets.Infiniti: Since 1989, Nissan has sold its luxury models under the Infiniti brand. In 2012, Infiniti changed its headquarters to Hong Kong, where it is incorporated as Infiniti Global Limited. Its president is former BMW executive Roland Krueger. From 2014, Infiniti cars are sold in Japan.Nismo: Nissan's in-house tuning shop is Nismo, short for \"Nissan Motorsport International Limited.\" Nismo is being re-positioned as Nissan's performance brand.\n\n\n=== Corporate identity ===\n\nFor many years, Nissan used a red wordmark for the company, and car \"badges\" for the \"Nissan\" and \"Infiniti\" brands.At Nissan's 2013 earnings press conference in Yokohama, Nissan unveiled \"a new steel-blue logo that spells out\u2014literally\u2014the distinction between Nissan the company and Nissan the brand.\" Using a blue-gray color scheme, the new corporate logo did read NISSAN MOTOR COMPANY. Underneath were the \"badge\" logos for the Nissan, Infiniti and Datsun brands.\nLater in 2013, the Nissan \"Company\" logo changed to the Nissan \"Corporation\" logo. The latter was the logo used by Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. up to early 2020.\nIn July 2020, Nissan introduced new corporate and brand logos, as part of an image revamp tied to the Ariya launch.\n\n\n== Products ==\n\n\n=== Automotive products ===\n\nNissan has produced an extensive range of mainstream cars and trucks, initially for domestic consumption but exported around the world since the 1950s.\nIt also produced several memorable sports cars, including the Datsun Fairlady 1500, 1600 and 2000 Roadsters, the Z-car, an affordable sports car originally introduced in 1969; and the GT-R, a powerful all-wheel-drive sports coupe.\n\nIn 1985, Nissan created a tuning division, Nismo, for competition and performance development of such cars. One of Nismo's latest models is the 370Z Nismo.\nNissan also sells a range of kei cars, mainly as a joint venture with other Japanese manufacturers like Suzuki or Mitsubishi. Until 2013, Nissan rebadged kei cars built by other manufacturers. Beginning in 2013, Nissan and Mitsubishi shared the development of the Nissan DAYZ / Mitsubishi eK Wagon series. Nissan also has shared model development of Japanese domestic cars with other manufacturers, particularly Mazda, Subaru, Suzuki and Isuzu.\nIn China, Nissan produces cars in association with the Dongfeng Motor Group including the 2006 Nissan Livina Geniss, the first in a range of a new worldwide family of a medium-sized car.\nIn 2010, Nissan created another tuning division, IPL, this time for their premium/luxury brand Infiniti.\nIn 2011, after Nissan released the Nissan NV-Series in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, Nissan created a commercial sub-brand called Nissan Commercial Vehicles which focuses on commercial vans, pickup trucks, and fleet vehicles for the US, Canadian, and Mexican Markets.In 2013, Nissan launched the Qashqai SUV in South Africa, along with their new motorsport Qashqai Car Games. It is the same year when the Datsun brand was relaunched by Nissan after a 27-year hiatus.Nissan launched their Nissan Intelligent Mobility vision in 2016 by revealing the IDS Concept at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show. Most Nissan vehicles like the Dayz, Rogue and Leaf are equipped with Nissan Intelligent Mobility technology.\nIn 2018, Nissan launched the sixth-generation Altima at the 2018 New York Auto Show.\n\nIn May 2020, Nissan announced that the company would cut production capacity by 20% due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The company announced it would shut down factories in Indonesia and Spain, and would exit the South Korean car market. Nissan announced that the Infiniti brand will be pulled out as well alongside the Nissan brand by December due to worsening business environment amidst the pandemic.\n\n\n==== Japan ====\n\nAs of 2007 in Japan, Nissan sells its products with internationally recognized \"Nissan\" signage, using a chrome circle with \"Nissan\" across the front.\nPreviously, Nissan used two dealership names called \"Nissan Blue Stage\" (ja:\u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8, Nissan Bur\u016b Sut\u0113ji), \"Nissan Red Stage\" (ja:\u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8, Nissan Reddo Sut\u0113ji), and \"Nissan Red and Blue Stage\" (ja:\u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30ec\u30c3\u30c9&\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30b8, Nissan Reddo & Bur\u016b Sut\u0113ji), established in 1999 after the merger with Renault.\nNissan Red Stage was the result of combining an older sales channel of dealerships under the names \"Nissan Prince Store\" (ja:\u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30b9\u5e97, Nissan Purinsu-ten), established in 1966 after the merger of Prince Motors by Nissan, which sold the Nissan Skyline, and \"Nissan Satio Store\" (\u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30b5\u30c6\u30a3\u30aa\u5e97, Nissan Satio-ten), which sold cars developed from the Nissan Sunny at its introduction in 1966. The word \"satio\" is Latin, which means ample or sufficient. \"Nissan Cherry Store\" (\u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30c1\u30a7\u30ea\u30fc\u5e97, Nissan Cher\u012b-ten) was briefly known previously as \"Nissan Cony Store\" when they assumed operations of a small kei manufacturer called Aichi Machine Industry Co., Ltd. (\u611b\u77e5\u6a5f\u68b0\u5de5\u696d) who manufactured the \"Cony\", \"Guppy\" and \"Giant\" brand of kei cars and trucks until 1970, when the network was renamed for the Nissan Cherry.Nissan Blue Stage was the result of combining older sales channels, called \"Nissan Store\" (ja:\u65e5\u7523\u5e97, Nissan Mise) in 1955, then renamed \"Nissan Bluebird Store\" in 1966, selling Nissan's original post-war products called the Datsun Bluebird, Datsun Sports, Datsun Truck, Datsun Cablight, Datsun Cabstar, Nissan Junior, and Nissan Cedric. \"Nissan Motor Store\" (\u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30e2\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u5e97, Nissan M\u014dt\u0101-ten) was established in 1965 and offered luxury sedans like the Nissan Laurel and the Nissan President. In 1970, Nissan also set up a separate sales chain which sold used cars including auctions, called Nissan U-Cars (ja:\u65e5\u7523\u30e6\u30fc\u30ba\u30c9\u30ab\u30fc\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc, Nissan Y\u016bzudo K\u0101 Sent\u0101), which they still maintain.\nIn the early days of Nissan's dealership network, Japanese consumers were directed towards specific Nissan stores for cars that were of a specific size and pricepoint. Over time as sales progressed and the Japanese automotive industry became more prolific, vehicles that were dedicated to particular stores were badge engineered, given different names, and shared within the existing networks thereby selling the same platforms at different locations. The networks allowed Nissan to better compete with the network established earlier by Toyota at Japanese locations.\nStarting in 1960, another sales distribution channel was established that sold diesel products for commercial use, called Nissan Diesel until the diesel division was sold in 2007 to Volvo AB. To encourage retail sales, Nissan passenger vehicles that were installed with diesel engines, like the Cedric, were available at Nissan Diesel locations.\nAll cars sold at Nissan Blue Stage (1999\u20132005):\n\nFairlady Z, Serena, Cedric, Liberty, Cefiro, Laurel, President, Bluebird, Presage, Presea, Terrano, Leopard, Avenir, Nissan Truck, Safari, Hypermini, Caravan, MuranoAll cars sold at Nissan Store (later Nissan Bluebird Store, Nissan Exhibition), Nissan Motor Store, (1955\u20131999):\n\nLiberta Villa, Bluebird, C80, Caball, Datsun Junior, Datsun Truck, Cabstar, Caravan, Civilian, Patrol, Datsun Sports, Leopard, Maxima, Fairlady Z, Gazelle, Terrano, Avenir, Cefiro, Laurel, Laurel Spirit, Prairie, Cedric, PresidentAll cars sold at Nissan Red Stage (1999\u20132005):\n\nX-Trail.

Vehicles in this category are:\n\nSkyline, Fuga, Cima, Fairlady Z, Murano, and the Elgrand.\n\n\n=== Trucks ===\n\nNissan Cabstar (\u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30ad\u30e3\u30d6\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc Nissan Kyabusut\u0101) is the name used in Japan for two lines of pickup trucks and light commercial vehicles sold by Nissan and built by UD Nissan Diesel, a Volvo AB company and by Renault-Nissan Alliance for the European market. The name originated with the 1968 Datsun Cabstar, but this was gradually changed over to \"Nissan\" badging in the early 1980s. The lighter range (1-1.5 tons) replaced the earlier Cabstar and Homer, while the heavier Caball and Clipper were replaced by the 2\u20134 ton range Atlas (\u65e5\u7523\u30fb\u30a2\u30c8\u30e9\u30b9 Nissan Atorasu). The nameplate was first introduced in December 1981.The Cabstar is known also as the Nissan Cabstar, Renault Maxity and Samsung SV110 depending on the location. The range has been sold across the world. It shares its platform with the Nissan Caravan.\n\nThe Nissan Titan was introduced in 2004, as a full-size pickup truck produced for the North American market, the truck shares the stretched Nissan F-Alpha platform with the Nissan Armada and Infiniti QX56 SUVs. It was listed by Edmunds.com as the best full-size truck. The second generation Titan was revealed at the 2016 North American International Auto Show as a 2017 model year vehicle.\n\n\n==== Japan ====\nThe first Cabstar (A320) appeared in March 1968, as a replacement for the earlier Datsun Cablight. It is a cab-over engine truck and was available either as a truck, light van (glazed van), or as a \"route van\" (bus). It uses the 1189 cc Nissan D12 engine with 56 PS (41 kW). After some modifications and the new 1.3 liter J13 engine, with 67 PS (49 kW), in August 1970 the code became A321. The Cabstar underwent another facelift with an entirely new front clip in May 1973. The 1483 cc J15 engine became standard fitment at this time (PA321), with 77 PS (57 kW) at 5200 rpm. The Cabstar was placed just beneath the slightly bigger Homer range in Nissan's commercial vehicle lineup. It received a full makeover in January 1976, although the van models were not replaced.\n\n\n==== Second generation ====\nThe F20 Nissan Homer, introduced in January 1976, was also sold as the Nissan Datsun Cabstar in Japan. Both ranges were sold with either a 1.5 (J15) or a 2.0 liter (H20) petrol inline-four or with the 2.2 liter SD22 diesel engine. The F20 received a desmogged engine range in September 1979 and with it a new chassis code, F21. Manufacturing of the heavier range (H40-series) Atlas began in December 1981, while the lighter series Atlas (F22) was introduced in February 1982 \u2013 this succeeded both the Homer and Cabstar ranges and the nameplate has not been used in the Japanese market since.\n\n\n==== Europe ====\nThe Atlas F22 was sold in Europe as the Nissan Cabstar and proved a popular truck in the UK market due to its reliability and ability to carry weight. From 1990 the range widened and was sold as the Cabstar E. Actually (2015) the Cabstar is manufactured in the NSIO (Nissan Spanish Industrial Operations) Plant in \u00c1vila, Spain under the brand name of NT400.\n\n\n=== Electric vehicles ===\n\nNissan introduced its first battery electric vehicle, the Nissan Altra at the Los Angeles International Auto Show on 29 December 1997. Unveiled in 2009, the EV-11 prototype electric car was based on the Nissan Tiida (Versa in North America), with the conventional gasoline engine replaced with an all-electric drivetrain.In 2010, Nissan introduced the Nissan LEAF as the first mass-market, all-electric vehicle launched globally. As of March 2014, the Nissan Leaf was the world's best selling highway-capable all-electric car ever. Global sales totaled 100,000 Leafs by mid January 2014, representing a 45% market share of worldwide pure electric vehicles sold since 2010. Global Leaf sales passed the 200,000 unit milestone in December 2015, and the Leaf continued ranking as the all-time best selling all-electric car.Nissan's second all-electric vehicle, the Nissan e-NV200, was announced in November 2013. Series production at the Nissan Plan in Barcelona, Spain, began on 7 May 2014. The e-NV200 commercial van is based on the Nissan Leaf. Nissan plans to launch two additional battery electric vehicles by March 2017.In June 2016, Nissan announced it will introduce its first range extender car in Japan before March 2017. The series plug-in hybrid will use a new hybrid system, dubbed e-Power, which debuted with the Nissan Gripz concept crossover showcased at the September 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show. As of August 2016, Nissan electric vehicles were sold in 48 world markets. Nissan global electric vehicle sales passed 275,000 units in December 2016.The second-generation Leaf was launched by Nissan in Japan.\n\n\n=== Autonomous cars ===\n\nIn August 2013 Nissan announced its plans to launch several driverless cars by 2020. The company is building a dedicated autonomous driving proving ground in Japan, to be completed in 2014. Nissan installed its autonomous car technology in a Nissan Leaf all-electric car for demonstration purposes. The car was demonstrated at Nissan 360 test drive event held in California in August 2013. In September 2013, the Leaf fitted with the prototype Advanced Driver Assistance System was granted a license plate that allows it to drive on Japanese public roads. The testing car will be used by Nissan engineers to evaluate how its in-house autonomous driving software performs in the real world. Time spent on public roads will help refine the car's software for fully automated driving. The autonomous Leaf was demonstrated on public roads for the first time at a media event held in Japan in November 2013. The Leaf drove on the Sagami Expressway in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo. Nissan vice chairman Toshiyuki Shiga and the prefecture's governor, Yuji Kuroiwa, rode in the car during the test.\n\n\n=== Non-automotive products ===\nNissan has also had a number of ventures outside the automotive industry, most notably the Tu\u2013Ka mobile phone service (est. 1994), which was sold to DDI and Japan Telecom (both now merged into KDDI) in 1999. Nissan offers a subscription-based telematics service in select vehicles to drivers in Japan, called CarWings. Nissan also owns Nissan Marine, a joint venture with Tohatsu Corp that produces motors for smaller boats and other maritime equipment.\nNissan also built solid rocket motors for orbital launch vehicles such as the Lambda 4S and M-V. The aerospace and defense division of Nissan was sold to IHI Corporation in 2000.\n\n\n== Marketing activities ==\nNismo is the motorsports division of Nissan, founded in 1984. Nismo cars have participated in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship, Super GT, IMSA GT Championship, World Sportscar Championship, FIA World Endurance Championship, British Touring Car Championship, Supercars Championship and Blancpain GT Series. Also, they were featured at the World Series by Nissan from 1998 to 2004.\nNissan sponsored the Los Angeles Open golf tournament from 1987 to 2007.\nBeginning in 2015, Nissan became the naming rights sponsor for Nissan Stadium, the home of the Tennessee Titans and Tennessee State University football teams in Nashville. Nissan also became the official sponsor of the Heisman Trophy and UEFA Champions League.\n\n\n== Global sales figures ==\n\n\n== Research and development ==\nNissan's central research  is inside the Oppama Plant site, Yokosuka, which began its operation in 1961, at the former site of Imperial Japanese Navy's Airborne Squadron base.  In 1982, Nissan's technical centers in Suginami, Tokyo and Tsurumi, Yokohama were combined into one: Nissan Technical Center (NTC) in Atsugi, Kanagawa, at the foot of Mount \u014cyama of the Tanzawa Mountains.  At its 30th anniversary in 2012, NTC employed 9,500 employees in product development, design, production engineering, and purchasing.\nNissan Technical Center works closely with its overseas operations: Nissan Technical Center (NTC)/North America, NTC/Mexico, Nissan Design America, and Nissan Silicon Valley Office.\nIn 2007, the company opened Nissan Advanced Technology Center (NATC), near the NTC site. It works in close contact with the central research, the Silicon Valley office, the technical office near the Nissan headquarters in central Yokohama, and the overseas offices in Detroit, Silicon Valley, and Moscow.Nissan's test courses are in Tochigi (two courses), Yokosuka and  Hokkaido.\n\n\n=== Nissan Digital Hubs ===\nIn mid- 2018, Nissan launched its first of many planned software and information technology development centers in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.\n\n\n== Manufacturing locations ==\nData extracted from Nissan's international corporate website.\n\nJapan\nOppama, Yokosuka, Kanagawa (Oppama Plant & Research Center)\nKaminokawa, Tochigi (Tochigi Plant)\nKanda, Fukuoka (Nissan Motor Kyushu & Nissan Shatai Kyushu Plant)\nKanagawa-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa (Yokohama Engine Plant, Nissan's oldest factory)\nIwaki, Fukushima (Iwaki Engine Plant)\nHiratsuka, Kanagawa (Nissan Shatai Shonan Plant)\nNagoya, Aichi (Aichi Machine Industry Atsuta & Eitoku Plants)\nMatsusaka, Mie (Aichi Machine Industry Matsusaka Plant)\nTsu, Mie (Aichi Machine Industry Tsu Plant)\nUji, Kyoto (Auto Works Kyoto)\nAgeo, Saitama (Nissan Diesel Motor, currently owned by the Volvo Group)\nSamukawa, Kanagawa (Nissan Machinery)\nZama, Kanagawa (Assembly lines in the Zama Plant were closed in 1995, currently Global Production Engineering Center and storage unit for its historic models.

        "wiki": "Otaru (\u5c0f\u6a3d\u5e02, Otaru-shi) is a city and port in Shiribeshi Subprefecture, Hokkaido, Japan, northwest of Sapporo. The city faces the Ishikari Bay, and has long served as the main port of the bay. With its many historical buildings, Otaru is a popular tourist destination. Because it is a 25-minute drive from Sapporo, it has recently grown as a bedroom community.\nAs of 31 July 2019, the city has an estimated population of 115,333 and a population density of 474.37 persons per km2 (1,228.6 persons per sq. mi.). The total area is 243.13 km2 (93.87 sq mi). Although it is the largest city in Shiribeshi Subprefecture, the subprefecture's capital is the more centrally located Kutchan.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe city was an Ainu habitation, and the name \"Otaru\" is recognised as being of Ainu origin, possibly meaning \"River running through the sandy beach\". The very small remaining part of the Temiya Cave contains carvings from the Zoku-J\u014dmon period of Ainu history, around A.D. 400. Otaru was recognised as a village by the bakufu in 1865, and in 1880 the first railway line in Hokkaido was opened with daily service between Otaru and Sapporo.\nAn Imperial decree in July 1899 established Otaru as an open port for trading with the United States and the United Kingdom.The city flourished well as the financial and business center in Hokkaido as well as the trade port with Japanese ruled southern Sakhalin until the 1920s. Otaru was redesignated as a city on August 1, 1922.\nOn December 26, 1924, a freight train loaded with 600 cases of dynamite exploded in Temiya Station, damaging the warehouse, the harbour facilities and the surrounding area. Local officials stated that at least 94 were killed and 200 injured in this disaster.\nDuring WWII, Otaru housed a prison camp for Aleuts taken there following the Japanese occupation of Attu.Since the 1950s, as the coal industry around the city went into a decline, the status of economic hub shifted from Otaru to Sapporo.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nOtaru is a port town on the coast of the Sea of Japan in northern Shiribeshi Subprefecture. The southern portion of the city is characterized by the steep slopes of various mountains (notably Tenguyama), where the altitude of the land sharply drops from the mountains to the sea. The land available between the coast and mountains has been almost completely developed, and the developed part of the city on the mountain slopes is called Saka-no-machi, or \"Hill town\", including hills named Funamizaka (Boat-view Hill) and Jigokuzaka (Hell Hill).\n\n\n=== Neighboring cities and towns ===\nShiribeshi\nYoichi District: Yoichi, Akaigawa\nIshikari\nSapporo (Teine-ku, Minami-ku), Ishikari\n\n\n=== Rivers ===\nSome of the rivers in Otaru are: Hoshioki, Kiraichi, Zenibako, Hariusu, Asari, Katsunai, Shioya, Myoken, Irifune.\n\n\n== List of Mayors (from 1923 to present) ==\n\n\n== Climate ==\nIn the summer the weather, like all of western Hokkaido, is very warm and balmy, with a maximum temperature of around 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F) and high humidity - not as hot as southern Japan. In the winter, however, Otaru is very snowy, receiving as much as 6.6 metres (260 in) of snow from November to March, when it snows almost constantly and sunshine levels are extremely low. The average maximum snow cover is 1.22 metres (48 in).\nExtreme temperatures have ranged from 34.9 \u00b0C (94.8 \u00b0F) on August 1, 2000 to \u221218.0 \u00b0C (\u22120.4 \u00b0F) on January 24, 1954, in which month the highest snowfall of 3.1 metres (122 in) occurred. Monthly precipitation totals in a record dating back to 1943 have ranged from 379.8 millimetres (15.0 in) in August 1962 to 12.0 millimetres (0.5 in) in June 2007.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\nJR Hokkaido Station\nHakodate Main Line : Ranshima - Shioya - Otaru - Minami-Otaru - Otaru-Chikk\u014d - Asari - Zenibako\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\n\n\n==== National ====\nOtaru University of Commerce\n\n\n==== Private ====\nHokkaido College of Pharmacy\n\n\n=== High schools ===\n\n\n==== Public ====\nHokkaido Otaru Choryo High School\nHokkaido Otaru Ouyou High School\nHokkaido Otaru Commercial High School\nHokkaido Otaru Technical High School\nHokkaido Otaru Fisheries High School\n\n\n==== Private ====\nFutaba Gakuen High School\nHokusho High School\nOtaru Meihou High School\n\n\n== Notable attractions ==\n\nA canal adorned with Victorian-style street lamps runs through Otaru. The city attracts a large number of Japanese tourists as well as Russian visitors.\nA popular attraction on the west side of the city is Nishin Goten (herring mansion). This large wooden building was built in 1897 and was once the house of Fukumatsu Tanaka, a magnate of the herring fishing industry. It was originally built in nearby Tomari village and moved from there in 1958. Visitors can clearly see the difference between the squalid conditions of the first floor sleeping quarters of 120 workers and the ground floor luxury of the magnate's rooms.\nAnother notable building is the Sakaushi residence, constructed by Yoshiya Tanoue, a pupil of Frank Lloyd Wright.The Tomioka Catholic church is also a popular spot. Many of the buildings have been designated as landmark architecture.In the nearby village of Asarigawa Onsen and perched atop of Asari Ski Resort comes a new Boutique Resort catering for outdoor leisure activity. Currently under development by LENKEN, another Wisbey Brothers Build, scheduled for completion in 2018.\nOtaru is well known for its beer, and Otaru Beer, next to the canal, is a popular restaurant with a medieval theme. Otaru is also known for the freshness of its sushi. Another food attraction unique to Otaru is the rainbow tower ice cream. The town also has substantial shopping arcades and bazaars, but fewer than nearby Sapporo.\nOtaru's prominent industries are arts and crafts, such as studio glass and musical boxes. Of the latter, it maintains the Otaru Music Box Museum.\n\n\n== Tenguyama ==\n\nOtaru is an important port for Sapporo, and part of this hilly city is on the lower slopes of Tenguyama, a good place for skiing and other winter sports and one that is accessible via Otaru Tenguyama Ropeway.\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n Nakhodka, Russia\n Dunedin, New Zealand\n Gangseo District, Seoul, South Korea\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nSeiji Aochi, ski jumper\nY\u014dko Asagami, voice actor\nGennosuke Fuse, anatomist\nSei It\u014d, author\nChiaki Kawamata, author\nYukie Kawamura, actress\nMasaki Kobayashi, film director\nTakiji Kobayashi, author\nMasaru Konuma, film director\nK\u014dtetsuyama Toyoya, sumo wrestler\nNatsuhiko Kyogoku, author\nMotosaburo Masuyama, statistician\nHideharu Miyahira, ski jumper\nNobuko Miyamoto, actress\nTetsuya Mizuguchi, video game designer\nTakiko Mizunoe, actress\nMaki Murakami, manga artist\nHideo Murota, actor\nNobuo Nakamura, actor\nTetsuya Okabe, Alpine ski racer\nYoko Takahashi, fighter\nMiyoshi Umeki, Academy Award-winning actress and standards singer\nHibiki \u014ctsuki, actress\nHirokazu Yagi, ski jumper\nAkiko Yamanaka, politician\nIchiro Yamaguchi, musician (Sakanaction)\nSawao Yamanaka, musician (The Pillows)\nKazumi Yamashita, manga artist\n\n\n== See also ==\nOtaru Station\nOtaru University of Commerce\nRising Sun Rock Festival\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Otaru travel guide from Wikivoyage\nOfficial Website (in Japanese)",

          "A lotttt of tourist taking photos, the streets and warehouses around the canal more interesting then the canal itself.",
          "No further comment needed for this renowned canel. It is beautiful whole year year. Take a slow walk, day or night. Feeling blissful.",
          "it was raining when we arrived at the canal but gradually turned to snow within 1 hour. the roof of warehouse buildings came white from grey and looks totally different and full of love",
          "nice view.... slow stroll along the canal.Nothing much to see though. we were there at abt noon time, the temperature was at abt 6 degree. the snow is melting and the ground is kinda slippery... so we took a slow and careful walk down the canal.",
          "During our trip at the night time around 7pm. The canal is pretty dark, not much light around. Its pretty hard to take photo. There\u2019re no activities around the canal even the tourist information already closed. Tips: During winter season its best to see the canal before 4pm",
          "The area around the canal is very pleasant, with lots of shops and restaurants. You can also take a cruise along the canal.",
          "Went there on a half day trip (2nd half). As we reached there, there was heavy snow. This took away a good 1-2 hours of our time (we lingered around at a nearby shopping mall waiting for the snow to reside) Then we finally got to Otaru Canal. What a wonderful place! Romantic",
          "Personally prefer the day than the night. The night lights is not very impressive. It was snowing when we were there and the ground was slippery.",
          "Came in the morning, too much visitor in group (day tour). So we decided to come again at the evening with very few tourist. So relax walking along the canal, but the toilet beside the canal is the dirtiest i found in Hokkaido !",
          "This is the most amazing and beautiful place if you are visiting Sapporo I would request you guys to surely visit this place as it is the \u201cgem of a crown\u201d and the journey to this place is also one of the unseen experiences when the trains take you from the very oceanic view. I",
          "Quite beautiful canal, we can also ride boat in canal or rickshaw around the city but overall not much else we can do or see. One day trip from Sapporo (1 hour trip) is enough for me, no need to stay overnight in the city. Also, I feel this place is bit touristy and local food",
          "Guess it is a passage for anyone that visits Otaru the first time. I think it is a little underwhelming. I can imagine it being nice when it is illuminated at night or when there is more snow.",
          "The most photographed place in Otaru. Lots of people here. Nothing fantastic but just a canal with old buildings on the side.",
          "This is popular place to see & photo, but should to get there at 6:00-8:00 am. tour group is coming.There are romantic place in Otaru.",
          "It was a short walk from the hotel, I only got to see the night view which was okay... though I wouldn\u2019t go out of my way to visit. So many little hotel/motels nearby so definitely worth a walking tour if in Otaru.",
          "A place to stroll and have your photos taken. After taking pictures, there\u2019s nothing more to do. The old warehouses were converted to commercial establishments. Spend 30-45 minutes here.",
          "Only 1 part of the canal is lit at night, so it's where most people would come, to view and enjoy the canal. It's a pity you can't really walk the full length of the canal. I believe that this would be better.",
          "A must visit in Otaru! A truly Romantic walk by the Canal, amazing reflection of the old buildings on the water.",
          "Otaru canal is probably the number one attraction that tourists come to Otaru for. The view is indeed nice, regardless during the day or at night, but do take note that as the sun sets, the crowd that gathers at the bridge could get quite big. Every one is nice enough to take",
          "Been there during winter. a lot of people walking and very romantic area to spend with love. It takes about 20 mins to walk along the stretch. There are also plenty of ice sculptures big and small along it.",
          "The interesting part of the canal is only a short stretch. The rest is about the same. We took a nice walk in the morning. Could not do it at night as it was raining....",
          "It\u2019s a canal. And there is some history associated with it. It can be pretty certain times of the year. But it\u2019s worthwhile only if you are already nearby.",
          "I somehow didn\u2019t see much mention of the great old architecture. The canal is ok but it is the side streets away from the canal that are so charming. We only booked 5 hours here and could easily have spent the entire day or better overnight. Old buildings covered with autumn",
          "Beautiful Canal, a lovely area to walk around and plenty of shops and eateries... Can easily spend a couple of hours exploring this place...",
          "Lovely place to visit, long walk in the street, lots of shops and restaurants, there's a glass shop that allows you make your own necklace but need to go early. One of the coffee shops even give away their Hello Kitty cup away after you bought the drinks.",
          "One of the places i love in Sapporo is the Otaru Canal. The place is simply serene. The weather was perfect at the time we were there. Quiet town. Lots of interesting shops on the side. Worth going. An hours drive from Sapporo.",
          "While some of my friends find the \u2018smell\u2019 from the canal noticeable, I found it alright, and I think that the view from the opposite end of the canal (instead of the side just outside the tourist information office) much better and less crowded",
          "the canal itself is no so impressive - it is the atmosphere and places around it that give it a bit of a buzz.",
          "Nice calm walk along the canal, main tourist area so lots of tour groups and selfie sticks, but the other end of canal by old fishery buildings is nice and quiet.",
          "Nice part of the town but can get a bit busy. You can take a boat ride up the canal though we didn\u2019t have time.",
          "Very nice view and weather during End of September 2018. The weather is good that not too cold and not too hot, specially good if travel with young children.",
          "It is about one hour away from Sapporo station. There are lots of nice quaint little shops to see and go to like the music box, the glass shops. We also visited the stained glass museum which displayed beautiful stain glass panels of saints and biblical scenes. It was a touristy",
          "Took a boat trip on the canal at night time. It was an ok way to spend 30 mins, the area has a lot of history",
          "Lots of restaurants at various price points from full service to counter along the canal. There were gondolas, shops & lots of sights along the canal. Pretty amazing how they converted old warehouses into so many colorful contemporary uses.",
          "Was excited to visit the canal but it was very short and not much to look at. Can\u2019t imagine why you would want to take a boat trip on it. Very tourist orientated with bus loads of people everywhere. Overall a let down.",
          "We went to see the spot where tourists gather at night for the night picture of the canal with light reflections. It was a let down. Nothing more than some simple lights lit at the side of the canal being reflected in the water. Do not understand what the hype was about. No",
          "Otaru is famous for the canal here. Definitely a pretty scene when you come in winter during snowy days.",
          "In the daylight, the view was very nice but packed with a lot of people. I went back at night and they lit up the snow lanterns along the side canal. It was very picturesque. Yet, you have to brace yourself to get a picture of the canal or yourself with the canal as your",
          "The Otaru Snow Light Path Festival is a winter festival that held every February in Otaru , we came here by taxi from Nesiko, it cost us around USD 150-200 round trip. Luckily, during this time the city decorated in lights and small snow statues for only ten days. Although",
          "It's very nice view and romantic place especially during good weather. I went there in April and the weather is cooling. People go there to just take photo of the canal. However, there is nothing much selling. Walkable to Sakaimachi street about 5-10 mins, so it's good to dropby",
          "Nice walk around town and along canal. Quite busy and very humid today. Had lunch & a beer at the Otaru Brew. Nice to sit and watch the boats go by.",
          "There is nothing much to see or do here; the view is just ok. We were done in 5-10 minutes. Overall we found Otaru to be quaint but quite a let down as there isn\u2019t much to do, our drive to hike at the beautiful Cape Kamui was a much better use of our time.",
          "It's a clean, well maintained canal. There's nothing much happening in the area. If you have time to spare, it is good to visit the place too.",
          "The canal tour is great experience to understand the history and usage of the canal, the explanation in multi-languages are clear enough during the 40 min tour. With some imagination, we can actually feel the bustling scenes during the old times. Few attractions are in walking",
          "Love the night time view of Otaru Canal.. best to stroll here with your kids just to enjoy the view and the clean air",
          "The view of the canal is not as spectacular as the pictures in the internet, but it is nice to stroll around the surrounding areas. You can also ride a boat to tour around the canal, but when I went there the wave is a bit high than usual so they have to shorten the tour with",
          "The canal is famous and it is kind of normal when you go there and see the view. I walk there in the day light and night time. It look better at night time with bulb and lights However, the most amazing thing is after you take a photo, you will find the photo is even more",
          "Picturesque location but pity canal is so short. Plenty of spots to take beautiful pics and if more tables and chairs were provided, great area to have a picnic!",
          "We have spent a few hours on the street parallel to the canal. The canal itself is not much to see but one can take a nice stroll or drink a beer. The side of the canal with the walking path has local artist selling their work.",
          "Good place to feel cool winds which is flowed along canal from ocean. OTARU BEER is a famous craft beer and is good testy. I love it. Craft beer house is located by canal. we'd enjoyed a beer at terrace table. It was very nice time.",
          "We took a 30 min train ride from sapporo to otaru. Right after the train station is a bus shuttle service like a hop on hop off service to bring you around Otaru. Very convenient and nice place to visit outside of Sapporo. The Otaru ropeline is not so exciting not much to see",
          "It was beautiful but the day we went was too windy. The boat ride got canceled. Lots of good sushi restaurants there.",
          "I guess this place is a must stop in Otaru. I think you can spend 20 minutes here. Take photos and go for a stroll along the old warehouses. You can spend longer by taking a 40-minute cruise which travels from Chuo-ku Bridge to Asakusa Bridge along the North Canal. The",
          "Carnal is not long enough. You can ride a ferry or walk along with the carnal. Night view is romantic",
          "Cute place for a little stroll and pictures before going to tour all the desserts on Sakaimachihondori Street!",
          "Cannot complain about the scenery but the canal area only took 10 minutes to walk finish. Suggest that you may want to schedule other things to do besides taking photos of the canal.",
          "Sky was blue weather was good but a bit too cold for us. I never see so many music box in my lifetime but Otaru provided variety of music box with low and high price. Some more we can try local food and icecream in this place. Parking lots are sufficient just the fee not so",
          "Picturesque canal (only a short section of the Otaru canal) lined with old warehouse. Not very much happening though.",
          "Most probably winter is better. Now this canal look so dull. So crowded and hot. Not sure if will go again next time.",
          "Next time will most likely do day trip from Sapporo. Nice walk along canal but not much to see. Boat ride too long, better to walk.",
          "Otaru is an old town especially beautiful in winter. The warehouses lining up along the canal are historical buildings now converted to shops, restaurants and drinking places. There is also an interesting musical box museum.",
          "Quite a nice place to shop, eat n explore. Enjoyed the visit as there are modern n interesting shops, glass museums, shops selling accessories n food.",
          "Otaru is a drive away from Sapporo. Must visit, spend the entire day if your time permits, lovely place to walk, have fresh seafood and lots of quaint shops to appreciate and buy gifts.",
          "Enjoyed the walk around the canal. Many interesting shops on our walk towards the steam clock. Delicious and hefty serving of donburi bowls!",
          "A 15 minutes walk from Otaru station. A quiet walk through the streets/ canal that had brought you good feelings back to the older time. A cafe which name is \"Otaru Time Garten\" has eco and greenery interior design and nice breads. A good place to enjoy a nice cup of coffee or",
          "We had no idea where we were going or what we were going to see once we arrived in Otaru. Firstly the train trip from Sapporo is one of the very best in Japan. In early March the snow was to the water's edge as we skirted the sea. The canal was just another \"Wow\" that we",
          "There\u2019s too much hype about it. If you are in the city close by why not but too many people. Make sure you don\u2019t suffocate.",

          "\"Otaru used to be the important commercial port of Hokkaido. Eventually it was no longer serve its functionality and becomes a tourist attraction. The town is famous for glass art, LeTao barkery and more. When getting off the train station, on the left hand side it leads to the",

          "We stopped here for a few minutes to view the canal amidst a snow flurry. For me the canal was dark, grey and not very pretty. I've seen some lovely photos of the canal at night and perhaps my opinion would change if the weather was better and we walked along the canal at",
          "One of the famous tourist place when pick Hokkaido. Personally for me, nothing much to do during my visit. Maybe becoz its already end of winter & the snow already start melting n the walking alley a bit look dirty due to the melting snow & also slippery. It's just a short",

          "Been here many times. The canal is amazing and has good views all season. Good for half day visit. Have some ice cream too if you have time",

          "Otaru is a very nice, calm and peaceful city. This canal is one of the best attraction that you must visit.",
          "We were there on a Friday night and yet not much activity going on at the restaurants and bars near the canal. Very quiet area at night.",
          "One of the highlight of the night walk at the canal in winter. It is pretty although the weather was very cold. You can see different snow sculptures.",
          "Love the snow in Hokkaido ... it was so fine ... enjoyed the seafood and milk ice cream ... a must try when visiting Hokkaido-Sapporo",
          "A stretch of path along the canal decorated by candle displays, ice sculptures and frozen flowers/leaves in the evening. The walk from the Otaru station takes about 10 minutes and there are two areas where you can enjoy the festival as well. The view of the canal in the day is",
          "The canal itself even with lights is so-so but it is delightful wandering the gift glass and food shops",
          "Simply amazing but incredibly cold! It\u2019s a very famous tourist but I recommend that you come here during the winter festival. Wear a lot of warmers! Don\u2019t forget a pair of gloves.",
          "The canals are worth a visit in concert with the main walking street. Some of the beautiful warehouses have been converted to shops, restaurants and bars. It is a heavy tourist area so expect moderate quality at higher prices. You can take a boat ride along the canals. Not",
          "The Otaru Canal is a must place to visit. We have been spending our Christmas in Sapporo for the past 3 years but this is the first time that we went to Otaru Canal and we realized that we should have went here the first time we went to Sapporo. The place is so relaxing and it",
          "Went there at the start of the otaru snow festival. Light up from 5pm. A short walk from otaru JR station, 30 minutes from Sapporo via JR lines. Nice scenary along the way. Lighting start qt the canal area.",
          "I\u2019m not sure what I expected from Otaru but it wasn\u2019t the fantastic evening we had. It was a stop on our way to ski Niseko and the town and snow light festival is a beautiful, romantic and unique. Loved it. Can\u2019t wait to come back.",
          "This being our first stop in Hokkaido , was really excited about the evening walk by the canal and dinner. Firstly most restaurants shut at 8pm so be prepared. Second, we were here from 31Jan-1Feb, apart from lights we didn\u2019t see any snow art. Was expecting a longer canal",
          "Lots of fun. Easy train ride from Sapporo. Can be extremely cold but candles at night are especially beautiful.",
          "I walked there many times , go around and around for finding the way back into history of city but I found only lovely shops Tastefully snack and Nice peoples . If you need good foto shots and romantic, recommend to visit in night time",
          "Packed with Chinese tourists. Can only do a brief photo stop. Can\u2019t stride down the canal due to heavy snow. Guess other seasons of the year is better for leisure walk.",

          "We walked the canal during the day and then return to see it during the night. It is way prettier by night. There were a lot of tourists. There is not a lot of things to do except to take pictures. The street near the canal has a lot of shops.",
          "I\u2019m a fan of canals and was intrigued to know what the Otaru canal was like. It stretches for a km and has interesting gold buildings on the ocean side of it. There\u2019s lamps and interesting bridges and art work. It\u2019s not wide or long compared with other more famous canals but it",

          "For people from the tropics (like myself and my friends) this was a very picturesque and interesting sight. Snow covered banks and walkways, a lazy canal, plenty of picture spots with the town of Otaru and the snow covered mountains in the background. It does get crowded when",
          "We visited on the last week of Dec in the evening. The area as we walked from the train station to the canal was rather quiet and many shops had close by 7pm. The canal was plainly lit up with some strings of blue lights, nothing fancy. It might be different in the afternoon but",
          "Always beautiful river view. Actually more beautiful when the lights up. And you should visit the Otaru Canal Terminal. Warm ambience in subzero weather.",
          "You could just spend half a day in Otaru and be satisfied. There is not so much to see but it is a nice town to stroll around in. The canal at night and with the snow was quite beautiful. The town itself is a nice walk as well and there is a steam clock identical to the one in",
          "Spent a whole day in the town, walking around, enjoying the sights, the museums, the eateries... the fresh seafood and nice hot tea.. the canal in the night was lovely... lights and snow...",
          "We visited Otaru in the afternoon in Dec 2018 - so that we can view the Otaru Canal during the day and after sunset After sunset, there is the illumination so it is very beautiful As it was snowing, do be careful when walking around as it was very slippery. Do consider",
          "Night view at Otaru Canal in December 2018. Attractive, beautiful lights around the canal. Even through it's in -5 degree, we still wanted to stay longer. A must visiting place while you are in Hokkaido in winter time.",
          "Went during winter in the afternoon. Really pretty view but it is very packed. Alot of tour buses are there so it's pretty hard to take photo. But still recommended to visit.",
          "Visited the famed Otaru Canal, many tourist taking photos here and it was snowing lightly. The canal is nice, clean and you can walk along its side pavements. We did not see it at night when the lights were turned on. Recommend to visit.",
          "Absolute beauty, was worth a look during the day and night. The boat ride on the canal is recommended",
          "Otaru is an old town worth visiting even in the winter. We took the 40 mins JR train ride from Sapporo station to Otaru Station. Stepping out of the station, we crossed the road and walk straight down for about 600m to reach the canal. It was a nice walk along the canal before",
          "Otaru Canal was one of our must-visit places in our trip. But we were a bit disappointed not to see the old buildings covered with snow like the pictures we saw in the internet. The place was also crowded with tourist jostling for nice spots to take pix. Nevertheless it was",
          "Winter with rains. The lighting is dull and not as expectation from other review. Wasted hours travel from Saporro. Lighting at Odori Park much better.",
          "Was quite disappointed with our trip to Otaru in mid Dec. We should have made just a half-day trip instead of staying a night there. Many shops along the main shopping streets were aimed at tourists. Even museums like the musical box museum seemed to be a tourist shop in",
          "Must visit preferably after sunset if you want pictures for your Instagram and Facebook. About 10 minutes from Otaru-Chikko station (1000\u00a5 by cab). Take a walk by the canal on a snowy evening.",
          "There was nothing to rave about the canal. Perhaps during the snow light path festival in February each year, there would be more lights and decoration to look forward to, but in December, it looks quite drab. Didn't spend more than 10 minutes here.",
          "Walking along the canal and take photos of the areas. Of course, there are restaurants nearby to enjoy the views. Take the canal boat ride if you can afford the time (40min) and money. It is very easy to get there from Otaru Bus Station. Just remember when is the last bus.",
          "Otaru Canal is so beautiful it's like an oil painting. We took numerous pictures here, and they all look fantastic! We were here on Sunday but it's not too crowded. Very scenic place!",
          "It is the landmark of Otaru. Amust visit place. However, there are many many visitors and so crowded. To avoid this , or you wanna take nice photo ( with less peple and disturbance), pla go during evening time or early in morning.",
          "This place is beautiful in winter. Even though I have visited Otaru twice, I am still mesmerized by the canal. I wish it is not so cold and there are more benches around so that I can sit and enjoy a hot coffee with the beautiful view.",
          "It\u2019s worth the visit. Shops close about 6/7pm. Try to be there earlier as there will not be enough time in a day if you like shopping, buying and eating dessert...we went there twice in our last 2 days.",
          "Lovely place for photo op. At night the lights made it look magical. Otherwise nothing spectacular. Just another place to see when in Otaru",
          "It was snowing when we were there and it is very beautiful. We took a video with slow-mo and wow it was so nice.",
          "A short walk along the canal. Nothing much to do there except to take a few photos. It is a popular place whereby many will visit but I personally find it average. Visited for a few minutes and move on to other nearby places.",
          "This is my 3rd year to Otaru and every year, whoever friends I was with, we would take a photo at the canal. This is a must-have photo spot. If you are in Sapporo and wonder how to get to Otaru, you can take a bus or train. For your convenience, I have a train schedule in a",

          "We took the train from JR Sapporo to Otaru. There\u2019s semi rapid train that will take you there under 40 minutes. Once arrived, Otaru Canal is 20 minutes walk. The seaside harbour town is dotted with brick buildings and greenery. Any angle you photograph Otaru Canal, it\u2019s as",

          "Otaru is probably my best visit place in Hokkaido. You will not be disappointed with this place. Of course is the famous Otaru Canal but there are many nice place near this tourist attraction. Nearby are the sushi street and a famous shopping street...a must visit place!!! At",
          "Nothing much unless visited during winter. Quiet during night time and pack with tourist during day time. Some photo, painting and souviner are selling along the canal pedestrians during day time.",
          "Landmark of Otaru. Nice to go for a walk either during the day or at night. There are also a few artists selling own-designed postcards and pictures on the side. If you have time, may consider taking the canal cruise.",
          "Different view when snowing. Shops along the street. Do not miss the crystal shop which my tour guide did not highlight to us. Went there during daylight. But would be nice to be there in night. Safe environment though is tourist spot.",
          "We were told this was the place to be but to be honest it was ok we had a bite to eat around here- nice for a walk",
          "A beautiful canal with buildings on one side and a nice walkway on the other. There are boats that will go up and down to take tourists around. Strolling along the canal is also nice. There's a tourist office on the east end and it even has free wi-fi. Located about a block",
          "as expected, it is the must see canal in otaru. beautifully lighted up during the night and people crowding to take photos. nice to take a stroll during the day and night time especially for couples.",
          "Went to this canal which is just oppoaite our hotel, Hotel Nord Otaru. We took a boat ride and pays \u00a51500 per person ( for day time trip ) and enjoy the beautiful canal and buildings. In my opinion the boat ride is not necessary as you can already view the canal and the colonial",
          "Otaru Canal, Is just one place to experience Japan's Culture, a perfect spot to relax and have a good evening with your sweetheart, family, and friends. The canal has a walkway from end to end- along the way Otaru Canal offers glass shops, large shopping malls and other tourist",
          "It\u2019s nice but over rated. It\u2019s not worth more than 10 minutes. Definitely worth seeing but many other more interesting things to see an do.",
          "Otaru itself is probably the worst ever holiday destination I ever visited. Otaru Canal , I would rate this only 1/10. Nothing spectacular. Perhaps October is not the right time but apart from a few old warehouse-turned-restaurants and shop houses, nothing at all. Please do not",
          "Departure from the Otaru Canal, a lot of seabirds, exquisite balance rocks, you can also meet dolphins if you are lucky. And ahead of a pitch dark cave is a touching and beautiful blue! Feed the seagulls feeling so high on the way back.",
          "Many tourists come to a little port town,Otaru, with expecting to see Otaru canal which is a water way for tranporting all goods to warehouses and do shopping at Sakaimachi street. I think Otaru canal view in winter day and night during illumination event is best both weather",
          "This is another so-called Otaru \"attraction\" that I didn't understand the hype about. The canal is basically a standard man-made waterway, the type that you can find a million times over in most big cities near water. Its surroundings are not particularly pretty. Much like the",
          "Worth a visit...mainly it's quite a place for photo ops. Take a walk along the banks or the cruise..then go to the shopping street",
          "Taking JR from Sapporo to Otaru Came out the station walking about 15 min to the Otaru canal not really long this canal . But it is charming. You can walk along or set at the coffee shop looking at it . Very relaxed.",
          "Spent the day in Otaru this month (September 3rd, 2018). The canal area is very interesting with it\u2019s industrial/historical feel. The canal boat ride takes you all the way down the canal and into the ocean. Less than a mile away you can see the cruise boats on the port of Otaru.",
          "This was a nice ride on the boat. You get a headphone with English so you can hear what the history is. Well worth the price.",
          "Nothing much to do here, except walking around the canal and taking photos. Suggest this as a quick stop before going to the shopping street (more to see in that street).",
          "Perhaps it is transformed into a magical winter wonderland, but without snow, it seemed a simple canal lined with old industrial warehouses that have been converted into upscale boutique shops, restaurants, and bars. A pedestrian path lines one side of the canal, and there is",
          "It is only a 10 minutes walk along the attractive part, although it's very beautiful especially in the evening.",
          "This is an unexpected and unique area in Hokkaido. We enjoyed a lovely walk along Otaru when we visited during Golden Week. We took lots of photographs, loved the art displays along the canal and enjoyed the views. This is a lovely area, and you can visit here either quickly",
          "the otaru canal is beautiful and there are a lot of interesting restaurant and dessert shops in that area.",
          "Simple canal with old warehouses along on one side and a pedestrian path on the other. A good photo spot. Beautiful view with the mountain as background. It felt good and serene strolling along the canal. Night view was even better when the lights went on after dark. It gave a",
          "It can be romantic. Depending on the season I don\u2019t think it won\u2019t change the actual scenery. Nice to laze away . But with a tour group time goes really fast . It used to be known as Venice of the North according to my guide .",
          "It was my first winder in Otaru. Actually my first winter ever. Made a day trip from Sapporo by taking the JR train. The canal was beautiful. The weather was good for a nice stroll along the canal, though my finders were quite frozen by the time I reached the other end. Stayed",
          "Checked out this canal next to Otaru port in the pouring rain. Weather was not our friend today. Many old buildings line the canal and have been converted into nice bars and breweries as well as restaurants and shops. About 10 mins walk from Otaru train station.",
          "Even thought there is a lots of visitors, however each of them very patient and take the photos silently and offer help to those solo or who needed. Nice scenary with good companion",
          "Nice walk during the day or night. Can take a cruise to those who would like to experience it. Nice background pictures.",
          "It\u2019s my 2nd time visiting Otaru canal but it\u2019s the 1st time for my parents. It\u2019s easy to find it from the JR Otaru station. You need to keep walking straight from the station until the end of the street. You will find it. It\u2019s really very cold this time. The view was so",
          "A Famous place that people have to visit whenever they come to Otaru City. This place good for family and children to spend their afternoon time. This place also offer people who want to ride on the boat to see around the canal instead of walking. During Summer time, you can see",
          "I decided to walk the canal on my own and found it to be a lovely area to wander around and view the city. I walked all the way to Canal Park and then around Canal Park before heading back. You can take a canal boat ride but this is all in Japanese and as an English speaking",
          "Really nothing special! One stretch of canal, maybe less than 1km boardwalk on one side, houses on the other side; there are boat rides on the canal, but the boats only go up and down a few hundred meters. Can\u2019t understand the fuss about it. Better spend the time following the",
          "Otaru Canal is a very beautiful place must visit. A lot or tourists were there, remember to take photos at this beautiful place.",
          "I visited the Otaru Canal when I went to Otaru earlier this month and I found the canal to be a nice peaceful place. I was there about 10:00am in the morning and there wasn't too many other tourists walking about at that time. The canal may have had a vibrant history, but I",
          "Otaru canal is a perfect place for a weekend getaway with your loved ones. We booked a canal cruise, they have english audio told about the history of the canal. But I think this place has beautiful scenery during winter and autumn. Tips:Easily accessible from otaru Station.",
          "The area is beautiful and was fully covered with snow. We expected the canal to be longer though! Haha!",
          "Shops and restaurants near this canal are both amazing and compliment this peaceful city. I highly recommend Le Tao Tea Salon, try their mango cheesecake. Naruto Fried Chicken to renew your energy after a day of walking. Worth mentioning too is the beautiful train ride from",
          "Really had no idea what the big fuss is. Perhaps look much better in winter under the snow...visit if you\u2019re passing Otaru or if you planned to see more of the town, otherwise not worth the trip specially to see the canals and all the tourist traps around it with tons of tour",
          "The canal is just pretty normal but the unique thing is that they have rickshaw puller to bring u around and explain to u the history of Otaru. But it come with a hefty price. An 1 hour tour can cost up to 17,500yen which is about more than SGD $200.",
          "Pleasant walk beside the canal and a few different stalls to see but not actually very pretty surroundings so we didn't go on the canal boat.",
          "The city is really easy to access. Just 45 minutes by JR train to reach the otaru station. You need to explore the canal and the shopping area. The best thing tjat you can buy: the variety od chocolate",
          "The Otaru town has a very romantic feel. The canal boat ride or a rickshaw ride Is lovely. There is a shopping street which has very cute stores and street food. Enjoyed eating the melon, white corn, soft serve ice cream and Panju dessert here.",
          "I agree that it might be a great day to sightseeing if it doesn't rain but while it was raining quite heavily, there is no where to shelter. The canal was nothing too impressive when you have to view it in the rain. Lots of tourists there.",
          "Otaru Canal is very popular destination in Otaru to spend couple hour walking around and checking restaurant around the area! really recommend to check there if you come to travel in Hokkaido",
          "A must visit for all first timers. For a lovely scenic stroll along the canal and a photo opportunity. From here it's a short walk to Sakaimachi Street which is the main highlight of Otaru.",
          "We strolled along the bank of this short canal and just simply enjoyed the walk and view together with other tourists under a quite fine weather. If you are not taking the boat ride in the canal, there was nothing much to do except taking time to stopped and checked on the",
          "First, as a tourist using Sapporo as a base of operations, Otaru is very easy to get to with your JR pass or ordinary train ticket. Although part of the trip is industrial looking, a good portion of the trip follows the coastline, which can be quite scenic. The JR station is",
          "In this short canal, with amazing mountain background view.. look so amazing for photography material or instagram material LOL.. anyway you can also try taking the boat which is not very expensive..",
          "Even in the rain, this small canal was lovely to stroll along and good for capturing a few nice photos. It's pretty short, but there are many other interesting places and shops in Otaru as well, so strolling by the canal is well worth it!",
          "One of the landmarks in Otaru/ Hokkaido Please visit Otaru canal both in the morning and night ! Whole new different experiences !",
          "A good exercise and shopping experience. Although the town is now more of an tourist shopping area, where prices are higher than usual, it still was a nice experience to go and see the area. The canal was beautiful with its old buildings and greenery. Boat rides in dinggys to",
          "Nice to walk and pretty but expected a little more. Nonetheless would recommend to do especially early in the morning. Couple of nice photo spots.",
          "The part of the canal that has restaurants, cafe and shops is rather short. Some of them are interesting in terms of interior design. Quaint, fusion, contemporary. Further down toward the fishing area is of no much interest, but there boats anchor along the side, so walking down",
          "A Romantic canal especially when you come at sunset, This is a must visit place when you come to Hokkaido, although to me the canal is too short. 10 minutes walk from Otaru Station, lots of food around, so you can relax and enjoy the surrounding area. The most popular food in",
          "the place is kinda small, not as big as we saw in most photos, but the area is beatiful.. and also the surrounding area.. we really enjoy our walkd at the otaru..",
          "We love the area around Otaru Canal. Good to go on foot to explore the surroundings. Otaru Canal is a nice place for photo taking. The small shops within the area is nice to shop around. The ambience and atmostphere surrounding the area is kind of quaint and romantic for couples",
          "Disappointed with the short canal. The beautiful pics that we commonly see of this otaru shows only the v short stretch that looks q good. Otherwise nothing much to see.",
          "Beautiful canal near Sakaimachi shopping street.. fortunately when we came there, there were not lots of tourists so we could take plenty of beautiful pictures of the canal. Recommended place to go when you are in Otaru. And yes you could actually take a boat to go around the",
          "Its a very nice place with lots of food and places for good photos. December season, the place is covered with Snow and the place looks very romantic.",
          "Nice weather to walk around the canal area and also the shopping street about 800m away. Must try Letao and purchase some trinkets and glass ware",
          "We went recently in june and was disappointed at how the canal looks nothing like the photos we see. We stopped at the Otaru station so the canal was a long walk to get to, with young children. I suggest stopping a stop earlier at Minami- Otaru station which is nearer to the",
          "This place is about a 10 minute walk away from the JR Otaru station. My family took an evening stroll along the canal and we managed to get many nice photos taken. A worthy experience indeed.",
          "I was on the fence on whether to visit the canal (June 2018) but went ahead anyway - did not regret it! Very good spot to take photos, but with lots and lots of tourists there. There is a shopping and food street nearby so you can spend a good 2 hours or so in the area.",
          "The canal is quite short and there are lots of tourists. The canal is right beside a road with busy traffic, which most tourism photos don't show you and which makes it less appealing.",
          "The canal is one of the main attractions in Otaru. On a sunny day it\u2019s a beautiful spot for a short walk and the charming old buildings on the opposite side provide a great backdrop for photos. For a fee, you can get a boat ride up and down the canal but we decided not to",
          "went during winter time.No space to take photo.too many people but still manage to take some photo..love the scene there but the weather is too cold -7 degree Celsius.",
          "Our 1st visit is 8yrs ago. There is no changes and again only the light posts next to the canal lighted. The lightings not that much and nice as seen in the deceiving leaflets. But still worth the 2nd visit. Most of the shops closed ard 5-6pm. Only 2 or 3 restaurants close late.",
          "Good for a quick stroll along otaru other than the main shopping street. I went in the day and the views were average.",
          "Always packed with group tours busy taking photos, could get pretty noisy with them yelling/talking to each other, honestly not much to see there.",
          "Otaru Canal is one of the most visited place in Hokkaido. Not too far from Sapporo, Otaru fulfilled visitors not only a stroll along the canal sidewalk but a pleasant taste of famous Le Tau super creamy cheesecake. The music box shop is nice to find lovely souvenirs for self",
          "I guess I expected something extraordinary but the canal is nothing to shout about. Most people go to Otaru for the day we stayed 2 nights and we walked from our hotel (Authent) to the canal. Then walked along the canal and stopped for a beer. Not much to see really. There",
          "I was here in summer 2014 and winter 2017. Nothing beats the view in winter as the canal area will be covered with snow. Its a must visit if you drop by otaru.",
          "I'm quite interested in history and architecture but this a small area of buildings that barely engaged me. About a block long, now mostly restaurants, a very brief history. That\u2019s about it!",
          "In daylight, it\u2019s just so-so. This is a place where the picturesque postcards look way better than the real deal. It\u2019s a small stretch of canal and there\u2019s really nothing much going on there.",
          "First of all I do not understand some people who says this place is overrated. But I find this historical old canal worth a day visit. It has it's own charm and it's so peaceful and serene. As you walk on you will find lots of seafood eateries, sweet shops and souvenirs shops.",
          "You must definitely visit this canal when you are in Otaru especially when it is still snowing. The place looks like a picture from postcard came alive. Just simply enjoy the scenery and take a relaxing stroll along the canal.",
          "Stayed in Otaru for 2 nights (about 1.5 days) but it wasn\u2019t nearly enough. You need a full 2-3 days here. A great place to score yourself some beautiful craftwork and make your own. Close to the slopes in winter as well. Only a short trip from Sapporo, part of the train trip",
          "Otaru You should go there for winter . It is vert Besutiful , small town . There is great seafoods, japanese sweet.",
          "We had an enjoyable yet short walk along the Canel, despite that road condition was slippery after days of snow, but sorrounding shops/ restaurants were fun to visit",
          "The famous location for visitors to Otaru. More beautiful at night with the light and reflection on the water but I see some day time pictures with green on the warehouse wall which is also quite beautiful. But it's more romantic at night. Very popular for couple and group",
          "The view is amazing during winter. Everywhere are white, the snows are fine and the weather is freezing.",
          "Surprisingly, when I was there in the evening, there was no tourists at the canal at all. Maybe I came at a wrong moment, but nothing much to do here except looking around the peaceful canal with nice lighting shed on the water and old buildings. Shops and restaurants were",
          "The snow literally pouring down when we took the walk along the canal.Quaint with old industrial buildings, the most open were various souvenir shops and one and another restaurant.",
          "I went there in the early April and the snow started to melt. Around the canal there are shops and the place itself is beautiful. At night time the lights are also pretty amazing. A must go if you go to Otaru.",
          "you can't missed otaru canal if you visit this city. otaru canal is the main attraction, especially in winter where everything is covered with snows. very beautiful scene of old building, a river, candle and ice. and very easy to access because if you came to otaru by train, it",
          "Otaru Canal is a must go spot when visit to Sapporo. Especially the winter view at evening and night. The ice cream there also is must try dessert at Otaru.",
          "The canal is pretty small, however it is iconic to stop here for a few minutes and snap a few pictures. I would recommend stopping by just to have a look then continue on to the shops at Sakamachi street although it is quite a walk there. We went during off-peak season so it",
          "We went for a walk along the Otaru Canal on a trip to Otaru. There was snow on the ground and it was lightly snowing - very romantic. It was late afternoon and the light festival was being set up, but unfortunately we could not stay for the evening light show.",
          "Otaru canal is a favourite photo spot with the Japanese for a reason. It is a nice short walk. However, they are overselling it in the brochures. It is really only a short walk behind the Otaru Beer brewery. I hear they do display more lights for a limited time but you need to",
          "Only come for the seafood or shop for deer titbits\ud83c\udf66\ud83c\udf66otherwise no need to spend so many days here. Better check with station regarding train times to airport and other stops when you are physically there bcoz I was given the wrong information for rapid trains and normal train",
          "After a long walk in the snow from Otaru Station, the canal was a bit of disappointment. It's relatively small. Not that the view was bad, but not as picturesque as I imagined (perhaps I expected too much). And in the evening, it was jammed-packed with visitors, making it",
          "Oh we had fun, but not because of the canal, but because we always have fun as a family. Canal is overrated in my opinion but I can see its value for young couples. It would be better if they offered romantic meal on the boat! Boat trip is short, anout 10-15 min with barely",
          "Went there in February and there was light up festival in the evening. A little crowded at photospot but the crowd clears fast",
          "We went there for the light festival but we didn't see much as what we have expected. There are lights within the canal but few on its sidewalk. Maybe because it's the firat day of the festival and not yet fully decorated. It is also too crowded at night. I still give it a",
          "The Otaru Canal area is beautiful during the annual light festival. Other areas close by are lit up with snow sculptures and candles.",
          "Perhaps it was because we went after sunset in winter so there was nothing much to see. Took photos like everyone else did. It is very cold there as well! Perhaps we would visit again during the daytime or in another season.",
          "We visited Otaru just before Christmas last year. It\u2019s snowing Everyday in Otaru and made whole scenery white. Many foreign tourists visited in the town at night.",
          "If you visit Otaru you should visit the Canal. All the Japanese tourists are there. Take a selfie just like all the other people \ud83d\ude09",
          "Walking during winter there is not crowded. We were there during the day and night, both provided different view: day time offers Mountain View in the background and night offers blue lights. 20 minuets there is enough.",
          "A nice place to walk along and soak up the fresh air. The snow makes it more pretty. Only a short walk from the JR station.",
          "This is the second time I visited Otaru. Last time was May last year. Maybe everyone wants to see the beautiful night view of Winter's Otaru, so everywhere is crowded with tourists. For the Canal, it is undoubtedly pretty, but as it was too cold for me, so I just took a quick",
          "Nothing much to see, filled to the brim with tourists. Food around the area was expensive. The train ride to the town was quite scenic.",
          "While sightseeing in Otaru, we walked the length of the canal as it is well known and a tourist attraction, and one night had dinner at one of the restaurants. It was a German Beer restaurant with Japanese staff. The staff were very friendly, the food good but small portions and",
          "Visited at night.. freezing cold.. 10 mins walk from Otaru JR station.. exit u will see Burger King on ur left, turn right, walk, turn right, traffic light, walk all the way straight, there is Canal plaza right before traffic light... u shud also see KFC on ur right on the way",
          "I visited the canal during winter, before the lampion festival. But the view was still stunning. There were blue lights along the canal and on the bridge makes beautiful effect on the white snow.",
          "The Canal is nice, seen many pictures of it and it gave us the same feeling when we were actually there. Expect many tourists as everyone is fighting to take pictures from the end where the tourist information office is located. We were there in the day and night as well.",
          "First time to this interesting place, we had fun by taking pictures in the middle of -4C and snowing time.. after that, we had some hot chocolate and caffe latte to get warmed. We then continue walked along the shopping street to buy some local souvenirs, and have a nice lunch",
          "No much to say about the canal, you can easily do it in 20mn.... with the snow all around it gives quite nice photo but no more...",
          "Temperature in mid December is on average -4C but don't let that dampen your spirits! 10-15mins spent at the actual canal is enough for photo taking and to admire the view. After that, head on to the shopping street catered for tourist opposite the canal! It is a pretty long",
          "Was here in the evening during heavy snowfall. Didn\u2019t bother to stroll around as the road was just too slippery but it was worth the effort.",
          "Been here the second time...during snowy weather. Very scenic view... Started strolling about 10am, but most shops behind the canal wasn't open for business. Most shops open around 11am...",
          "It was a really nice place to stroll and have some great photos taken. We made some snowman while we were there. And the atmosphere was really good. :)",
          "One day trip to this touristy old town. Freezing cold during winter time and yet snowing heavily when we are there but pretty worth it with the very amazing view. Romantic walkway for couples. But a bit walk from the station.",
          "Highly recommended half to full day trip from Sapporo. Easy access, from JR Sapporo Station to JR Otaru Station, which is the last terminal station. JPY640, 30-40 minute journey passing the scenic seacoast, trains depart every 10-20 minutes. From the station, walk out the",
          "It's about 1h train ride from Sapporo. It's very touristy place. Was very unfortunate to rain on the day we arrived. However even rain did not stop the tourists from taking pic at along canal. It s nice to visit this old lovely town.",
          "is a good day trip visit, glass and music box museum is beautiful. my family went for a sushi and grill unagi restarant near the canal (sorry I can't remember the name of the restaurant) unagi is yummilicious! my teenage kids love it.",
          "It's a nice good spot to photo shoot, from the background will know where you are!! Especially during winter time",
          "Second time visiting, and the view surely is different from summer (my first time) and well worth it.",
          "This is a romantic place for a couple to stroll in the evening. The entire stretch is not long, but the lightings and the snow makes it perfect.",
          "Nice ambient for cold weather. Very relaxing walk along the Canal . Good for family . Surrounded by shopping and eateries",
          "The canal is really beautiful. We took the cruise too but to be honest, the cruise was nothing much to us. Only certain part of the Canal is illuminated with lights. Maybe cause it\u2019s a bit dark and it\u2019s a bit too cold during the cruise, we did not really enjoy the cruise.",
          "Abit of walk from the station. If you could put up signs how to go will be useful. It was snowing heavily when we went.",
          "Its an interesting old city with many canals.Visiting the Otaru beer factory is a must.A walk along the canals is great.",
          "Came during winter with heavy snowfall. Cold like hell. A beautiful place. Definitely worth a romantic walk by the Otaru Canal.",
          "there is a stretch of canal that is lit at night, providing a Venice or Bruges like backdrop with canal boats cruising and lighted warehouses converted into restaurants. A little piece of Europe in Hokkaido.",
          "Have been here on 19th November 2017, it was cover with snow everywhere. The canal looks great with different feel during dusk, night and day.",
          "The Otaru canal is better at night, when lights up it creates a romantic atmosphere. There are plenty of shops selling souvenirs and foods around, beware of slippery road as covered with snow.",
          "The canal is quite remarkable to stroll down, the warehouse buildings are historic gems and interesting to see a collection of tourists from Japan and some other countries. What I like the most was seeing some street artists and performers at their craft. One woman played her",
          "No trip to Otaru is complete without a visit to the Otaru Canal. Yes, it's extremely touristy. But, you can take some good pictures around the canal. It's especially atmospheric when there's snow. You can walk along the canal leisurely after taking some pictures or go inside",
          "Don't miss the canal boat ride..a great time in June - cool and sunny. After the ride, there are so many seafood restaurants and deli cafes...along the street....",
          "This is quiet a pleasant place to stroll around. You can rent a boat and cruise the river. Clear blue sky, ocean air, nuance of old japan. Great experience.",
          "Canal located not too far from station, its walk able. We had day trip from Sapporo. Also nearby there shopping center when you want spending your day in Otaru. Canal itself actually not so beautiful, but trust me its very good place to take picture. Result is beautiful. We",
          "We visited Otaru Canal last night. It's not that pretty now vs winter time. The canal don't light up during this time. But still a good walk around the canal region.",
          "A must go spot, a movie was made there sometime ago and make the canal so famous. It looks its best with snow, but it was still beautiful as my visit there was in September. Took 25 minutes walk there from the cruise port. Nice little shops and restaurants around and nearby.",

          "I had a short, pleasant stroll along the Otaru Canal. You can take a cruise, but I did not do so as I was travelling on a budget and felt I could enjoy a similar view by walking the short stretch. There are artists along the Otaru Canal doing sketches, paintings, and more. I",

          "we went in the middle of a festival season in summer, before the fireworks. So there were quite a lot of people, but it complimented the canal and there were activities such as the boat ride that was out, as well as food stalls. I imagine the winter/autumn/spring would even be",

          "It is exactly what you see in the pictures. The Otaru Canal is just a big canal. To me, it looks like the canals one sees in pictures of Venice... The winter light up makes it look very pretty. Worth taking a stroll there and taking a picture. I must admit, it is a pretty sight.",

          "This is a scenic spot and most tourist would head here for the obligatory photo-taking session. The warehouses are now used for purposes other than what it was originally intended for, driven by trade in the old days. Nonetheless, it's a nice stroll along the canal and is",

          "Upon arrival at this Otaru Canal (\u5c0f\u6a3d\u904b\u6cb3), one cannot resist taking our their cameras or camera phones to take a few shots of this serene and beautiful canal. The Otaru canal used to be a busy port in the early days, but became obsolete in the late 20th century. Walking along this",
          "There are stone & brick warehouses built in a row along the canal. Ideal place for picture taking and you can easily spend about 20-30 minutes or so there just to admire the beauty of the area. I joined the Chuo bus tour so it was a bit of a rush. Time given for this tour is",

          "We didn't actually go to take a boat ride, but passed through in the evening. The lights were so pretty!",

          "We arrived at the Canal shortly after sundown. The blue light display was pretty, but not as impressive as we had imagined. I think the late December/February display might be better. Otaru town however is worth walking through! The train ride, with slight snow drifts were",
          "A beautiful place regardless of the season. Stroll along the canal. There are European styled buildings along the canal, making one feel like being in a dreamland. As you stroll around, try the multi-layered ice cream cone, cakes, snacks in the shops.",

          "Go in the morning around 8 am (or earlier) before the throngs of tourists arrive and stallkeepers set up shop. You'll be able to see Shinto priests conducting their morning prayers, and you can make the peaceful gradual climb up the forested pathway of 10,000 vermillion torii",

          "This is a sister shrine of the Inari Shrine in Kyoto. The one in Kyoto has more poles. But a good place to go if you haven't seen the one in Kyoto yet. Going there is a bit hard since there is not direct public transportation - you need to walk from the nearest train station.",
          "Most people seem to only hope half way. If you are mobile and reasonably fit go all the way...it's worth it. We thought the gates would only be part of the way but they really do go the whole way over the mountain.",
          "Went there in March with a photographer. I do not know how to get there as the photographer drove. It's close to town, maybe 10 minutes form Susukino. It's a beautiful spot for photo-taking, especially in the snow. Didn't do any other thing except that.",

          "Amazing place to take a photos with red gates and there is place on the top to make a wishes and prays.",

          "Get there before nine or two hours before sunset. Climb Inari mountain walking through 1000 orange gates. Some steep parts. Views of the city. A little less crowded in the afternoon.",
          "There isn't much to see, but shrine was very pretty when covered in snow. It was very hard for us to find the shrine because there isn't any signboard that show us the way, but luckily we got Internet to follow the way there. Shrine was covered in snow, but no one was there to",
          "We visited just as dark was falling. It was cool but not cold. Ideal for what was a long hike up. The atmosphere was incredible - the gates, the foxes, the cemeteries. I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars only because the maps are TERRIBLE. They repeat the same \"you are here\"",
          "Visited the Kyoto's Fushini Inari-Taisha. was magnificent and can't wait to go back again to climb up the steps to venture further. However, this location as above is for the Sapporo's shrine. I did a simple google search, and the pictures churned out from google map is",

          "This is a beautiful shrine. It requires a lot of walking, but is well worth it. If you plan on visiting and have a tendency to attract mosquitos, be sure to use bug spray, as there are a lot of them here. If you can, it's best to go just before sunset as it is very beautiful",
          "I came here with my girlfriend about 4pm when it was still light and busy and then read that it is actually open late into the night. We headed up to the top as the sun set and the whole place changed from a crowded tourist hotspot to a quiet, haunting yet wonderfully authentic",
          "The entrance is conveniently located opposite the train station but get there early - it is almost impossible to get a good photo of the torii without people! We visited on a hot August afternoon midweek and it was very busy. Having just come from Namzen-ji, we much preferred",
          "Being close to the base station of Mt. Moiwa Ropeway, it's worth visiting this shrine. Particularly during winter-season the red gates look very beatiful. Be sure to wear boots, since the path to the temple under the gates was not cleaned while we were there.",
          "Different than most shrines in Sapporo, the Fushimi Inari Shrine doesn't attract many tourist since its located in a suburban area a little ways off from the gondola. Coming in the winter, the red and white contrast is absolutely gorgeous; the shrine is tranquil and worth the",
          "Google maps told us to turn at the sign for the Moiwa Waterworks Museum, but we ended up at the shrine's side entrance. Do not blindly follow Google maps, and continue up the road from the junction and you'll save a 40-minute side trip through a housing area."

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River. Sapporo has an elevation of 29 m (95 ft 2 in)Sapporo has many parks, including Odori Park, which is located in the heart of the city and hosts a number of annual events and festivals throughout the year.

Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues.

        "wiki": "The Mitsubishi Lancer is a compact car produced by the Japanese manufacturer Mitsubishi since 1973.\nThe Lancer has been marketed as the Colt Lancer, Dodge Colt, Plymouth Colt, Chrysler Valiant Lancer, Chrysler Lancer, Eagle Summit, Hindustan Lancer, Soueast Lioncel, and Mitsubishi Mirage in various countries at different times, and has been sold as the Mitsubishi Galant Fortis in Japan since 2007. It has also been sold as Mitsubishi Lancer Fortis in Taiwan with a different facelift than the Galant Fortis. In Japan, it was sold at a specific retail chain called Car Plaza.\nBetween its introduction in 1973 and 2008, over six million units were sold. According to Mitsubishi, there were nine generations of development before the current model.Mitsubishi ended production of the Lancer in August 2017 worldwide, with the exception of Taiwan and Mainland China. An extensive facelift was given to the car by Pininfarina's Chinese offices.\n\n\n== First generation (A70; 1973) ==\n\nThe first Lancer (A70) was launched in February 1973. It served to fill the gap between the Minica kei car and the larger Galant. The sporting 1600 GSR model began the Lancer's long and successful rally history, winning the Safari Rally twice and the Southern Cross Rally four times.\nThere were four body styles, two- and four-door sedans, a two-door hardtop coupe and a long-running five-door station wagon (built until replaced by the front-wheel drive Lancer/Mirage Van in March 1984). Engines were different 1.2-liter, 1.4-liter, and 1.6-liter fours.\nThis car was marketed under a variety of names: Dodge Colt in the United States, Plymouth Colt in Canada, Dodge Lancer in some Latin American countries, Chrysler Valiant Lancer in Australia, and Colt Lancer in some European markets.\n\n\n=== Celeste ===\n\nIn February 1975 the Lancer was complemented by a hatchback called the Lancer Celeste, succeeding the Galant FTO. It was also called the Mitsubishi Celeste (New Zealand) or Colt Celeste in some markets; and sold as the Chrysler Lancer in Australia, the Dodge Lancer Celeste in El Salvador, the Plymouth Arrow in the United States, and the Dodge Arrow in Canada.\nFour-door Lancer assembly began in New Zealand in 1975, supplementing the larger English Hillman Avengers also built locally by importer Todd Motors. The Celeste was imported built-up from Japan initially and assembly of a single 1.6- liter, manual transmission model began in 1978 followed by a minor facelift about a year later.\nThe Celeste was originally available with 1.4- and 1.6-liter options, while a bigger 2.0-liter model was added later. An even larger 2.6-liter four was available in the US-market Plymouth Fire Arrow. The Celeste was facelifted in 1978, receiving square headlights and bigger squarer bumpers. Production of the Lancer Celeste ended in July 1981 and it was replaced by the front-wheel drive Cordia in early 1982.\n\n\n== Second generation (EX; 1979) ==\nIn 1979, the all new Lancer EX was unveiled in Japan. Its new, clean and aerodynamic styling with integrated plastic bumpers reflected that of the recently introduced Galant and Sapporo. It was of a more European appearance than earlier Mitsubishi vehicles. Considerably more spacious, it grew in all dimensions. Only two engines were offered at first, a 1.4-liter MCA-JET equipped engine paired with Mitsubishi's Silent Shaft Technology, which generated 80 PS (59 kW) and a 1.6-liter engine that generated 85 PS (63 kW). The MCA-JET system was an entirely new concept when compared with the previously used carburetor system. The MCA stands for Mitsubishi Clean Air which meant that the EX passed both Japan and US emission standards, while the new cylinder head design of the engine gave way for a Jet valve which introduced an extra swirl of air to the combustion chamber, swirling the fuel-air mixture for a cleaner, efficient and more thorough burn.\n\nIn addition to these improvements, another breakthrough in the Lancer lineup was the Silent Shaft Technology, which was actually two counterbalancing shafts that rotated in opposite directions, cancelling the power pulses inherent in an inline four-cylinder engine. This reduced both engine noise and vibration, and provided a smoother driving experience. The 1.8-liter Sirius 80 engines were then introduced in the Lancer in 1980, expanding the Lancer's range of engines. Also, a turbocharged, 135 PS (99 kW) engine was added in 1980 for sportier performance, and an intercooler system was also integrated in the existing turbocharged engine to produce 160 PS (118 kW) in 1983.\nIn 1980, The Lancer EX was introduced with a 1.8-liter turbocharged inline-four option known as the 1800GSR and GT Turbo. The first generation 1800GSR and GT were only available with a turbocharged, non-intercooled 135 PS (99 kW).\nNew Zealand importer Todd Motors assembled the new Lancer EX from 1980 with 1.6-liter carburetor gasoline engine and a choice of manual or automatic transmission. The model was also a popular base for rally cars in that market, with some success. It was replaced by the front-drive Tredia in 1982 with the Cordia coupe equivalent effectively replacing the earlier Celeste.\n\n\n=== Europe ===\nIn Europe, the Lancer EX sold well as its restrained styling better matched the desires of European buyers than its somewhat fussy predecessor. Other considerations concerned handling and also the demand for more passenger room, as Mitsubishi tailored the Lancer towards European consumers. It went on sale locally after making its European premier at the 1979 Frankfurt Show.Unlike in Japan, European buyers could also get a 1.2-liter option which suited local tax conditions. Claimed outputs in Europe were lower than in the domestic market, with the 1200, 1400, and 1600 being good for 40, 50, and 60 kW (54, 68, and 82 PS) respectively. Here, the Lancer EX was also offered with a turbocharged 2.0-liter engine, known as the Lancer EX 2000 Turbo. It achieved a maximum output of 125 kW (170 PS) and managed a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph). This model was equipped with multi point fuel injection (ECI). A rally version of the Lancer EX 2000 Turbo was made for the 1000 Lakes Rally that gave out 206 kW (280 PS). At home, sales of the turbo model were low because of emission regulations Japan imposed at that time.\n\n\n=== Japan ===\n1400 SL, GL \u2013 Four-door sedan powered by a 1.4-liter engine, with a four-speed manual transmission; a five-speed was also introduced (1979\u20131987).\n1200 EL, GL, SL \u2013 Same as the 1400, with a 1.2-liter engine option (1979\u20131983).

Mitsubishi had originally launched the Mirage in 1978 as a front-wheel drive hatchback, with a sedan variant later released in 1982\u2014and a version of which sold in Japan as Lancer Fiore. Five generations of Mirage were manufactured by Mitsubishi up until 2003, with new generations released in 1983 and 1987 (with the equivalent Lancer delayed until 1988), 1991 to 1995. It was not until 1988\u2014with the 1979 to 1987 Lancer now departed\u2014that the Mirage-based Lancer eschewed the Fiore suffix.\nBetween 1982 and 1987, the aforementioned Mirage sedan with minor styling modifications sold as the Lancer Fiore through Japanese retail channels. The Fiore spanned two generations, the second of which came to the market in 1983. Internationally, the Fiore sedan often sold under the abbreviated name Lancer, and sometimes as the \"Lancer F\" (for example, in Germany). Thus, with the rear-wheel drive Lancer as introduced in 1979 and the front-wheel drive Lancer Fiore, Mitsubishi had two similarly sized models competing in the same market segment, sometimes even while sharing the Lancer badge.\nAlthough naming conventions varied, for all generations, sedan versions of the Mirage were typically badged as Lancer in export markets such as the Philippines, although notably not in the United States. In Japan, sedan variants of the Mirage and Lancer sold alongside one another with minor differences in trim. The station wagon, part of the 1983 and 1991 iterations, was typically known as the Lancer in export markets. Likewise, the Mirage coupe variant, available with the 1991 and 1995 generations, also became part of the Lancer lineup in some regions.\nMitsubishi introduced replacements for the Mirage starting in 2000, with a new generation of Lancer sedan\u2014now larger and having moved up to the compact segment. Then in 2002, a subcompact five-door hatchback badged Colt internationally became available, thus substituting the Mirage hatchback. By 2003, the Mirage had been completely phased out of mainstream Japanese production and Lancer became the primary title for Mitsubishi's compact offerings.\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Sixth generation (2000) ==\nMay 2000 saw the release in Japan of the Lancer Cedia (meaning CEntury DIAmond); though in most markets the previous 1995 vintage Mirage-based Lancer continued on, built at Mitsubishi's Mizushima plant in Japan. The new model was available in sedan and station wagon forms. In Europe, the Lancer was not offered in some countries, being too close to the size of the Dutch-built Mitsubishi Carisma, so the Evo VII model sold there bore the Carisma name. This series of Lancer is still sold in Japan where the 2007 onwards generation Lancer is known as \"Galant Fortis\".\nIn February 2003, for the 2004 model year, a heavily restyled Lancer surfaced with a front styling that brought it into line with the Mitsubishi corporate look, as well as a restyled rear, to further differentiate itself from the Lancer Evolution. The car's grille was then redesigned again in 2005 for the 2006 model year.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\n\n\n==== Asia ====\nIn Japan, the Lancer Cedia was offered with many different trim levels and engines, including some options never exported. It was also one of the first models to use the INVECS-III CVT transmission. There was also a Ralliart version of the Sportswagon which was powered by a turbocharged 1.8-liter GDI engine. As of 2009, this generation of Lancer sedan is still being sold alongside the newer 2007 era generation, which is known in the home market as the Galant Fortis.\nIn Taiwan, the Mitsubishi Lancer was produced and marketed by China Motor Corporation, and the car was slightly restyled in the beginning with larger front grilles, extra chrome trims, and the rear license plate located on the trunk lid instead of the rear bumper. Later, following the internationally sold facelift version, the front lamps were restyled and reshaped to be triangular while the tail lamps extended onto the trunk lid which is different from the version sold in other parts of the world. An additional facelift was added again in 2005 with white marker lights in the front replacing the amber ones and restyled tail lamps.\nIn Indonesia, the Lancer was available in GLXi and SEi trims. It was assembled locally and sold from 2002 until 2012.\nIn Malaysia, the Lancer was made available after Mitsubishi had sold all its shares in Malaysian carmaker Proton, marking the return of Mitsubishi in Malaysian market after being absent since 1985 due to the agreement with Proton. The Lancer sold in Malaysia was powered by the 4G18 engine which also powered the early 1.6-liter Proton Waja model.\nIn the Philippines, the Lancer was launched in 2003, with the central trapezoidal in the grille. It is offered in 3 trims, the base GLX (5-speed manual), the mid GLS (5-speed manual or INVECS-III CVT), and high-end MX, featuring side skirt and chrome door handles, (INVECS-III CVT) with manual override. Both GLX and GLS are powered with the 1.6-liter 4G18 SOHC engine, and MX has powered with the 1.8-liter 4G93 SOHC engine. In mid-2004, the Lancer gives major facelift; featuring front and rear end design. Later than 2007, the Lancer gives minor facelift; featuring front and rear end, and now without semi-triangle in the grille.\nIn 2007, Mitsubishi released a 2.0 variant called the Lancer GT and GSR. The GT is powered by a naturally aspirated version of the 4G63, (4-speed INVECS II). The GT also sports semi-bucket seats and Momo steering wheel while the GSR has leather seats and only comes in Glaire Beige (champagne).\nIn Pakistan, this variant was launched in 2005 with cosmetic changes from the front and the back. Thai production was switched to the new model, and in all markets except for India the previous model was no longer marketed, four years after the Cedia's introduction. India received this 2000 era series of Lancer in 2006, known locally as the Mitsubishi Cedia to distinguish it from the previous version which was assembled and sold as the Lancer till June 2012, and Mitsubishi Cedia production closed in November 2012.\n\n\n==== Australia ====\n\nIn Australia, this series of Lancer was introduced as the CG series in July 2002 with the 2.0-liter 4G94 engine. The 2003 facelift, designated the CH series, introduced a heavily updated VR-X, which included new 16\" alloys, stiffer suspension, body styling kit, and gear shifter borrowed from the Lancer Evolution. In 2004, the new Lancer wagon was introduced as a direct replacement for its ageing circa 1992 predecessor.\nIn August 2005, all Lancers were upgraded to the 2.4-liter 4G69 engine, producing 115 kW (154 hp) and 220 N\u22c5m (162 lb\u22c5ft) of torque. The upgraded engine also saw a change in trim levels and upgraded equipment\u2014the ES and LS models now featured a more upmarket looking black interior, while the VR-X gained a new black grille to closer resemble the Lancer Evolution IX. The equipment levels of all models were also upgraded, with the LS and VR-X gaining climate control, and a premium audio system sourced from the luxury Mitsubishi Verada. The Exceed model was discontinued, and all updated models now used JDM sized rear bumpers instead of the larger USDM sized versions. Additionally, the wagon also saw these changes; and as of 2007, continues to be sold alongside the sedan.\nThe ES and LS models were given a minor facelift for the 2007 model year; this time gaining the same front grille as the US models, and putting it into line with the current corporate look\u2014similar to that of the Colt and the locally built 380. A limited edition ES model dubbed \"Velocity\" went on sale prior to this generation being replaced. This package included VR-X grille, rear spoiler, leather/Alcantara bolstered seats, sports pedals, 15-inch alloy wheels and chrome exhaust tip\u2014all for the same price as the previous standard ES.\n\n\n==== Europe ====\nIn some European markets, the Lancer began to take the place of the Carisma in 2004. It is powered by a 1.3-liter SOHC 16-valve 4G13 engine producing 82 PS (60 kW) at 5,000 rpm and 120 N\u22c5m (89 lb\u22c5ft) of torque at 4,000 rpm. The next engine in the range is the 1.6-liter SOHC 4G18 engine producing 98 PS (72 kW) at 5,000 rpm and 150 N\u22c5m (111 lb\u22c5ft) at 4,000 rpm. Finally, there is the 2.0-liter DOHC 4G63 producing 135 PS (99 kW) at 5,750 rpm and 176 N\u22c5m (130 lb\u22c5ft) at 4,500 rpm.\n\n\n==== India ====\nIn India, it was sold under the Cedia name. In order to comply with the emissions regulations, it used a slightly detuned version of the SOHC 16-valve 4G94, having 114 bhp (85 kW) at 5250 rpm and 175 N\u22c5m (129 lb\u22c5ft) at 4250 rpm. The bore and stroke are identical to the 4G94 found on the Lancer.\n\n\n==== North America ====\nIn North America, the Lancer was introduced in 2001 for the 2002 model year as a direct replacement for the Mirage. In the United States, Chrysler had offered an unrelated Dodge Lancer at various stages between the 1950s and 1980s. However, when Daimler, who owned Chrysler at the time, briefly controlled Mitsubishi through the DaimlerChrysler-Mitsubishi alliance from 2000 through to 2004, the rights to the \"Lancer\" name were relinquished to Mitsubishi for usage in North America. Consequently, after Mitsubishi discontinued the 1995 series Mirage for North America in 2001, the replacement model adopted the Lancer name for the first time.\nNorth American Lancers were powered by a 2.0-liter 4G94 engine producing 120 hp (89 kW) and 130 lb\u22c5ft (176 N\u22c5m) of torque. In Mexico, the Lancer sedan was available in DE, ES, LS and GS trims with a 2.0-liter DOHC 4G63 engine.\n\nIn addition to the facelift, North America received three additional models to the Lancer line in 2004\u2014Lancer Ralliart, LS Sportback and Ralliart Sportback. Ralliart slots in between the base models and high-performance Evolution. These cars came equipped with Mitsubishi's 2.4-liter 4G69 engine (rated at 160 hp (119 kW)/ 162 lb\u22c5ft (220 N\u22c5m) for the Sportback, and 162 hp (121 kW)/ 162 lb\u22c5ft (220 N\u22c5m) for the Ralliart). The power gain was due to a tuned muffler for the Ralliart, and also included a new, stiffer suspension package that improved handling and lowered for Ralliart and lifted the LS Sportback by 2.9 inches. The LS Sportback had 15-inch steel or optional 15-inch alloy wheels. The Ralliart came with 16-inch alloy wheels, front bucket seats borrowed from Japan's Mitsubishi Evolution GT-A, optional fog lamps, and a new aerodynamic ground package for Ralliart. The LS Sportback and Ralliart Sportback were equipped with a four-speed INVECS-II automatic transmission, while the Ralliart came with a five-speed manual transmission with an option for the four-speed automatic.\nFor the 2005 model year, the grille was changed to include more fins to reflect a closer similarity to the North American Galant. For the 2006 model year, the fascia was changed again from a bridged fascia to one with an open vent after Mitsubishi received complaints from current owners regarding its similarity in appearance to General Motors Division Pontiac's corporate look, and to bring the appearance closer to its bigger brother, the Evolution.\nThe Lancer Sportback wagon was cancelled in the United States one year after its release, but the Mitsubishi Lancer wagon was sold in Canada for a while longer.\n\n\n== Seventh generation (2007) ==\nIn 2005, Mitsubishi revealed the \"Concept X\" model car at the Tokyo Motor Show and its \"Concept Sportback\" model at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The new Lancer was previewed by these two concepts. The new Lancer was officially revealed in January 2007 at the Detroit Motor Show and went on sale in North American markets in March 2007 as a 2008 model. New Lancer features Mitsubishi's next-generation RISE safety body.\n\n\n=== Marketing ===\n\n\n==== Asia ====\nWith the exception of the Lancer Evolution X, the Lancer is marketed as the Galant Fortis (Latin for strong, brave and resolute) in the Japanese domestic market. It comes in three trim levels: Exceed, Super Exceed, and Sport.\n\nDue to popular demand of the previous 2000-era Lancer in Singapore, it continued to be sold alongside the new 2007 era Lancer which was called \"Lancer EX\" to differentiate itself from the former for two years. The 1.5- and 2.0-liter engine sizes, and a flagship GT trim level were available in Singapore. For model year 2009, the design was refreshed all around with updated front grille, darkened clear tail lamps, and chrome lining with an additional floor console internally. The rear for the 2.0-liter variants had disc brakes for better stopping power. From 2014 models onwards, only a 1.6-liter engine was offered in Elegance and Sports trim with factory AM/FM radio, ducktail spoiler and 16\u201d black gloss 10-spoke chrome rims or 16\u201d Spaco gunmetal rims. For a limited period between 2015 and 2017, the Lancer EX had a slightly revamped rear with double rectangular \u201cC-shaped\u201d LED tail lamp clusters and had its Lancer badge positioned to the center of the boot.\nIn Malaysia, the Lancer was first launched in August 2007 with a sole variant known as GT. The Lancer was then updated in 2009 and an EX variant was launched in July 2010. In October 2010, the Sportback bodystyle was launched in October 2010. The Lancer was then updated in August 2012 and April 2014. Also, Proton had renewed cross-licensing and technology transfer agreements with Mitsubishi as of October 2008 and lead to the Proton Inspira which is a badge-engineered 2007-2017 Lancer.In Indonesia, only the GT is sold and it utilizes the 2.0-liter 4B1 engine and is sold alongside the Evolution X. The previous generation Lancer was still sold, marketed as the Cedia using the 1.8-liter 4G9 engine.\nHong Kong received its unique edition of the Lancer in 2008, dubbed the Lancer 2.0. The car comes in two trim levels, without a name for either of them. Both are equipped with the 4B11 2.0-liter engine, seven airbags, eight-speaker stereo system, adaptive front-lighting system (AFS) with HID as well as 18-inch alloy wheels. The upper trim has Ralliart style body kit which includes a revised front bumper, side skirt, rear bumper with diffuser and the addition of a correct-to-Evolution X rear spoiler, while the lower trim make do without the above-mentioned features.\nIn the Philippines, the Lancer was launched in mid-2008 as \"Lancer EX\" to differentiate from the preceding model Lancer still sold there. Initially available only with the 2.0-litre 4B11 powerplant, the preceding Lancer was phased out in 2011 and replaced with a new 1.6-litre version of the new model.\nThe top-of-the-line GT and GT-A was added into the lineup, which came in 2008. It is only available with 2.0 Litre engine, the only difference of GT that it has a rear spoiler, side skirt, 18\" alloy wheels, (5-speed manual). And GT-A, same from the GT trim, but with paddle shifters (CVT).\nIn 2011, 3 trims were available: the base GLX (5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic), no fog lights and three-beam headlights. The mid GLS is the middle variant and has fog lights, GPS navigation with touchscreen, same headlights (5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic). The high MX is the top-of-the-line variant and it has the same features as the GLS trim. The only differences being that it has HID headlights, blue LCD monitoring screen beneath the speedometer and paddle shifters (4-speed automatic). In 2010 and 2012, the GT and GLS trim was phased out.\nBetween August 2015 and August 2017, GHK Motors (Mitsubishi Brunei) had offered a version of the Lancer Sportback under the name Mitsubishi Galant in Brunei. The Galant is equipped with the 2.4-liter engine, 18-inch alloy wheels, a Ralliart style front grille, side skirts, rear spoiler, and sports front seats.\n\n\n==== Australia ====\nThe Lancer was released in Australia in October 2007, designated the CJ series and was initially available in ES, VR and VRX trims. The ES included cruise control, driver, passenger and knee airbags, stability and traction control as standard. The VR added alloy wheels, fog lights, side skirts, boot lip spoiler, rain-sensing wipers, automatic headlights, six-disc CD changer, as well as curtain and side airbags. The VRX received extra skirts including front aprons, a larger rear spoiler, 18-inch alloys, 9-speaker Rockford Fosgate sound system, keyless entry, keyless engine start, and bluetooth connectivity with voice control. All three models shared the same 4B11 2.0-litre engine and can be found with a manual gearbox or CVT. The Sportback body followed the sedan and has been available for all variants except the Aspire.\nIn July 2008, the Lancer Evolution X (officially just \"Lancer Evolution\" at the time) became available for orders in Australia.In September 2008, another variant, the Aspire, was introduced. The Aspire was based on the 2009 model VRX, which had a new 4B12 2.4-litre engine. The Aspire included more luxury features and only came with a CVT, whereas the VRX maintained a manual gearbox option.\nIn late 2008, the Ralliart variant became available. It featured a single turbocharged version of the 4B11 engine, all-wheel drive (AWD) and a twin-clutch six-speed (TC-SST) gearbox.\nIn 2010, the limited edition ACTiV was added to the lineup. The ACTiV was based on the ES and added features such as 16-inch alloy wheels, side skirts, rear spoiler, hands-free Bluetooth and multi-function leather steering wheel.\nVarious special models have also been introduced, such as the Platinum Edition, which is based on the VR but added a chrome grille, window surrounds (sedan only), MMCS satellite navigation and Bluetooth. The RX version is derived from the ES but comes with standard alloy wheels. Another model introduced in 2010 was the SX coming with factory alloys, leather steering wheel and gear shifter as well as factory spoiler.\nFrom model year 2013 onward (introduced in late 2012), the Aspire was dropped.\n\n\n==== Europe ====\nIn Europe, a diesel model was also available also from 2007 to September 2010. This was a 2.0-liter PD-TDI 103 kW (138 hp) engine sourced from Volkswagen, with engine code BWC. From September 2010, it was also available with Mitsubishi's own 1.8-liter 4N1 engine. This engine has an aluminium cylinder block, four valves per cylinder and a common rail injection system with variable geometry turbocharger and variable valve timing. It develops 85 kW (116 PS; 114 bhp) and 300 N\u22c5m (221 lb\u22c5ft).In Ireland, the specifications are different from those of models sold in the United Kingdom. The Lancer is available in five-door hatchback (Sportback) or four-door sedan body styles. Engines are the 1.5- and 1.8-liter petrols and the 2.0-liter diesel\u2014all available in the United Kingdom until 2012. Trim levels are GS2, GS3, and GS4 for the saloon, and GS2, GS3, and Juro (satellite navigation and rear-view camera) for the Sportback. The Sportback Juro model marked a temporary end to the line in the UK and was the most generously equipped. A Ralliart version (petrol), a detuned version of the Evolution, was also available. Mitsubishi intended to supply the UK with 400 further Lancers in late 2014.\n\n\n==== North America ====\nFor the United States, the Lancer was initially available in DE, ES, and GTS trim levels. DE, ES, and GTS models are powered by a GEMA based 4B11, 2.0-liter DOHC engine producing 152 hp (113 kW) (except for California models which have been detuned to 143 hp (107 kW) to meet regulations). Transmission options include a brand new F1CJA continuously variable transmission (CVT), sourced from Jatco, alongside a regular F5MBB five-speed manual sourced from Aisin Seiki. GTS models get a six-speed paddle shift version of the CVT.\nIn Canada, a fourth model (SE) was introduced to the Lancer lineup. The SE model is a cross between the ES and GTS models. Features not included in the SE model that are found in the GTS are the FAST key, automatic climate control, carbon-fiber trim pieces, leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, and 18-inch wheels.\nFor US markets, starting with the 2009 model year, an ES Sport version was released similar to the SE model for the Canadian market. Externally the ES Sport is similar in appearance to the GTS\u2014with side skirts, rear spoiler, etc. (with the exception of the wheels, the ES Sport retains the ES wheelset). The ES Sport also uses the 2.0-liter engine.For 2009, the GTS is powered by a 2.4-liter 4B12 engine producing 168 hp (125 kW) and 167 lb\u22c5ft (226 N\u22c5m).For 2012, A new trim level called SE was added. The SE model features the 2.4-liter 4B12 engine and Mitsubishi's all-wheel drive system. The SE is only available with a CVT transmission. For 2013, another trim level called GT was added. Based on the all-wheel drive SE trim level, excluding the all-wheel control system, the GT features sportier suspension, upmarket options, and an available manual transmission.\n\nThe five-door hatchback version, known as the Sportback, was introduced for the Canadian market in spring 2009, and in the US for the 2010 model year in mid-2009.A detuned and cheaper version of the Evolution X was announced at the 2008 North American International Auto Show. This model became available for purchase in the United States in October 2008.\nFor 2009, the Ralliart is available exclusively with the TC-SST transmission. The TC-SST transmission equipped in the Ralliart offers two modes (Normal, Sport) rather than the three modes the same transmission offers in the Lancer Evolution X MR (Normal, Sport, S-Sport). The car also includes a simplified version of the Evolution X's AWD system, with a simple \"mechanical limited slip\" rear differential.\n\n\n==== South America ====\nTo differentiate it from the previous model, still on sale, this model is marketed as \"Lancer Serie R\" in Chile. For the same reason, in El Salvador, depending on the engine and trim, this series is titled \"Lancer EX\" or \"Lancer GT\".\nIn Brazil, Lancer was officially sold by Mitsubishi Motors 2007-2017. Between 2015-2017 was produced in Catal\u00e3o Mitsubishi's factory. It was sold in four versions: MT, HL, HLE and GT. All versions come with the 2.0-liter 4B11 l4 engine (gasoline). The Lancer Sportback was sold until 2013 in a single version, signed by Ralliart, and the Lancer Evolution X is also sold, although not produced locally.\n\n\n=== Facelift ===\n\nIn October 2015, Mitsubishi released details of the model year 2016 Lancer facelift for North America. The MY16 update was announced and released for Australia in December 2015. It sports a mildly altered front and does without the Ralliart-style grille of the MY15 version, now with a cleaner front bumper with integrated chrome upper and lower grilles. New C-shaped LED daytime running lamps surrounding the foglights and side skirts complete the exterior changes, while the cabin gains a high-contrast instrument cluster, a new front centre console with silver and black accents, and a new colour touchscreen audio system with DAB digital radio.\n\n\n=== Discontinuation ===\nMitsubishi Motors North America's executive vice president and CEO, Don Swearingen, confirmed in January 2017 that Mitsubishi would end the Lancer's production in August 2017, without a successor. Mitsubishi's main focus was to be on crossovers and SUVs, but  production of the Mirage hatchback and the G4 sedan will continue due to ongoing popular demand for the Mirage nameplate in the North American market.\n\n\n=== Lancer Fortis / Lancer iO ===\n\nThe Lancer Fortis and Lancer iO are derivatives of the global Lancer model. Both models were developed primarily for the Taiwanese market, historically a stronghold for Mitsubishi vehicles. The Lancer Fortis and iO are locally assembled in Taiwan and China by CMC and Soueast respectively. CMC also exported the Lancer Fortis to the Middle East.The Lancer Fortis made its debut in Taiwan in August 2007. The Fortis has a unique exterior design, but its interior styling and mechanical underpinnings are largely identical to the global Lancer model. Early models of the Lancer Fortis were powered by the 157 hp (117 kW), 2.0-litre 4B11 engine paired to the INVECS-III CVT gearbox. Later variants were offered with the 143 hp (107 kW), 1.8-litre 4B10 plant, while the 2.0-litre Fortis models were discontinued by 2010.In April 2008, Mitsubishi launched the Lancer iO in Taiwan. The iO was pitched as a sportier version of the Lancer Fortis, featuring a more aggressive front grille and bumper combination. In February 2012, Mitsubishi discontinued the Fortis-based iO, and launched the global Lancer locally under the iO nameplate. The Taiwanese colloquial term for the 2012 Lancer iO and the global Lancer is 'shark head' (\u9bca\u9b5a\u982d).The Lancer Fortis made its Chinese debut at the 2013 Shanghai Motor Show. The Chinese market Lancer Fortis features a different front grille and bumper design in addition to other minor cosmetic changes. The base models are powered by the 113 hp (84 kW), 1.6-litre 4A92 engine, and the range topping variants received the 1.8-litre 4B10. The Lancer Fortis in China is positioned in between the more expensive Lancer EX and the cheaper Lancer Classic.The Taiwanese market Lancer Fortis and iO were simultaneously facelifted in May 2014. The design of the front grille and bumper combination on both models became more aggressive, while the Fortis adopted the 'shark head' design and the headlamps from the global Lancer. The rear lamps on both models were also revised, and the interior designs received minor cosmetic enhancements. The powerplant configuration for both models were refined for better fuel efficiency, but were otherwise largely unchanged. The Chinese market Lancer EX was later updated in line with the Lancer iO design.\n\n\n== Eighth generation (2017) ==\n\nIn January 2017, Mitsubishi Motors agreed to continue the Lancer nameplate in certain Asian markets including Taiwan and Mainland China after 2017, due to ongoing popular demand for the Lancer nameplate within the Chinese-speaking world. The development of the new Grand Lancer in Taiwan was led and designed by the Taiwanese China Motor Corporation (CMC). Part of the design was partnered with Pininfarina Shanghai. Due to the international version being discontinued, the new generation Lancer will be built on the same platform as the existing model as an extensive facelift. It comes with the new Mitsubishi Dynamic Shield grille and redesigned creases over the side body panels. The interior, front hood, front bumpers, front fenders, front and rear door panels including the rear passenger door window, the boot lid, and the rear bumper have been completely redesigned for the new generation, while the rest are carried over from the pre-2017 model.\n\n\n== Sales ==\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nSince 2007, the Lancer has regularly featured within the Top 10 and Top 20 vehicle sales charts. Prior to the discontinuation of Lancer production in 2017 John Signoriello, CEO of Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd, decided to stockpile as many Lancers as possible, in order to sell them in succeeding years. The following table shows sales since 2006.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMitsubishi Lancer Cargo\nMitsubishi Lancer Evolution\nMitsubishi Lancer WRC\nMitsubishi Racing Lancer\nProton Inspira\nProton Jebat\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nMitsubishi Grand Lancer website (Taiwan Mitsubishi Motors)\nMitsubishi Lancer official history from archive.org (archived 22 November 2004)",

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River.

        "wiki": "The \u014ckurayama Ski Jump Stadium (\u5927\u5009\u5c71\u30b8\u30e3\u30f3\u30d7\u7af6\u6280\u5834, \u014ckurayama Janpu Ky\u014dgij\u014d), also known as the \u014ckurayama-Schanze (\u5927\u5009\u5c71\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3\u30c4\u30a7, \u014ckurayama Shantse) is a ski jumping venue located in the Miyanomori area in Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Sapporo, Hokkaid\u014d, Japan. Owned mostly by Sapporo City, the ski jump is on the eastern slope of the Mt. Okura. The stadium has hosted a number of winter sports events including 1972 Winter Olympics and FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2007. The area of stadium consists of the Winter Sports Museum, the \u014ckurayama Crystal House, and the Mt. Okura Observation Platform, as well as the ski jump.\nThe stadium has area of 8.2 ha which houses 50,000 people at a maximum during a competition, and the ski jump is categorized as the large hill jump. The total height of the jump hill from the top starting point to the bottom of the slope is 133 metres, also the distance to the K-spot (critical point) is 120 metres.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1931, the Okurayama Ski Jump Stadium was constructed by Kishichiro Okura with an advice and financial aid of Prince Chichibu, a brother of Hirohito, and was donated to Sapporo after the completion. Another name \"\u014ckurayama-Schanze\" originated with the inauguration ceremony in 1931, when the mayor of Sapporo at that time, Masaharu Hashimoto, named the ski jump as \"\u014ckura Schanze\" after its founder. The term schanze means ski jump in German. The jump and stadium ware designed by Olaf Helset, the president of the Norwegian ski federation.The stadium was renovated with the national expenditure in 1970, which was to suit in coming 1972 Winter Olympics. After the renovation, the stadium had the K-spot at the point of 110 metres, and was capable of housing 50,000 people. At the same time, the word \"yama\" (\"the mountain\" in Japanese) was added to its name, thus the stadium was called the \"\u014ckurayama Jampu Ky\u014dgij\u014d\" (Mt. Okura Ski Jump Stadium) . For the 1972 Winter Olympics, the ski jump was the venue of 90 metres class ski jumping competition.The ski jump was remodeled many times under advice from the International Ski Federation, and the ski lift toward top of the mountain in 1982, and the distance of the K-spot was extended to 115 metres in 1986, and 120 metres in 1996.\nThe stadium has been under the jurisdiction of the government of Japan until 1995, when it was switched as a facility under the control of Sapporo. In 1998, the ski jump in the stadium was remodeled to include the Summer Hill, a ski jump which enables skiers to jump even in the summer. Also the ski lift was extended, and lighting was installed for night competitions. In 2005, the monument of the Ballad of the Rainbow and Snow, the theme song of 1972 Winter Olympics, was erected.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nThe Mt. Okura Ski Jump Stadium is one of the venues of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, and also one of the few 90 metre class jumping hills throughout the world. The maximum inclination of the Approach Slope, the area from the starting point to the take-off ramp with 101 metres, is 35 degrees, and the Landing Slope, the area drew lines of P-spot and K-spot, is 37 degrees. The P-spot was displayed by the blue line on the slope, which indicates the standard points for landing of ski jumping, while the K-spot is partitioned by the red line, and is designated as the area which gives ski jumpers additional points in the case of successful landing.\nVisitors must use the moving staircase from the parking lot to the place where the stadium is located. The \u014ckurayama Crystal House, a building which houses a souvenir shop and a restaurant, is located near the entrance, and the Winter Sports Museum is located in the other side. The construction of the museum was completed in December 1999, and opened to the public on April 22, 2000. It has 3 stories, and exhibits a number of materials related to the history of skiing, instruments, and media contents. To reach at the Mt. Okura Observation Platform located on the top of the ski jump, it is required to buy tickets to ride the lift toward the Observation Platform at the shop in front of the \u014ckurayama Crystal House. Another route, a trail leading to the platform on the side of the ski jump, is also available. The places for observation are located both in the second and third floor, and visitors enjoy the view of the entire ski jump and Sapporo city from a height of 300 metres.\n\n\n== Hill record ==\nUnofficial or absolute records are all jumps that were at that time longer than official records but set in a lower circuit competitions such as continental cup, nationals etc., not actually counting.\n\n\n== Access ==\nJR Bus: 12 minutes from Maruyama Bus Terminal (Maruyama-K\u014den Station, T\u014dzai Line) to Okurayama Kyogijo Iriguchi Bus stop, plus 10 minutes walking distance.\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMt.

          "I'm glad we took this little side adventure. Mount Moiwa offers great views of the entire city. It was windy and cold on our visit to the top, but that probably kept the crowd sizes down. Actually, there weren't many people there at all. There's a little caf\u00e9 area at the",
          "Use the circular city tram to get there. If you are romantic couple buy the padlock at midway station (or bring your own) to put on the roof thingy shown in the picture.",
          "Very simple attraction with very friendly staff. You get a nice view of the city and there is a restaurant to dine at if you want. Do it if you are bored.",
          "We visited the place on a foggy day. It wast difficult to find and there is a free shuttle bus service from the bus stop to the cable car stn (return trip too). The person selling the ropeway tickets advised us abt the poor visibility but we still bought the tickets. At the peak",
          "I didn't know night view of Mt. Moiwa is top three night scenic view in Japan. You can see 360 degrees from the peak. 1.9 milion people living city light is shining beautifully. Top of the montain is windy. You need to bring a jacket even the temperature is over 20 degrees.",
          "To avoid too many people we went to the top before sun set. Unfortunately, the weather was not with us and it was windy and raining. The shuttle bus from the tram station is relatively small so it will not be able to cope with large input of guests. The day view from the",
          "We drove and took the mini cable car up to the mt moiwa. Need to pay for parking (toll) and also for the mini cable car. We went in the afternoon, it was quite windy. Nice view of Sapporo. We rang the bell of happiness for good blessings. Should have brought a padlock to place",
          "need to take two times of cable car to reach the hill top. good panoramic view of Sapporo city. was told it\"s beautiful at night.",
          "Well worth a visit - Mt Moiwa is easy accessible via streetcar then courtesy shuttle bus to the lower Ropeway (Cablecar) station. Spectacular views over Sapporo.",
          "Me & my friends went there on January arround 8pm, we took the tram & free shuttle. When we finally on the top, the weather was soooooooooooo cold & snowy. We only there for like 5mins to saw the view and took picture, then we went back inside. Beautiful view... but not",
          "Sunset worthy spot, but however, after sunset hours, the cable car to go down will take 1-2 hours. There is a total of 2 cabins and limited pax going up and down. Be prepared to wait.",
          "Very easy to find this place, take sapporo tram street car, stop at Iriguci rope way stop,free shuttle bus waits you and take to the front gate of Ropeway station.",
          "Took a trip here at night and was able to see the whole of Sapporo spread out in front of us. Amazing sight.",
          "The reason why you should go to the top of Mt. Moiwa is that there is not really any reason why you should not. Not every city has a ropeway up a hill from which you can get a great view, but Sapporo does. So why not go up there and enjoy the view? It is very convenient to get",
          "Although it was hazy the view was stunning and well worth the trip to the top. Of course had to ring the bell for many many years of love!",
          "We were attracted by the advertisement for the beautiful night scenery from the peak (the one with the bell). The bell looks beautiful particularly at night, but we just cannot manage to take any photos with the same angle as the advertisement. What we can capture in the photo",
          "I am not sure if it's worth the 5 minute view to have to spend a good two hours round trip for that. the lines -when the weather is decent and there is actually something to see- are CRAZY. you spend 5 minutes at the top because it's amazingly cold ( I visited in May) and you",
          "Great experience ascending/descending the mountain using the cable car, beautiful view from the top, must go places when you are in Sapporo.",
          "If your time schedule allows, do not miss this tourist attraction. You can get there by tram and a free shuttle bus. Overlooking the city of Sapporo, by day or night is spectacular. Don't miss it!",
          "I always wanted to visit Sapporo, Hokkaido for their cute food and beer even though I dont drink. Some people say that they have good parks. So I prepared for parks itinerary while in Sapporo. But when I touched down Sapporo last week, I read review that Mt. Moiwa is one of best",
          "It's a must write for me on the early part of the Mt. Moiwa trip. We slighted at the station of Ropeway Iriguchi to take the free shuttle bus to the ropeway. The attendant there is more than fantastic. 10mins of waiting time he was polite and courteous and friendly. To every",
          "This place is a must see regardless of crowd. We went there in early October. Do bring warm clothes because it is cold and windy up there. We took the street car (tram) from Susukino to Ropeway Iriguchi station (170 yen). From there there is a free shuttle bus that goes to the",
          "Wasnt that easy to find the route up considering its one of the main tourist attractions. There were no signage of directions from the nearest streetcar stop (Denshajigyosho-Mae). However, once you've braved the 15 minutes trek to the ropeway building, it's a nice ride up to",
          "We visited here at night right after the sunset (I wish we could have seen the sunset). It was an incredible experience. Riding the ski lift to the top of the mountain, you could see all of Sapporo with all the buildings and lights. There is so much life in Sapporo! The first",
          "Good view of the City. We got special discounted rates by buying from tourist center office in Tanukikoji. =)",
          "Highley recomeneded, I suggest going up about 30 minutes prior to sunset. The day/night view are both spectacular.",
          "We chose this ski resort because it was close enough to our hotel in Sapporo to get a taxi there and back in a day, and because we have novice skiers with us, so we didn\u2019t need a more up market resort. The beginners slope is not as well arranged for learners as other ski fields",
          "I heard of this place through here and I just had to check it out. I went close to 9 pm this past Wednesday night, hoping there would be a smaller crowd. We made it before the last free shuttle and we were rewarded with spectacular views! I recommend a good jacket for this time",
          "You can access the peak of Mt. Moiwa by riding the ropeway and then transferring to the cable car. The ropeway that departs from Moiwa Sanroku Station travels 1,200 meters in five minutes. The ride includes the stunning view of Ishikari Bay in the distance past the cityscape,",
          "One of the rated night view of Japan was indeed beautiful, it snow heavily when I turn dark so I couldn\u2019t take much photos. Crowded with tourist, so be more careful when you are at top.",
          "Mt.Moiwa can access by street car (tram) and when arrive iruguchi station and continue with the free shutter bus to the cable car centre. On top the Mt.Moiwa we can see the whole Sapporo city view especially the night view are amazing. On top the Mountain the snow scence are",
          "This place is accessible by tram then by shuttle bus to the cable car station. Some activities available to sign up such as the Morisu Express. The cafe up at Mount Moiwa served delicious pastries. Be sure to give them a try. There is also a restaurant but it was fully",
          "Unfortunately I didn't manage to go up to this attraction. That is because I went in the middle of Febuary with the initial thought of going to see the snow festival with a few add on things. But if you do wish to go up here as I heard the view is fantastic, then please check",
          "The night view from Mt. Moiwa near Sapporo, so beautiful that it has been listed as one of the \u201cthree best night views of Hokkaido.Place for lovers.It only takes about 30 minutes from Sapporo station, and is a very important sightseeing spot.",
          "Visited here toward the end of the day and watch the sun go down. Its gorgeous to watch the lights come on over the city as the place turned dark. Seemed like Christmas in February!",
          "One of the best place to try for foreigners & locals alike. If you happen to be in sapporo city, Don't forget to include this tourist spot on your schedule. You will love the breathtaking view of the whole sapporo city from the top of this mountain. Very accessible from sapporo",
          "We visited this mountain on a cold February evening. The view was spectacular and well worth the trip, but very, very cold. You couldn't stay out long but ringing the bell gave a nice photo opportunity . Cable car was cramped ,but if you were by the window you had a good view.",
          "We took the cable car and rope car to the top of Mt Moiwa. Lots of snow but the views are incredible. Watched the 3D movie which was interesting although it was Japanese which was to be expected of course but still got the gist of it. Had an ice-cream which seems to be the norm",
          "Worth to visit while in Sapporo Nice view of Sapporo from the top of the mountain A bit cold in the evening",
          "Those going during winter may want to keep a lookout for the shuttle to the ropeway base station near the streetcar stop instead of walking because it can get really cold trekking up the hill. The views are good up there if you go on a clear day (during winter). We also saw",
          "interesting way to get up to mount moiwa. you have to take the streetcar first then hop on the shuttle bus. finally the ropeway and cable car brings you to the top of the mountain. great view but it can be cold! we went in winter. great way to spend the evening after sunset.",
          "It was snowing but the view was great. Fir direction going there local people where so friendly and very accomodating",
          "Good place in Sapporo city to enjoy the evening. Shuttle bus available in the city center connect with tram. Be sure to go with a warm coat.",
          "A spectacular view of Sapporo City from this mountain. From Susukino, take Sapporo's only streetcar line to \"Ropeway Iriguchi\" station (25 minutes, 170 yen, frequent departures). From there, a free shuttle bus operates to the lower ropeway station (5 minutes, departs every 15",
          "We went here on a lark before our flight, and were blown away by the spectacular view from the top. The mountains all around Sapporo are beautiful, but the coolest thing was seeing Ishikari Bay spread out below to the west. The map of Hokkaido felt like it had come to life in",
          "I think that it's almost a must visit in Sapporo. The view of the city is spectacular, the facilities on the top are comfortable, and the hike through the park is great (one needs basic gear to take a hike - poles and preferably - spikes, if in the winter).",
          "Amazing Night Scenery but Too Cold During Autumn/Winter. We visited during December 2017 and though this is Autumn, being on top of such a high mountain made the climb and end destination a freezing experience. We didn't stay at the lookout for too long because of the cold air",
          "Took the Ropeway going up, definitely worth the trip! You can see the whole Sapporo, plus the great view beyond Sapporo. Stayed here for about two hours, we wanted to take the trail going down back to the main lobby at street level but we weren't wearing any proper trekking",
          "The climb up the observation deck is beautiful. One can see a panoramic view! Very cild during the winter.",
          "Took the cable car ride up around 3pm and the surrounding views were amazing. The sunset & night view from the top was breathtaking! Dine at Jewels restaurant. Fine food & views!",
          "There's the ropeway to a midway station, then a cable car up. You can get tickets to just the midway station, but you can't really see much from there, and there's no dedicated viewing platform. Pay the extra amount to go all the way to the top, and you will be rewarded with a",
          "Came here on my birthday and got my cable car and driveway tix for free!!! It's easily accessible.just go to the streetcar stop and sit till Ropeway Iriguchi stop. Costs about 200jpy. Then from there walk to the shuttle bus stop. It's less than five mins walk away. The shuttle",
          "We visited Mt. Moiwa at night and the view was breathtaking. We were lucky and it was a clear night. It was cold so bundle up before you go. You can go by bus, taxi or drive.",
          "Quite a child friendly spot although taking the Sapporo tram with a stroller could be a challenge. Went on 20 Oct and the weather wasn't good to grant us a good view of the city. Nonetheless, the ride up on the cable (round trip for adult: 1700 yen) was quite well spent.",
          "This is one of the cool places of Sapporo, great view especially during night time. Lighting of the city is amazing. There is some fee's involved but it's much worth it. 360 degree view awesome.",
          "Great view with enough space for everyone to take nice photos. Suggest to help each other to take photos in the middle light structure.",
          "there was a photo taking service which provided you a doll character of the hill. It was a cold night with only 8 degree celcius in June! And there was a free shuttle bus service so it was quite convenient to go there. You can go hiking to reach there if your do not want to take",
          "Definitely a must visit spot with great views of Sapporo. I have been to this place both winter and autumn. Probably better on autumn",
          "Worth doing in the late afternoons and evenings, since it provides for a good, if not spectacular panorama of the city and its surroundings. Otherwise, it is rather unexciting, and stuck in an area where there is nothing else to do",
          "I hiked by myself in an attempt to catch the sunset view. I only saw 3 or 4 people on the whole hike and there were warning signs everywhere about bears. I was very worried as I didn't have a bear Bell but I made it! I'd advise getting a bear bell just to have a peace of mind.",
          "Sapporo Mount Moiwa This tourist destination is recommended. You may go up the peak either in the day or at night. I think the night view is even better than that of Mt Hakodate. According to the brochure, during the \u201cNightscape Summit 2015 in Kobe\u201d, Sapporo Mt Moiwa was",
          "I went hiking up Mt. Moiwa early morning from the Jiekaibyoin Mae Course Parking Lot for a moderate hike that took about one hour to complete. Once done, I emerged at the observatory on a beautiful sunny day with 360 degree views of the entire area that stretched for miles.",
          "We were lucky as we did not have to wait very long to get up Mt Moiwa (~4.30pm on weekday) and we deliberately plan to get up the Mt before dawn. Knowing the time for sunset will help you plan your trip and you will be able to see both the day & night view.",
          "Do it properly and hike up. It's not a particularly long or hard climb (an hour up at most), and makes the views at the top even better. I went up the mountain the day after I went up the JR T38 tower. and the views over the city are even better! with the bonus of being able to",
          "We visited the mountain in the evening which was a very great idea. At the first the lines were long but when we reached the summit we released why this is such a big tourist attraction. The views were magnificent. Looking over Sapporo city during the evening is definitely one",
          "Not sure if it is always so crowded but I waited 2 hours for a 10-20 mins view at the top of Mt. Moiwa. The morriscar and ropeway was packed with people. The night scenery was good but marred by the crowd. Recommend to go before sunset and stay till darkness falls for a much",
          "The view is nice but it is not easily accessible if tourists do not rent a car for the trip. Even at a summer night, it is quite cool there.",
          "Awesome view from top of mountain. You may came late at afternoonand stay until dark to have a sparkling night view. Easily access from susukino by tram. They providw love lock pad pad too.",
          "We did this on our last full day in Sapporo, a very clear and sunny day in July. We took the streetcar from Odori park and used the free shuttle. We paid the one way to go all the way to the top and walked down. The view up there was amazing. One can easily imagine how cool it",
          "Nice view over the city from top of MT Moiwa. Recommend to go there in the evening . Go there by bus and ropeway",
          "We took the cable car around sunset time and the view was great! It was the night when a number of places were having firework. A unique experience to be able to see the full moon and firework together with the Sapporo night view all at the same time!",
          "I went there in winter and I can see a lot of snow covered the mountain and city! Beautiful place for night view too.",
          "Amazing view of Sapporo at night. It can get a bit congested with tourists, but the staff are helpful at moving people along. There's free parking at the base of the ropeway, and if you're looking for something to do after dinner, I'd strongly recommend a visit.",
          "We visited Mt. Moiwa in the late afternoon with the intent of watching the transformation of the day view to the night view. Public Transportation to the Ropeway is very convenient. You just need to do a little research on how to get there. It got a bit chilly, so dress",
          "Went up to Mount Moiwa in the late afternoon. If you had been to other cities e.g. New York, frankly this view was forgettable. That said, strolling around the park / garden and doing the short trekking nearby was a nice experience.",
          "Went to Mt Moiwa on a lovely clear day. There's a free shuttle bus dropping you off at the cable car entrance near the street car stop. Then need to catch 2 separate cars to get to the top. As they charge separately for the 2 cars, you can decide not to go to the top if you",
          "A long expensive trip for a view of Sapporo from on high. Maybe we are just jaded but it did not seem worthwhile. Perhaps the restaurant would be nice when it is open on the top.",
          "Visited on a week day morning with our son who lives and works in Hokkaido. First time up Mt. Moiwa for all of us and we caught the first train at around 10ish I think. Pretty easy to find and park the car (at the time of writing this was free and is located directly opposite",

          "This is like the mountain in the backyard of Sapporo. It offers a magnificent view of the city and the surrounding mountains. You can also chose to hike up fr mid mountain. I saw someone jog up the trek. Either way you do it, we'll worth the efforts and enjoy the view. Tip:",
          "Went there during early summer, Took the cable car to go on top. View is nice but nothing much to do.. 1 visit is enough..",
          "I went here during the day and the view of the city was lovely. I can only imagine how beautiful it is at sunset. I took a street tram to the Mt Moiwa shuttle bus stop and then took the free shuttle up to the building. I thought that the tickets for the ropeway and cable car",
          "We were in Sapporo in late April and although the weather was warming up there was still a lot of snow around. Coming from a warm area in Australia it was wonderful to visit Mt Moiwa and see it covered in snow on a beautiful sunny clear day (it was still very cold in our",

          "We unfortunately went there on a cloudy day but the flip side was it was not at all crowded and we thoroughly enjoyed the feeling of being amidst clouds. The vending machine has hot cocoa and on top of Mt. Moiwa it was simply heavenly !",
          "Ascend the mount by foot to make your trip a little more memorable - that's what I did. Then descend with the ropeway after taking in the city view.",
          "Go before the sunset and return when it is totally dark. This way you will be able to see the beautiful Sapporo in the day time and enjoy its lights at night time. There is also a restaurant there with nice view so you can have a good quality time with your companions.",
          "The view is great. We went during the afternoon, so we didn't get to see the bright lights of the Sapporo landscape, which is rated as top 3 in all of Japan. We recommend a total of 1.5 hours for this trip. You may have dinner there, but the food is average. They are selling",
          "I'm going there at noon during the cloudy day, so nothing much to see. I suggest to go there at night so you can see the view better, but it depends on the weather.",

          "As the no 1 thing to do in Hokkaido, we made it a must go item even at 7pm, but after 20 mins just to get to ticketing counter on 2nd floor of the starting point, it was an ominous sign. Still we preserved. Then another 20 mins to the first tram. Then when we reached the top,",
          "Maybe my opinion is not 100% correct because when I visited there, it's raining and in the winter. The night view of the city was not that good compared to HK.",
          "Was there previous night but it was already closed by around 9:15pm. Hence went again the morning and it was great view from there.",
          "Nice place to go to get a good view of Sapporo and some of the surrounding mountains. Doesn't hope until 10:30 in the morning. A visit in the evening would probably be better.",
          "Definitely recommend this hike while in Sapporo. Took us about an hour to go up; slow and steady with no stops. The same going back down. The views at the top were fabulous. Could see the Sea of Japan from the top, and heaps of snow capped peaks in the distance. The trailhead",

          "After a beautiful sunny day in Sapporo the rain set in but with high hopes we caught the streetcar to Mt Moiwa ropeway and a few metres to the left the free shuttle bus was waiting to take passengers up to the ropeway. Disappointingly the clouds had rolled in and there was zero",
          "A good place to go for a great view of Sapporo. We went here in the morning and we regret that we didn't go here at night. Transportation going there is easy - just ride the streetcar.",
          "I wanted to run up there, but in april, on the north face you need more than just sneakers Still you can walk to the bhuddist temple 15 min upwards The 1700 yen are worth the view and at night even better",
          "Went up the Mt. Moiwa by Bus. The night view of Sapporo city is breathtaking. You won't able to capture nice pictures unless with DSLR camera. The is love bell lighted up. I did que up to take picture but not sure the significant of its :)",
          "Mt. Moiwa was neat during the day, but I wish we would have went at night to see the monument lit up and the city lights. The funicular ride to the top was fun. You can take a bus from near where the city bus drops you off, but we just walked.",
          "Beautiful scenery on the way to the top by ropeway.. Night view of the city so beautiful... If possible, go up before sunset so can have 2 different views of Mt. Moiwa",
          "Nice view from the top. Mt Hakodate was too far away so we opted to go Mt moiwa & we were not disappointed. The ticketing staff asked if we have the discount coupon for tickets but we didn't have so we paid the full price. It got very windy & cold in the late afternoon and the",
          "Definitely worth a visit, we went up at about 18:00 in April, just as the sun was setting. It looked amazing. Its a bit expensive 1700yen for a round trip to the very top, but if you have booked via JTB, you might get a pamphlet full of discount tickets, as we did. With the jtb",
          "Cool place to stop by on an evening in Sapporo. Beautiful view of the landscape, and there's a nice coffee shop and restaurant at the summit.",
          "Took Mt. Moiwa ropeway. It was snowing that day.. You can see the whole city of Sapporo from the peak level..",
          "This is definitely worth the cost of admission. The views are spectacular. Be sure to arrive in time for sunset and stick around to see the city light up. Warm up at the visitor center with a beer or hot chocolate.",
          "It is a second attempt for us to go this place. On the first night, we tried to use google map to search Mt. Moiwa and it guided us to go by the expressway (toll road), unfortunately it is blocked till the week after we visit there. The next night we drive to the ropeway",
          "Worth the trip for the views alone. The beginning of the ropeway is easy to get to from the centre of the city via the Ropeway Iriguchi streetcar stop and the ropeway itself runs every 15 minutes. You get a short talk pointing out famous landmarks on the way up (Japanese only",

          "Went without a reservation for dinner. Nonetheless, the small take out counter settled dinner but it's only sandwich and hot drinks. The view is great and kids had some fun in a snowball battle the same evening. Take the full ride all the way up. Usual price is JPY1.7k but",
          "About 30 minute by the streetcar and another 15 minutes to entrance. Signage not too good after streetcar. Interesting ride on ropeway, cable car to tower. Beautiful view and restaurant offers decent food for very reasonable price. Sledge carriage is an experience too as it",
          "It's fabulous up there! I visited there @winter time. Everything was white and so peaceful. The nature surrounding... Allt to explore. I remembered running and lying on the snow. Unforgettable memories. There's a red cart u can drive on (I forgot the fee). It's fun cart.. Must",
          "Wonderful view during the night, especially during cold winter night but please wear thick layers of clothes!",
          "Got lost going to the place as the bus driver did not drop us at the right stop. But when we reached the peak of Mt Moiwa and had our tons of pictures taken, the exhaustian disappeared. The place reminded me of my Switzerland (Zermat trip).",
          "This viewing deck may not be within central Sapporo, but going here is worth it. The experience going up the mountain via ropeway and tramway is already relaxing and enjoyable. Once you reach the top, you can see Sapporo city from a bird's eye view. This is a must especially",
          "Visited Mt. Moiwa in the winter while in Sapporo for the Snow Festival. Very easy access taking the city's only street car and then the free shuttle bus to the cable car station. As roads can be quite icy, it is highly recommended to take the shuttle bus during the winter than",
          "Can't compare with other seasons but its really cold in Winter. Catch the ropeway for JPN1700. Midstation for the shop and the top station for the views and 3D movie. Its really beautiful with the whole Sapporo City blanketed with snow. Nothing much on the top though except",
          "Went up Mt Moiwa in February 2017. It is freaking cold. However, there are still some Japanese oldies who came up the hiking trail. I respect these people. Not much activities up at the mountain other than observing the city. It would be a nice place to see the city at night but",
          "The ropeway and cable car rides provides a teaser to the panoramic views of Sapporo. I think the SnowFestival gives the traveller amazing views of the city of lights. Mt Moiwa has a restaurant and a cafe where you can just sip on your hot drink, eat and relax and be simply",

          "Mt Moiwa (Moiwayama) is right inside Sapporo with two lifts, hiking trails, skiing, and neat views of the whole city. How to get there: from the central city, take a streetcar to the Ropeway station. You can walk about 600m to the entrance - turn left when you see the sign",
          "Great place to view the city and surroundings. But in winter everything is grey and white.Take the tram or street car to a stop called Ropeway Iruguchi. Once you get off at the stop around 100-150 meters is the shuttle bus that will take you to the base of the cable car station",
          "It is best to hop on a streetcar and get off at Ropeway Iriguchi stop for 170 yen (one way). You may purchase a one day pass (Dosanko Pass 310Y) for the streetcar if you are travelling during weekend or holidays for unlimited ride for a day. From Ropeway Irigiuchi, the free",
          "It's quite pricey to get up there just to get a night view. Out of curiosity we did that but we won't do that again unlike the hilltop night view form Mt Hakodate which is much more amazing. We got there by street car follow by a free transfer by bus then cable car to the hill",
          "The best view would be going down the ropeway during sunset where you can have the panoramic of Sapporo city. A must place to visit when in Hokkaido. We just loved the winter view. The kids definitely enjoyed the ropeway rides.",
          "Get on the streetcar and alight at the Ropeway iriguchi stop. Hint: you can get on at any station as the streetcar goes in a loop, 170 yen flat rate. There's a discount coupon in the streetcar (right behind the driver seat) which entitles you to 1500 yen ticket instead of",
          "It is indeed cold once you get up there but the clear views of the city down below distracts you from the cold for a few minutes. After dark it was difficult to see the beauty of the mountains just behind the city views but I reckon at daytime it will be stunning. Night views",
          "We went there in winter and the whole place was covered with thick snow. As it was snowing very heavily on the day we went, we actually couldn't see any view. But the place just looked so romantic in snow.",
          "A good short day trip for a fantastic view of the city . In winter, views maybe covered by bad weather, but a nice restaurant to enjoy lunch or coffee with your love ones is nice. Getting there is easy, take the tram car and get on to the free shuttle.",
          "It was a nice ride up in a ropeway ( Cable car) and tram ( finnicular). The views are fantastic of snowed over mountains and Sapporo! You can trek down on a snowed over path if you are up to it. Cold at wintertime up there.",
          "I went on a friday night to see the city views and was easy to get to from Susukino, I used the streetcar and free shuttle. The views are really great but its very cold in January and be sure to wear warm clothes for the ride up and to spend a decent amount of time outside",

          "Free shuttle every 30 minutes to the main entrance. Otherwise 15 minutes walk uphill. \u00a51,600 return ticket for cable car to the mountain top. There is a souvenir shop, vending machine, restaurant and a kiosk.",
          "Worth a visit to view Sapporo from top. The only dissapoint aspect is the cabel car. They put as many people posibble in the cabel car. Saw 1 old lady fall from the cabel car.",
          "The location offers a good view of the city. Either during the day where you see all of sapporo or in the evening when the city lights are on. you pay for the ticket (inclusive of the cable car rides) to go to the top. A good place to spend an hour.",
          "Went to mount Moiwa is really worth the trip. Our family enjoyed the cool weather of Sapporo. Highly recommended for family traveling together. Getting to the area is easy, take the street car either at Odori or Susukino then drop off at the ropeway station then there is a free",
          "This is my second time to Sapporo but my first to Mt Moiwa. Breathtaking views!! It's also very easy to access from Susukino. Definitely worth the visit!",
          "I have been to mount Moiwa for few times, either solo or recommend to my friends. The scene on the observatory of Mount Moiwa is amazing in every season. You will see green during summer, yellow/red during summer, or white landscape during winter. However, the most important is",
          "Took a tram and alighted at the ropeway stop. There is a shuttle bus nearby just behind one of the tram stop. The intervals are about 15 mins between each trip. View from the top of the mountain is beautiful . You can see the city and the mountains in the background. There is",
          "This place is definitely worth going. The view from the top was amazing, the view while riding the cable car up was equally breathtaking. My siblings and I had a great time having snow fights and building snowmen there, hiking trails were also available for those who are more",
          "Reminds me of The Peak in Hong Kong. An accessible mountain in a city. Buy the tickets up to the top and enjoy the view of Sapporo city. Can be done in an hour if there's no crowd.",
          "The ropeway is a great way to have a view of the city - the view from the top is quite lovely, and they have a small couples activity at the top (you ring a bell...). There is a stop midway, where you change cars, where there is a souvenir shop, and access to the outside. There",
          "The views from the top are second to none of the Sapporo area and beyond. You can catch the local bus right to the door. Take bus #11 from Maruyama Koen, which is a stop on the Tozai line subway. It was \u00a51700 each to the top. There is a stop halfway up where you change cableway.",
          "2 stage ropeway, beautiful view of Sapporo up there, it's very cold even in October, not far from Center of Sapporo",
          "My trip to Mount Moiwa was a memorable one! The cable car station was easily accessible and the going up the mount via the cable car followed by the tram was an adventure in its own right. Do note that due to it altitude, the outdoor viewing platform tends to be very windy and",
          "Convenient ride by Tram and shuttle up and experience two type of 'lifts' up the mountain top. Feel the air and love, Also wait til its darker and have a night view of the spectacular city and you tell me what you think !..... Remember to lock your love away too.",
          "We went up the Mt. Moiwa ropeway all the way up to the observatory. Really easy to get to and a fast trip. It was pretty cold though so you don't want to spend too much time out on the deck. Beautiful views at night, but I think I might've preferred to see it in the daytime.",
          "This is the right place if you want to see the Sapporo city view. To reach the place, you need to take a street car to Ropeway Iriguchi station. From there, you can either walk to the base station or take a shuttle bus (which is running every 15 minutes). At the base station,",
          "How to reach Mt. Moiwa observation. The best way to get Mt. Moiwa is to use city tram loop.

          "I visited in late October when the Mt Moiwa Ropeway was closed. Thanks to that I could experience my visit there in complete solitude. Beautiful park covers the slopes of the mountain, and this time of the year the autumn colours were at their peak. Nice place for a relaxing",
          "We visited during Autumn weather meaning just a jacket was sufficient for a nice walk. There is a restaurant but take a picnic and have lunch on the grass at the top. Also if you intend to lock a padlock on the gate at the top and ring the bell... Buy one from the town first as",
          "Its been done up since I last went up but the new setup is much nicer. The view of Sapporo is one of the best probably besides Mt Teine.",
          "This was a very good attraction, where you go up on a cable car then a morris car to get to the lookout at the very top. It is very easy to get here by taking the monorail, then you walk to the right and get the free shuttle to the base of the cable car. Once there you can go",
          "Drove here from Sapporo, about 15-20mins drive. Plenty of parking. If you have the discount coupons (check with your hotel or look around in JR stations or in the airport when you arrive), it is a little cheaper. Do bring a jacket as it gets chilly and there are some strong",

          "On our last day in Sapporo, we went to Mt Moiwa. Unfortunately, it was rainy and did not get much view of the area. From the photo gallery, we saw what we missed out on. There was some 3D sessions on Sapporo which was quite good, just that they were all in Japanese.",
          "We went to Mt. Moiwa for the night view of Sapporo. It was quite nice but was very crowded (I think it was a public holiday at the time). I believe there is a free shuttle from downtown Sapporo that takes you to the cable car station at the bottom of the mountain. We travelled",
          "I personally like the whole concept of reaching the mountain top observatory with a cable car. The view from the top was just unbelievably stunning. As we reached the top at around 8PM, the lights that decorate Sapporo just looked fantastic. Practically everyone in the cable car",
          "It's the panoramic place of the city. It's nice during the sunset, however is not a fantastic view; there aren't particular things to see, just the city, lights... Expensive",

          "Was a nice surprise to find snow on Mt Moiwa in mid april which was in itself lovely. Being low season - not many people there so it was tranquil too. When up there, we found out we could walk down and the road down ends at the bottom cable car station. We didn't do that",
          "Went here as part of a tour package. They only gave us about 30-45 mins to explore the area. I wish I could have stayed longer. This place is very romantic. The view is spectacular! This is perhaps one of the most memorable places I've gone to. I went there in Winter and there",
          "We visited late at night, riding the two cable cars to the top. It was a cold, clear night and the views of the shining city lights were wonderful. It was also almost empty as we were there just a short while before the last cable cars. The mascot of the mountain was also",

          "Went there before sunset to see both the day and night view ! The rope way and gondola rides were excellent. The night view is one of the 3 best night view in Hokkaido, together with Hakodate and Otaru. A bit windy up there, do bring a light jacket.",
          "Definitely worth a visit! Amazing 360 views of the city. We went after dark so the city looked especially stunning. Also great for seeing how the city is laid out early on in your trip so it makes it easier to navigate your way around during your trip. The last cable car down",
          "Despite some intense heat and humidity, this was a very enjoyable half day trip. Getting to Mt. Moiwa is very easy with the street cars. From the street car stop, it is a 400m walk to the rope way or there is a shuttle bus across the street that can take you right to the door. I",

          "We drove to this location instead of taking the ropeway/cable car. JPY660 per entry that brings you to the cable car station. From there its a short hike up to the top. Much has been said of Mt Moiwa...views from all ends simply breath-taking. Great attraction.",
          "We have not heard about Mount Moiwa before. We were introduced to it by a helpful staff at the Sapporo Tourist Information Center at JR Sapporo Station. This was where we gathered most of the travelling details about Hokkaido's tourist attractions. To Mt Moiwa, we took a",
          "I wouldn't call this a must-see attraction, but if you want a great view of Sapporo and the surrounding snow-capped mountains it is well worth a visit. We went during the week and only saw four other people the entire time we were there. Only two people went up on the ropeway",

          "Very picturesque, costs 1700 yen round trip per person to the summit. We took the subway to Susukino, then transferred to the streetcar/tram above ground, and stopped at the ropeway station. There, a block away, was a free shuttle to the bottom of Mount Moiwa. We went at 9pm and",
          "Went there at 7.00pm right after dinner during March, the weather is still cold with occasional showers. Had to go up by tram. Went we reach the top of the observatory, the view was completely spoilt due to the cold weather and there was a blizzard which clouded all the lights",
          "Great for taking in the view of the city. Worth going all the way to the top and seeing the lookout. Reasonable value for money",
          "I went up there on a whim after my summer course after researching it briefly on the internet. The night view is brilliant but the crowd is a bit too much to bear for me. A lot of local and international tourist taking photographs so one might need to squeeze right to the front",

          "Recheable by tram and a free shuttle. Nice view of the city from the top and on the way up. But probably not worth the 1700 yen to go up. Better to go to the ski jump observatory instead.",
          "From Mt Moiwa, you can enjoy the beautiful view / scenary of Sapporo city. Highly recommended. Worth the money and effort to reach there. The view is breathtaking! From Sapporo main station, I walked to Odori (near Odori Park) to get to the Nishi Yon Chome street car / tramp",
          "You take the street car at the suskino side of town, pay 170 yen and get off at the iriguchi stop. Cross the street and you'll see the free shuttle bus stop which leaves for the rope way station every fifteen minutes. Or you can just walk up, it should take you five minutes. The",

        "wiki": "Sapporo Dome (\u672d\u5e4c\u30c9\u30fc\u30e0, Sapporo D\u014dmu) is a stadium located in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, and is primarily used for baseball and association football. It is the home field of the baseball team Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters and the association football club Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo. It is one of the planned football venues for the 2020 Summer Olympics, was the venue for the opening ceremony of the 2017 Asian Winter Games, and was used for 2 matches of the 2019 Rugby World Cup. The stadium was previously a venue of the 2002 FIFA World Cup.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSapporo Dome opened in 2001 with 41,580 seats.  This stadium hosted 3 games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup, Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador; all three matches were in the first round.\nThe Dome hosted the opening ceremonies to the 2007 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships on February 22 and hosted the closing ceremonies of the championships on March 4. It also made history as being the first venue where both indoor and nighttime skiing events took place for the first time on a world championship or Winter Olympic Games level with competitions in the cross country skiing sprints (men's and women's individual, and men's and women's team) and the cross country portion of the 7.5 km sprint event in the nordic combined. In order to generate snow, the stadium used its turf conversion hovering system to facilitate the snow making process for the skiing competitions. The opening ceremony featured Maki Ohguro, a local artist from Sapporo, Japanese drum demonstrations and other performances paying tributes to local customs and traditions. For the championships, seating capacity was reduced to 30,000.The Dome was used as a super special stage in Rally Japan in both 2008 and 2010.\nIn late 2009, renovations with the possibility of increasing the capacity up to 53,796 were finished. These renovations also included space for more food outlets, an extra video screen, two extra changing rooms (to accommodate preseason matches in the NFL International Series, which have up to 75 players per team) and further media area as part of new office buildings attached to the stadium. As part of these renovations, the surface area of the arena itself was decreased to allow for more seating.\n\n\n== Retractable surface ==\nThe Dome switches between two entirely different surfaces: Baseball games are played on an underlying artificial turf field, while football games are held on a grass pitch that slides into and out of the stadium as needed.\nConversion from baseball to football begins with the storage of the baseball field's artificial turf.  Once finished, a set of lower bowl bleachers rotate from an angled position for baseball to a parallel position.  A set of main bowl seats on one end of the dome then retracts, and the football pitch is slid into the stadium.  The lower bowl is then rotated 90 degrees.  Conversion from football to baseball occurs in reverse. Due to the retraction of seats, the Stadium has a capacity of 40,476 for baseball games.\nOther stadiums that feature sliding pitches include the GelreDome in the Netherlands, Veltins-Arena in Germany, the split pitch of London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona, United States; however, unlike these four facilities, the Sapporo Dome has a fixed roof.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Details ==\nName: Sapporo Dome\nCapacity: 41,484 / 40,476\nHome Teams: Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo, Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters\nCompleted: March 2001\nLocation: Sapporo City, Hokkaido, Japan\nBuilding Area: 53,800 m\u00b2 Total Floor Area:(Open Arena) 92,453 m\u00b2\nRoof Diameter: 245 m Stand Inclination: Max. 30\u00b0 angle\nArchitect: Hiroshi Hara\n\n\n== Access ==\nT\u014dh\u014d Line: 10 minutes walk from Fukuzumi Station.\n\n\n== Major sports matches ==\n\n\n=== 2002 FIFA World Cup ===\n\n\n=== 2019 Rugby World Cup ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nOther domed stadiums in Japan:\n\nFukuoka Yahoo!

        "wiki": "Sapporo (\u672d\u5e4c\u5e02, Sapporo-shi) is the fifth largest city in Japan, and the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. It is the capital city of Hokkaido Prefecture and its Ishikari Subprefecture, and numbers among the nation's ordinance-designated city. Sapporo lies in the southwest of Hokkaido, within the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, which is a tributary stream of the Ishikari. Sapporo is considered the cultural, economical, and political center of Hokkaido.  \nAs with most of Hokkaido, the Sapporo area was settled by the indigenous Ainu people, beginning over 15,000 years ago. Starting in the late 19th century, Sapporo saw increasing settlement by Japanese migrants. Sapporo hosted the 1972 Winter Olympics, the first Winter Olympics ever held in Asia, and the second Olympic games held in Japan after the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Sapporo Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup and two games during the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe annual Sapporo Snow Festival draws more than 2 million tourists from abroad. Other notable sites include the Sapporo Beer Museum, which is the only beer museum in Japan, and the Sapporo TV Tower located in Odori Park. It is home to Hokkaido University, just north of Sapporo Station. The city is served by Okadama Airport, and New Chitose Airport in nearby Chitose. \n\n\n== Etymology ==\nSapporo's name was taken from Ainuic \"sat poro pet\" (\u30b5\u30c3\u30fb\u30dd\u30ed\u30fb\u30da\u30c3), which can be translated as the \"dry, great river\", a reference to the Toyohira River.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nBefore its establishment, the area occupied by Sapporo (known as the Ishikari Plain) was home to a number of indigenous Ainu settlements. In 1866, at the end of the Edo period, construction began on a canal through the area, encouraging a number of early settlers to establish Sapporo village.In 1868, the officially recognized year celebrated as the \"birth\" of Sapporo, the new Meiji government concluded that the existing administrative center of Hokkaido, which at the time was the port of Hakodate, was in an unsuitable location for defense and further development of the island. As a result, it was determined that a new capital on the Ishikari Plain should be established. The plain itself provided an unusually large expanse of flat, well drained land which is relatively uncommon in the otherwise mountainous geography of Hokkaido.\nDuring 1870\u20131871, Kuroda Kiyotaka, vice-chairman of the Hokkaido Development Commission (Kaitaku-shi), approached the American government for assistance in developing the land. As a result, Horace Capron, Secretary of Agriculture under President Ulysses S. Grant, became an oyatoi gaikokujin and was appointed as a special advisor to the commission. Construction began around Odori Park, which still remains as a green ribbon of recreational land bisecting the central area of the city. The city closely followed a grid plan with streets at right-angles to form city blocks.\nThe continuing expansion of the Japanese into Hokkaido continued, mainly due to migration from the main island of Honshu immediately to the south, and the prosperity of Hokkaido and particularly its capital grew to the point that the Development Commission was deemed unnecessary and was abolished in 1882.\nEdwin Dun came to Sapporo to establish sheep and cattle ranches in 1876. He also demonstrated pig raising and the making of butter, cheese, ham and sausage. He was married twice, to Japanese women. He once went back to the US in 1883 but returned to Japan as a secretary of government.\nWilliam S. Clark, who was the president of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst), came to be the founding vice-president of the Sapporo Agricultural College (now Hokkaido University) for only eight months from 1876 to 1877. He taught academic subjects in science and lectured on the Bible as an \"ethics\" course, introducing Christian principles to the first entering class of the College.\nIn 1880, the entire area of Sapporo was renamed as \"Sapporo-ku\" (Sapporo Ward), and a railroad between Sapporo and Temiya, Otaru was laid. That year the H\u014dheikan, a hotel and reception facility for visiting officials and dignitaries, was erected adjacent to the Odori Park. It was later moved to Nakajima Park where it remains today. Two years later, with the abolition of the Kaitaku-shi, Hokkaid\u014d was divided into three prefectures: Hakodate, Sapporo, and Nemuro. The name of the urban district in Sapporo remained Sapporo-ku, while the rest of the area in Sapporo-ku was changed to Sapporo-gun. The office building of Sapporo-ku was also located in the urban district.Sapporo, Hakodate, and Nemuro Prefectures were abolished in 1886, and Hokkaid\u014d government office building, an American-neo-baroque-style structure with red bricks, constructed in 1888. The last squad of the Tondenhei, the soldiers pioneering Hokkaido, settled in the place where the area of Tonden in Kita-ku, Sapporo is currently located. Sapporo-ku administered surrounding Sapporo-gun until 1899, when the new district system was announced. After that year, Sapporo-ku was away from the control of Sapporo-gun. The \"ku\" (district) enforced from 1899 was an autonomy which was a little bigger than towns, and smaller than cities. In Hokkaido at that time, Hakodate-ku and Otaru-ku also existed.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nIn 1907, the Tohoku Imperial University was established in Sendai Miyagi Prefecture, and Sapporo Agricultural College was controlled by the University. Parts of neighbouring villages including Sapporo Village, Naebo Village, Kami Shiroishi Village, and districts where the Tonden-hei had settled, were integrated into Sapporo-ku in 1910.\nThe Sapporo Streetcar was opened in 1918, and Hokkaido Imperial University was established in Sapporo-ku, as the fifth Imperial University in Japan. Another railroad operated in Sapporo, the J\u014dzankei Railroad, which was ultimately abolished in 1969.\nIn 1922, the new city system was announced by the Tokyo government, and Sapporo-ku was officially changed to Sapporo City. The Sapporo Municipal Bus System was started in 1930. In 1937, Sapporo was chosen as the site of the 1940 Winter Olympics, but due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, this was cancelled the next year. Maruyama Town was integrated as a part of Ch\u016b\u014d-ku in 1940, and the Okadama Airport was constructed in 1942.\nThe first Sapporo Snow Festival was held in 1950. In the same year, adjacent Shiroishi Village was integrated into Sapporo City, rendered as a part of Shiroishi-ku, and Atsubetsu-ku. In 1955, Kotoni Town, the entire Sapporo Village, and Shinoro Village were merged into Sapporo, becoming a part of the current Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Kita-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Teine-ku. The expansion of Sapporo continued, with the merger of Toyohira Town in 1961, and Teine Town in 1967, each becoming a part of Toyohira-ku, Kiyota-ku, and Teine-ku.The ceremony commemorating the 100th anniversary of the foundation of Sapporo and Hokkaido was held in 1968. The Sapporo Municipal Subway system was inaugurated in 1971, which made Sapporo the fourth city in Japan to have a subway system. From February 3 to 13, 1972, the 1972 Winter Olympics were held, the first Winter Olympics held in Asia. On April 1 of the same year, Sapporo was designated as one of the cities designated by government ordinance, and seven wards were established. The last ever public performance by the opera singer, Maria Callas, was in Sapporo at the Hokkaido Koseinenkin Kaikan on 11 November 1974. The Sapporo Municipal Subway was expanded when the T\u014dzai line started operation in 1976, and the T\u014dh\u014d line was opened in 1988. In 1989, Atsubetsu-ku and Teine-ku were separated from Shiroishi-ku and Nishi-ku. Annual events in Sapporo were started, such as the Pacific Music Festival in 1990, and Yosakoi S\u014dran Festival in 1992. A professional football club, Consadole Sapporo, was established in 1996. In 1997, Kiyota-ku was separated from Toyohira-ku. In the same year, Hokkaid\u014d Takushoku Bank, a Hokkaido-based bank with headquarters in Odori, went bankrupt.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2001 the construction of the Sapporo Dome was completed, and in 2002 the Dome hosted three games during the 2002 FIFA World Cup; Germany vs Saudi Arabia, Argentina vs England and Italy vs Ecuador, all of which were in the first round. Fumio Ueda, was elected as Sapporo mayor for the first time in 2003. Sapporo became the home to a Nippon Professional Baseball team, Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, in 2004, which won the 2006 Japan Series, and the victory parade was held on Ekimae-D\u014dri (a street in front of Sapporo Station) in February 2007.\nThe 34th G8 summit took place in T\u014dyako in 2008, and a number of people including anti-globalisation activists marched in the heart of the city to protest. Police officers were gathered in Sapporo from all over Japan, and the news reported that four people were arrested in the demonstrations.The Hokkaid\u014d Shinkansen line, which currently connects Honshu to Hakodate through the Seikan Tunnel, is planned to link to Sapporo by 2030.\nGallery\n\t\t\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSapporo is a city located in the southwest part of Ishikari Plain and the alluvial fan of the Toyohira River, a tributary stream of the Ishikari River. It is part of Ishikari Subprefecture. Roadways in the urban district are laid to make a grid plan. The western and southern parts of Sapporo are occupied by a number of mountains including Mount Teine, Maruyama, and Mount Moiwa, as well as many rivers including the Ishikari River, Toyohira River, and S\u014dsei River.

Sapporo is one of few metropolises in the world with such heavy snowfall, enabling it to hold events and festivals with snow statues.

          "This place definitely isn\u2019t what we expected. On entry there is 3 large turtles in a tiny pool. One of them didn\u2019t move the whole time and another kept banging up against the wall. The dolphins were kept in what looked like a standard pool. They kept swimming fast in circles.",

          "I hope we could spend more time here, but it closed one hour earlier in winter. We were able to see seal feeding, penguin waling, and dolphin show. They were awesome! You got to see these amazing animals very closely. Plan at least 3 hours here and you won't regret.",

They have many animal shows you can watch here. They have a Pelican walk too. Dolphin show and seal feeding... I would",
          "I was enthralled to my first ever Walrus. What a magnificent beast. The park is very old but they've held it together well. The semi natural pools for the seals down the hill in the rocks in the same place as the Walruses as well you'll find penguins and kids fishing games.",

          "We as adults, aquarium and zoo are something like \"ohh poor animals in these small cages...\" but for kids they are just a fantastic place to explore live animals. Otaru Aquarium was great as well. Dolphin and Sea lion shows were well worth watching. I can see the aquarium is",
          "My friend wanted to go to the aquarium so we went to visit. It was suprisingly interesting with the various aquatic life from the Hokkaido seas on display. The animal shows were fun: the seal feeding, dolphin show, and penguin walk. The light house is nearby and there is a good",

The list includes all types of railways, such as handcars, horsecars, trams, light railways, heavy rails, freight rails, industrial railways, monorails, new transit systems, or funiculars.  Some companies are still active in other businesses, such as bus operation.  Translated names might be tentative.  \"Former names\" include those of preceding operators not directly related to their successors.\nThe list omits these types of operators:\n\nType 1: Direct predecessor of surviving railway operator. (e.g. Meguro Kamata Electric Railway, the current Tokyu Corporation.)\nType 2: Operator with lines largely succeeded by surviving railway operator. (e.g. Kaetsun\u014d Railway, whose lines succeeded by Many\u014dsen.)\nType 3: Operator that was merged by surviving railway operator, Type 1, or Type 2. (e.g. Sany\u014d Railway, later merged into Japanese National Railways, which was later succeeded by Japan Railways Group Companies.)\nType 4: Planned line that was never built.\n\n\n== Hokkaid\u014d ==\n\nAbashiri K\u014dts\u016b \u7db2\u8d70\u4ea4\u901a\nFormerly called Higashi-Mokoto Transportation \u6771\u85fb\u7434\u4ea4\u901a.

          "It was a good thing we stayed very near else a trip here might have been a wasted effort to come as only 1 trail was opened with the rest I\u2019m guessing iced up. Even the trail that was open was quite inaccessible unless you wear spikes on your shoes. It would have been more",
          "This area has a parking lot at the entrance and you can walk the easy way or the longer route. If you are lazy, the moment you enter, they have multiple viewing spots that are just there. This place is suitable for old people as well. It's free entrance but you gotta pay for",
          "Did a quick photo stop here but didn't think it was worth spending more than an hour unless you are keen to trek around hell valley. A convenient break point between Sapporo and Lake Toya if you are not planning to stay overnight in Noboribetsu.",
          "We visited in December at dusk - the cold air and snow on the ground gave the area a wonderful atmospheric feel. The steps that lead down to the valley were, however, quite icy and treacherous on the day we were there. I would have thought the local tourist promotion body would",
          "Nice scenery. Pathway is slippery during winter. Walk with caution. Many hiking routes are close during winter.",
          "A slow long walk along the valley is so rejuvinating. Beware of the slippery icy footpath during winter season.",
          "There was a slight snow fall when we were here. The valley was partially covered in snow and it was quite a breathtaking sight! Took a lot of pics and enjoyed the walk thoroughly!",
          "A nice place to spend an hour or so. Too bad the footpath was closed when we visited. We are on the way when someone told us that it was not opened. Nice place to take some photos.",
          "It definitely looks like a vision of \"hell on earth\" with the sulfur smells and the steam rising from the ground. There's even a bubbling tar pit-like part of the park. Most people will simply go to the geyser areas, but the entire park is worth a walk around if visitors are",
          "This place is well signed and you will not get lost. There are a few trails here and each one of them takes about 10-15mins to complete. If you hike on all the trails, it will roughly take you 40mins one way to complete. Give yourselves a good 2 hours here if you intend to take",
          "I enjoyed visiting geothermal sightseeing spot that oozes slight smell of sulphur. We parked our car near the Noboribetsu gateway centre. Costs is 500Y and you can park in another car park nearby on the same day. At the gateway centre, adults and children can borrow walking",
          "Hot sulphurous steam vents in the valley create a mystical view of the area. Good walking trails through the forest to other spots, 20 to 30 minutes, you will get to Oyunuma, a sulfurous pond with a surface temperature of 50C and a smaller, even hotter, mud pond nearby. Flowing",
          "This place doesn't need any further explanation as many reviews are out there. Hell Valley it is called for its heat that came out from the burning ground and the overall landscape of smokes like hell. Pretty interesting place to visit with some nice spots. A lot of walking is",

          "Jigokudani or Hell Valley is right outside Noboribetsu and can be accessed very easily on foot from the town (5 min from the centre). It is well indicated just follow the signs or the tourists! It offers great views of the smoking hot pools. You can easily walk for 1 to 2 hours",
          "I went to Jigokudani with my parents for sightseeing as it\u2019s one of the famous spots here. The air is so fresh, not much tourists visit in this season as it\u2019s quite cold. When we walked up to the upper area, we felt a tranquil atmosphere. One important point I have to mention",
          "Jigokudani lies along the fabled \"Ring of Fire\" - it is one of several areas of intense volcanic activity. You get to see the 1,476 foot crater and surrounding fumaroles and mineral springs. The walks are fairly easy and the area is well worth exploring.",
          "A must visit if you come to Noboribetsu area. There are several short trails, easy walk to the lookouts. Their sulfer hot springs are amazing and appealing to look at. For tourists or those who have limited time, 1-2 hours would be sufficient to explore the major areas. However",
          "Great views and nice trails. I recommend hiking up to the foot baths and Oyunuma pond. It\u2019s not very far and worth the effort.",
          "Good facilities and signage. The park was cleaner earlier in the day and later, it was dirtier after buses of tourists came.",

          "Sulphur smell permeates the surroundings but worth a look see on this natural phenomenon. Crowded with tourists",
          "Overall, I think it is worthwhile to make a trip to visit this place. This was my experience to get to this place: a) Take a JR train from Sapporo Station to Noboribetsu Station. The duration is 1 hour 15 mins/way and it costs 4480 Yen/way. b) Once you've reached Noboribetsu",

          "The Jigokudani is the source of much of the onsen water in Noboribetsu. Right when we stepped out of the car, it smelled strongly of sulfur due to the volcanic activity but you get used to it quickly. Some beautiful landscapes in the valley that make for great photo",

          "We visited Jigokudani on a wintry Feb afternoon when it was snowing and foggy. Trails were icy and a lot of the snow-bound trails were closed. I can imagine this place being a nice easy hike in better days. Even then, it was crowded with several tourist bus loads of people.",

          "Quite disappointed by this attraction. Had hoards of China tourists swarming the area so was not such a great place to visit. The nearby untouched trails with unadulterated snowy landscapes proved to be a more enjoyable trek. Beware of the slippery steps if you do visit this",

          "Apart from the onsen, the thermal activity area of Jigokudani (or Hell Valley in ENglish) is the reason we came here. Nothing much to see but mostly for photo opportunity. Those coming with tour normally won't stay long, so the inner part of this area which is very beautiful",

          "Came here during winter, so everything is so beautifully white, powdered snow, so soft that its hard to walk at some place where your whole foot can sink in. Had my first fall here! its worth to go anyway!",
          "My Wife and I visited this place in late afternoon, in early Feb. It was snow season so everywhere there was soft snow and the hotspring with red and brown hill features stand out. One immediately gets the sulpher smell reaching there. What we liked is lovely walking trails made",
          "Went around nightfall, the views were surreal! Did a day trip, but it seemed many travellers stay overnight at one of the famous onsen hotels.",
          "After the group tour was cancelled due to minimum numbers, we decided to pay more for a personalised holiday. We were able to pick and choose what we wanted to see and for how long. We were also able to adjust/add places during the week and arrange late morning pick-ups so we",
          "The walk around the valley was nice with some good views and photo taking spots! Might take awhile to complete in winter",
          "Went with family this time round and visited the site. Place is huge and the views are scenic. Highly recommended for photographers who wants to take scenic pictures of the environment.",
          "Nice walk thru the park. It was nice to see the path lighted up at night but maybe because i was expecting it to be similar to snowlight path in otaru, so it did not appear as interesting. The day view was nice but because of the snow, we couldnt see alot of the landscape and",
          "I've been to many natural springs(many that weren't free) and think that this is a great little time waster. Love people that complain about a free attraction. It's still a unique sight. Can get rather slippery in winter so wear appropriate footwear. And yes there are tourists.",
          "Interesting. Nice in the snow. Good for Stretching the legs. Didn't blow me away. Might be better with better weather and during change of seasons.",
          "The boardwalk trails provide a close view of the sulphur hills. Relaxing atmosphere to stroll along the paths.",

          "This 'Hell' is actually pleasant for a nice walk in winter when snow still manages to cover most part of the valley. Of course, there's area that the hot spring and thermal prevail. We didn't walk up the hill which is for those stronger. Some 3-400 metres was all we walked,",
          "One of must visit place if you visit Hokkaido, Noboribetsu Hell village. We have short walk on the trek during the winter time. The trek is very slippery after rain. Very strong sulfur smell from the hot spring. There are a lot of nice restaurant nearby Hell Village. You can",
          "One thing very obvious that we hate is the overwhelming number of tourist groups around, which practically destroys every experience. And the fact that it was cold and raining made it even worse. We've been to the one at Beppu and Mt. Aso in Kyushu, so this wasn't new, and",
          "The views are great and with the steam rising us, we felt that we were in a sauna. Actually, I believe this place means \"Hell\" because of the rising smoke. It is a nice little walk and very enjoyable.",

          "A nice afternoon walk in winter to see the colourful geographic features of a hot spring area. The path was very well taken care of and safe to walk (even in winter). The view was scenic and lots of signs posted to help make the experience meaningful and enjoyable.",
          "This is one place you cannot miss when you are in Hokkaido. Here you see the natural hot springs in the winter. Imagine the temperature is 0deg C and the hot springs can be as high as 150deg C ! Beautiful colors. A lot of walking and climbing. Last but not least we have the",
          "Decided to come up here instead of Lake Toya as we were on our return trip from Hakodate back to Sapporo. I have read that there are lockers there for luggages and I was warned that the lockers that cost about 700 yen is not very big and thus for all our train travels, we did",
          "Just passed by for few hours. Should have stay longer. Very beautiful scene from the volcano. Strong sulfur smell, onsen should be good. There is a good Soba shop along the street, very nice and cheap.",

          "A rather volcanic valley in Noboribetsu. It can be made as a side trip from Sapporo by heading towards JR Noboribetsu Station and then by a local bus. However, if you wanna visit the other two theme parks as well, it is best to stay overnight for a hotspring bath in the",
          "Next stop we drove to Noboribetsu from Niseko for hot spring dip! Visit this park since its famous (and free :) ) but the area is pretty small. Alot of steam from the valley, good for a picture or two. Spent less than 30 mins here though",
          "We took a day out and went to this national park and trekked around with our kid, wonderful view in the snow field. Great for photo session as well. This park provides snow boot hire for the convenience of visitors. However, it was a little sad to see people just taking photo",
          "This is the go-to place in Noboribetsu as there is literally nothing else to do here. Beautiful sulfur volcanic scenery is what you'll expect and is what you'll get. There's a stairway which leads to a snowy platform, more beautiful views. Apart from overcrowding mainland",
          "As this is a popular spot in typical guided tour, expect buses of tourists here. However, as the area is widely spread, it was not overly crowded. Tourists generally gathered near the entrance to take photos with the sign against the valley backdrop. I suggest that you walk",
          "The easiest way to get to Hell valley is using schedule bus from air port but the earliest bus start at 1230, since we reach airport quit early, we decided to hop on the train, will not recommend you if too much luggage because from new-chitose airport you need to change to",
          "Last December, it was very cold when I visited the jigokudani, both raining and thick snow everywhere. We must walk carefully as afraid of slippery. Thick smell of sulfur and you can see the fog from hot spring.",
          "There's a nice walking path that takes you through the valley and up the hilly areas. Lots of photo areas and beautiful scenery.",
          "Well mapped out sights and the sulphuric fumes make the place look mystical. The Tessen-Ike was interesting. It sprouted out gases while we were there and boy, it was interesting enough to see nature at its action. I brought my parents aged 70+ and it was manageable so I gave",
          "Went a little late and it was rainy. Initially a little overwhelmed by the sulphurous smells. But it was worth the journey. Felt as if one was transported to the moon. At twilight, the place turrns magical with the lights on the pathways. Too bad we did not have time to make it",

          "If you love walking through the forest and looking at natural Onsen; it is one of the best hiking in noboribetsu. It smells like sulfur, but u will get use to the smell. Once you walk up there's also a nice place where you can rest your foot in the flowing hot sulfur Onsen. It",
          "Great place, there are different paths in the valley, better to avoid the slippery paths in the middle of the forest. The view is magnificent, it's worth to spend 2-3 hours here.",

          "It may not be as great as those in USA or New Zealand, but I still find it worth a visit. If you drive, please note that there are 2 main car parks in the park. One is at the entrance, and the other is at Oyunuma Pond \u5927\u6e6f\u6cbc. You just need to purchase one parking ticket and you are",
          "Hell Valley is a walkway into the sulfur hot spring volcanic area. The walkway is entirely paved and is quite accessible. Good for taking photos. However, the real spot to see is the Oyunuma Pond, which is a long (30 min) walk or a short (5 min) drive up the left hand side road",

          "My first trip was in group. We only visited the vally down. It is damaged already by people. Nothing to see and boring. My 2nd trip was our own choice. I even want to escape this place because of my first experience. To show my family, we still went there. Luckly the staff at",
          "Definitely a must visit when you are in Noboribetsu. the smell of sulphur is strong and you can walk down to the valley and see the bubbling hot waters which provide much of the hot springs in this town. After a visit, you should definitely take a nice soak in the onsen in one",
          "On the end of Onsen Street . Suggest visit the Visitor Centre first to watch the documentary before the walk . There are free rental of boots if needed . Few spots for photography Worth a visit",
          "Worth a visit. very peaceful walk track that lead you to the Hell Valley. Great food onsen. Many local onsens nearby.",
          "For those who take the trouble to visit Noboribetsu Onsen, it would be a shame not to hike to nearby stark and sulphuric Hell Valley and, just beyond it, Oyunuma Pond and streamside Ashiyu footbath. Exploring the rugged, scenic area takes an hour or two via well-marked",

          "This is definitely an entry-level sort of a hell: a few bubbling pools of hot mud, a whiff of sulphur (this is one of the few places on earth where Mrs W's farts don't smell), and a few patches of burnt-out landscape. The most dangerous thing we saw was a snake. The best part",
          "A wonderful site for some geography lessons for the children. The sulphur odour was quite noticeable and we could take a close look at a geyser.",
          "The valley is similar to visiting one of the volcano. i go thereby by bus and train. After getting off at Noboribetsu station, you need to catch the frequent bus to the either Noboribetsu onsen (where most bus terminte) or to the nearer Daiichi hotel stop which only some buses",

          "Average experience with this place; isn't very amazing though. However worth a drop-by if you are driving down from Sapporo to Hakkodate.",
          "Really spectacular setting and you can get up close to some bubbling and sputtering geysers. The smell isn't all that bad. There are some charming wooden signs around warning of dangers on the rocks. There are a few very pleasant walks around and you can head over to the Bog",
          "Noboribetsu onsen cho area is the small town. The hell valley is short walk from the city center. This place can make you sweat since there are so many routes to many interesting origins of hot springs. By the way, smell is not good.",
          "The area is like well maintained park with clearly marked foot paths and fences. It was rather crowded when I went in the afternoon but well worth the visit. If you feel like strolling in quiet go there at night after sunset. It's very spooky but beautiful with fog like steam",
          "You can see the beauty of the mountains and get a strong dose of the sulphur long before you come across the actual entrance, as there are many walking trails all leading to this natural wonder. It can be crowded at times when the tour coaches arrive, but as they don't stay",
          "Never been up close to a geyser before, so this was a first experience! Interesting to stand \"within\" the source of the hot spring! :)",
          "We happened to suffer from jet lag and visited this place at 6:30 a.m. It was nice and quiet without the hasseling and buzzlong of tourists. My family had a pleasant hike on all of the trails there. I didn't find the smell of sulfur to be too overwhelming. What I saw was",
          "Jugokudani is a valley with active volcano, and may be translated into Hell Valley in English. As I don't have seen volcano as my country is so safe, I was pleased to see the volcano that is still active.",

          "Visited this at night as well as in the morning. The view there is awesome!! The smell is a bit strong but when you see the view, everything is worth it. They had this special night performance on thursday and friday only in summer so make sure you catch it!!",
          "Very touristy. Bus loads of tourist invading the place. Better if you hike the trails or drive around for higher vistas or to the steaming Lake Oya-Numa where you can see a blowing spring high above (see photo). That is more spectacular IMO. If you drive, follow the route",
          "The Jigokudani area, like other sulfuric hot-springs, has \"unique\" sulfuric smell. The valley is crowded tourist spot and has tour buses come and go during the day. Come early in the morning or late in the afternoon for a quiet walk along several hiking trails. The path is very",

          "It's the only reason why you want to be at this place. The Hell valley has all the smell of the sulphuric volcanic steam and there is a small geyser that so happen erupted when we were there. Night time there are small show and fireworks.",
          "First and foremost, this place STINKS. The whole area is full of vents and geysers that just reek of sulfur. Smears of yellow coat some of the red and white rocks. It is not the best place if you have allergies or asthma, as you will find it difficult to breathe. However, it is",
          "I really enjoyed this visit to Jigokudani. Despite the overpowering sulphur smell, the volcano and its surroundings are quite picturesque. There are several walking trails to choose from, all at different distances to suit everyone. The walking trail to Oyunuma hot-spring is",
          "My 1st experience to visit such nature. If you are staying nearby hotel in Noboribetsu Onsen just a few minutes walk up to Jigokudani. A very nice yet unique view. Get a map and stroll away with it, which you can see a nice view. Good for photographers. If you have time, you",
          "Again, go early or late to avoid the hoards of tour buses that descend on this place. The colours just before sunset makes the place a bit more colourful",
          "Went around to visit several points of interests, but take quite a walk. some are quite difficult especially when its raining. Be sure to know your way around with the map, or else you will end up walking too far or walking along the roadside.",
          "I like the place. Not very big but the view was unique. You can see the hot spring comes out from the ground. Parking is not cheap. Suggest to park your car in the hotel and walk to here.",
          "Having been to other similar places in other countries, Hell Valley here doesn't amount to much. For first-timers though, this would be a good experience.",
          "Noboribetsu has a lot of geothermal activity, and Jigokudani is the source of the hot spring waters for the onsen town. Here you can see huge steam vents and streams of sulphuric water, the smell's pretty strong if you're not used to it. Trails are pretty easy to walk, and if",
          "Beautiful....you could smell the strong sulphur as you enter the Jigokudani area. We didn't get a chance to stay and enjoy the Onsen but the town itself was a blast from the past. As soon as you get off the JR train, I was taken back to the old style station. It brought back",
          "I visited a similar place in Kyushu and near by Tokyo long time ago. When I got in the entrance, I could smell the strong sulfur scent which reminded my previous visit somewhere else. It was like stepping in another world. if you like to fell the nature, pls visit here.",
          "It's a pretty cool place to check out geothermal activity. The walkways make it an easy visit that takes about 20 minutes to look around. The views that look like something from another planet are fantastic. You can walk further another 20-30 minutes to check out a pond with",

          "Depending on the time of the year you come here I am sure it will offer very different views. We came here during the winter and it was quite cold. There are lots of hiking trails that takes you to different parts of the landmark. We didn't get too far as it was quite cold",
          "The view in December is breath taking. Snow covered walk paths but steaming hot spring water emanating from,the valley. The track up to the look out of hell valley takes 40 minutes and is worth the walk when you see the crater formed from volcanic eruption. Simply postcard",
          "There are plenty of trails here for people to explore. However the first thing that hits me is that smell. Sulphurous yes, due to the volcanic hot spring but really bad to smell. Went in winter and again, it is a pity that many of those trails are covered with slippery ice and",
          "It seems like it's a must visit when visiting Noboribetsu but its not very interesting. Just a vast landscape of brown with sulphur smell. There was a bubbling Tessen Pond at the end of the walk and a few demon statues along the way. I saw a poster in the hotel about some light",
          "We like the pathway as it is easy to walk. The whole place is rather small but with free entrance one can't asked for more. We didn't get a chance to explore the small stream whereby you can soak your feet as it was getting dark.",

          "Though not of the scale and the variety of scapes as the the other volcanic geyser-parks, Hell Valley shares the same geologic landscape. Get the feel of the incessant activity that goes on in the bowels of the earth. Activity that has not stopped in the hundreds of thousands",

          "There's no other sight that I can compare this too - it's really unique and beautiful in its own way. It's definitely a long way up and even longer way if you hike (which is what I did). It takes maybe 20-30 minutes by bus and ~2 hours by foot from the station. Never been to",

          "We stop on the driving trip from Chitose Airport to Lake Toya. The scenic was refreshing however that day there wasn't much steam activity from the hot spring. So mostly it was some red sand valley. The entrance was free but there is fee for parking.",
          "Its amazing to actually stand on the high ground and see into the valley full of hot spring coming out right from the bottom. even though the valley don't have too much to be seen, but it's still some worth it to experience such amazing scenery in noboribetsu, hokkaido. Last",
          "It's within walking distance from onsen hotel, nice to have a walk and have a look of natural hot spring. Beware of the sulfuric smell.",
          "Jigokudani The road to Hell is often paved with expensive onsens. Noboribetsu is a onsen resort. Main attraction will be the Hell valley and the various onsen source in their natural setting. From the JR Noboribetsu station, take a bus that goes to Noboribetsu Onsen. Cost",
          "Lots of undulating terrain if you want to go to the upper region where bigger mud pool and footbath are. Car park is not free at lower and upper region. It cost 410yen for whole-day parking.",
          "Never walked on a volcanic area before this. The place stinks of sulphur but you will get used to it. Enjoy you hike and have a good camera with zoom lens would enable you to take close up photos of the bubbling mud and lava pools.",
          "At first glance I thought 'didn't James Bond film here?' The park is at the top end of the town. Multiple walking trails take you in all different directions, some wheelchair accesible. If you can't be bothered spending time looking round there is a quick slope up to the",
          "It is the largest hotspring site I've ever visit. The walk way is well maintained, the hotspring, lake and forest are very beautiful. Car park and toilet are also available. There are so many hotels and onsens where you can relax and enjoy bathing.",
          "We came to Jigokudani as it was within walking distance from our ryokan. It was very popular with tourists as there were many tour buses visiting the area. The smell from the Sulfur wasn't pleasant but the view was great and the snow during winter was a nice change of scenery",
          "Well maintained walking pass will easily take you to the hot water well which is active intermittently. Wait 5 minutes and you will see the new hot water is coming out from the well. Water temperature is around 80 C degree. Walking distance from entrance to this well is only 5",
          "CYC(2013. 2)+G We went to there before check-in. We went there when the road is very slippery and it was cold. But when I go near the sulfur hotspring, it was so warm. If you have glasses, be careful of your glasses being steamed.",
          "It took me longer than expected to walk around. And somewhere past the half-way point, we started to panic a little because it seems like forever to reach the exit & there were hardly any people around. There is no lamp post here in the wilderness. So if it gets dark & you are",
          "I don't think i can comment on this so much because we went only around the Jigokudani view point. Anyway it was so fantastic to see such the scenery. I hope i can find some time (and money ;P) to go there again! I want to go to the large lake so much. (Sorry that I forgot the",
          "It's raining , and my friend dont want to accompany me to see the place so I took the umbrella and walk to see the valley , yes you can smell the sulphur , I just had a quick snap picture of the place and go",
          "it's just 15mins walk frm nearby shopping street & multiples onsen hotels, crowded with tourist during my visit, walk till the end of the trail for the main attraction which is the geyser (which i find that the geyser in the park is so much more astounding compare to this, so",
          "There were a number of short, pleasant trails leading to different sites with close view of mud pond, crater lakes and steamy slopes. Be reminded that easy access to these trails was possible with the help of a car, not sure if It would be as convenient if one was relying on",
          "The walking path was well maintained and smell of sulphur filled the air but not that pungent to make you feel uncomfortable. Love the steam water geyser feature at the end of the walking trail. What i dislike is the paid parking for each of the attractions. But guess this is",
          "Good for a walk, however, not as much to see as the jigoku in Beppu, Kyushu, Japan. There are no hot Geysers to watch, no natural hot spring to see, other than 1 small puddle at the end of the trail. Its fine if you are there to take a walk and relax etc. However, if you are",
          "The walking treks are wonderfully installed. The signboards are helpful.",
          "Natural phenomenon and it's wonderful to watch. It's free and there are people helping u to take pictures free... Worth a visit:)",
          "Except for the sulphuric smell which gives me a headache and made me sick...",
          "Fantastic view, good hiking/walking trails, natural foot springs",
          "This is the second time I came to Hell's Valley, the previous visit being in spring. The heavy snow has made most of the attractions around the area impossible, i.e. Oyanuma and the forest trails and the natural foot bath. It was extremely perilous even to visit the geyser,",
          "Exploring the nature and valley was good and it was a good walk around the valley. However, as we went in winter and the paths were all covered with snow, it tends to get quite slippery when walking.",
          "This used to be a pretty impressive walk. But so many hotels have tapped into the hot springs that what used to be a roaring rocket powered volcanic vent now enits a few little wisp of sulfury steam.",
          "Great walk, hardly any other tourist around on a winter's weekday",
          "a good place to visit & hike while you are at Noboribetsu.. go early & take your time hiking along the trail, then have a relaxing evening at your onsen hotel."

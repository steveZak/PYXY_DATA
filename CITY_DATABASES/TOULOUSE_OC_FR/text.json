          "A very beautiful garden that is enjoyable by both friends, family and even the younger kids in the family. We went on a sunday and it was a nice walk in the park with not too many people",
          "What a gorgeous spot to sit and reflect or wander aimlessly within a picturesque and serene environment. I found a spot and sat to people watch and take in the lovely gardens. Some great places for pictures within also.",
          "This is a favourite stop of ours And we adore the garden. Admire the planting, the fish, reflect on your day but don\u2019t miss it!",
          "A little piece of tranquility in a busy city center. I wasn't quite sure what to expect before arriving. When I arrived at the park that is connected to the garden I was even less sure of what to expect. I visited early in the morning and was surrounded by fellow",
          "I went early in the morning and there were only 3 other people there. very pretty garden to walk around and well looked after.",
          "They have done a nice job of making these Japanese gardens. It is completely fenced off, only one way in or out. There weren\u2019t many people there, but some teen girls sitting in the shelter (pagoda?) were rather loud.",
          "The gardens offer a clean and quiet space for relaxing. Close to metro but within 15 minute walk of Capitole.",
          "Good place for a walking or jogging. More a relaxing place. Great for photos. Close by the Campaign-Cafarelly",
          "Although not in the central part of the city this is worth the short metro ride to get to. It is well maintained in Japense style and is a lovely walk inside the main park. WE didn't spend as long there as some other reviewers but as its free you don't have to plan to spend",
          "We saw some cherry blossoms to make up for not being able to be in Japan during Spring! The place is nicely kept but the pigeons kept stealing our food!",
          "Walking bridges connect all the main Jardines here. Spent a few hours just strolling through them all. Took our lunch and grabbed a seat in the shade with other visitors and relaxed our way through rest of afternoon.",
          "Small but still worth a visit. In the middle of a park in Toulouse but very Japanese. A visit won\u2019t take too long but worth an hour or two.",
          "To be quiet in Toulouse city center and have a peaceful moment, do not hesitate to go in one of the nicest Park of Toulouse. Maybe you'll have the opportunity to enjoy a little nap.",
          "Worth a visit. Very nice and well maintained garden, quiet with lot of shade. There is a small pond in the middle with few turtles. I recommend to visit it",
          "Beautiful Japanese gardens within a municipal park. Nice and relaxing and very pretty and picturesque. Lovely for a stroll in the heat.",
          "Peaceful and relaxing place, it\u2019ll worth your time! Go there just to have a look at this special creation near the center of the city. This Japanese Garden is surrounded by a big park. I\u2019ve been there in a sunny Saturday afternoon and I really appreciated all these people lying",
          "The park itself is not great, but the Japanese gardens are small, but perfectly formed. Well worth a detour.",
          "Very well maintained gardens - very Zen. Lots of places to sit and relax, contemplate or just enjoy the scenery. Lovely plants and trees. A little haven in the middle of a city. Highly recommended.",
          "A nice place to relax and recharge. In the centre of the Compans Caffarelli garden, you walk into a Japanese garden and tea Pavillion",
          "Beautiful and park with play area for kids. Very refreshing - a must visit incase you are in Toulouse for more than 2 days.",
          "We loved our hour or so wondering around the 3 large old gardens. So many huge trees and lots of colourful garden beds. It would be a wonderful place for a picnic lunch.",
          "Well maintained Japanese garden, nice to visit on a spring day. The sand design is better than average, haven't seen one like it so far.",
          "It's a nice place to visit. It's not huge, rather small I'd say. You may have already seen other Japanese gardens, if so, you won't probably be amazed about this one. Kids like it as it's not huge. And there's a place for kids to play close by.",
          "A bit secluded but still walking distance from city center. Do not miss it by any reason as it is a pearl within the city. Plus there are panels that explain the culture behind the Japanese gardens if you are interested. It was so relaxing for us, the Japanese standards have",
          "It was opposite of the Compans Cafarelli metro station. Inside of the Compans Cafarelli Jardins. It was a small but very peaceful place. You can spend one-hour taking photos and doing sunbath",
          "My friend and I had a wonderful walk in this splendid spot, a Japanese garden within a public park. It was a delightful experience, a lovely walk on this Sunday afternoon. Worth the search... you will enjoy it! xxx",
          "Small and nicely maintained Japanese gardens. Visited there couple of times with my family. There is also a children's play area and a eatery adjacent to the garden.",
          "Nice Garden. Unfortunately not much going on flower-wise in February but also the size of the garden is smaller than anticipated. We went here on Sunday morning and it was packed with families with children so it is defo a cute place but I have seen nicer parks in other cities.",
          "It's a clean and a relaxing place. Different as well. Worth the visit if you just have a couple of spare hours.",
          "Nice smaller garden with lovely Japanese garden. Well done. Not sure it\u2019s worth the trip from downtown but certainly if in neighborhood. Could do entire garden in 10-12 minutes or spend a lot longer.",
          "This garden is quite centrally located in Toulouse and is adjacent to Compans-Cafferelli metro station. The entry is free and the Japanese section is breathtaking. In autumn, one can see a variety of colours and the atmosphere is very spiritual. Behind the Japanese garden is a",
          "Pretty parc but the actual Japonese garden is small and quite crowded on sunny days. If you are down in toulouse for a short amount of time then I would not include the garden in your must see list. If you're in the area then walk through the parc and enjoy a quick stroll. If",
          "30 years ago this was a great idea and a great success! Sadly it is now frequented by all the drop-outs of society who treat it as home and I no longer enjoy visiting! It's high time the town hall get their act together and clean this attraction up VB before it's too late.",
          "Beautiful place to visit during any season. Deserve a time in every tourist schedule. A place that provides great pictures. Easy access.",
          "right outside our hotel so defo had to visit ..Its small but pretty and very well looked after ..ENJOY",
          "Beautiful garden. It was raining and we hesitated to go. But, even we got all wet, we don\u2019t regretted. You have to see it, is a little oasis of this city.",
          "This is a small but stunning Japanese garden located in the centre off a park near Compans Caferreli metro. Very peaceful with small streams and pools with fish, bamboo, a zen garden and Japanese styled buildings. Free entry and worth a visit if you are in the area.",
          "Worth the walk out from the city center to see the overall park plus the Japanese garden. Very nice landscaping and upkeep. Quiet and picturesque. Some millennials we're goofing off and security spoke to them right away.",
          "Free entrance Absolutely amazing and very peaceful Calm and with lots of nature!! Very beautiful I recommend to visit during good weather / sunny day Beautiful bridge and dojo!!! Stunning views The Japanese garden is a garden inside the main one There are places to eat inside",
          "Perhaps because we visited in February and most of the foliage was a distant memory, we didn't find it particularly attractive. It was nice to walk through to the garden and peaceful given the lack of tourists during winter. Would like to see it in full bloom.",
          "These are very peaceful part of Toulouse that is definitely worth the trip out of the town centre. Lovely to spend an afternoon sitting and relaxing here.",
          "This garden is part of the bigger park but is free to enter and walk around. Very well looked after the only problem is it is popular. If you want to take really good pictures an early start is advised",
          "What a beautiful find this was on our walk around Toulouse. The garden is small but beautifully kept. The pond had huge goldfish and a wee turtle in it. A wee haven in the middle of the city",
          "If you have time you must visit this garden. Good place to relax for few hours away from the hustle and bustle of the city.",
          "Is it because I already visited some Japanese gardens in other cities in Europe and in Japan, but I found this one small and not really interesting. You can walk around in 10 minutes and it's done ...",
          "situated in a larger park, this is the place to have a moment of \u00ab time out \u00bb and quiet contemplation.",
          "Well maintained gardens. Small but wonderful to see in a city that has very little parks. A 5 minute cycle ride from our apartment and we're in a good place. I even bring my studies to this park during the week.",
          "This is tucked away in the far corner of a local park. It was worth seeking out as a tiny piece of Japan in the middle of a French city. We were enchanted. On the downside, as the weather was scorching we tried to have a relaxing sit on the grass in the shade of a tree, and",
          "This park is so well kept it is a pleasure to visit. With well manicured trees, shrubs and grassy areas accompanied by a pond that is stocked with some impressive fish this really is a place to relax and reflect.",
          "We visited here in the evening just before it closed. It is a lovely urban park and garden where families were enjoying themselves. There is a children's playground in one area and wonderful tree-lines paths all around.",
          "A beautiful and quiet park to walk around. A nice change from the busy streets of the city. Beautiful sculptures, buildings and of course the bridge really help to make the gardens special. Plus the dragon sculpture just outside the gardens is impressive too!",
          "The previous day all the city parks had been shut for reasons we didn\u2019t find out so it was pleasant to visit these gardens next morning before our departure to get away from the general city hubbub and the smells of urine and dog excrement in the main streets. It won\u2019t take you",
          "This peaceful spot is great for a stroll in the garden. Lots of families enjoying each other... on a beautiful spring day with flowers blooming.",
          "Slightly off the beaten track, but well worth a visit if you like this sort of thing. Set within a pleasant larger park, including a substantial children's play area wuth a huge rope climbing frame.",
          "While in a very stresful end of year, we went their to chill and have somme quiet refreshinng time in nature...it was amaising.",
          "We wandered about the gardens but the emphasis was on the playground, having 4 year old twins in tow. And it was a great place, well maintained. The area is clean, and there are lavatories available. Wide range of young childrens activities as well as some for the older kids.",
          "These gardens are quite small however wonderfully maintained, tranquil and completely free. Worth a visit whilst escaping the touristic areas of Centre Ville.",
          "This was a beautiful, quiet spot. A real Japanese garden. Not large, but worth finding in the larger garden.",
          "Located a distance from the city center, close to the Canal du Midi, this is a park within a park where you can sit quietly watching the carp in the pond or just contemplating life. It is well maintained.",
          "Nice enough for a peaceful 15 minute walk or maybe a photo shoot. There\u2019s a cool looking play park for children there. Not much else to say.",
          "If you want to get away from the city these gardens are ideal to visit. Tranquil and peaceful they have a lovely feel. Very pretty and well kept, worth a visit if you are near.",
          "Very nice place to wander around or sit on the grass for an hour or so. It's not too big but is kept very well and is definitely relaxing. There's terrapins and carp in the water and a zen garden with a buddha included. It's about a 20 minute walk from the capitol square and not",
          "It is so easy to walk around Toulouse and we approached the Japanese Gardens from Pont Neuf, along the La Brien canal. The gardens are at the rear of the main park area and were beautiful. The weather was a little grey and overcast and it was early in the season. I imagine the",
          "Pretty space very well kept and inviting but could use some seats for those who wish to relax in the garden. Sitting on the grass is not permitted.",
          "A curious garden - designed in the \"Japanese Style\" by the Toulouse parks department - with some features \"protected\" from visitors by caution tape! A nice place to visit if you are in the area, but not a full day destination.",
          "This Large japonese garden was used for wedding pictures. Nice fenced of area in the surrounding park.",
          "What a nice surprise in the middle of city, there are great walks all around the park, bridges, fountain, streams, and cafe with delicious crepes, wine, coffee and much more. Great place for a picnic1",
          "It is a nice garden for kids to play around and watch the fishes in the pond, nothing extra-ordinary about the garden. There is a small play area for kids behind the garden. No entrance fee.",
          "Very beautiful parc a little bit outside the city center of Toulouse (only 1-2 metro stops or a 15-20 minute walk). Beautiful garden and nice atmosphere!",
          "This is place of peace, calm and tranquillity. The place has a red bridge over a little river, koi carp, siting areas and walks with some lovely plants and flowers. Well worth a visit",
          "Lovely garden but there were quite a lot of people milling around so not easy to appreciate its beauty and contemplating experience. It has all the ingredients of a Japanese garden. Best to visit in spring when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom.",
          "It is that kind of place that makes you forget you are in the centre of a city. Beautiful and peaceful. Lots of green space.",
          "The garden is secure and clean. All trees and plants are very well taken care of. But it\u2019s quite small so there\u2019s no need to plan hours to see it. I would recommend to buy some food to go and just eat at the garden while you relax. The red bridge is the most important thing in",
          "Whenever wishing to have some time to go away from the rush of the city life, the Japanese garden is an oasis of calmness. In the morning you can see people meditating or just quietly walking around its narrow paths. It is well kept and the Tea House in the center of it offers",
          "Loved the garden, well maintained and interesting history of former mayor of Toulouse with Japan and in particular, Kyoto. Very nice stone display, red bridge and Japanese plants including bamboo - very peaceful",
          "I fell in love with the quietness of this garden. I wad specially impressed with the Koi carps. They are huge and don't seem to mind the frozen ester of the lake at all.",
          "Very cute place, with a red bridge, and pavillion. Great place for photos as well. There is a monument of a zen master. Spend some time relaxing here.",
          "The park was already very nice but the japanese garden was beautiful and calm. The red brigde and the little water place turn the garden into a really relaxed and peaceful spot. If you wanna take some time off from the big city in the big city - go there and sit in the sun. Its",
          "Title says it all. Nice break from hectic Toulouse. Found it by accident when staying at hotel next door.",
          "A lovely little gem into Toulouse and the array of Autumn colours were beautiful. Interesting wildlife. Worth a visit!",
          "During our weekend in Toulouse it was a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city to have a couple of hours out. From the city centre, we took the metro to the closest station and then walked to the gardens. The weather was beautiful and as it was November there weren\u2019t",
          "4th visit for us but first in Autumn. Definitely worth a quick visit if in Toulouse and not too busy. Nice for a respite from shopping and sightseeing and truly beautiful.",
          "This garden is hidden behind a larger public park.This park was quiet and very pleasant. If you're in the area make sure to drop by!",
          "Nice park, close to other parks and to the metro station. Offers a calm walk, specially at the end of the day.",
          "A tranquil haven in a busy city, lovely spot to wander around and admire the Japanese style of pruning and lovely little lake with carp. Good children's playground nearby too. Allow an hour and cover up/wear repellent if you're prone to insect bites.",
          "Very nice Japanese garden in middle of the city. Great place to rest or just walk. There is a cat who has an elegant house.",
          "A very strange little place in the middle of toulouse. Would really reccomend a visit. It has fantastic displays of Japanese architecture and just overall really worth a visit. Only downside is that is was a bit dirty when we got there.",
          "Quiet and beautiful hideaway in an otherwise very stony city. Don't sit on the grass, the park guard will tell you off in a very French and not so nice way.",
          "An opportunity to see a range of planting and some design features. But too small to be peaceful. So, a worthwhile concept but execution flawed. Following another reviewer's suggestion, on leaving the park I walked along the canal. However, heavy traffic made that less than",
          "Loved the Japanese house by the lake - lovely Acer trees. An oasis in the middle of the city - well worth a visit for at least an hour.",
          "Lovely gardens to sit in, did close at 6 but able to sit by lake after closing, nice to see the koi in the water and even saw a terrepin basking in the water, nice clean park and well maintained",
          "If you happen to be in the park that this garden is a part of, it's fine to walk through, but it's not worth a visit otherwise. Better still, leave the park from the north side facing the Canal du Midi and stroll along there. We saw loads of ducks and two otters enjoying the",
          "A pleasant little garden in Toulouse.It is not going to take your breathe away However, to walk around and have some nice chill time it's perfect. We took a little picnic and had a lovely 20 mins there. A lovely little Japanese Garden.",
          "The Japonais garden is small but relaxing. It has a nice pagoda and a pond, but there is a wide field which has nothing in it yet. A little disappointing since it is a little far away from the center of the city.",
          "Very well kept gardens within the park - which had it's fare share of local drunks in it though this area was very well looked after. It was just unusual to suddenly find the lovely spot in the city - with a bridge, pavilion and zen garden and pond with turtles thrown in. Nice",
          "After reading the reviews we came out of our way to see this garden. It's a garden within a garden and there wasn't a lot there that I would class as Japanese. The water in the pond was filthy too!",
          "We walked around the park for around 30 mins. We are from NZ so use to lots of grass so was nice to swap the city for the park for a while. It was a nice garden but not all of it was very well maintained - at least to what we are use to back home. The photo shows a nice part",
          "Beautiful place to visit when you are in Toulouse. They maintained the garden very well. Although it is a bit small it is still worth to visit it.",
          "I went there with my girlfriend and had a walk in this wonderful parc. There was informations about feng shui and also a very nice place to look at. The place is beautiful and is perfect for a romantic stroll in a calm place.",
          "This is a beautiful park with quite large Japanese Garden in it, perfect for a family visit or a picnic with friends, tranquil despite many people around. There's plenty of benches and grass to sit around and take a break from the day of work or sightseeing. It's easy to get to",
          "A well designed garden with a good variety of plantings, trees and settings. Would have given five stars but the pond seemed murky and in need of aeration - it may be misplaced, but I felt concerned for the well-being of the Koi and terrapins.",
          "Very nice walking spot, as well as the perfect place to just sit down at one of the many benches available to just relax for a while. The are some spectacular trees and plants, as well as different decoration in typical japanese style. Definitely a must see in Toulouse!",
          "The gardens are generally well maintained and are a quiet spot away from the busy city and square. Also plenty of wildlife to look out for!",
          "We visited the garden whilst out walking along the Canal du Midi. Along the route of the canal, we reached the Jardin Compans-Caffarelli and detoured into the park to visit the Jardin Japonais (Japanese Garden). The Japanese Garden is in the centre of the larger Jardin",
          "So pleasant to walk around or sit for while in the lovely tendered gardens - so quiet in this busy place. Some huge Koi in the spacious pond. Teenagers even liked it!",
          "A really beautiful place in the Pink city, really calm, it's always a pleasure to come there with friends ! After a good ramen at St Michel street on wednesday, I usualy come with friends to see the little cat who live in the \"Jardin Japonais\" and have a great time !",
          "This place is so beautiful and tranquil and definitely worth a visit. I went three times on my 5 day visit to Toulouse. Very beautiful a lovely place to unwind and enjoy the sun.",
          "Visiting friends were desperate to visit the garden so we made a picnic and trotted up to Campans. I took a back seat so they could practise their French. No signs to help find the place once in the 'outside' park and when we got inside and sat down, we were told to get off the",
          "if you have been to a real japanese garden, you would know that there's a good resemblance which is commendable. the wooden pavilion was nicely built. it wasn't big but quite cosy. the pond though was pretty murky and almost completely covered by algae. hardly able to see the",
          "It was supposed to be a calm place to be in but with a kids park behind its impossible. Also not many spaces to enjoy that jardin. Not that great of a visit.",
          "It is a lovely space, but smaller than I had hoped and even though it is set within another path it is not an oasis of calm. the lake, tea house bridge area is lovely but the gravel garden is not well maintained. It is a bit off the beaten tourist track in the city, but as the",
          "Small but very beautiful Japanese garden. Really a good place for a short walk and enjoy the cite and place.",
          "Quiet... the feel of traveling far away to japan. The best place to relax from city life and just enjoy the nature. The trees were blooming and the pink leaves were making a dream look a like day. Ps: check the signs and prohibitions. It's a strick quiet place, and no bikes",
          "The Japanese Garden is within a much bigger park. It is only open from 8.30 - 3pm. Our first visit was after three and the gates to the garden was locked. Quite a few of us were disappointed and there were no signs to say what the opening times only that visiting was limited.",
          "It's quite nice. It's not easy to find. That said, where else would you find a Japanese garden in a city, urban environment? Have you got one. Nice oasis. Bide a while. Well done, Toulouse",
          "We wanted to visit The Jardin Japonais on Friday 7 July. Unfortunately, it was closed. The Japanese garden in the middle of public park is surrounded by a fence and all the gates were closed to our disappointment. I don't know a cause, no info provided.",
          "I think I was expecting a bit more than what I saw. The gardens are within a big park, & the Japanese Garden is actually quite small. Very tranquil & peaceful. Don't use the little toilet behind kiosk, disgusting! Saw one turtle & some Koi. Long walk for a short visit.",
          "Went here on Sunday having purchased sandwiches and drinks from a supermarket for an improvised picnic. The Japanese garden is worth a visit to see the artificial pond with Koi Carp and turtles swimming in the muddy water. The winding paths and little bridge certainly invoke the",
          "You enter the garden and the time stops. It's calm although there were many people at the time we went there. You can just sit or lie on the ground and relax. It's very nice to take photos too",
          "I was walking around Toulouse as I was to early to go in to my hostel when I came across the Japanese garden it was a pleasant surprise. The building it self looked very authentic as well as the choice of plants that was present even thought the site is very small there was a",
          "Great to wander through. The whole park is quite nice, which convenient if you rock up expecting to see this one and it's shut (not open all the time).",
          "The Japanese garden was interesting and quite calm compared to the rest of Toulouse. The walls and the lake were not very well maintained. The creators of the garden had clearly done a lot of research into Japanese garden traditions and there were accompany descriptions about",
          "We had spare time before going on a tour. The lady in the tourist office had recommended a visit. It's a lovely tranquil place, well maintained, plenty of seating in the shade, and an extensive planting of unusual specimens.",

          "A beautiful and relaxing garden, only 20 min walk from the center. Definitely a must-see in Toulouse!",
          "The garden provides a splendid respite from the busy city and the mid-day heat. One small warning is to stay off the grass!",
          "I was in the Centre de Congr\u00e8s Pierre Baudis and I had some time so I took a walk in the park. It is a big park. The interesting part of the park is a location dedicated to the japanese culture and tradition. There is a japanese building, with some statue and bridge. The lake in",

          "The garden is located in a larger park and separate from it. A great design - well explained - and a very beautful and peaceful place to spend a little time. Probably best to walk or take public transport - parking was difficult to find in this part of town.",
          "This japanese garden is very nice and cute. It provide some help to try focus and meditate. I used to go there alone or with friends. Every people I know were happy to discover this place",

          "As a separate part of a public park, this japanese garden is well worth a visit. Well maintained, sympathetically laid out and tranquil, it's a real oasis in the centre of a modern busy city. Apart from Sunday mornings, apparently when it's full of screaming kids running amok.",
          "The garden is quiet and peaceful. On a good weather day, you can come to jogging, reading books and walking. There also have Japanese garden inside. It is easy to get here, you can take the metro and get off at Compans Caffereri station. It just 2-3 mins walk. If you get",

          "There a few Japanese style plants and trees here, but I sense this is not designed to mimic, just to be in the style of. That said it is a very pleasant place to be, to sit a while and take in the atmosphere, including the sounds of children playing in the park next door. This",
          "I was disappointed because there are not that much of plants to see. There are a lof of homeless people hanging around at that area.",
          "Hidden in a public park, the Japanese Garden is a tranquil place to spend a few quiet minutes or hours. If you have spent time in Kyoto, you may not be impressed, but if not....you get a good sense of the components of a Japanese garden. I walked from the Capitoline Square-",

          "If you happen to be nearby, this park is worth a quick stroll, but it is extremely small and averagely pretty. The rest of the park isn't much cop either. OK for a quick lunchtime picnic, but don't make the effort to go out of your way to get here.",
          "I mean if the purpose of a japanese garden is to inspire peace and quietud, it is not achieved because of the masses of people that come to compans cafarelli in the weekend. It is difficult to move around if you have a stroller... and after 5 minutes you just want to go",

          "Nice place to hang out with a book. Well maintained, friendly people around. Onky downside too many dogs around. You might have to be careful where you walk. The Japenese garden itself is lovely though. Be careful there is a closing time. You cannot just access the oark at",

          "The Jardin Japonais is a pretty space..the part with the most Japanese influence is very well kept and inviting but could use some more seating for those who wish to relax in the garden. Sitting on the grass is not permitted. There is still park to explore around this area, but",
          "I used this park a number of times during my visit to Toulouse. It was a great pace just to sit and watch the world go by, I had discussions with colleagues over a coffee and at times just sat reflecting. The park itself is well used by families etc. and is very well maintained",
          "Small but lovely half an hour spent walking around this place. Quite difficult finding the entrance, as its in the middle of another park and surrounded by trees, but was worth it. Love the teahouse by the lake and the little bridge. Great for a little relaxation!",

          "Went for a wander in the rain with my husband. It is a small but perfectly formed public park that even looked good in rubbish weather. In summer lots of people are often sitting watching little birds or the details in the leaves - a small black and white cat joins in (it is",

      "name": "Saint-Sernin Basilica in Toulouse",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Basilica of Saint-Sernin (Occitan: Basilica de Sant Sarnin) is a church in Toulouse, France, the former abbey church of the Abbey of Saint-Sernin or St Saturnin. Apart from the church, none of the abbey buildings remain. The current church is located on the site of a previous basilica of the 4th century which contained the body of Saint Saturnin or Sernin, the first bishop of Toulouse in c. 250. Constructed in the Romanesque style between about 1080 and 1120, with construction continuing thereafter, Saint-Sernin is the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, if not the world. The church is particularly noted for the quality and quantity of its Romanesque sculpture. In 1998 the basilica was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites under the description: World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe abbey of Saint-Sernin was an ancient foundation. St. Sylvius, bishop of Toulouse, began construction of the basilica towards the end of the 4th century.Its importance increased enormously after Charlemagne (r. 768-800) donated a quantity of relics to it, as a result of which it became an important stop for pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostela, and a pilgrimage location in its own right. The size of the current building and the existence of an ambulatory may reflect the need to accommodate increasing numbers of pilgrims.\nThe difficulty of determining an accurate chronology for the construction of Saint-Sernin and the completion of its sculpture has given rise to numerous problems. At least as early as the 1010s, Bishop Pierre Roger had set aside a portion of the offerings to Saint-Sernin for an eventual rebuilding of the Carolingian church. During the decade of the 1070s and by 1080 at the latest, the canons of Saint-Sernin had accepted the rule of St. Augustine and had placed themselves under the direct control of the Holy See. Nevertheless, there are only two firm dates that bear directly on the church itself and even these involve certain difficulties. On May 24, 1096, Pope Urban II dedicated the altar of the still largely incomplete building. Although there have been numerous attempts to determine the point that construction had reached at this time, the most that can be said with certainty is that 1096 is a firm terminus ante quem. That is, construction must have begun at least several years before that date.\nThe second firm date is July 3, 1118, the death of St. Raymond Gayrard, canon and provost of the chapter. A 15th-century life of the saint states that he took charge of the building after part of the church had been completed and that by the time of his death he had \"brought the walls all the way around up to the completion of the windows...\" Unfortunately, the life was written much later, some three hundred years after the events it describes, and since at least three different Raymonds were involved in the building of the church, the biographer may have confused elements from the lives of all three.\nAt any rate, whenever started, it appears that construction of the church did not progress continuously through to completion, for there is physical evidence of several interruptions in construction. The literary evidence cited above indicates that construction proceeded from east to west and, indeed, it appears that the earliest part of the exterior walls is the southern, lower part of the ambulatory and its corresponding radiating chapels. The walls in this section are built of brick and stone, with a higher proportion of stone than elsewhere in the building. As construction proceeded, it was clearly marked by an increasing proportion of brick, the characteristic building material of Toulouse. While there is basic agreement on the starting point, interpretation of the subsequent archeological evidence is subject to varying opinions. The earliest systematic examinations, after the restoration of Viollet-le-Duc, concluded that there had been three major building campaigns.More recent observations have concluded that there were four major building campaigns. The earliest section begins with the apse and includes the chevet and all of the transept below the level of the gallery, including the Porte des Comtes in the south face of the transept. The second stage is marked by the walls of the transept being completed with alternating courses of brick and stone. This change is also paralleled by a change in the style of the interior decorated capitals. This break is most evident in the transept buttresses, which change from solid stone at the bottom to bands of brick and stone at the top, a change which occurs at various levels around the transept but generally about the level of the gallery floor. There then follows another break between the eastern portion of the church \u2013 including the transept and the first few bays of the nave itself \u2013 and the rest of the nave. The alternating courses of brick and stone give way to a predominantly brick technique with stone quoins and stone window frames. This third campaign includes the wall enclosing the entire nave, including the western entrance and ends just below the gallery windows. During the fourth phase, the remainder of the nave was completed in brick with almost no stone.\nThe plan of the abbey church here was also used in the construction of the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, \"begun in 1082, too direct a copy to have been done by any but Saint-Sernin's own architect or his favored pupil\", but finished much earlier.In 1860, Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc restored the church, but his changes are currently being removed to restore the original appearance.\n\n\n== Features ==\n\nDespite being called a basilica, Saint-Sernin's deviates from the basilica plan of early Christian architecture in a few ways. It is much larger compared to earlier churches, measuring 104m in length. It is also constructed mostly of brick. The building is in the form of a crucifix. The ceilings are vaulted, unlike many of the earlier churches. Saint-Sernin's contains radiating chapels which were used to display important relics. Another deviation from the earlier Christian churches is the addition of an ambulatory, a walkway that goes around the nave and side aisles to allow for viewing of the radiating chapels (which could be done while mass was being held without interrupting the ceremony). For these and other reasons, Saint-Sernin's is often said to follow the \"pilgrimage plan\" instead of the traditional basilica plan.\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nOn the exterior, the bell tower, standing directly over the transept crossing, is the most visible feature. It is divided into five tiers, of which the lower three, with Romanesque arches, date from the 12th century and the upper two from the 13th century (circa 1270). The spire was added in the 15th century. The bell tower is slightly inclined towards the west direction, which is why from certain standpoints the bell tower roof, whose axis is perpendicular to the ground, appears to be inclined to the tower itself.\nThe chevet is the oldest part of the building, constructed in the 11th century, and consists of nine chapels, five opening from the apse and four in the transepts.\nThe exterior is additionally known for two doorways, the Porte des Comtes and the Porte Mi\u00e8geville. Above the Porte des Comtes is a depiction of Lazarus and Dives. Dives in hell can be seen above the central column. The doorway gets its name from a nearby alcove in which the remains of four Counts of Toulouse are kept. The Porte Mi\u00e8geville is known for its elaborate sculpture above the entrance: the ascending Christ, surrounded by superb angels, is the central figure on one of the oldest and most beautiful tympanums in Romanesque architecture (circa 1115).\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nThe interior of the basilica measures 115 x 64 x 21 meters, making it vast for a Romanesque church. The central nave is barrel vaulted; the four aisles have rib vaults and are supported by buttresses. Directly under the tower and the transept is a marble altar, consecrated by Pope Urban II in 1096 and designed by Bernard Gelduin.\nAs well as Saint Saturnin, Saint Honoratus is also buried here. The crypt contains the relics of many other saints.\nThe basilica also contains a large three-manual Cavaill\u00e9-Coll organ built in 1888. Together with the Cavaill\u00e9-Coll instruments at Saint-Sulpice in Paris and the Church of St. Ouen, Rouen, it is considered to be one of the most important organs in France.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nFrench Romanesque architecture\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nO'Reilly, E.

          "A truly beautiful Basilica and the silence inside was so peaceful and welcoming. The chapels around the main altar and the stained glass windows were stunning. Tourists are not allowed to enter the main altar but you can get some good views as you walk around it. There is also a",
          "An interesting building inside and out. Pleasant situation, it's worth visiting this former abbey church.",
          "Truly amazing place. Extremely well looked after and presented to the public. Make sure you can translate the info in the church to English from french as there is only local language. Very well worth a visit, stunning place.",
          "Awesome experience. Wish there was more literature in English. The staff were very accommodating of my old parents. There is currently restoration work going on. It is a priceless grand building and I was fortunate to have had the opportunity to visit it.",
          "I prefer Romanesque churches to Gothic, but have only seen them in stone. Impressive. We were lucky enough to visit when the organist was playing.",
          "In the Carms neighborhood of Toulouse is this beautiful Basilica. The photos don\u2019t convey either the beauty or the serenity you will experience when you go inside. When in the area, walk around. The streets are lovely, with parks, centuries old and well-kept buildings, and",
          "What a beautiful place to visit, just a short walk from Place du Capitole. Its octagonal bell tower is an imposing structure, visible from far away. Inside, there\u2019s plenty of religious art and history, explained in brochures (in several languages) available at the entry. There",
          "It's quite and unassuming and can be found down a narrow street, no major signage to tell you that you've arrived, nor to tell you it's a UNESCO heritage site (apart from the signs in the main square 5 minutes walk away) and barely any tourists on a September weekday afternoon.",
          "Beautiful, I could stay here for hours basking in the stillness. So glad I went in and would certainly recommend.",
          "We had passed by the day before on a wzlking tour. We passed by again and hearing the wonderful sounds of an organ, we entered. Magnificent! The sound of the organ and the surroundings made this visit quite surreal.",
          "There is a fair amount of re-construction/refurbishment going oin here, so you will have to work your way around the construction. but it's worth it, as this is a wonderful cathedral, with a sense of devotion throughout. The choir, the altars and the crypt are all worthy of",
          "It's easy to become blas\u00e9 about the churches of Europe - so many over the top productions - but Saint Sernin is worth a visit. Apparently it too was once richly decorated inside but now only a few vestiges remain on the vaulted ceiling. The rest was stripped back sometime last",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit while in Toulouse; the Basilique is very well preserved and offers a very rich collection of status and art. worth a visit",
          "We initially made the mistake of thinking this was the Cathedral, but soon realised our mistake when we read up on it and visited the real Cathedral. This basilique was very impressive and would recommend a visit. It's huge.",
          "You must visit St Sernin. It is located next to St. Raymond museum. Unlike many churches, St Sernin is not dense with ornament and objects. It has a renaissance-like simplicity despite its size. As you would expect from a romanesque basilica, it has a variety of carved figural",
          "This morning first up I took 10 am Mass for the first time in 50+ years at St Cernin Basilica in Toulouse. The organ and singing was fantastic. But once the sermon began I am afraid I left at 10.05. The cathedral was another magnificent building. Its construction took place",
          "A very good place for an organ concert, and it was packed to capacity. Lots of extra plastic chairs made available by the city of Toulouse.",
          "The Basilique is well worth a visit. Beautiful architecture and atmosphere through out. At the time of visit the organ was being played and it sounded immense. Be sure to visit the ambulatory and crypts (there was a small fee for this portion). The grounds surrounding the",
          "It is believed that Saint Saturnin, the first bishop of Toulouse, was martyred on an altar to Roman Gods in 250AD and his body dragged by a bull through the streets to a location where the Basilica of Saint Sernin, now a link in the Camino de Santiago, was built from 1080. With",
          "A very nice basilica in a very nice surrounding area. A superb bust of Pope John Paul 2 inside well worth seeing.",
          "There are so many churches in Europe it\u2019s easy to get blase but this one is beautiful. It is huge and the octagonal shape makes it really interesting as a point of difference to many over churches of this style. The fresco\u2019s inside are well worth a look.",
          "Dating back to the 11th century, Saint-Sernin is the largest roman church in France. From the outside, you can enjoy the building, thanks to the changes made all around by the city hall in order to offer a large place to pedestrians. The construction are supposed to be completed",
          "A huge basilica but beautifully proportioned. Beautiful landscaped gardens. As i,posing inside as out. Quiet and peaceful retreat from the busy world. Well worth a lingering visit. Good for the soul.",

          "Very historic basilica with beautiful architecture. One of the best organs in France, which is played for Sunday services. Well worth the visit.",
          "The church is an easy walk from the centre of Toulouse or \u2013 if you prefer \u2013 on the much longer trail that constitutes the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route. The basilica houses the relics of Saint Sernin, the first bishop of Toulouse, who was martyred in 250 CE (or 250 AD, as",
          "There is restoration work going on outside but don't let that deter you. This church is much older than the gothic cathedrals elsewhere in Europe. The feel inside this structure is very different from those-it has an air of being much much older, as if it was a place where some",
          "The area is currently under construction, but that does not distract from the beauty of this basilica. Inside and out it is absolutely stunning. It is definitely worth stopping in for a visit.",
          "One of the sights of Toulouse. Great architecture and vibe inside. Follow the story of how Saturnin becomes a saint. Easy walk within the old town",
          "Best and largest Romanesque church in Europe. It\u2019s a shame they never completed the West front of it, or perhaps it was damaged at some point. Fantastic capitals and other sculpture here, although some of it looks restored and recarved. It would be good to take a tour of the",
          "Beautiful and unique church, set in a quieter area but still central in the city. Unfortunately there is some remodelling of the surrounding garden so there were fences up, but that didnt really affect the experience too much",
          "Lots of building work around the site but make the effort to find the entrance and you will be rewarded. Central location makes the place easily accessible.",
          "It is a charming and cute church. It is one of the main historic places to visit in Toulouse. The entrance is free.",
          "The entire front of the basilica was fenced off for improvements, but that just meant that it was easy to take nice photos of it. No people in the way of a great shot! I was able to go inside through a side door. They don\u2019t let anyone get very close to the alter where the",
          "A very nice looking Cathedral that is free enter however, there is a charge to the inner knave that contains much of their special items. Having some work being carried out presently, especially outside.",
          "The basilica is set in the middle of a pretty promenade which is lovely for a walk around during the day or at night (the church is lit up).",
          "The literature says that this cathedral was constructed in the Romanesque style between about 1080 and 1120, and it is allegedly the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, if not the world. It is impressive, and the crypts contain a number of relics.",
          "This amazing Basilica is so beautiful and so different to other churches, Cathedrals and Basilicas we have seen. It\u2019s a \u2018 must see\u2019 in my opinion. It was built between 1080 and 1120 in a Romanesque style and it is the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, it is",
          "We didn't have time to go in but walked around the edge of the Basilica. The architecture was stunning. In 1998 the basilica was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The Romanesque details is just beautiful and I would certainly recommend people go and take a look at this",
          "The Basilica of Saint Sermon is a huge and wonderful 11th century example of Romanesque architecture. It is the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe and, most likely, in the world. It stands majestically on the site of a very large 4th century abbey, also dedicated to",
          "Though not a big church fan, the Basilica is quite nice. Of note is it's status as a Basilica and Romanesque details. The inner chapel, with the frescoed ceiling requires an admission.",
          "You can walk around most of the church for free, but it is worth to pay the small fee to get into the choire and down into the crypt. There are quite a few shrines which are really beautiful to see. The building is beautiful from the outside as well.",
          "In France practically every town has nice churches and cathedrals and Toulouse is no exception. However, this is worth a visit.",
          "Basilique saint sernin is a very old church. In the past it must be very huge archectecture. When I was there about 7.15 pm, it was closed or the place is under construction. Only manage to walk around the premises.",
          "We truly thought that this was one of the prettiest buildings in all of Toulouse. The outside as well as the inside is really pretty. There was some construction, but still, lovely Basilica!",
          "Interesting architecture. It's good to visit and take a look around. The location is about 10 min from Capitole.",
          "We visit many cathedrals and churches on our travels but I would put this in my top ten. It is all so beautifully proportioned, light, clean and so many things of interest to see. I was fortunate enough to be there for Mass on the Sunday evening which, because of the organ, was",
          "Very well kept as many monuments all over France. Well situated right in the city center that makes it easier to visit.",
          "The spire is amazing dominating the skyline and the inside is also incredible. Well worth a visit. Recommended",
          "Nothing spectacular but something to see if you are in Toulouse. Outside architecture is impressive.",
          "A beautiful building from the outside. I could hear the organ playing within so I stepped inside to check it out. Better out than in!!",
          "A beautiful church from the outside in a square that's being renovated. Inside some very good stained glass windows, some old and some modern ones.",
          "A lovely old church established around 1180. Within walking distance of the hotel. It has a distinctive tower and of course surrounded by eating and drinking places. Could do a tour of the crypts which we didn\u2019t do.",
          "Unexpectedly, it wasn't crowded on Sunday. The organ is beautiful; and the music makes a visit better.",
          "This church is well worth a visit to take in the huge barrel vaulted ceilings. From the front of the building you probably wouldn't be attracted to going inside but it is a stunning space. There was some very interesting street art just around the corner.",
          "I thought there wasn't much to see in Toulouse until I came across this lovely building. Although I lean towards Gothic architecture this building is both Gothic and Romanesque and besides the very ornate basilica, rather like the baldachino in St Peter's, I found the frescoes",
          "Most old churches are a jumble of styles as each subsequent renovation was done in the style of the period of the period of the repair or replacement. But this lovely old church is a nearly pure Romanesque style that gives it a somber grace.",
          "If you approach the Basilica from the front you will wonder what all the fuss is about. Walk around the back of the structure & the view is breath taking (see photo). After you enter the Basilica you will find a very beautiful church.",
          "It is a very nice place to visit. Espiacially in the hot day you can really enjoy coming to the more north-European temperature ;) The church is included in the city pass.",
          "Gorgeous romanesque basilica. The main nave is spectacular and the crypt is full of relics and statues. Definitely work seeing.",
          "Dedicated to the first bishop and martyr of Toulouse, Saint Saturnin. He lived and died in the first half of the 3rd C The building was originally built from a combination of stone and brick, but the cost of stone changed the final and upper stages to be built of brick alone.",
          "Like many throughout Europe this is a large, old church that is beautiful and is filled with artwork and history.",
          "Lovely Basilica with interesting history - worth a visit. Central if you are doing a walk around. There is not a lot to see so you can visit in about 15-20 minutes",
          "At the time being the surrounding street or the church itself was under construction so we couldn't get close to have a look. We were there during a night walk so we didn't have the chance to visit the place again.",
          "Construction of the late XII century, is impressive from the outside and very bright & cozy inside. It was modified on several occasions, the most notorious influences being Romanticism and the Gothic movement: its architectural form corresponds to an abbey. It is beautiful,",
          "The history of this place is simply amazing - dates back to 250 AD information is available is several languages.",
          "Wanted so much to climb tower ,website says open some days .When we got there I could see people on top of tower.But when we asked we were told no ,only on very rare occasions .But still enjoyed the alter ,and walk around .website needs update",
          "Beautifully looked after and huge vaulted ceilings and a wonderful alter and ceiling. Worthwhile finding and spending a little time here.",
          "There is not much to see. The building has one large altar but you cannot come close to it. Rather than that the church is rather sad and empty.",
          "A very beautiful interior and interesting visuals regarding the pilgrimage route to Santiago Di compostela",
          "Visited for centuries by pilgrims, this is a place of peace and beauty. Local government is currently redeveloping the surrounding area to be more in harmony with the basilica. Try to be there for an organ concert.",
          "There is a lot of work going on outside and inside this stunning church but it doesn\u2019t detract from the experience of visiting here. The interior of the church with its altar, side chapels, frescos and mosaics is on a par with some of the great churches in Rome. There are also",
          "Worth a visit for sure. Im not religious so architecture is more my thing. Intersesting history and ambiaence.",
          "A beautiful large elegant church, unusual at being built and vaulted in brick. Well presented and a must to visit.",
          "Nothing beats seeing this place in person. Am simply in awe of the sight of the church. A bag of mixed feelings it brought, the grandness of it on the outside, but the unkept entrance didn't do it justice. Inside the church, brought upon a feeling of serenity despite tourists'",
          "Distinctive wedding cake tower, leaning gently, tops this huge Romanesque Church. Most guide books describe it as the largest pure Romanesque church in Western Europe. The nave is a soaring feat of light, only marginally spoiled by the fussy 18C Baroque additions around the",
          "This is certainly a beautiful and important landmark, but the entire area is under heavy construction. They are building what should be a beautiful plaza to surround the Basilica, but right now it is a big mess. You can go inside, but it is a path through mayhem.",
          "We did not know the history of St. Sernin and so we decided to go and visit the basilica. We learned so much about this Saint and how he came to be a Saint. This is close to the city center but since there is some construction going on outside of the basilica, it is a bit of a",
          "This is one worth seeing in the area of Toulouse. It is near the city center, and I went because of ease or proximity,",
          "The church is within easy walking distance of the city centre/Place de la Capitole.The exterior is a bit of a mess due to ongoing building works but it should look good on completion.The interior is very nice and the tour of the crypt is worth doing.Make sure to get a leaflet in",
          "Spiritual and educative visit of Saint Sernin. Visited several times and discover something new each time; being a gem of history and spiritual depth. Miss it already!",
          "This is an astonishing inside roman volumes in light pink bricks. The Choir has in the back very old statues 9th century. This is the nicest jewel of Toulouse. Just get in from the side door with an exceptional roman top. Some times, there are organ concerts. Don't miss it!",
          "Although we visited on a Sunday morning we were not stopped from walking in whilst a service was taking place. Breathtaking both on the inside and out despite the large amount of construction work that is currently going on. Well worth a visit. It is a Unesco world Heritage site",
          "This holy place was consecrated in 1090. It was built in dedication to St. Sernin who died in 250 AD. The exterior is worth the walk around but to dispel any lingering comments such as if you\u2019ve seen one church you\u2019ve seen them all, go inside where you will be pleasantly",
          "Lots of construction going on around the church but worth negotiating and finding the entrance. Stunning interior and architecture. Pay an extra 2 euros to view the crypt.",
          "This is a beautiful building and very much worth a visit. It was almost empty when we were there which added to our enjoyment.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral in Toulouse, currently there\u2019s renovations all around the Basilique but you can go in and enjoy the wonderful architecture",
          "The journey from the center of Toulouse to the Basilique takes in Rue du Taur, a lovely narrow street, which leads from the Capitol. Unfortunately at the time of our visit there were renovations going on to the extrior of the Basilique. This had the effect of reducing the effect",
          "Really liked this church. Great architecture with lots of space inside. There was a chorister singing Ave Maria on our visit Not far from the Capitole square, around 10 mins. Jean d'Arc metro is nearest and around 5 mins walk away.",
          "The architecture is beautiful. It provides a cool stop on your walk about Toulouse on a hot summer day. Actually there in July 2017. It wasn't too busy or crowded which was nice.",
          "As mentioned the Basilica is mostly boarded up for renovations making it difficult to find the side entry. The Church is impressive and has free entry. However there is a \u20ac5 entry ( no discounts for seniors etc ) to the Crypt and Ambulatory which I believe was a waste of",
          "the view of the basilica is obstructed by the renovations of the square. when completed, the surroundings will complement tbe beauty of this very old building. even with all the works, you can appreciate the architecture.",
          "Beautiful Building with a lot of history, and even with the many visitors, it is quiet and the ambiance Holy. Good for a visit or to say prayers no matter your denomination. There are pamphlets and guides for English speakers.",
          "We weren't intending to visit but came across during an evening stroll so didn't go in. However, the exterior is stunning and although undergoing renovation, the hoarding gave some really interesting historical detail. Unfortunately, we haven't got time to so a day visit as",
          "The place is absolutely awe inspiring and well worth a visit if you are in Toulouse. A must do. There is so much to take in. I would go again. We were only in Toulouse for a few hours and wanted to see as much as we could. Some beautiful paintings as well as some unusual things.",
          "Fascinating story behind architecturally impressive basilica. It was built in honour of a martyr saint and first bishop of Toulouse, it is also a major stopping place in the pilgrimage to Compostela. It's very well maintained, located off the beaten track but very accessible.",
          "Despite extensive road works around the church, it's very accessible. Lots of free literature telling the story of the building and the Saint. Was lucky enough to attend a free \"mini concert\" in the evening, featuring the huge organ, covering a selection of music, both sacred",
          "An incredible tour, so much beauty and history to take in. It\u2019s good to see repairs being undertaken as to lose such an incredible part of our history would be so very sad.",
          "I could only visit late in the evening, but the building exterior alone was worth the trip. Simply breathtaking architecture, and beautiful in the sunset light.",
          "It is a big building with not much glamor as in other European countries even though it is decorated. maybe it attracts due to the crypt- for payment. Saint Sernin was tortured and killed, according to the legend, not far from here- on grounds of church of Notre Dame du Taur,",
          "oh please, youhave to go here. a beauty, a marvel not to be miessed, if you go for roman architecture. it is a quite place, only a few coffe shops in one corner. which i do not understand. but all the better. i went there twice in one week taking piles of shots. all further",

          "An amazing old church. Went to mass & hard to concentrate in such an old church with so much history.",
          "We visited on a Sunday in July, and it was inspiring to sit and listen to the service whilst the organ played and the sunlight came through the windows. A stunning building full of character and life. Well worth a visit.",
          "In the heart of the pink city. The atmosphere were so calm and the place has something to say about the ancient tradition of Toulouse.",
          "This church is filled with history and is interesting to visit to take in the architecture. Free, quick & easy to take time to check it out.",
          "Another cathedral, another example of a house, and a lot of money, spent in the name of God. Probably reason for some disputes trough the history as well..",
          "Constructed between 1080-1120, added in 1998 to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, famed for its quantity and quality of its Romanesque sculptures. With its 115 metres in length, it is an imposing site, outside and inside, and has been extensively renovated over the past",
          "This seems a bit out of the way but isn\u2019t really that far from the city centre so walkable using the tourist map as a guide. The outside is pretty impressive but if you\u2019re a keen photographer you\u2019ll need a wide angle lens to fit it all in as it\u2019s surrounded pretty much by narrow",

          "Great concerts; often on Sunday afternoons! lovely acoustics and a large great organ! Amazingly cool!",
          "I am a. experienced church visitor but this place is quite astonishing. The sheer scale and design of this early church blows one away, very strongly recommended.",
          "It is difficult to describe how beautiful this church is. You have to see it with your own eyes and let your brain process the beauty it is beholding. Majestic might be one word to describe it. The Basilica of St Sernin is the largest Romanesque church still standing in",
          "If you like looking round romanesque churches I would say don't miss this one! It's immense, and all of a unity, and very beautiful. I arrived just after Sunday morning mass, and the organ was still playing (a real one, that is, not a recording) and that added to the atmosphere.",
          "A very nice visit here. The Basilica is well kept and looks like it's used. Many Cathedrals I've visited recently look they are more like museums than working churches - but this was obviously very much in use. Clean, with very nice windows throughout, amazingly spacious. Good",
          "The city is under renovations and roads around the Basilica are closed. The building is very nice. At walking distance from the Basilica is the river with very beautiful views.",
          "Majestic, stunning, inspiring, magnificent. One of the most spectacular cathedrsls I have seen, anywhere. Give yourself at least half an hour to wander and enjoy its interior.",
          "A very old church being refurbished currently. There are beautiful unrestored paintings on the walls, as well as carvings which amazed me. We were treated to an organ recital which echoed beautifully through the church. Well worth the time to sit and linger, people watch what",

          "Worth a visit. We caught an wee recital in an amazing arena. Incredible architecture with a special ambience.",
          "The church is quite lovely and beautiful to visit. When we were there, in the nave was a \"slide\" several feet high constructed of small wooden blocks placed in a very particular way. By pulley, you raised a wooden ball to the top. As the ball came down the slide, it played",
          "We came here on a self-directed foot walking tour. The church is impressive from both the exterior and interior. We stumbled into a organ rehearsal. This is a world famous instrument and we thoroughly enjoyed being able to hear it.",

          "The basilique Sain-Sermin is an impressive monument of religious art, impressive in dimensions and internal decoration. Simple, aired, and majestic. Very useful free booklets help the visitors with the orientation. Lucky visitors may also get to listen to an organ concert.",
          "A UNESCO world heritage site and has history, is the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe.",

          "This was down the street where we had a HomeAway, on rue du Taur, so it as the first thing we went to see...the octagonal steeple is characteristic of the area. Lots of detailed information on the history of the church and area in French, English, and Spanish",

          "On recommendation from a local friend we visited this church...... less than a 10 minute walk from our apartment.... it's beautiful. Just one comment (slightly negative); it's a shame there are \"electronic machines\" inside this church, selling maps etc...... it just looks out of",
          "World heritage sight. We spent more time than we realized. Largest Romanesque church in Europe. Rich history. Entry to crypt on the left for an extra fee well worth it.",
          "This place is a gem, it is very unusual in it\u2019s style and nothing prepares you for what is inside. Due to the leather inset internal door it is like it is meant to be a hidden secret. The architecture, carving, statues and paintings are breathtaking and it should be remembered",

          "A stunning church made mostly of brick and stones. The bricks are laid in interesting patterns on the exterior which is carried on in the inside. A very different but special and beautiful church. Worth a visit.",
          "Really interesting church with reliquary and crypt which you have to pay a small amount to access - plenty to see!",

          "I've been travelling to Toulouse for about 20 years and only decided to visit St Sernin weeks ago. It is not different from other religious places but its history is worth knowing. The neighborhood is very nice, and the narrow paved street that connects the big city hall square",
          "You must visit this if you're in Toulouse. Easy to find and easy to access. Free entry, and only \u20ac2.50 to see the crypts (which you can miss, in my opinion), but it's pretty chilly - so wrap up warm.",

          "The high ceilings are very imposing as you enter. Beautiful, long stained glass windows. It was very solemn during my afternoon visit. I did not get to visit the crypt as it was closed. Close to the Capitole.",

          "This is a huge building with a beautiful and unusual tower, but the main attraction for us was the crypt! You do have to pay a small entrance fee for the crypt (\u20ac2.5) but it is well worth it as it is hidden away and really quite unusual. It is full of relics and reliquaries of",
          "Visited on a weekend trip to Toulouse and you can see why this ranks number one on trip advisor. My advice, pay the few euros it costs and have a look at the crypt. The architecture and detailing is exquisite and for the cost it really shouldn\u2019t be missed. There is some work",

          "Although what one sees of Saint-Sernin as one passes from the busy thoroughfare is an imposing exterior of typical red brick with a very prominent bell tower, it is really quite modest on the inside. Considering other churches, Saint Sernin is bare of extravagance and consists",
          "Me and my partner visited on a sunday morning during a church service. We couldn't have a look all around because we remained respectful and sat in on the service for around 30 minutes. The atmospherics were amazing, when hymns were sung the sound travelled all around the main",

          "Interesting and unusual style of architecture. No entrance fee charges and certainly worth a good look round.",
          "This is a delightful church crammed full of Christian saints and martyrs. Dating back to 4th century of thereabouts the building is well kept and interesting to visit with helpful notices in several languages.",

          "Basilique Saint Sernin is located on the northern part of Toulouse at about a 10-minute walk from the city center. The interior is absolutely majestic and you find yourself spinning head up enjoying the grandeur of the building. I spent about an hour there and loved it.",

          "Great space. Amazing how those in the past built such buildings and to have lasted so long. For me praying and walking in a place where thousands of the great and good and not so, have done so is mind blowing. Liked the quiet side chapel for private time. Some interest modern",

          "A beautiful environment with a great sense of calm. A simply styled basilica with and interesting history. We were fascinated with this area - there was a flea market outside full of North African and Middle Eastern vendors. It felt a little unsettling as they were all men - no",
          "Great place to visit. Basilique is located in city centre, just 5 minutes of walk from main central square. From architecture, relics and tombs, many interesting things to see. Worth a visit!",
          "A bit quirky but well worth coming to see. A shame you can't go up the central tower, which is quite distinctive",
          "The basilique is beautiful, just the architecture itself was worth it, but also it truly inspired peace and some desire for introspection. Unfortunately at the very moment I visited the access to the tombs was closed for some renewal. The organ started playing majestically, this",
          "I think it is the most impressive church in town, part of the route for the pilgrims os Saint-Jacques de Compostela (there are special hours for pilgrims arrivals). The church has relics of several saints and is absolutely beautiful and a special atmosphere, hard to describe.",
          "A quite unusual church with an interesting tower. Internally its quite clear of clutter and therefore good to wander round. We enjoyed the visit as part of a day in Toulouse",
          "This is a big cathedral located about 5 min. away from the Capitol. It is worth visiting by your self, but having a tour guide will change your perspective on the place.",
          "Impressive in size both externally and more so internally. Historically important to the city. If you can catch a service do so - the organ sounds magnificent. You pay 2.5 euros to enter the crypt and it is worth this small fee. It is not far from a stop on the metro (Line B).",
          "An impressive church. The wall paintings are very interesting and well-preserved. Unlike a lot of churches, one can take photographs of everything. Highly recommended.",
          "This church is truly magnificent. It is well worth visiting and also welcomes pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago",
          "St. S. was built from the Toulouse red brick and was very large and impressive inside and out. If you like Romanesque, this is for you.",
          "The Basilica is in an area close the the university. Its off a side street so may need a little effort to find. Actually a stop on the French part of the Camino.",
          "Even by French church standards, this is a very impressive building. And, along the Rue Taur, there is another church that is very easy to miss that is also worth a visit.",
          "This is the former abbey church of St. Sernin located on the site of a previous basilica of the 4th century which contained the body of the first bishop of Toulouse in c.250. It was constructed in the Romanesque style 1080-1120 and is the largest remaining Romanesque building in",
          "The place was historically stunning and the architecture was so beautiful. The pipe organ which we can listen to the concert on Sunday impressed me also.",
          "As an art historian,I wanted to visit St. Sernin. It is remarkable. However, what I did not expect that enhanced the experience was to visit when there was a funeral mass. The music and liturgy ( and I am not Catholic) was so moving in this very old and very well preserved",
          "Both from the outside and the inside this is a magnificent church, decorated with splendid statuary. The crypt, which costs 2.50 euros admission, contains a number of fine bas reliefs, including a wonderful 11th-century Christ in Majesty. From the point of view of art history,",
          "It is a beautiful church, a few steps away from the Place du Capitole: not only is the stroll there quite please, but so is the view of the building itself.",
          "It is as a pellegrin that I visited this immense and beautiful piece of architecture and history and it is with great pleasure that I took the time to take a long tour by myself although I could have used a guide on site if wanted. If you visit Toulouse, St Sernin is a must!",
          "If you are visiting Toulouse and not visiting monumental sites you are not filling the visitor card. This is one of the Must See items.",
          "Interesting red brick former Abbey with frescoes and impressive Nave. Best visited early in the morning before tour parties arrive and whiz around the aisles.",
          "This is a wonderful piece of architecture, inside and out. The number of iconic figuerines sculpted around the altar are incredible! The whole work must be forty feet high. You really feel steeped in the Catholic tradition, and we spent several quiet minutes just looking at the",
          "This is a fine example of a cathedral done in the Romanesque style (round arches and vaults) predating the gothic period of cathedral construction more commonly used in northern France and England. Definitely worth a visit to compare the smaller fenestration and interior natural",
          "This stunning church in Toulouse has to be one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. Unfortunately I went inside on a Sunday during which a large mass was taking place so did not get the chance to see inside the crypt or really take in the splendour of the place properly.",
          "We were cutting through town and stumbled on Saint Sernin, we did not get chance to look inside but from the outside it looked truly fantastic, would loved to have spent more time there and I bet inside is truly wonderful.",
          "A magnificent example of Romanesque architecture and said to be the largest Romanesque church in Europe.",
          "Not expecting anything so special, we were delighted by how much there is to see in this magnificent building which is the largest Norman-style church in the world. It is definitely worth paying the few euros charge to see behind the main altar and visit the crypt. The church",
          "This is a shrine to a 5th century martyr (St. Saturnin) whose resting place became a highly popular pilgrimage site. The building is huge and impressive, with interesting things to see inside, including tombs in the crypt (fee). Probably the best sight in Toulouse. Nearby",
          "Oh how disappointing that visit was. No idea why it is no. 1 of things to do. I suppose you could say it's large, but apart from that it's very uninspiring. It looks like all the walls and columns have been washed, except for a very few that are still vaguely decorated.",
          "Having enjoyed reading about the history of this cathedral it was quite nice to see it in the flesh. As one of the largest remaining Romanesque buildings in Europe it's well worth a look. Try to visit on a day with good weather as the blue skies make for an awesome backdrop. We",

          "Our hotel recommended we visit as this Basilique has lots of history. When we walked in Mass had just started (Sunday) so we stayed. It was all in French but could follow (with our very limited French) what the reading, songs were. Lost it with the homily, didn't matter, the",
          "This is a beautiful building and worth walking to. On Sundays the area around the basilica provides space for many stalls alternating between the flea market, regular markets and brocantes.",
          "nice place, lot of history, nice soroundings. easy to reach, nice place to check while in tolouse. :)",
          "The Basilique is nice from outside but inside there's nothing special. So we recommend to visit only when you have it on your way (what you definitely gonna have ;) )",
          "A little disappointed to find it totally surrounded by an uncoordinated flea market - goods sprawled across the pavement and hung on the railings - which seemed completely out of place, especially with a funeral taking place inside at the same time. We couldn't really understand",
          "Some Cathedrals in Europe try hard to wow its visitors. A very few seem to have somehow attained more of a sincere spiritual impact. This is one of them.",
          "We slipped into the side door and waited for our eyes to adjust. The Basilique Saint-Sernin invoked awe with its flickering votives, golden altar, and vaulted majesty. The choir loft is elaborately carved and the organ pipes in the rear of the chamber are remote but",
          "For a cathedral it was rather underwhelming inside. It was much more stunning outside. It was plain inside and the pews looked very uncared for. Perhaps they are hoping for an injection of cash to renovate the place. There were guides available and if you are religious it was a",
          "The Basilique, set in the middle of the attractive Place St Sernin , stands imposing and majestic and oozing with history. It was constructed between 1080 and 1120 and became an important stop for pilgrims on the route to the Santiago de Compostella and would probably have",
          "This is a beautiful church. There is a lot to see there...also a lot to see along the rue du taur. Highly worth visiting if you are local",
          "This very large church is one of the oldest in France and truly awe inspiring. It is dedicated to a 3rd century bishop sent to the area by Rome. Under no circumstances should anyone visit Toulouse without seeing it. It is located less than 10 minutes by foot from the main square.",
          "Although it is obviously a rebuilt of the original cathedral, it blends well with the rest of the city and can be seen from a distance.",
          "Given its rating on Tripadvisor as the top attraction, I was expecting to be awesome. The tower and exterior of the church was interesting but I thought the inside was not well maintained or stocked, although there were guides available to show you around I didn't see any",
          "The Sunday market around the basilica spreading right out to boulevard de Strasbourg where the food and cakes are is a must if you are here. Lots of bits and bobs I've not seen before, leather sold by the yard, trinkets and avoid the cheap cigarettes! The Basilique is very",
          "Spent around 2 hrs here on a Saturday. Make sure you visit the crypt: small charge. What more can be said: if you like the history, calm, and architecture of great churches and cathedrals then you need to go.",

          "You can see why this magnificent building 'pulls in the crowds'. I dare say that it is the same reason that it was constructed in the fist place. This really is a breathtaking place to visit, worship in and just admire the architecture. For all the magnificence this",
          "Huge basilica with a very busy flea market on Sundays. Possible to visit the crypt for a small fee. Nice caf\u00e9s around.",
          "One of the biggest and best-preserved Romanesque churches of the south, a giant among piligrimage churches. OK, I studies the building in college, couldn't wait to see it when I spent a week or so in Toulouse thirty years later, and now, thirty years after that, saw it after",
          "Really beautiful church in the middle of the city. The church is certainly worth the visit and you might be lucky to hear the choir rehearse while you are there.",
          "The size of the basilica is impressive. I found it to be more beautiful from the outside than the inside. It has an interesting architecture especially with the tower and the brick-red tower. We didn't visit the crypt and we only made a short tour inside and then out!",
          "Travelling through France and Spain can leave one with church fatigue but this one is worth a visit. My first time in Toulouse which is a lovely city and the Basilica adds to the city's appeal. Lovely both inside and out.",
          "Very big and gorgeous (in old times I think) church, I can't say that it is something special but can be visited once. I found interesting that it was made from ordinary bricks in some parts :)",
          "Saint-Sernin is a huge and beautiful basilica to visit in Toulouse. The basilica is well-located and the architecture is amazing with many details. One of the most wonderful basilics that I had the chance to visit in France.",
          "I was enjoying the ceremony on Sunday morning in this church. Very beautiful hystorical building with many sculptures and pictures and colourful vitrages.",
          "One of the most beautiful basilics to visit in the south of France. The large stained glasses give impressive colours from the inside.",
          "This place was overrated. Would recommend Les Jacobins over this if you're short on time. The spire looks nice on the outside, but can't be accessed on the inside.",
          "This is a very nice church and I think one of the most visited in Toulouse.Builded in roman style with a beatiful bell tower and many chapels worths a visit free of charge.",

          "I visited this place on Sunday. Initially I went to see the church and I visited also very nice church. After my visit I also did shopping around this place. On Saturday and Sunday many people come here for shopping. It's kind of old market where all sellers come in thee Van",
          "A must visit if in this stunning city. Well wort spending an hour looking around the church. The architecture is superb and there are multilingual guide options.",
          "This is an interesting church but you have to pay to see the relics and boxes that hold them. I think the boxes are way more interesting than the relics. The best place for relics is the Residence in Munich. These boxes made me think of something Indiana Jones would have been",
          "This church is on the UNESCO list and is a must see item in Toulouse, it is both amazing and beutiful",
          "Reasonably well maintained basilica in a nice, serene surroundings. Indeed peaceful and divine experience",

          "Elegant, impressive, echoes within and without on Sundays the buzz of the flea market or brocante all around. A Toulouse landmark worth visiting",
          "Best is to arrive before 6pm so you can visit a part for a small entrance fee with access downstairs to lot of relics and \"chasses\" which are containers used for relics transportation. Some of the people working there are very passionate about this basilica history and would be",
          "Unusual church, with a great history. Do not miss the cloister. Tis style is not my favourite, but to each their own",
          "Beautiful and historic destination in Toulouse. For all - religious and those seeking a piece of French history. Quaint outdoor setting as well.",
          "Massive building which exudes class, tradition and history. Fantastic art work. Best to visit before the mass of tourists arrive.",
          "A beautiful structure inside and out. On Saturday and Sunday we strolled around the flea market surrounding the cathedral soaking up the sights and sounds.",
          "Georgeous basilique, one of the oldest ones in Europe. Although the entrance to the crypt is paid, it is definitely worth the extra money.",
          "The basilica is amazing and the visit is great. The area around the basilica is beautiful and inside, the church is very interesting. No wonder this is the number 1 attraction in Toulouse.",
          "Just stunning, nothing less! Beautiful church tower and exterior look, even more amazing decor inside! Many bars, cafes and restaurants near by. Free entry, but there is little fee of 2 euro should you wish to see the altar too.",
          "Beautiful basilica that has to be seen. The ceilings and walls are beautiful as are the windows. Literature is excellent.",
          "This is a must visit if in Toulouse. Plenty of history explained in French and English but mainly just worth seeing for how nice a building it is both inside and out",
          "This church is one of many around Toulouse but is one of the larger, more well known of the city. Set at the end of Rue de Taur, where it is said St. Stephen was dragged down tied to a bull, it has wonderful architecture. Once a regular stop for pilgrims en route to St. Jaques",

          "The size, grandeur and history of this Basilica make this a must stop to enjoy. It is recommended to take pictures from the east/northeast side to capture the entire Basilica. While the stop can likely be brief the views and moments to take make this a worthwhile stop.",
          "The rich history and religion here are overwhelming. A must see if you're in Toulouse. We enjoyed our visit immensely. The only thing that would have made it better for us was a guidebook or audio in English.",
          "Basilique St-Sernin, a massive structure and the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe. It is difficult to fully capture the immensity of this church due to its tremendous size, both from the outside as well as within. Stained glass windows alone are worth a visit.",
          "A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe was Southwest France's most important stop for pilgrims on the Way of St. James. It glows pink with the famous brickwork of Toulouse. Its marvelous stained glass looks uncannily modern. Its 12th",

          "A fabulous building that has a serene & calming atmosphere. It invites one to light a candle in remembrance of a loved one and this is what I did for my Mum. The building is quite plain but is all the more interesting because of it as the architecture is not overshadowed. There",
          "We spend our last Christmas (2015) in Toulouse and on the second day we visited this Basilica. This is just 15 mins walk from the metro station Capitol. This place is listed as a Unesco world heritage site and is the largest Romanesque church. The building is make of Red",
          "As a lover of religious architecture, I cannot recommend this location any more highly. Every nook and cranny is filled with religious significance, and no matter how much time you allow, you will run over as you marvel at what you see.",
          "Like most of these places it's well worth a visit to find out the history and background that surrounds it. Worth a visit.",
          "This huge but also simple and complicated at the same time is a must see for anyone visiting Toulouse. It has an extraordinary history dating back to the first bishop of Toulouse and was originally built in the 5th c. A major restoration project commenced in the 19th c. and",

          "Wonderful building set in its own square - well oval to be precise. but a fantastic monument both inside and out.",
          "The height of the ceiling, the length of the columns, the spacious domes\u2026Everything in the cathedral gives you the sense of the unreachable, and leaves you in a mathematical panic, feeling very tiny. When I went, someone was practicing the organ and I wandered around and lost",

          "The exterior grounds of the church were incredibly dirty - I couldn't help but wonder if there was an event earlier in the day because of the quantity. I hope so because it was a detractor. The church itself was beautiful and brought back memories of visits to Italy and some",
          "Saint-Sernin is one of the biggest attractions in Toulouse, nt least for organ lovers, who flock to hear Michel Bouvard play the exceptional Cavaill\u00e9-Coll. There's a souk-like market there on Sunday mornings, all rather 21st Century, really.",

          "I agree with a few other reviewers on here, in that I was slightly underwhelmed by the interior of the Basilique Saint-Sernin. I don't know if it's because the outside gave a very promising impression of what's within, or because there are so many other more beautiful churches",
          "The area is beautiful and the building is outstanding thanks to its bricks. They might be red but look pink like in most of Toulouse and this gives Toulouse its name \"Ville Rose\" (Pink city) and it sure is.",
          "Having seen so many churches, I am a bit \"churched\" out! So, this review is definitely biased. Because the church is so close to the Capital, you will probably come across it anyway but I think you would have to have a specific interest in church architecture to fully appreciate",

          "Nice place but you have to say the outside view of the tower (steeple?) is everything. Adorably lit up at night (as is everything in Toulouse) . Cant put my finger on it but something is disappointing on the inside (eg compared with Santa Maria del Mar in Barcelona)",

          "Located in the heart of the city, 5mn walk away from the city hall (the Capitole) this church will take your breath at the first look. Not only it\u2019s size and architecture makes it exceptional, it\u2019s color too. It has been build with red bricks and white stones which make this",
          "This is a beautiful, stunning place and worth a wander round. It is very impressive more so on the inside the outside I found understated. We were lucky and when we visited the organ was being played which added to the atmosphere.",
          "Romanesque tour de force. Great church in Toulouse - brought alive by the organ being played when I was visiting.",
          "We had passed through Toulouse several times but never had time to stop and check things out. St Sernin was our first stop. Very impressive and a must for historical vultures.",
          "One of the most beautiful churches from the Middle-Ages, St Sernin is a gem to be explored both Inside and outside. There are guided tours and they are well worth the time and tiny expense. The view from the first floor balcony is breath-taking. Best to go on a week-day. On",

          "Truly beautiful like so many other European churches. The signs outside were difficult to follow. It's easy to photograph from the exterior.",
          "Nice and impressive cathedral, it is good to visit it, if you are in Toulouse. I prefered Church of Jacobins, but this cathedral deserves your time too.",
          "Entering the Basicila we were immediately impressed by its size. I've visited quite some churches and cathedrals but don't think I've ever been in a Romanesque one of this size. Enjoyed walking around and good info in French and English in the side-chapels.",

          "If you visit one church inToulouse let it be this one. It is romanesque rather than gothic - a nice change.",
          "This church is remarkable mainly for two things: first, because it was completed over the amazingly short period of 40 years (from 1080-1120), it has an incredible uniformity of architectural style. Second, there are some amazing examples of early mediaeval sculpture. The best",
          "The largest cathedral in southern France, and possibly all of France. Visually splendid and fairly uniform in style. The more you look around--the outside and inside--the more you discover. I could visit the cathedral frequently and never get bored.",

          "What a stunning basilica \u2014 steeped in history and rich in iconography and masterful craftsmanship from floor to ceiling. What power and wealth the catholic church had in its heyday. Even if you're not religious, you definitely don't want to miss taking a tour of this building \u2014",
          "As I have said in my reviews here, if you have seen one of these, you have seen them all. There is very little to differentiate one from the other except perhaps in scale. And in that respect this is huge. But it is more impressive from the outside than the inside. It is",
          "It is worth paying a couple of euros to visit the treasures, some of which are genuine articles. The building escaped the ravages of the Revolution",
          "Learn the history, get your compostelle trail passport here or get it stamped. Free crypt entrance if student",

          "It is a must see while in town. It is a magnificent and massive Romanesque structure. To stand inside something that is over 1000 years old is absolutely amazing to me. There is no cost to visit.",
          "Awe inspiring and majestic architecture! I visit here every time I come to Toulouse. If you do not have much time to sight see put this at the top of your list. There is not much written information available at the Basilique so worth a quick background read before you visit.",

          "When you entering the church, you have a wonderful timpanon, one of the best what I ever seen from the roman period. The church itself with it huge and high belfry is not by chance one of the signs of Toulouse",
          "It is a beatiful basilique, but if you don't like over-crowded areas, avoid going on sundays (or search for it if you want a 0,5 EUR pair of socks to go with your basilique visit ;)).",
          "We visited the church on a Sunday and enjoyed the organ playing and the priest saying mass. Made for a very moving experience. It was a bit of an anomaly to have a Muslim market straight outside the cathedral. The exterior of this cathedral makes for some great photos.",
          "The most visited sight in Toulouse well worth a visit. There is a flea market outside on Sunday morning too.",
          "Just a beautiful church in a beautiful city. It dates quite far back and has a very interesting history and is charming in it's placement right in town, making it well-worth a stop.",

          "The Basilica is a true gem of Toulouse. The largest Romanesque church in Europe is large indeed: its magnificent austere exterior reminds me more of a fortified castle than a church. The interior is equally impressive in its solemn tranquility. Beautiful nave! I loved the",
          "Multi-cultural, all types of food, herbs and spices, fresh fruit and vegetables and everything else from trinkets and junk to bicycles (albeit a bit sus as to where they have come from), furniture and clothing. Visit in the morning as by lunchtime, everything is 'picked over'.",
          "Reputed to be the largest Romanesque church in Europe, the basilica is an architectural masterpiece and lesson. Be sure to read up in a guide, because the onsite documentation is not very good. Free entry to the basilica.",
          "Beautiful exterior. Inside it is quite solemn and really quite bare, though with some lovely stained glass. Also architecturally interesting",

        "wiki": "The Augustinian Convent of Toulouse was founded in 1286 for members of the Augustinian religious order.  It was first established outside the city walls, near the Matabiau quarter, then, between 1310 and 1341 moved to the corner of rue du Mus\u00e9e and rue des Arts.  In 1790 it ceased to be a convent and today its buildings house the Mus\u00e9e des Augustins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The construction of the convent ===\nIn 1269 a community of Hermits of St. Augustine was founded outside the city of Toulouse, near to the Montolieu quarter. The construction was due to the Chapter of Canons Regular of St. Sernin who undertook to build a convent in exchange for land and rights that newcomers granted them from the donations they had received (Departmental Archives of Haute Garonne, 101 H 638). As frequently happens in the history of religious foundations, this initial location proved inadequate to the needs of the community.\nIn 1309/1310, the hermits of St. Augustine obtained the Pope's Clement V approval to sell this first building, and purchase the land to build the existing buildings that lie within the walls of the city, in the parish of Saint-Etienne. The canons of Saint-Sernin objected to the transfer, but, in 1326 sold three houses to the hermits for the price of 3500 guilders in exchange of a part of the wax sheets received by the Augustinians for a burial.\nJean Lobres, prime contractor of Toulouse's cathedral participated in the construction of the apse of the church. The layout of the church is typical of the southern Gothic style. The apse has three chapels that open directly onto the large, single nave, there is no transept, and in the upper parts, sections have been cut out.  By 1341 the foundations of the monastery were well established.\nThe completed church was painted in the style typical of northern Spain during the first half of the fourteenth century and decorated with miniatures produced in the royal court at the time of Philip IVth of France (Philip the Fair). The campanile is built on a square and close to the chorus. Access is via the opening which is now located in the vestry. The construction of the eastern part of monastery began in 1341. Construction of the other three parts of the building were only begun in 1396 by the mason Jean Maurin. Ninety years later, in 1396, the cloister was completed.\n\n\n=== The fire of 1463 ===\nStarting on 7 May 1463 and lasting for nearly two weeks, a fire (started by a careless baker) destroyed much of the city of Toulouse. As was the case at the Carmelite convent, most of the roof collapsed. With the help of the faithful and the church, reconstruction of the roof began in 1495 through the work of masons Martin Pujol and Pierre d'Arroye. The work was quickly completed and the building was rededicated on 30 June 1504.\n\n\n=== The decline of the convent ===\nUp until the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the convent was home to two hundred monks. But then numbers started to decline; by 1518 there were no more than 140, and the fall continued. In 1649 there were only  60 and in 1680 there were only 31. By the time of the French Revolution only a few remained. In addition, in 1542, the convent was the victim of looting; many books and records were stolen from the Library, along with liturgical objects and valuable furniture. On 14 September 1550 (the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross), lightning struck the bell tower. The upper floors were destroyed, causing extensive damage in the surrounding area. This event marked the beginning of the decline of the monastery. The financial and material difficulties could not be overcome and the bell tower was never reconstructed, instead it was lowered by one floor.\nIn May 1562, in the aftermath of the revolt of the Huguenots, three Augustinians were flogged in public, apostatized, and married to three Augustinian nuns for having left their convent.  During this time, all the Augustinian nuns (bar one) of Toulouse became part of the Protestant Reformation, and the house was donated to the Jesuits (the Chapel of the Black Penitents).\nIn a decree of 2 November 1789 the convent became a national asset, and was decommissioned during the suppression of the monastic orders in 1790. Since 27 August 1795 it has housed the Toulouse Museum of Art.\n\n\n== See also ==\nToulouse Art Museum",

          "The museum is in fact an old Augustins Monastery, which gives it a fabulous square shape with a cute garden in the middle of it. It has several galleries dedicated to paintings and different time panels. This time, I had the chance to see an exhibition about the french",
          "We stop at the museum whenever we are in Toulouse, sometimes more than one times. Why? Great location, close to the Esquirol metro stop; down the avenue from the river and bridge; walking distance from the Capitale; etc. The gardens offer a place to sit and reflect, as well as",
          "Must go to place in Toulouse if you want to know the ancient culture and traditions. Worth exploring",
          "The Augustine monestary is a lovely exampleof southern Gothic architecture.It contains more than 4 000 paintings and sculptures by famous artist like Delacroix,Ingres, and Toulouse-Lautrec Unfortunately I could not load some great photos. You will have to take your own ones.",
          "Yet another great museum, set in a glorious building. Loved the gargoyles and medieval etchings. Loved the lights above the columns. A really lovely setting. Don\u2019t miss this museum.",
          "Most interesting museum with wonderful exhibits. I could have spent half a day there. Very convenient to Place du Capitole.",
          "Let's get down to the nitty gritty first, before I gush. Tickets for this museum cost \u20ac6. If you want to get an audio guide it will set you back another \u20ac2. Is the audio guide necessary? Well, I visited twice (as I had the Toulouse Pass Tourisme card). My first visit was",
          "Visited this museum and I was very impressed with its collection of paintings and sculpture from the Middle Ages to the early 20th century. There are over 4,000 items in the collection including works from Delacroix, Ingres and Toulouse-Lautrec. In the centre of the museum, I",
          "The reduced admission reflects the fact that the paintings were closed off (2n floor). I have to say the 1st floor exhibits were worth the admission.",
          "A must see with lots of great items. Great courtyard, great art, and OK sculpture also. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "The paintings rooms are closed, so the most important part of the museum is not accessible during this period. The building by itself and the exhibition about the transformation of Toulouse are not, in my opinion, worth the effort.",
          "It is almost worth going in for the building alone -- a beautiful, airy former monastery complete with cloister garden. But the collection, though fairly small, is also a joy, ranging from Roman capitals and Renaissance paintings to stonework from the Middle Ages. The organ is",
          "I was only able to visit for 20 minutes since the museum was closing, but I had a free pass to most Toulouse museums on my 24 hour tourist pass and so visited anyway - I wished I could come back and spend several hours",
          "A one time monastery now a museum with in interesting collection medieval statues and gargoyles. Also a big collection of capitals displayed very effectively.",
          "In about an hour, you can leisurely walk through the museum and enjoy the garden in the center. The cost was 6 euros.",
          "Even though the painting were unavailable on our visit, the use of space for the displays in this former church and convent was brilliant. Especially the capitals with the color coded lighting.",
          "Magnificent location for a museum. The building was originally the Augustinian convent built in 1309. After the French Revolution the Augustines were shown the door and it opened to the public as a museum. It\u2019s been a museum since. It revolves round a courtyard which is now a",
          "Disappointing. Pretty courtyard and some interesting (very old/crumbly) sculptures in the rooms surrounding. However turned out the gallery was closed - the lady at the desk said for the last 2 years?! Not worth \u20ac6.",
          "The museum is worth to see. Gargoyles from the Couvent des Cordeliers welcome you from the doorstep. Colored lamps and fa\u00e7ade elements, fixed on colored columns allow to see their details. There are also paitings and sculptures inside.",
          "Nice to visit, especially if you are art lover.. very old paintings and lot of history, dont forget that all information is in french.",
          "The building of this museum is very interesting. Particularly fascinating is the cloister and the old sculptures.",
          "It was disappointing that whilst refurbishing they have not taken the trouble to exhibit their more important paintings rather than just making them unavailable. Especially the \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e-le Brun and Guido Reni which in their publicity. Tsk!",
          "For the art and History lovers, this is a must go in Toulouse. We were in love from the beginning to the end with the visit.",
          "Absolutely beautiful to walk around, with some outstanding installations. Really cool to have such an old building with some really modern artwork in - a nice twist. Beautiful little courtyards here and there too. Recommended!",
          "This museum is so original. It is like a collection of rooms situated around a beautiful square garden. Each room has a different collection of art. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because ALL the staff were moody. I was also told off for using a selfie stick outside in the",
          "I had a few hours before catching my bus so I chose this museum. The collections that were available were interesting. Some of the descriptions were in English and Spanish but many were not. Two of the three main galleries of paintings were closed as was the church. It is a",
          "Beautiful building and great collections of medieval and Renaissance art. I would rate it much higher were it not for the fact that the best galleries of paintings are closed for renovation leaving the visitor with only a roomful of Academic and local painters. Quite",
          "A very good example of a high quality provincial museum. Don't expect the Orsay or Louvre and you won't be disappointed. A nice array of sculpture, paintings, architecture, and when we visited a very interesting modern and installation. Plus it is right next to a good grocery",
          "It's a great museum with a rich collection of sculptures and paintings. There is also an organ with weekly concerts that are a must-see.",
          "It is pleasant to walk in the Musee des Augustins. Personally I was impressed by the architecture more than by the art contained in the Musee, even though there are interesting pieces by Toulouse Lautrec and Rodin. It is certainly worth a visit.",
          "We spent a very good hour visiting this attraction. At \u20ac4 for adults it was well worth the money.the buildings are simply stunning and as it was a lovely sunny day the reflection of the sun on the bricks really bought out the colours. Some really interesting exhibits and the",
          "The museum is well maintained, well staffed and extremely pleasant. Entry fee of Eur 5 is minimal and the medieval sculpture is worth viewing whilst winding down and enjoying the serene environment.",
          "Another interesting public building to visit for its high cultural value. Historically the church and its cloister are secluded havens of peaceful ambiance. The colonnaded cloister goes around the grassy central courtyard and gives access to other museum chambers were",
          "This museum is great for a visit on an afternoon. There are lot of exhibits and the garden is nice. There is an entrance fee - 5 \u20ac for adults and free for kids.",
          "If, like me it was raining in Toulouse and you wanted something cheap to do (free for students!) then Mus\u00e9e Augustins is for you. It's got a lot of sculptures downstairs then upstairs there's an interesting light exhibition. Up again and there is an extensive collection of art.",
          "Several important pieces by masters, well displayed in the church. Sunlight coming in the high windows enhanced paintings utilizing light for central subjects. In the upstairs gallery, some pieces were mounted too high to see well. Many very nice pieces were of local interest.",
          "Highly recommended museum developed around a exquisite garden. A variety of sculptures, paintings etc from different periods presented in very well preserved manner. Entrance fee very small for what you get to see. Overall very impressed.",
          "The interior courtyard is a beautiful place to enjoy. The fine art collection is well selected. The Jorge Pardo design for the CAPITALE collection is wonderful and intensely colorful. The museum takes about two hours to cover. It is worthwhile to get the audio headset. A",
          "We enjoyed a good couple of hours here. There's a strong religious theme to quite a lot of the exhibits, which won't be everyone's cup of tea, but there are a lot of very interesting things to see, and the building itself is very impressive, including a beautiful courtyard &",
          "The museum is a former monastery, built in the 14th and 15th centuries. This lovely old building provides a wonderful atmosphere in which to display art. Perhaps fittingly for a former monastery, the majority of art on display is of a religious nature. The old church provides",
          "This place Toulouse has the great work of the sculpture and art of the medieval times to contemporary . The display here is a treasure to times and will remain so . The stunning architecture will leave you with a glory of the art and the craftsmanship . The experience of being",
          "one of the best collection of sculpture and paintings from the Middle Ages to the early 20th century, including a unique collection of Romanesque works. A great place to visit!",
          "I've been to a few places in France however for a combination of beautiful architecture, art work: historical and contemporary, atmosphere, history and future for me, for 5\u20ac it had it all! Would definitely visit again if only for the extreme pleasure of the oh so peacefulness of",
          "Great place to visit, will only take 1 to 3 hours to complete, depending on how interested you are in sculpture and medieval art. However, the garden is fantastic and some of the paintings would MOMA or the Louvre",
          "Wonderful old monastery with a beautiful cloister. Decent selection of art with a lot of religious sculpture.",
          "This museum is well located on the Rue de Metz. It is set in an old monastery and the buildings are around a central courtyard garden. The museum has wonderful architecture, inside and out. There are sculptures and paintings and other artifacts. The former church area has",
          "We did only see the museum from the outside which is really a nice place and buildings, if the inside is as nice it is clearly worth a visit.",
          "Easy to access - clean - well maintained - well staffed museum. Worth a visit. A nice way to spend an afternoon in Toulouse. There is even a little courtyard garden - but it could use more of a green thumb!",
          "I went to visit this museum on Saturday 1:00pm and I did have a high expectations. Unfortunately, they have to close it for an hour because they didn't have enough staff. So I went back there. It was kind of average collection of paintings and sculptures.",
          "This was one of the main museums that I tried to fit in to a limited window of time the museum its self consisted of 3 main sections which was the church, museum and art gallery I must warn that if you don't like more dated art and sculptures this isn't the place for you I would",
          "Nice Museum & historic building in central Toulouse. Interesting exhibits and grounds. Free on the 1st Sunday of the month.",
          "We appreciated the setup of the museum with different spacious rooms that are all different so that you don't get bored easily while walking through the museum. The building is really a nice location for this collection.",
          "Besides an enormous collection of medieval art from the three primary churches in Toulouse, this museum has an installation of column capitals, primarily 12th century, arrayed in a room designed by the Cuban-Mexican artist Jorge Pardo. You will be amazed, knocked out, entranced",
          "We enjoyed this museum and its beautiful spaces, with sculptures, paintings and statues. It is a digestible size with good quality pieces. Glad we visited!",
          "Harking back to the 14th and 15th century this former monastery has been restored and re-purposed as a museum back in the late 1700s not long after the establishment of the Louvre in Paris. It is home to a variety of Gothic sculptures, large format works of the French and",
          "This is not your average museum. The work is spread out throughout three separate buildings which at one time housed monks. It was very fun and informative. Loved it and worth a visit.",
          "Wasnt expecting much, but some of the rooms are filled with very good XV century paintings. Some very famous painters are represented here.",
          "There is lots to see here. Nooks and crannies filled with sculpture and paintings donated to the museum from all over make it very worthwhile to spend several hours here. Gardens are a delight, too.",
          "Really enjoyed this centrally located museum, the medieval sculptures were particularly amazing, well worth the trip on their own",
          "A friend and I were lucky enough to be in Toulouse the first Sunday of May and entrance to the museum was free. This museum is small but full of interesting objets d'art arranged in small rooms. Some rooms have only paintings, some only sculptures and others a mixture. I enjoyed",
          "My wife and I luckily stumbled across the museum whilst in Toulouse for a day and were told 'there's a party tonight, with music and chatting and fun'. Slightly confused we realised seeing posters every museum in Toulouse was open from 7pm to midnight for free, for the one",
          "The cloister garden is as beautiful as it is peaceful with benches for you to sit, reflect and enjoy the calm. The museum has several themed areas with gothic sculptures and art work. Finally the church is breath taking. Well worth a visit.",
          "This is a beautiful building and well worth visiting no matter what special exhibitions are on as the central garden, the architecture and the permanent exhibits are all interesting and beautifully presented. Certainly a quiet reflective contemplative gem in the City.",
          "This is a great Museum to visit although I would suggest you allow a full hour to look over it in some detail. As with most former Monasteries it had taken a fair amount of bashing about but has been brought back to life with a wonderful exhibition of sculptures and statues and",
          "We enjoyed seeing a collection of unique and unusual objects, paintings, and sculpture in a centuries-old building.",
          "Lovely experience in this magnificent building. Very helpful staff and a mix of modern and old. Beautiful working garden in the middle of the the grounds, well worth a visit.",
          "The monastery has been turn into a museum,a former Augustine monastery has now a very nice selection of picture art and a few Toulouse Lautrec,etc. All rooms are very interesting but for me the sculptures where different ,especialy the one in title ,first day at school,look at",
          "Interesting and varied collections in a fabulous setting. I was particularly impressed with how the works were lighted so that they called to you. The temporary exhibition theme was courtyards. They provided a detailed handout in English of the temporary exhibit.",
          "The Musee des Augustins is housed in a former Augustine monastery, a historical monument in itself of southern Gothic architecture. The monastery dates mainly from the 14th and 15 century. The museum has four exhibits halls: a Gothic Sculpture Gallery, works from 15th to the",
          "Supposed that it will be just a visit to monastery and inner yard, but haven't expected such a rich collection of picture art (even Delacroix and Toulouse-Lautrec) and column caps from XII century churches, selection of bronze and marble statues. The most peculiar - collection",
          "This medieval convent has been turned into a museum that houses a first rate medieval collection of sculpture from the surrounding churches. It also has a very interesting collection of paintings (mainly nineteenth and twentieth century) on the upper floor. The cloister offers a",
          "Lovely and eclectic collections, from 13/14 century gargoyles and medieval wall paintings, to 15th-17th paintings in a chapel to the 17th-20th century painting galleries. English in most sections although full translations are missing.",
          "Architecturally one of Toulouse's most attractive buildings The temporary exhibition (as of March 2017) on the subject of Courtyards in art, was a model of how to take a group of works only a few of which could be called masterpieces and make an interesting show of them:",
          "Visited this museum on a Monday as we had time to spare before heading for airport and nothing much open on a Monday. So glad we did visit as this was one of our highlights. Suggest you use the audio guide to make the most of it.",
          "There's currently a wonderful exhibition of art through the ages with the courtyard as its theme, (it works, trust me) quite apart from the fantastic permanent galleries of vast French masterpieces upstairs, the cloisters, the modern display of salvaged columns, the statuary and",
          "Well worth a visit if in Toulouse. We spent over two hours there. It is a beautiful and very old building while the are collection has a mixture modern paintings and ancient stone work. Use the audio guide.",
          "This museum of Arts is housed in a former convent which became a Museum after the French Revolution. Along one of the cloisters is an array of gargoyle statues which allow the visitors to look closely at their features. There are paintings by Toulouse Loutrec, Delacroix,",
          "This would be a MUST for any visit to Toulouse. The cloisters were wonderful, the art inside a nice overview of mostly French sculptures (marbles) and paintings. There was also a small contemporary show on inside, which was great fun.",
          "The building itself is incredible, and the artwork, while perhaps not the best in Europe, tells a great story. If you are in Toulouse, make this a destination. The artwork ranges in era, from religious to landscape to later, and the statues also are a wide range. Well-signed",
          "Beautiful building, former church of the Augustins Order, which is hosting several art collections inside. We visited the paintings section (quite a rich collection with impressive paintings, I especially liked the ones of Philippe de Champaigne, Delacroix, Toulouse-Lautrec),",
          "the building itself, with the cloister &the staircase, is beautiful; the exhibits (roman capitals from local churches and cloisters that have been destroyed) are amazing, the first floor however, which hosts 19th paintings looks very dated",
          "Art, sculpture and history all in one, very interesting and informative. The architecture is fascinating but there is a lot of walking and steps to climb. Lovely cloisters and quiet spots in the gardens to just sit and take it all in. There was some building and restoration work",
          "Excellent collection of religious sculptures and French and Italian paintings from the 15-17th centuries. Not many people if you visit during weekdays early in the morning. Very pleasant visit.",
          "It was a rainy and a cold day when we visit Toulouse and we wondered what to do. We went to the Musee des Agustins and it was such an interesting place to visit including having a garden in the middle of this previous church compound. Their collection of paintings, sculptures,",
          "It's one of the biggest museums in Toulouse! Paintings and Sculpturs, not Modern Art! Not famous for its paintings of renowed painters, but it has a nice selection! They have a temporal expo by Jorge Pardo that is just breathtaking!",
          "It is monastery turned into museum - so you can se beautiful example of gothic architecture, nicely preserved. Inside fantastic exhibitions. Gothic sculpture galleries are absolutely outstanding! That's my favorite part of the museum, but there is so much more to see. Very rich",
          "I ended up spending almost two hours there,just so I can observe and enjoy every part of it. Impressive and lots to see.",
          "This was an unexpected gem. A great expo going on...well worth a visit to get a little history of Toulouse",
          "I really recommend to visit this place for sightseeing. It is really worth seeing with very good paintings and sculptures.",
          "Starting with the cloister, which is quite splendid, this is an important museum for anyone interest in medieval art and architecture. There are lots of Gothic statues, gargoyles, devotional items and, above all, a wonderful group of capitals. These have been arranged by a",
          "This exhibition is a \"pot-pourri\" of art work . Some great scupture and paintings and also a great collection of \"capitols\" that have important interest but did not hold mine throughout. Notwithstanding, you should visit is museum.",
          "Museums by their very nature display artifacts of interest. But it is rare to have the display of the artifacts to be as interesting as the items on display. The Mus\u00e9e des Augustins capitalizes on its beautiful historic structure and courtyards to creatively display familiar",
          "I really liked the layout of this museum and found the English audio guide very helpful. If you get tired walking around the museum you can stroll into the nice garden in the center of the complex and relax on the benches there.",
          "There are many reasons to expose yourself to art. The Musee des Augustins is an expansive setting for the open-minded to consider Western civilization's depictions and perceptions through the ages. There is sculpture here from modern and medieval eras, French, Spanish, Dutch,",
          "I would definitely recommend to go when in Toulouse, also given that there isn't a huge amount of things to visit in the city. I enjoyed visiting it - there was not too much and I mostly focused on the highlights. A couple of hours well spent and besides the building itself it's",
          "Many different periods and themes to choose from and spent sufficient time on a section rather than trying to get around the entire space. It is huge. Easily accessed with many cafes and shops nearby the gallery museum is restful with the surge of Toulouse going on all around.",
          "Super museum, with a lot of history, its not expensive to go in (5 euros) and you can enjoy the garden and all. Good location near to transports (metro Esquirol), take at least 3 hours to be inside.",
          "We fell upon this and we're rewarded with a free visit today. Some very ancient religious sculptures good to view. Quiet little courtyard where you can have a drink and a little break from the heat of the day. Recommend.",
          "This a fantastic museum with plenty of paintings and sculptures to see. We had our 9 year old with us and he also enjoyed it. We spent about an hour here and it was only 10 Euro for 3 of us so great value.",
          "we enjoyed the impressive church, delicate sculpture and this recent exhibition of the 'sculpture romanes' . The way they have been set is fantastic : between ancient and modern, we took many pictures. well worth the \u00a35!",
          "It's a sudden plan and visiting here. So that city center is quite little busy and we went here also on Sunday so there is free access area only available to see inside. So we went and see those pictures and paintings. It's quit interesting. If you visit that some other days",
          "Not the most interesting collection for a big museum like this. There is one hall that's just columns. Hundreds of them...",
          "Really enjoyed out potter around this well laid out museum. There is a lovely courtyard where you can rest and let everything sink in, great deckchairs! The layout of sone if the exhibits is unique and there are a significant number of English details given, something lacking in",
          "Visited it with my wife and three kids for the whole morning. We all lobed it including the kids. The display is beautiful especially the sculptures and the display on top of the columns on the second floor. The cloister is a peacefuk place where someone could spend a whole",
          "Worth the time, not expensive to visit and the 2 euro guide makes all the difference. It has a mix of art, sculpture a large, airy cloister and gardens plus a long row of gargoyles!. Something for everyone.",
          "We started our Bastille Day here at the Musee des Augustins. It has a marvelous collection of architectural sculpture, artistic sculpture and paintings. I particularly enjoyed the Toulous-Lautrec pieces in the painting gallery. The presentation of column capitals in the gallery",
          "The building is huge very well located close to the square of the capitole. Nice if you like history",
          "This is a wonderful collection of exhibits and is beautifully organized. It was true key fascinating especially the lower level which was largely devoted to materials form the Middle Ages. The upper level has a very large collection of paintings- some from world famous artists",
          "Best among the places I visited in Toulouse. The room decorated by Jorge Pardo will stay in memory. A large collection of sculptures and paintings mostly from the region.",
          "this museum is set up in the old Augustin convent Interesting art collection and history of the city",
          "The building is amazing and the exhibitions are fascinating. The garden in the middle of the building is just gorgeous. I was there on the first Sunday of the month and it was free, apparently this is always the case. There are also activities for children if you come with small",
          "This was a really well balanced museum with something for everyone. It is not too big and not too small, perfect to see everything without running through the teens' attention span. Highly recommend.",
          "The museum has plenty of sculptures, lovely cloisters etc to see for 5 euros. The ticket allows you to pop put for lunch and return later to complete your visit. Lots to see and a good way to spend a few hours, especially if wet!",
          "Its great to see all the pieces of art in this museum, however its sad that the light on the paintings are now in a good position, they make reflexes and its dificult see all the details of the paiting. Still they have and amazing garden and the church and the exposition and all",
          "Different things to see - statues, huge rooms with art, old chapel, modern light installation, and courtyard garden. Not a Must See, but reasonable if you have time. Not open on Tuesdays.",
          "Free the first Sunday of every month. Lots of very well exhibited items from ancient sculpture to interesting paintings on the first floor. The building and garden alone are worth a visit, and there was a dramatic performance in the garden the day we visited.",
          "Des Augustins is in the middle of the city centre. This museum is inspiring. There are lots to see from pairings to sculptures and a wonderful garden. A must see when in Toulouse.",
          "First, it costs only 5\u20ac for a normal ticket and free for a student. Second, I was impressed by this big and beautiful building and church. Third, the way the statues and paintings were shown here are very beautiful and impressive. Fourth, highly recommended!!",
          "This is the place in the centre of Toulouse or sculptures and painting. I believe entry is free the first Sunday of every month, coinciding with the traffic-free day.",
          "Very interesting exhibition! Worth visiting! I love the Gothic architecture and Romanesque sculptures from the 12th to 15th Centuries. I've visited also the temporary exhibition hall, very beautiful paintings. Never seen such beautiful paintings in Asia before, therefore I am",
          "Makes for an interesting afternoon exploring the history of the region; we particularly enjoyed the sculptures and the gisants (French, \"recumbent\") which give you a sense of life as a knight in the middle ages. Do take the guided tour head set, it really helps to get the",
          "The museum has a beautiful collection of gothic sculptures, a well-displayed room of romanesque capitals, some interesting nineteenth century paintings. The gargoyles from the Convent des Cordeliers displayed in the cloisters are remarkable. There was a temporary exhibition",
          "Interesting column exhibition. But the painting collection is extremely crowded and mixed with paintings hanging all along the wall in a rather random order so that it's even quite hard to find the descriptions for certain paintings.",
          "On a wet wintry day, I spent over an hour here: lots of sculptures and gigantic early paintings. I enjoy going to galleries but I am no expert when it comes to art, so I am not in a position to comment on the quality of the works on display. But the building is magnificent.",
          "Great museum in beautiful setting of an old monastery. Its probably not that interesting for young kids though.",
          "My museum time limit has shrunk as I've aged, and now two hours is about the max I can do before my feet start hurting. Well, maybe 3, but definitely not more. The Musee d'Orsay and Louvre in Paris are both so huge that I always leave before I've seen half the art, or else",
          "Wonderful museum in stunning building. Artefacts well laid out. Go there for the beauty of the building as much as the contents.",
          "Lovely building from outside but apart from the sculptures many of which you can see from the street outside there seems to be nothing here. It really COULD be amazing and probably will be one day. But isnt right now.",
          "On a rainy morning, this was an excellent choice to while away a couple of hours examining the Medieval tablets, statues and paintings. The \u20ac5 entrance charge is modest, considering the size of the complex of buildings and rooms. The cloister and garden with deck chairs was",
          "The museum is amazing - walking round the cloisters with a tree full of sparrows singing in the sunshine! A beautiful building with Gothic architecture - the vaulted ceilings in many of the rooms, the structured tower and the exhibition of sculptures make this a must to visit.",
          "Spent an hour and a half admiring the sculptures and some enormous paintings. Mainly early work with a few cotemporary items. The building is a delight too. English map and guide avail. 5 Euros entry.",
          "Great place to visit, on many levels, disability lifts available. A small fee charged but well worth a visit.",
          "Lovely building but the exhibits were not as inspiring as I had hoped. Gardens were nice and the price at 8euros p.p was not too bad. A pleasant way to while away a hour.",
          "The building itself is very nice. The exhibition with the sculptures maybe interesting for some but wasn't that for me. So if you have some time left during your visit in Toulouse take the time to walk through the building.",
          "This is a really big museum with lots of sculptures and paintings . Very polite staff, nice prices and good information system. The area with the paintings is very stunning even though all the tablets below those were only in French , which was really very difficult for the",
          "We were blown away with the cloisters and garden enclosed. A beautiful working garden right in the centre of the city. The fine art paintings were a joy and the presentation of the ancient stone artifacts with modern lighting was genius. Thoroughly enjoyed our visit.",
          "An interesting art collection that is presented in a bit of a random manner. Much more information on the works of art should be posted so that visitors could better appreciate what they are seeing. The building itself is worth seeing.",
          "Each time I go to Toulouse I make time to visit this small but perfect museum. The setting is beautiful, the entrance fee is modest, and the collection is wonderful. On entering you walk through a cloister along a long line of gargoyles. The opportunity to see these mediaeval",
          "For me, the art, while interesting, was secondary to the setting. The cloister is beautiful, and I want to spend days and days in it, studying each of the gargoyles individually, looking at each of the plants and trees growing in the garden, and generally feeling the peace and",

          "Beautiful cloisters around a herb garden enclosed by very different exhibitions on all sides. Wonderful Roman and medieval works with large statuary you can examine at close hand. Not really into 18/19C Romantic stuff but upstairs gallery full of very large bucolic paintings. My",
          "Musee des Augustins was filled with great art and sculptures, but for having so many staff members guarding the place I didn't feel very engaged. I would have like the staff to offer some information on the artwork on display. However it did have some great community links,",
          "All the guide books point to this as a great collection, but I found it underwhelming. At least one major section was closed; the large, old-style galleries of French 18th and 18th century pictures was frankly boring; the staff seem uninterested. Not one I would return to.",

The museum however is not huge and walking through",
          "The best thing about this museum is the building itself. It's worth visiting just for this. In addition you get to see a bunch of religious relics, statues and paintings. You even get to see some Toulouse Lautrec. Worth a quick visit, especially if you go on one of the days that",

          "This is in the best tradition of spacious French museums, some of which are outstanding. For anyone interested in Romanesque sculpture, this is a must - and the only reason to divert from Moissac to Toulouse. However, for those many who are not acquainted with the incredible",
          "I was surprised to find an amazing collection of paintings there.",
          "The architecture of this former monastery is itself more than worth the 3\u20ac entrance price. There are four galleries: Romanesque (12th century) sculptures and Gothic (14th/15th c.) sculptures, paintings from the 17th to 20th c., and combination of the two media from the 15th to",
          "Our visit had an air of serendipidy about it as we came across the museum on our way to Les Abbatoirs (very disappointing, btw) and decided to go in. Also entry was free on the day we went, which is always a pleasant surprise. It is almost worth going in for the building alone",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed visiting the Mus\u00e9e des Augustins. Had I only seen one part of it, it would have been worthwhile. The row of stone gargoyles on pedestals looking out onto the courtyard, the courtyard of the cloister planted with herbs, the different galleries housing",
          "Honestly speaking, I ran through the collection rooms with the speed of light, I am not a big fan of the art shown in this museum. However, the museum is worth visiting, there is no doubt about it. Both, the monastery, as well as the cloister are simply beautiful. And amazingly",
          "Lovely location inside an old monastery with some beautiful cloisters and preserved gargoyles. The variety of art and sculpture is wonderful. If you are under 25 it is free entrance. Highly recommended.",

          "Spend a few hours in this little haven from the bustle of the city. First greet the grounded gargoles in the cloister, then take a slow visit through the first floor room full of romanesque capitals. Then pull out a book and relax on a bench by the garden. There are paintings",
          "A fascinating museum inside a former monastery. Great collection of paintings, sculptures and architectural elements. Neat garden in the middle of the cloister with kinds of flowers and foods (artichoke bushes! strawberry plants!) makes for great photos. This food is all",
          "This museum was really a great surprise. Unfortunatelly we only had 1 hour for the visit and could not enjoy the masterpieces as long as we would have liked. Next time I will be in Toulouse, I hope to find the time to finish the visit.",
          "Recently,I spent several days enjoying fine paintings and sculpture at Toulouse's huge,Musee de Augustins. I studied French Medieval Sculpture and Romanesque Sculpture from several Toulouse houses of worship. I studied and enjoyed fine paintings by Perugino,Gabriel"

        "wiki": "The Church of the Jacobins is a deconsecrated Roman Catholic church located in Toulouse, France. It is a large brick building whose construction started in 1230, and whose architecture influenced the development of the Gothique m\u00e9ridional (Southern French Gothic) style. The relics of Thomas Aquinas are housed there. In the two centuries following the dissolution of the Dominican Order at the time of the French Revolution, it served various different purposes before undergoing major restoration in the 20th century. In the early 21st century, it was partially converted into a museum.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name Jacobins is the nickname that was given to the Dominican Order in the Middle Ages. Their first convent in Paris was located in the rue Saint-Jacques, (Latin Jacobus), and that name came to be attached to the order itself.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First church ===\nIn Languedoc in the early 13th century, Catharism, which the Catholic Church considered a heresy, was strong and growing. In 1215, the future Saint Dominic founded in Toulouse a small community of monastic preachers to combat the heresy, and starting in 1230, the friars began the construction of a small church in which to preach. Built entirely of pink Roman brick, this first building was half as long and half as high as the present church, and very simple in design, in line with the order's vow of poverty. It consisted of a double nave, one side for the friars, and one for the congregation, separated by pillars and screens.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\nOver the next century, as congregations grew, the church was enlarged and embellished. Between 1245 and 1252, it was extended with the addition of a choir with side chapels. Between 1275 and 1292, the height of the choir was increased, and a vaulted roof constructed. In response to the technical difficulty posed by creating a vaulted roof for the new space, the builders installed one oversized column in the centre from which the ribs radiated outwards in all directions. This feature has come to be known as Le Palmier des Jacobins, the palm tree of the Jacobins.Between 1275 and 1315, the height of the choir was increased, and high windows created above the chapels. The seven-storey bell tower was also added at this time.\nStarting in 1325, a new, higher vaulted roof was constructed for the nave in order to bring it into line with the choir. The last component of the century-long expansion of the church was the construction of the chapel of Saint Antonin (separate from the church itself), between 1335 and 1341.\n\n\n=== Relics ===\n\nThomas Aquinas, author of the Summa Theologiae and canonised in 1323, was a member of the Dominican order. In 1368 Pope Urban V decreed that his remains be transferred from Italy where he died to the Jacobins, the mother church of the order. When they arrived in 1369, they were placed in a stone reliquary beside the altar. After being moved to Saint Sernin at the time of the Revolution, they were returned to the Jacobins in 1974 when the restoration of the church was complete.\n\n\n=== Dissolution ===\nFollowing the French Revolution of 1789, the Dominican order was banned, and the friars forced to leave. In 1804 the conventual complex including the church became the property of the city of Toulouse, and in 1810 the emperor Napoleon requisitioned the church and converted it into a barracks. Floors were installed to create upper storeys for dormitories, while stables and an armoury occupied the ground floor. During the period the building served as a barracks, the stained glass windows were destroyed, and the medieval paintings in the choir were painted over with whitewash.\n\n\n=== Monument and museum ===\nCitizens who were appalled at the destruction succeeded in 1861 in convincing the army to move to new barracks. In succeeding years, the building housed an exhibition of Arts and Industries (1865), served as a playground for the pupils of the nearby Lyc\u00e9e Fermat starting in 1872, and as a place to safely store treasures from the museums of Paris during World War I.Several periods of restoration work were undertaken over the course of the 20th century. In 1905 the floors installed by the army were removed; starting in 1923 blocked windows were uncovered and stained glass installed; between 1953 and 1963 the chapels were reconstructed; and between 1965 and 1974 the whitewash covering the medieval murals was removed. Today the building functions as a museum.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe round arch at the base of the south side is a vestige of the original romanesque church, while the three solid buttresses correspond to the double-nave layout of the interior which was retained as the church grew. Otherwise the Jacobins is considered a leader in the development of the Gothique m\u00e9ridional (Southern French Gothic) style. One of the most typical characteristics is the fact that it is constructed entirely of brick. Also characteristic is the style of the south wall between the buttresses. Each section consists of a tall Gothic ogival (pointed) arch with a small rose window at the top, and below that a lancet window. The spaces between the buttresses of the nave also show the same ogival arch, in which is set a tall, narrow triple-lancet window. There is hardly any decoration, which is considered to have been a conscious choice aimed at differentiating this church from the highly elaborate Gothic of northern France.The nave also served as a model in the development of Southern French Gothic architecture in presenting a very unified space. The double-nave layout, however, one side for the friars and the other for the congregation, turned out to be inconvenient and was not imitated, whereas the choice of columns to support the Gothic vaulted roof was. Each slender column, only 1.4 metres (4 feet 7 inches) in diameter for a height of 28 metres (92 feet), including 22 metres for the stone shaft (72 feet), supports eight of the ribs of the vaulted ceiling, and the six columns divide the nave into six bays. A seventh column continuing the same line supports the 22 ribs of the vaulted roof of the choir, the famous Palm Tree. This masterpiece is considered a precursor to the complex structures of the later Gothic.\nPictures\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "We visited this wonderful church that is where the Dominicans began and St. Thomas Aquinas is buried. This unusual church has a split nave with tall center columns and a small altar. It is best known for its \"palm tree\" columns. Some of these have mirrors at the base so you",
          "Amazing place !. The church gives us the feeling to be so little with its height . don't forget to walk around the cloister it's really worth it. Regularly, there're some exhibitions or concerts so don't hesitate to inform you to see what's going on when you'll visit this",
          "I do not have much to say as I was just totally wowed - this is a very beautiful convent, with some unusual architecture. I believe, there are more reviews of the church, as the cloister (courtyard) worth the separate money, but god it worth it! I sat there half an hour just",
          "If you visit Toulouse, you must visit this convent. Don't be put off by having to walk round the back to get in, it is well worth it. The church and cloister are both absolutely wonderful. I am amazed that there are not more reviews!!"

        "wiki": "The H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat in Toulouse, France, is a French Renaissance h\u00f4tel particulier (urban palace) of the 16th century which houses the Bemberg Foundation, a major art gallery of the city.\nThe H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat differs from the other Renaissance townhouses in Toulouse not only in size and its exceptional ornementation, but also in its pristine condition, a fact which earns it a mention in every overview of French Renaissance. Today, it is home to the Union des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s savantes and the Bemberg Foundation. It is one of the first manifestations of French classicism.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat was likely built by Toulouse architect Nicolas Bachelier for Pierre d'Ass\u00e9zat, an internationally renowned Toulouse woad merchant. The construction of the H\u00f4tel began in 1555 and was not yet completed when Pierre d'Ass\u00e9zat died in 1581. It is an outstanding example of Renaissance palaces architecture of southern France, with an elaborate decoration of the cour d'honneur (courtyard) influenced by Italian Mannerism and by classicism. The use of brick is typical of Toulouse. The H\u00f4tel now belongs to the City of Toulouse and was restored in the 1980s.\n\n\n== Presentation ==\nPierre Ass\u00e9zat was at the height of his social and professional success when he launched the construction of his mansion close to the Merchant Exchange, of which he had been one of the founders. Nevertheless, he did get caught up in the religious troubles of the time. A Calvinist convert, he was obliged to leave Toulouse after attempting to seize the town along with his fellows capitouls in 1562. He recanted ten years later and returned to his townhouse in Toulouse where he died in 1581.Ass\u00e9zat launched the first phase of construction in 1555\u20131557. The main L-shaped structure was built along with the staircase pavilion in the corner. The stonemason Jean Castagni\u00e9 was entrusted with carrying out the masonry works defined by the architect Nicolas Bachelier. The designs of the fa\u00e7ades, featuring twin columns which develop regularly over three floors (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian), takes their inspiration from the great classical models such as the Coliseum. The capitals also precisely adhere to classical models, known from engravings. The erudite architecture\u2014its source can also be traced to the treatises of the royal architect Sebastiano Serlio\u2014expresses order and regularity. On the deaths of Castagni\u00e9 and Bachelier the construction work stopped; it was restarted in 1560 under the direction of Dominique Bachelier, son of Nicolas. He undertook the creation of the loggia and the passageway, which divided up the courtyard, and the street gate. Much polychrome interplay (brick/stone) and various ornaments (cabochons, diamonds, masks) evoke luxury, surprise and abundance, themes peculiar to mannerist architecture.\n\n\n== Main gate ==\nThe monumental gate designed by Dominique Bachelier combines power with delicacy. The gateway arch takes a certain rhythm from several projecting stones decorated with small dots. Serlio's Extraordinary Book of Doors contain this type of composition and it was used on several occasions by Toulousain architects (H\u00f4tel de Molinier and H\u00f4tel de Massas). The Doric pilasters that frame the gate display an alternating succession of diamond-shaped stone, which gives the ensemble a precious aspect. In the upper section the Ionic pilasters around the mullioned window are fluted and delicately ornamented. And with the table that surmounts it, the composition imparts a refined sophistication. Thus, Dominique Bachelier was able to offer the owner a complete composition which evoked both power and a delicate erudition.\n\n\n== The passageway and the consoles ==\nIn the courtyard, the passageway features arches decorated with diamond-shaped stone. They rest on large scrolled consoles, whose fronts are decorated with grotesque masks of different design. On the side, the rolls of the scrolls engender plant pods and cloves. Each console is borne upon a lion foot standing on a section of pilaster capped underneath with a magnificent rose. These consoles illustrate, by themselves, the manneristic aesthetic on the unusual and the association of opposites, combining mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms. These refined motifs, heightened through the polychrome interplay and relief of the passageway, were much appreciated by contemporaries and inspired details on other buildings, such as H\u00f4tel de Massas and Lar\u00e9ole Castle.\n\n\n== Staircase term ==\nIn the stairwell, on the landing of the first floor, stands the impressive figure of a male term. Half man, half pilaster, his face grimacing and his hands holding a cushion placed on his head to reduce the pain, this term was condemned to support the weight of the console. Although a symbol of knowledge in the sense that it alludes to mythology (Atlas and Hercules), this motif also amuses thanks to an association of opposites, such as the straining muscles and the soft cushion. Cariatid termes and other telamons were much appreciated in Renaissance Toulouse, notable examples can be found on the windows of H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin and on the main gate of H\u00f4tel de Bagis.\n\n\n== Bemberg Foundation ==\n\nSince 1994, the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat has housed the Bemberg Foundation (Fondation Bemberg), an art gallery which presents to the public one of the major private collections of art in Europe: the personal collection of the wealthy Argentine Georges Bemberg (1915\u20132011). His foundation was created in collaboration with the City of Toulouse. The large Bemberg collection features paintings, drawings, sculptures, ancient books and furniture. Paintings and drawings are the highlights of the collection, especially 19th and early 20th century French paintings (with impressionism, Nabis, post-impressionism and fauvism) and Venetian paintings of the 16th and 18th centuries.\nThe painting and drawing collection includes an impressive set of 30 paintings  by Pierre Bonnard and 18th century Venetian paintings by Canaletto, Francesco Guardi, Pietro Longhi, Rosalba Carriera, Giovanni Paolo Pannini, Tiepolo. 18th century French painting is represented by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Nicolas Lancret, Elisabeth Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun and Hubert Robert.\nFrom the Flemish and Netherlandish schools of painting are artworks by the studio of Rogier van der Weyden, Lucas Cranach, Gerard David, Adriaen Isenbrandt, Joachim Patinir, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Frans Pourbus the Elder. For the 17th century paintings are displayed by Antoon Van Dyck, Pieter de Hooch, Nicolaes Maes, Jan Van Goyen, Philips Wouwerman, Isaac van Ostade.\nItalian Renaissance painting is centered on Venice with paintings by Paris Bordone, Jacopo Bassano, Titian, Paul Veronese and Tintoretto while for the 17th century there are works by Pietro Paolini, Giovanni Battista Carlone, Evaristo Baschenis, Mattia Preti.\nFrench Renaissance and 17th century painting are represented with Jean Clouet, Fran\u00e7ois Clouet, Nicolas Tournier while the Foundation bought in 2018 a canvas by Spanish painter Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n.\nFrench painting from the second half of the 19th century is well represented with paintings by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, Claude Monet, Henri Fantin-Latour, Edgar Degas, \u00c9douard Vuillard, Odilon Redon, Paul S\u00e9rusier, Paul Gauguin, Louis Valtat, Alfred Sisley, Camille Pissarro, Gustave Caillebotte, Berthe Morisot, Paul Signac and Paul C\u00e9zanne.\n20th century French art is represented by Georges Rouault, Andr\u00e9 Derain, Henri Matisse, Raoul Dufy, Albert Marquet, Maurice de Vlaminck, Kees van Dongen, Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Othon Friesz, Amedeo Modigliani and Maurice Utrillo.\n\n\n== Pictures ==\nH\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nBemberg foundation\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBruno Tollon, H\u00f4tels de Toulouse, p. 313\u2013318, in Congr\u00e8s arch\u00e9ologique de France. 154e session.

Pont de Pierre and Grand Pont), is a 16th-century bridge in Toulouse, in the South of France.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nOriginal planning for the bridge started in 1542 by the assembly of a committee of master masons and carpenters.  Construction started on the foundations in 1544; the first arch was started in 1614.  The bridge was finished in 1632, and was inaugurated on 19 October 1659.\nThe bridge is not symmetrical; the longest arch is the third from the right-hand bank.  The openings through the piers were originally supposed to represent the face and mane of a lion.  A triumphal archway added in 1686 constricted traffic and was removed in 1860.It is 220m long, and has 7 arches.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPont Neuf pictures\nHistoire de la construction",

          "Although it\u2019s name means new bridge - as in Paris - this one is the oldest still in operation in Toulouse. The construction lasted almost 90 years in between 16th and 17th centuries. This bridge was strong enough and above all well designed to resist to many floods including the",
          "The Pont Neuf is a must see and the surrounding setting was gorgeous as it was autumn. The local cafes were busy and looked like a great place to spend the afternoon.",

          "The bridge is aesthetically pleasing and may be of architectural interest to some, but it would be hard to describe it as a destination in its own right \u2013 it is just a bridge, after all. I was mildly interested in the several large arches on the supporting structures, and",
          "It is a classic spot in the city. Makes for great pictures. You have a nice view of both sides of the city, the region is surrounded by trees and its cool to see the sunset from it. Still, it as a bridge and honestly there is only so much you can expect from a visit to it.",
          "A must see whilst in Toulouse, nice during the day but spectacular when lot up a night when it comes alive with locals picnicking on the river bank below",
          "The Pont Neuf offers wonderful photo ops both of the bridge and from the bridge. The view of the town is quite nice and the park nearby is a great place to walk, jog, bike or simply chill.",

          "Nice place to stop and check out the views across the River Garonne. It\u2019s also close to the Point de Le Daurade where you can book and go on a river cruise.",
          "Pont Neuf is French for new bridge! It is very nice to look at and walk across. Built in the 16th Century this bridge is not symmetrical if you look closely. If you are in the area then do go and take a look and get some photos.",

          "We often look at photos of monuments, structures or art and think it must have been enhanced but in this case the photo doesn\u2019t do it justice. Even the most amateur photographer will achieve this shot but the real joy is the reality of Pont Neuf in reflection. The only word",

          "If you haven't seen a lot of riverside / bridges, it's okay. When you have seen a lot, the Pont Neuf is just another one... We found much more interesting to walk around in the narrow streets in the city centre, where you meet local shops and specialties that you don't see",
          "Good to have a walk around in summer. You can go down to the promenade alongside the river and relax.",
          "Pont Neuf is a nice bridge, nothing more, nothing less. It's in the heart of the city, as Rue Metz leads (and starts) there. Worth passing by!",
          "It's a nice bridge which have seen some things through time. They are busy with fixing the quay walls at the moment (north side). Nice to see of you are there.",
          "Isn't it amazing to experience a 4 centuries old structure that still functioning well today? The bridge looks like many other ordinary old bridges, but if you read the history well, you would want to come here and take picture of it. There are some parks and greeneries along",
          "A significant landmark of Toulouse that is best enjoyed at dusk, when the lights come on. The bridges are an unforgettable scene when lit with the cityscape in the background. Pont Neuf itself is beautiful to photograph from the banks of the Garonne in the approach to its",

          "I do not generally think of bridges being particularly interesting. Functional - yes, but not interesting. The bridge at Pont Neuf is an exception. Part of the interest is the bridge's name in French means New Bridge. Being France, in this case New means it was built in the",
          "The whole area is very soothing and picturesque. Most people go there in the evenings for walks, jogging or reading a good book on the river banks.",
          "History of this bridge is interesting. The reasons why it is in this shape is so clever. You can enjoy walking along river bank.",
          "Walking over the the Pont Neuf then down the river past the Ferris Wheel then back over the other modern bridge and along the Quai de La Duurade made a lovley after dinner walk of about 45 minutes. Time it for sunset if you can and the Pont Neuf make a great photo from the",
          "The Pont Neuf was the only bridge in Toulouse to survive the big flood due to the holes in it that allowed the water through. We took a boat tour which ran under the bridge and gave us a good view of it.",
          "this bridge is best seen from the water and is very very pretty. The reflection in the water is quite gorgeous",
          "An eye catching piece of historic beauty , if in toulouse, a must visit place , we took the boat trip and had the best view",
          "The best pictures of Pont Neuf are made at sunset from the park La Daurade, a few hundred meters away. Simply fantastic!",
          "Just a short walk from downtown. Great sidewalk to walk the span of the bridge...even ride a bike. Great view below",
          "Lovely view and nice to cross over in the evening. Worth a meander along and good for a photo or two :)",
          "Words cannot describe this enough. A truly magnificent work of architecture and to have survived this long amid all weather. Night time on the bridge is breathtakingly beautiful. The lights and reflection magnificent. The highlight of our trip",
          "Nive views from this and from the nearby bridges. They are quite different during the day and the night, worth to visit at both.",
          "At night this bridge looks stunning. And the atmosphere around it is great. Lots of people all chilling out enjoying the view its wonderful.",
          "The sun didnt shined today for me to appreciate as I wanted the view over toulouse but the bridge is very nice and allows for a wide view.",
          "An interesting bridge in this part of France. If you are wondering, yes, those holes in the bridge are to allow floodwater to pass through the structure more easily. We debated it for a few minutes before the bridge info sign informed us of this flood alleviation piece.",
          "Nice old bridge in Toulouse, the special holes in the pillars are a part of the design to handle high water levels in the river, such that the water can get through.",
          "The oldest bridge within Toulouse is a must to be visited. In the night time the view is incredible. Just as an advise - visit in a group and not alone. Never had the feeling that it is dangerous but better be on the safe side.",
          "Nice bridge, but it simply joins two horrible areas of Toulouse. Looks best at night when it is lit up - and you can't see too much of the stuff going on on either bank.",
          "This bridge may not be new but it provides an excellent vantage point to both sides of the river. Take photos from either end or the center to compare",
          "Beautiful old bridge to walk, bike and just to enjoy the ambience of the lovely city of Toulouse....",
          "Pont Neuf or The New Bridge is one of the best place to see the full view of the Garonne river. If you visit Toulouse, don't forget to spend your time cyling around the city and take a stop at this bridge. However, the view at the night time, with nice lights decoration, will",
          "We walked to the Pont Neuf from our hotel on Place du Capitole (easy access to all of Toulouse). We sat at Bistro Flo at its edge in the Beaux Arts. Nice way to absorb the feeling of this city.",

          "The bridge is in the middle of a pleasant river walk - nice to walk on both sides, though only one bank has resaturants",
          "Nice old bridge with the garonne shining below. Good photos opportunity in the day with large buildings the other side of the river. Many young student around that aeria and small coffe shops or bistro place around. Worth a visit at night with the lights for great photos!",
          "Well worth the walk over the bridge and you get a great view of Le Garonne. In the middle of the bridge there is a mappointing out all the sights from where you are.",
          "In the night one can spend hours standing on the beautiful and ancient bridge and get soaked in the beauty of the reflections in the Garonne.",
          "Near from city centre. Very nice place for jogging or just a short stroll in the morning and afternoon. During night time we can enjoy the light animation around the bridge",
          "If you go to Toulouse, you must walk along the Garonne river. There are paths that go quite a way either upstream or downstream from the Pont Neuf. The bridge itself is beautiful, especially at night, when it's lit up, but can be admired in all weathers and under all skies.",
          "This bridge does exactly what you want it to do: get you over the water! At the river level there are benches where you can have a seat and a bottle of wine on a nice sunny day. Good architecture!",

          "We walked along the river and crossed higher up to observe the wonderful view across the river of toulouse and this enabled us to take photographs of the bridge all made so much more enjoyable by the sun shining",
          "So, yes, the bridge is every bit as pretty as all the reviewers say, but what really sends it over the top is the all the interpretive signage along the river walk that explains what you see and can no longer see. Yes, this is the new bridge but, most remarkably, the abutment",
          "It's 17th century old rather than new but remains of an even older bridge can be seen - joining an old port which has been restored as a park with a former hospital on the other side of the Garonne river. At night it is finely floodlit and the walk along the bank is a wonderful",
          "Comparing to Pont Neuf over the river Seine in Paris, it is smaller and shorter. But the view of the vicinity is very attractive. Along the river there are a lot of cafes and pubs where you can enjoy a glass of wine or beer with your company. It is the must-see place to visit",
          "It is called the new bridge but it is the most old remain bridge in Town. Very photogenic, it will help you doing real nice photos. The view over Garonne is amazing. Don't miss it!",
          "The Pont Neuf (New Bridge), aka Pont de Pierre and Grand Pont, isn't very \"Neuf\" as it was completed in 1632 and inaugurated in 1659. It is not symmetrical; the longest arch is the third from the right-hand bank and the openings through the piers were originally supposed to",
          "The Pont Neuf was built in the 16th century, and as you cross it you get an excellent view of Toulouse and of the river. Well worth strolling over.",
          "I run around 10:00 around the Pont Neuf. The weather is so nice. Not too hot and not too cold here. Moreover, at the free time, we can bring some sandwich or juice to sit and look at this relaxing city going. You will see local Frenches enjoying the sun. Plus, the lighting in",
          "The bridge is an essential element to your visit. You need to visit the sight. It is the oldest bridge and when you look at the design you can appreciate the survival characteristics.",
          "Built in the 16th century the 'New Bridge' has some interesting features, including huge sculpted holes in the supporting pillars to allow for water to flow through in the event of exceptional water levels",
          "I walked everywhere in Toulouse, and made a point of walking cross at least one bridge day. This is wonderful city for walking and the bridges have lovely vantage points. This was my favorite of all the many smashing bridges.",
          "The view over the bridge is stunning. You see lovers, joggers and teens by the shores having fun day and night. But they badly need to clean the river.",
          "Great place for some photography practice and a chilled atmosphere. Whether you want to spend a few minutes or a few hours we enjoyed this spot on a hot day",
          "I would not say it is the best bridge in the world but it's nice to walk around the Garonne, especially when the sun is out. Very nice atmosphere! In the evening many people gather on the shore and bring their own drinks/food",
          "Pretty, a nice part of Toulouse if wandering about. Views of the bridge are in a pleasant setting and the river here seems clean and generous",
          "Pont Neuf is the architectural heart of the Pink City, crossing the mighty Garonne River and linking old and new neighborhoods. Take in the view from the crossing or walk along the quay at dawn or sunset to marvel at its unique design.",
          "Walking over the historic Pont Neuf is not a must, viewing it from La Daurade is the must! From there you see the unique design on this important part of the city. The design to ensure that it survived the many floods of the river.",
          "Very old, very beautiful bridge, definately worth a visit. Very well information about and a huge plus is that it is also available in english! Something you do not see much in this area.",
          "Built to withstand the floods, eons ago, and still working today! Its scenic and its a great way to cross the Garonne!",
          "I walked across this bridge when I arrived in Toulouse but can not for the life of me work out why it warrants a record in Trip Advisor. It is a bridge, if an old bridge, and there is nothing special about it. The name - neuf - is entirely illusionary though it may have been",
          "A must visit if you are in Toulouse a wonderful bridge with good views of the Garonne and the town, you can also stroll along the banks of the river to reach the Canal du Midi.",
          "Very scenic bridge and well worth a walk over, as part of a tourt around the very pretty old town in Toulouse",
          "Lovely place for a promenade along the River Garonne. Makes for some great photos due to the architecture. There are seats in the shade which make a nice spot for a picnic!",
          "The bridge is nice but the water of the river is horrible, very dirty is not pleasant to smell. The view is nice",
          "Walked across Pont Neuf and took some photos along the Garonne. There's a great view of the old hospital and gardens as well as the Garonne.",
          "Beautiful bridge close to the city centre with great view over the Garrone river. Many cafes and restaurants near by. There is a bus stop next to the bridge and metro station less than 5 minutes away.",
          "The bridge is certainly worth visiting, especially because it's central location a visit does not require any extra effort. It will not take your breath away though. It's an old bridge with solid engineering from era including extra holes in the structure to let raising water",
          "The Pont Neuf connects the historic center of Toulouse to St-Cyprien across the Garonne River. It is a beautifully architected bridge with beautifully landscaped river banks. A great place to wander and/or sit and marvel at the most pleasant surrounding views.",
          "it is one of the beautiful places in toulouse region and it takes hardly any time from center. i feel its a must visit",
          "A landmark bridge over the Garonne River, old rather than neuf. It's in the Old Quarter, part of a busy intersections with lots of restaurants, shops, and the Bemberg Art Collection.",
          "It was a sunny afternoon and the camera had much to do to take it all in! A lazy walk and pauses enable time to appreciate!",
          "We were in Toulouse in last Christmas and visited various places. We started our walking trio from the metro station Capitol and went to Saint Pierre des Cuisines church. Few minutes walking from this church reached us to Garonne river and it\u2019s one of the beautiful bridge,",
          "An old bridge of architectural interest close to other attractions (the Capitole, various museums, shops etc).",
          "Really elegant wide bridge over the Garonne with stunning views (on a clear day) of the Pyrenees. Well worth standing and taking in the view if in Toulouse",
          "The bridge is rather nice, but it's enough if you just pass by. It doesn't take much time, but it's better to do it on a sunny day.",
          "It is nice to have an evening walk here by the river bank. Locals or mostly probably college students, hang around drinking, smoking and playing music. Chilling' Toulouse style I guess. We manage to watch the sun sets here too.",
          "A nice place to enjoy a walk, part of the city and people moving all around. Unfortunately it was a rainy day when we visited!",
          "A basic bridge not much to say if you are pushed for time I would not make a special trip. There is not much around it either.",
          "Pont Neuf can be seen from almost everywhere in Toulouse. Walk along for wonderful views and if not too windy take a walk down near the river...",
          "'Pont Neuf' means 'new bridge,' but in fact this is the oldest of the bridges across the Garonne. It must have been solidly built as it has never been swept away by the Garonne in flood. It's worth a quick look and a photo on a sunny day, from a position 50 metres up or down",
          "Many people come here just to hang out. There's usually plenty of area just to lay out a spread and and have a picnic. Gets crowded in the summer. Lots of restaurants nearby. Nice spot for photos too.",
          "Good walk and good views of the river. People watching and what looks like a development of a new recreational area by the bridge",
          "Walking the quays, looking at this stunning bridge and eating street food under the plane trees nearby - for me this was the best of Toulouse - and a great way to spend an afternoon.",
          "We walked along the waterfront.The sun was shining , the bridge pretty and the building facades interesting",
          "unfortunately it seems this may be the best thing the town has going for it. We went to Toulouse expecting it to be our favorite spot...We moved on. This attraction is quite nice if you are in the area or planning on passing through but in no does it warrant a special trip",
          "its a perfect place for a walk in the morning time or late evening stroll.10 mins from capitol and one of the most beautiful places to see in Toulouse do visit.",
          "We ran over the bridge this morning, pretty good view over the river in the dark. Would be very good in daylight. The banks of toulouse are pretty.",
          "A visit to the Garonne River is well worth the effort. There is a nice even path near the river to Pont Neuf and many historic buildings in this area.",
          "A good walk on a fine day, just be careful on and near the bridge as there are some dodgy looking people and pickpockets, there can also be a bit of dog poo so watch where you walk.",
          "Walking along the banks of the River Garonne we watched the wild life - cormorant, ducks and some itinerants with their dogs ( both well behaved and inoffensive). The river flows under the Pont Neuf - we could only count eight arches - but the scene is idyllic and, were it not",
          "very nice place... at weekends, this place is best place to relax apart from the pubs :P Lights on the bridge make it look really nice.. you have some grass grown there, where you can sit just next to river border",
          "Lovely bridge made up if 7 visible arches with a large shaped hole through each of the supports. Can walk by the river under the bridge along to catch a boat ride.",
          "great view it has. its lovely to walk along. its fresh and soothing. the view is the keystone for this place.",
          "Bring your camera for great views of La Garonne and nearby Toulouse area. You can walk from the bridge, along the waterfront Place de la Daurade. Many tourist, but mostly locals. Frequently you can find people playing instruments in the Area and in that point you can go down to",
          "This is not a pretty bridge to look at but its very interesting historically. This is Toulouses oldest bridge although 'neuf' means new. The Garonne river has strong currents and regularly floods. This is the only bridge that had never come down which is a testiment to its",
          "From on side to the other, this bridge has amazing view, as the sunset in the river and if you look in the other sense you can see the white Pyren\u00e9es. Great place for going with your love to a romantic walk :)",
          "This bridge with its historic significance was a 'must-do' for an early morning walk. It was interesting to sail underneath it as well and to realize that the spans are not equal! We stood on the bridge to watch the amazing Bastille Day fireworks.",
          "Like most great cities, this is an icon that the city is based around. Well worth the visit and exploring.",
          "this bridge has surprised me is the best I've visited I like much by having a atranquilidad like no other although it is a bridge that has a river that is not very clear I think to spend a summer evening with your boy or girl is excellent, I really like",
          "impressive looking bridge, not a lot going on whilst we were there but told there are often impromptu shows and performances by various street artists. Can walk alongside the River Garonne from under the bridge",
          "We walked along the river bank, as well as taking the guided tour, and this bridge was a standout feature on the route. Great views. The structure of the bridge has history, that can been seen in the construction methodology.",
          "A lovely bridge that spans the Garonne river. It is very wide so there is plenty of space to stroll across. From the river on a boat trip it is an amazing site because of the extra tunnels that run through it to allow for excess water flow. At night it is a very pretty site.",
          "Nice place to walk!. neuf mean new in french, but this is the oldest bridge of the city. It was a sunday afternoon, people walk by, kid cycled , few car on the bridge, and on other side of the central is a nice and quite park. So peaceful!",
          "The Pont Neuf is actually the oldest bridge across the Garonne river linking the centre of Toulouse to the elegant quartier of St Etienne. It is very pretty viewed at night from one of the other bridges, such as Pont St Pierre or Pont St Michel.",
          "It's worth stopping by if you are in the neighbourhood as it is a lovely bridge. However the sidewalk on the one side of the bridge seems to be a popular place and is used as an outdoor toilet. The smell was disgusting and made our stroll and photo taking short. The city",
          "Beautiful views of the Garonne from the bridge. The bridge reminded me magnificent bridges over the Seine in Paris - the same elegance and harmony. We had plenty of opportunities to enjoy the bridge from the car as well because we got lost and were going in circles coming back",
          "Connecting St Cyprien ( easier place to park) and the main part of Toulouse...one one side is the museum of medicine (not for the weak stomach) and other side is old water tower converted to photo exhibit. Concerts on the banks...",
          "Great view on the whole Garonne river. The architecture is very interesting with the big \"holes\" in the structure.",
          "Why review a bridge? I think it's worthy of a visit just to view the combination of aesthetic and practical elements merged in its architecture. Sure, it can carry a heavy load across a river, but it does that while maintaining a pleasant appearance and adapting to various",
          "This is simply one of my favourite spots in Toulouse. I love it! The view is great, the atmosphere nice. Everybody visiting Toulouse should check it out!",
          "It was a good stroll from my apartment to the river but it's worth it as the neighborhood there is quite lovely. Apart from the fairly average newer bridge a few hundred yards away the Pont Neuf has more character and seems to fit that part of the city better than does its",
          "This well known old bridge over the river Garonne is easy to walk to from the centre and looks good in a picture. The views up and down the river around here are nice, and you can enjoy a nice stroll along the river in both directions.",
          "Beautiful bridge, but water colour is not very nice(probably because of its nature). Anyway a nice place to make some good photos!",
          "Not much to do or see around here- Ok to sit on the bank if it's warm. Would have been nice for a riverside bar to grab a glass of rose!",
          "I am pleased I saw this beautiful bridge, but it is one of many in Toulouse. There is a lovely walkway along the river and nice places to sit and relax while looking at the bridges",
          "Whilest Pont Neuf is nice, it is not worth a special trip to see the bridge. If you are visiting the Fondation Bamberg, the bridge is only a couple minute walk away. I would have been disappointed if I'd just gone to see the bridge. There is a walkway along the river if you have",
          "The views from here are tremendous and the buzz when busy is great. A real focal point and social centre this bridge spans the wonderful river and overlooks the broad banks where you can stroll, picnic, sunbather and relax. There are a multitude of bars, cafes and restaurants at",
          "It's a bridge. Well constructed (it should be given how long it took!) and very functional, but not somewhere you really need to spend more than 3 minutes looking at.",
          "A beautiful place when the sun is going down and lighting the river. Pont Neuf is close to the center of everything, lots of restaurants, museums and things to do and see nearby.",
          "The piers and arches and lion shaped holes were quite dramatic otherwise nothing special. You would not come to Toulouse or go out of your way to see this bridge but there is a very good chance that you will see it if you come down to the river and the place de la Daurade",
          "I first stood on the bridge and thought, nothing special, but then we walked along the river and I looked back and realized just hw beautiful it is. It was a lovely, sunny morning and the reflections of the bridge in th water and th sunlight back up onto the bridge was really",
          "This bridge is the prettiest of the bridges in Toulouse, it has practical applications like carrying traffic, but it is also a place to stand and stare. We were lucky as our visit in October was warm and sunny and many people were enjoying the river, and bridges, a real place to",
          "One of the main bridge in Toulouse which takes you from Esquirol to St Cyprien and the green area \"la prairie des filtres\" (you could either chill or attend a special event such as the Rio Loco scheduled each year in June). With a great view on the mountain chain les Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es if",
          "One of several bridges to enjoy while in Toulouse...great view of other bridges. Take a small walk and enjoy each moment.",
          "We had a cruise on the Garonne and were told all about the Pont Neuf, the beautiful (and very old!) bridge that spans the Garonne. The cruise was a bit disappointing but the views of the Pont Neuf, with its lion shaped holes to protect it from floods, were superb.",
          "The bridge is well worth a look. When we were there, it had been dry so the water in the Garonne was rather dirty.",
          "Perhaps excellent doesn't really apply to a bridge which is there for a function. I reached it after an interesting walk along the brick embankments of the Garonne. The bridge is almost 400 years old built of stone with brick dressing to the piers which have unusual ornate",
          "Beautifull bridge in a beautifull city. A perfect example of the feeling you get when you visit Toulouse .... the pink city!",
          "from the pont neuf continue down to the river side and up for boat trip on the river.a relaxed differnt view over the city of Toulouse",
          "What can I say? A bridge connecting two parts of a city. Very useful but not really an attraction. It is part of the scenery of the city.",
          "There are benches and cafes around the area. Definite hang out for local teens (not a bad thing--my teens found it interesting to watch). They were setting up for what appeared to be a concert when we went by.",
          "Like in Paris the new bridge is in fact the oldest bridge. There are some shady areas nearby, also cafes.",
          "What a wonderful structure. It is easy to see how clever the designers were in allowing for the huge variations in water volumes which come down this river. As usual pont neuf is the oldest bridge.",
          "Very impressive and addictive view, the bridge and the building at its ends, you will want to go there every day of your stay in Toulouse.",
          "Bring your sandwiches, cokes and spend the afternoon admiring this beautiful structure next to teh water, lots of people coming and going but still a relaxing place to spend the day in this full of students city, we loved it.",
          "You'll love this one. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting on one of the benches on the Quai de Tounis just beyond Pont Neuf on a glorious sunny Sunday afternoon, admiring this impressive bridge - bliss! It's definitely a lot more striking and archtecturally better looking than the",
          "The nearest metro is Esquirol. From their its just 5 mins walk. View the bridge from the the river side It's a good piece of architecture.",
          "We took the m\u00e9tro to Esquirol and walked down to the river to see the bridge. It's a good piece of architecture and gives the otherwise uninspiring Garonne river some character.",
          "The Pont Neuf is a beautifu walk for evening particularly. we enjoyed the river and the activity along it. take an hour, stretch your legs, enjoy a leisurely stroll.",
          "Best viewed from the river banks, will cost nothing to look, if you stroll access cut through the park on the right to the HotelDieu",
          "...it's just a bridge. We crossed it from the old side, walked around the arbitoire(sp?) came back, waled along the bank, grabbed a sandwich, walked some more and just didn't get it. If you have a lot of time on you hands, go there and look at it, but there are museums all over",
          "Sat on the river bank here one afternoon and had a salad from a near by cafe. A wonderful memory to have of just sitting and listening and watching the world go by. The view is one of a kind, so much history to this amazing city!",
          "You walk down Ave Metz and almost stumble upon it. Have a drink/meal by the bridge and then walk by the river and look back, or walk onto the bridge and look across the river at both banks.",
          "The bridge itself is not particularly attractive, but the areas at each end are well worth exploring. If you have time, try to visit the old abbatoir district, with its art museum and some good views towards the city centre. There is a free navette circulating in the old town,",
          "Solid by day, but comes to life at night. Needs some repair to the higher flood relief tunnels but a splendid piece of civil engineering.",
          "We visited during the day and then at night. It is really beautiful at night with the lights on below the bridge. The area adjacent was buzzing with young people at the bars and roller blading along the river bank. A great photo opportunity and rather romantic despite the",
          "If you're in Toulouse, don't miss Pont Neuf! A picturesque bridge and surrounding areas, East to get to by foot, bus or metro from the centre of the city. Try to visit by day and by night as the coloured lighting really makes the bridge look beautiful in the dark.",
          "Make sure to see Pont Neuf as part of an evening stroll along the Garonne. It's lighted so its beauty can really be appreciated at night. When we tried to do an evening cruise and found they were cancelled due to high waters, we instead hung out in the area occupied by",
          "Having never visited Toulouse, I had expectations of a bridge similar to that of Charles Bridge in Prague, where you can spend your time walking across and be entertained by the various street vendors and performers along the way, certainly a good way to spend up to an hour of",
          "All the main tourist attractions are within easy walking distance from hotel. Council car park very close by.",
          "The Pont Neuf was spoilt by the amount of road works going on. The walk along the river and round the bridge will be lovely once the noise and mess from the road work is complete.",
          "Even though it was a bit of a dreary day, it was a great walk to this ancient bridge. Lovely views of the city and the river. We did not go at night but understand that's a great time to go also. If you have the time, I would recommend.",
          "If you have time, take a stroll across this bridge. We walked across during the day and it was busy with lots of other walkers and cyclists. Worth a visit if you have time, but nothing special",
          "There are four main bridges across the Garonne in Toulouse. This is the oldest even though its name translates as the brand-new bridge. The style is quite interesting with its cut-out sections but that's about all that one can say. Make sure you have a guide book with you to",
          "A must see and feel the history of this river crossing. Just wonder the many battle of this city and the bridge played a large roll in this cities history.",
          "The oldest bridge in the very center of Toulouse is the \"Pont Neuf\" (new bridge). It perfectly fits into the romantic image of the brick-rose city. This 16th/17th century bridge (1544-1632) then was the new one and today is the oldest. The other bridges had all been destroyed by",
          "There are bridges and there are bridges...what is so remarkable about the Pont Neuf, a 16th century bridge, is the fact that it took so long to complete construction, nearly 90 years for all seven arches. It was started around 1542 but wasn't completed until nearly 1632. It",
          "A rare burst of sunshine, in the otherwise cool and wet first week of April, suddenly brought Toulouse to life. Walking along the river, looking out at the Pont Neuf, taking a few photos, leaning over the wall - we suddenly noticed lots of young people (and a few oldies like",
          "Well worth a walk to and a walk over. Beautiful river and city views from this bridge. Visited on a very rainy day and I'm assured that the views at sunset are beautiful - all you need is sun I suppose!",
          "The old bridge is the second prettiest in Toulouse, (after Pont St. Pierre) and is delightful to walk across or simply gaze at any time.Wide sidewalks make walking easy. It is, however, best appreciated at dusk, when the sunis setting the bridge lights are on and it becomes",
          "It\u2019s a nice antique bridge that goes over the Garonne river and connects to the other interesting old part of the city in rue de la republique and surroundings",
          "A very nice bridge over the Garonne. This is in the busiest neighborhood of Toulouse and at night, it's very very very beautiful. You can see the lights flashing on the water, this is awesome.",
          "It was one of the most prettiest bridges in Toulouse. If are in the vicinity, it would be worth your while to spend a few minutes admiring the architecture of the bridge and the view!"

        "wiki": "Toulouse (, too-LOOZ; French: [tuluz] (listen); Occitan: Tolosa [tu\u02c8luzo]; Latin: Tolosa [to\u02c8lo\u02d0sa]) is the capital of the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km (143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean and 680 km (420 mi) from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France, with 479,553 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (as of January 2017), and 1,360,829 inhabitants within its wider metropolitan area (also as of January 2017), after Paris, Lyon and Marseille, and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.\nToulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus (formerly EADS), the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It also hosts the European headquarters of Intel and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe. Thales Alenia Space, ATR, SAFRAN, Liebherr-Aerospace and Airbus Defence and Space also have a significant presence in Toulouse.\nThe University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 103,000 students, it is the fourth-largest university campus in France, after the universities of Paris, Lyon and Lille.The air route between Toulouse\u2013Blagnac and Paris Orly is the busiest in Europe, transporting 2.4 million passengers in 2014. According to the rankings of L'Express and Challenges, Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the Occitanie region, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.\nToulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname La Ville Rose (The Pink City).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nToulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nToulouse has a temperate humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified as a Mediterranean climate zone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age.\nThe historical name of the city, Tolosa (\u03a4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian, or from Iberian, but has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages.Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost.\nAfter the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city of Gallia Narbonensis. In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 (Battle of Vouill\u00e9).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n\n=== County of Toulouse ===\n\nThe town became the capital of the County of Toulouse during the Carolingian era.\nIn 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders.\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the military crusade, such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the Southern French Gothic.\nIn 1215 the Dominican Order was founded in Toulouse by Saint Dominic in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\nIn the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs, were started. They found home in Les Jacobins. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital.\n\n\n=== Within the Kingdom of France ===\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the kingdom of France and declared a \"royal city\". In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years. The Consistori del Gay Saber is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\nThe 14th century brought a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population by Crusaders in 1320, the Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years' War. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.The situation improved in the 15th century. Charles VII established the second parliament of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of pastel, a blue dye made from woad. The fortune generated by this international trade was at the origin of several of Toulouse's superb Renaissance mansions.\n\n\n=== Within the French Republic ===\nThe Battle of Toulouse (1814) was one of the final battles of the Napoleonic Wars, four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition.\nToulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by Marshal Soult.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of the city proper (French: commune) was 479,553 at the January 2017 census, with 1,360,829 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,187,686 at the January 2007 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area). Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.4% per year between 2007 and 2017, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2007 censuses.\nToulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\nFueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for metropolitan France), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.\nA local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Toulouse M\u00e9tropole ===\n\nThe Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Toulouse) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent communes, covering an area of 380 km2 (147 sq mi), totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communaut\u00e9 urbaine). This has become a m\u00e9tropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes.\n\n\n=== Local politics ===\n\nOne of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (Halle aux Grains) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (Z\u00e9nith, the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace was founded, etc.\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen.\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nToulouse has many interesting churches, but three of them are of remarkable architectural and historical interest.\nSaint-Sernin Basilica, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest remaining Romanesque church in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by Charlemagne to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\nCathedral of Saint Stephen is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\nThe convent of the Jacobins (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the Albi Cathedral, the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the Dominican order, for not having obtained the relics of Saint Dominic kept in Bologna, Pope Urban V made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar Saint Thomas Aquinas, one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Civilian buildings ===\n\nThe Capitole de Toulouse (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole (opera house). It is located on the Place du Capitole, a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (place royale). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th-century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (le donjon), which housed the archives of the Capitouls; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called h\u00f4tels particuliers) or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat, the H\u00f4tel de Bernuy, the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, the H\u00f4tel de Bagis...\n\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n\nThe banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the Pont-Neuf, it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the H\u00f4pital de La Grave. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe Jardin des Plantes is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a botanical garden (early 19th century).\nThe Cit\u00e9 de l'espace (Space City) is a theme park of space exploration.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nSights and monuments of Toulouse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe main industries are aeronautics, space, electronics, information technology and biotechnology. Toulouse hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320, A330, A350 and A380.  (A320 lines also exist in Hamburg, Germany, Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, USA.) Airbus has its head office in Blagnac, near Toulouse. Airbus's France division has its main office in Toulouse. Toulouse also hosts the headquarters of ATR, Sigfox, one of the two headquarters of Liebherr Aerospace and Groupe Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re.\nThe Concorde supersonic aircraft was also constructed in Toulouse.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nToulouse has the fourth-largest student population in France after Paris, Lyon and Lille with 103,000 students (2012).\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nThe University of Toulouse (Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse), established in 1229, is located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology\u2014inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts\u2014as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.\nCatholic University of Toulouse\nUniversit\u00e9 Toulouse I, Toulouse School of Economics, Toulouse School of Management and Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse\nUniversity of Toulouse-Jean Jaur\u00e8s (Formerly University of Toulouse II \u2013 Le Mirail)\nUniversit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III)Toulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:\n\nICAM Toulouse (Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers)\nINSA Toulouse\nISAE SUPAERO (Institut sup\u00e9rieur de l'a\u00e9ronautique et de l'espace)\nENAC (\u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile)\nINP ENSEEIHT (\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectronique, d'\u00c9lectrotechnique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique et des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications)\nENSFEA (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de formation de l\u2019enseignement agricole)\nINP ENSIACET (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs en art chimique et technologique)\nINP ENSAT ('\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure Agronomique de Toulouse)\nINP ENM (\u00c9cole Nationale de la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie)\nEPITA (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les techniques avanc\u00e9es)\nEPITECH (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies or European Institute of Information Technology)\nIPSA (Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avanc\u00e9es)\nEIPurpan (\u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Purpan)\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThe most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Sernin.\nInternational schools serving area expatriates are in nearby Colomiers:\n\nInternational School of Toulouse\nDeutsche Schule Toulouse (German school)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThe main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nIn addition to an extensive bus system, the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tired trains. Line A runs for 12.5 km (7.8 mi) from Balma-Gramont in the north-east to Basso Cambo in the south-west. Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaur\u00e8s.\nLine C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Ar\u00e8nes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named \"Gare des Capelles\", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened. Le TOEC station opened on 1 September 2003 with the creation of line C, allowing an urban train service in Toulouse and close western suburbs.Similarly, Line D runs south from Toulouse Matabiau to Muret.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\nThe tramway line T1 (operating since December 2010), runs from Beauzelle to Toulouse passing through Blagnac. All urban bus, metro and tram services are operated by Tiss\u00e9o. Tramway line T2 is a branch of the first line serving notably Toulouse Blagnac airport.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nIn 2007, a citywide bicycle rental scheme called V\u00e9l\u00f4Toulouse was introduced, with bicycles available from automated stations for a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly subscription.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nAirports include:\n\nToulouse Blagnac, the principal local airport\nToulouse Lasbordes\n\n\n=== Canal ===\nThe Canal du Midi begins in Toulouse and runs up to S\u00e8te.\n\n\n=== Toulouse public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Toulouse, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 44 min. 9.1% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

Toulouse's art museums include the Mus\u00e9e des Augustins, the Mus\u00e9e des Abattoirs, the Mus\u00e9e Georges Labit, and the Fondation Bemberg in the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat. The Mus\u00e9e Saint-Raymond is devoted to Antiquity and the Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse to natural history.\nToulouse is the seat of the Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux, the equivalent of the French Academy for the Occitan-speaking regions of southern France, making Toulouse the unofficial capital of Occitan culture. The traditional Cross of Toulouse (from Provence, under the name of cross of Provence), emblem of the County of Toulouse and commonly widespread around all of Occitania during the Middle Ages is the symbol of the city and of the newly founded Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es r\u00e9gion, as well as a popular Occitan symbol.\nThe city's gastronomic specialties include the Saucisse de Toulouse, a type of sausage, cassoulet Toulousain, a bean and pork stew, and garbure, a cabbage soup with poultry. Also, foie gras, the liver of an overfed duck or goose, is a delicacy commonly made in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nStade Toulousain of the Top 14 is one of the most successful rugby union clubs in all of Europe, having been crowned European champions four times and French champions twenty times.Toulouse Olympique represents the city in rugby league, playing in the English/European 2nd tier Championship from 2017.\nThe city also has a professional football team, Toulouse FC, who play in Ligue 2, the second division of football in France, and who won the 1957 Coupe de France Final.

          "This is a fantastic museum, and we really enjoyed it. We are a bilingual family, so being able to read French was a help. The exhibits are beautifully presented, excite interest and am generally rather wonderful. I'd give it the highest possible rating.",
          "Some interesting exhibits, but ability to read french language would enable a visitor to get maximum benefit from the visit, as there are only a few english/german/spanish captions, mainly at the start of each exhibition. A great selection of stuffed animals showing the",
          "I love that the museum shows things in time order and very complete. From earth, stones, volcanoes, earthquake, small lining cells to big animals. The exposition topic about giraffe is also very interesting.",
          "OK, maybe I should have done more homework, but when I saw Toulouse had a natural history museum, I was there. New York and London had both been enthralling and I was looking forward to it. It quickly became apparent though, that this was geared for children. While it was well",
          "What a fab place to go and visit. The museum was much larger than I thought it would be. Loved all the beetles and bugs there were to see. Well thought out layout, making the visit interesting and informative. I speak French and this helps as all the info is is French. Maybe",
          "great museum but if you do not speak French, you will struggle to understand as all the labels commentaries and workshops are in French. Still it is a great place to visit.",
          "A wonderful place for children to learn about natural history. I went today by myself as it is free on the first Sunday of every month, and I was out walking around enjoying Toulouse. I took a quick walk though, and my grown children would have loved this place when they were",
          "Very modern natural history museum. Easy to get to. Not the largest collection of exhibits on display but very well presented and easy to navigate. Plant collection slightly disappointing, mainly as many exhibits were closed.",
          "The Museum is fun, comprehensive, modern and a good place to visit even if you don't have a lot of French. There is a wall with all kinds of skeletons and an interactive display where you can select a skeleton, find out what animal it is and see it as it would have looked in",
          "This was worth a quick stop but I wouldn't plan a trip around it. Nice collection in the Natural History exhibitions but the point of temporary giraffe exhibition escaped me. Overall not much here that you wouldn't see elsewhere.",
          "We didn't go into museum adjacent just walked the gardens which were full of lovely sculptures, a waterfall a lake with turtles in and lots of carousels. Our young son loved the playground and the family feel was great. So many birds and beautiful plants and nicely laid out",
          "As we are based in the Pyreneese , Toulouse is one of our hubs so to speak ,and on this day we were picking an arivee from the Blagnac (Toulouse Airport) so combined the visit in. It turned out to be a win win situation Weather had eased off from proceeding heat wave in a way of",
          "What.a great place to visit for old and young and combinations of both The museum has some wonderful, jaw-dropping skeletons and creatures (pterodactyl, whale, giant squid) and the displays are well organised and accessible. Outside there are impressive gardens and greenhouses,",
          "This is a modern, well-organized natural history museum. The four sections cover: - Terre Planete Active - geology - Ordre du Vivant - specimens of insects, animals, reptiles and birds - La Vie dans Le Temps - fossils - Les Besoins du Monde Vivant - how human society has",
          "The museum is reasonably priced, well laid out and has interesting content but if you don't speak or read French then there isn't much point in going. The English guide book is simply a book and the only exhibits that had translations were in the temporary exhibition in the",
          "Closed on Mondays so could not visit the museum, or the animal exhibition. Gardens not that exciting",
          "Here is something for those who enjoy horticulture and gentle walks. There is a series of geographically themed garden areas linked by winding paths. Along one edge a stream runs between reeds and water plants and under bridges. There is a museum in a very striking modern",
          "Easy to get to using the metro to Palais de Justice, entry is free on the first Sunday of each month, so no reason not to go. So much to see over 3 floors, so you need most of the day to do it justice. Amazing displays of animal life, and good interactive displays about the",
          "During a rainy day a visit of the Toulouse museum is recommended. The content is the same as in other big museums of natural sciences, but the way how the content is presented is much more attractive. There is mixture of movies, exposures, pictures, interactive pic screens,",
          "We visited the public parc in October 2014. The parc is not big but contain nerver the less many very large threes like cedars, taxodium, ginkos, planes, black walnuts and several other big threes. We enjoyed the rare sight of so big threes and many with interesting fruits.",
          "Visited the gardens and the Natural History Museum. The Natural history Museum is quite good and inexpensive, lots to see. The garden are a hip place to chill out in to cool off from the heat of the French sun.",
          "The displays of all the items in this museum were wonderful, making some of the quite ordinary items extraordinary. The fossils were some of my favourite, as were the rocks and the plants. Skeletons set against the windows creating silhouettes were amazing. My 16 year old son",
          "The fee for the museum is reasonable considering how much there is to see, the gardens are free. The weather was nice so we enjoyed ourselves more. The museum has a superb collection of taxidermy and minerals.",
          "Visited here on our last full day in Toulouse, just like the Jardin Japonais, its a nice wee outdoor space to get away from the hustle and bustle of every day life, the gardens was full of ordinary Tulousians enjoying lunch, was pretty to walk round and some hidden gems",
          "Beautiful gardens, and a fun place for the family. Quite extensive and well maintained. We went for an early evening visit and it was nice to see so many families out enjoying themselves.",
          "This place is great, at the moment they have a temporary exhibit on bears as well as two floors for the permanent collection. We were very lucky and just happened to be in Toulouse on the 1st sunday of a new month - the museum is free. Unfortunately my French is very poor so I",
          "Not botanical gardens in our sense of the phrase but very nice nonetheless. We spent a good while exploring the different corners, including the pond which is home to various animals including turtles and several types of geese. Everything is very well-kept and it's just a",
          "The museum is more targeted at younger folks (kids) but for me who has very mediocre French, it was good. There are lots of exhibits. My favorite was all of the animals (stuffed, skeletons, etc.). Would be fun to go back now that I know more French. Staff was very helpful.",
          "This place is great for children (I went there with a friend with a small boy) Loads to point at from a full wall showing a volcano erupting to a talk on where to find wild brown bears in the Pyrenees and how to behave around them (in French) at the temporary exhibit. Some of",
          "Great place to visit go loose yourself for a few hours or days really really well set out one of the best I have been to",
          "This is where people go to hold informal child groups, have their lunch and generally while away their breaks. The caf\u00e9 on the main boulevard serves an excellent lunch and drinks and the Jardin in the Museum is well laid out for understanding plant groups and purpose.",
          "It's interesting like any museum, but there is no differential in comparison to other natural museums. Anyway, the garden worth a visit, specially in the summer time.",
          "Last week we visited the jardin des plantes but found it rather dull. However the visit was redeemed by our discovery of the botanic garden.We found this area by chance,not having seen any signs directing us there. at the edge of the main park there are greenhouses and looking",
          "Not to be missed. Our six year old - a veteran of London museums was in his element. An extensive and historic collection has been re-housed imaginatively and creatively in a new building. The displays are fabulous, particularly the two storey curving glass wall of animal (and",
          "Everything was written in French so we still have a lot of gaps about the speciments... However, some beautiful peacocks were walking freely in the garden among the visitors.",
          "some brilliant exhibits, mainly the animals and humans in skeletal form. we took loads of pictures of the man on horse back",
          "The museum is located in the Jardin des Plantes, itself worth a stroll on a nice day. For non-french speakers/readers it is harder to appreciate the museum since no signs or materials are in English, but it can still be appreciated without. There is a good quality restaurant in",
          "It is a nice little park, very pleasant to stroll and spend some time. It is located a little far from the city center.",
          "Pretty good, especially for a museum resto. Surly lady on the till each time - try to smile a bit please? Food is ok - not great value, but tasty.",
          "This is a very well designed museum of natural history. The architecture is interesting, the presentation is well done, the gardens are marvelous and even the restaurant is more than decent. I will certainly return if I go back to Toulouse.",
          "This was a really great collection, so many well preserved animals and amazing skeletons - however I was there with my children and after a couple of times where they asked \"Whats that?\" and I struggled with my school french to read the information... well we just gave up. Its",
          "Excellent layout and not at all crowded unlike a similar establishment in UK. There seemed to be as many staff as there were visitors. The garden was very attractive. Nice cafe too!",
          "I took my children age 6 and 8 round here. It was just the right size for a few hours and didn't have so much that it overwhelmed them (The Natural History Museum in London is huge in comparison!) There was plenty to look at - my kids especially enjoyed the taxidermy birds and",
          "We only had time to wander around the extensive gardens and adjacent park. Loved the ambience and colours. The fibre glass cows everywhere added a touch of humour and creativity. Very well tended and lots to see. The weather was perfect, too.",
          "it was 38C when we were there - the gardens are small but compact, the museum well organised, good for kids, the Restaurant had a very nice lunch menu at a very reasonable price with nice tables outside to enjoy the gardens at a distance",
          "Great exhibits, could use more English placards explaining what are you looking at. Did a great job of laying out life and all of its branches. Skip the restaurant; one of three really rude French people manning the cash register. Sure, I don't know enough French to live in",
          "Made the very big mistake of leaving the Museum of Natural History for last on my stay and only had a few hours to spend there before catching a train. Could have stayed a lot longer. The kids loved the exhibitions which appealed to children and grown ups alike. Had lunch at the",
          "...and interesting but not very accessible if you dont! Lots of Geology. Botanical gardens is small and might take 30 mins of your time!",
          "Another beautiful place to visit when you are inToulouse. A beautiful walk takes you to this modern museum situated in the best park of downtown Toulouse.",
          "Then this is a 'don't miss' attraction. If you don't speak French, and are in Toulouse for more than a day, and have any interest at all in natural history, pay a visit. It's well laid out, has excellent displays, wonderful explanations for all exhibits. (I think. My French",
          "...since i didn't visit the museums, so just the gardens get the 4 stars. We spent a nice hour strolling the charming gardens on a Sunday morning (a nice thing to do since a lot of things are closed). There are pretty bridges, ponds, and statues spread throughout the gardens.",
          "they had too much money and too many consultants, and ended up with a mish-mash - confused, incoherent, too much theming and not enough information. Pity, the building and the gardens are attractive, but the multi-sensory approach (static displays, info. screens, video reveals",
          "This would be a lovely place to take children as long as they speak French; there are no English exhibits, plaques, or demonstrations. However, for young Francophones, this museum would be a blast!"

        "wiki": "Toulouse (, too-LOOZ; French: [tuluz] (listen); Occitan: Tolosa [tu\u02c8luzo]; Latin: Tolosa [to\u02c8lo\u02d0sa]) is the capital of the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km (143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean and 680 km (420 mi) from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France, with 479,553 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (as of January 2017), and 1,360,829 inhabitants within its wider metropolitan area (also as of January 2017), after Paris, Lyon and Marseille, and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.\nToulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus (formerly EADS), the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It also hosts the European headquarters of Intel and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe. Thales Alenia Space, ATR, SAFRAN, Liebherr-Aerospace and Airbus Defence and Space also have a significant presence in Toulouse.\nThe University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 103,000 students, it is the fourth-largest university campus in France, after the universities of Paris, Lyon and Lille.The air route between Toulouse\u2013Blagnac and Paris Orly is the busiest in Europe, transporting 2.4 million passengers in 2014. According to the rankings of L'Express and Challenges, Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the Occitanie region, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.\nToulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname La Ville Rose (The Pink City).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nToulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nToulouse has a temperate humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified as a Mediterranean climate zone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age.\nThe historical name of the city, Tolosa (\u03a4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian, or from Iberian, but has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages.Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost.\nAfter the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city of Gallia Narbonensis. In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 (Battle of Vouill\u00e9).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n\n=== County of Toulouse ===\n\nThe town became the capital of the County of Toulouse during the Carolingian era.\nIn 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders.\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the military crusade, such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the Southern French Gothic.\nIn 1215 the Dominican Order was founded in Toulouse by Saint Dominic in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\nIn the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs, were started. They found home in Les Jacobins. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital.\n\n\n=== Within the Kingdom of France ===\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the kingdom of France and declared a \"royal city\". In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years. The Consistori del Gay Saber is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\nThe 14th century brought a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population by Crusaders in 1320, the Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years' War. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.The situation improved in the 15th century. Charles VII established the second parliament of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of pastel, a blue dye made from woad. The fortune generated by this international trade was at the origin of several of Toulouse's superb Renaissance mansions.\n\n\n=== Within the French Republic ===\nThe Battle of Toulouse (1814) was one of the final battles of the Napoleonic Wars, four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition.\nToulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by Marshal Soult.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of the city proper (French: commune) was 479,553 at the January 2017 census, with 1,360,829 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,187,686 at the January 2007 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area). Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.4% per year between 2007 and 2017, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2007 censuses.\nToulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\nFueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for metropolitan France), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.\nA local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Toulouse M\u00e9tropole ===\n\nThe Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Toulouse) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent communes, covering an area of 380 km2 (147 sq mi), totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communaut\u00e9 urbaine). This has become a m\u00e9tropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes.\n\n\n=== Local politics ===\n\nOne of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (Halle aux Grains) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (Z\u00e9nith, the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace was founded, etc.\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen.\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nToulouse has many interesting churches, but three of them are of remarkable architectural and historical interest.\nSaint-Sernin Basilica, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest remaining Romanesque church in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by Charlemagne to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\nCathedral of Saint Stephen is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\nThe convent of the Jacobins (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the Albi Cathedral, the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the Dominican order, for not having obtained the relics of Saint Dominic kept in Bologna, Pope Urban V made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar Saint Thomas Aquinas, one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Civilian buildings ===\n\nThe Capitole de Toulouse (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole (opera house). It is located on the Place du Capitole, a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (place royale). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th-century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (le donjon), which housed the archives of the Capitouls; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called h\u00f4tels particuliers) or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat, the H\u00f4tel de Bernuy, the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, the H\u00f4tel de Bagis...\n\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n\nThe banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the Pont-Neuf, it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the H\u00f4pital de La Grave. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe Jardin des Plantes is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a botanical garden (early 19th century).\nThe Cit\u00e9 de l'espace (Space City) is a theme park of space exploration.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nSights and monuments of Toulouse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe main industries are aeronautics, space, electronics, information technology and biotechnology. Toulouse hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320, A330, A350 and A380.  (A320 lines also exist in Hamburg, Germany, Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, USA.) Airbus has its head office in Blagnac, near Toulouse. Airbus's France division has its main office in Toulouse.

Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology\u2014inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts\u2014as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.\nCatholic University of Toulouse\nUniversit\u00e9 Toulouse I, Toulouse School of Economics, Toulouse School of Management and Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse\nUniversity of Toulouse-Jean Jaur\u00e8s (Formerly University of Toulouse II \u2013 Le Mirail)\nUniversit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III)Toulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:\n\nICAM Toulouse (Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers)\nINSA Toulouse\nISAE SUPAERO (Institut sup\u00e9rieur de l'a\u00e9ronautique et de l'espace)\nENAC (\u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile)\nINP ENSEEIHT (\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectronique, d'\u00c9lectrotechnique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique et des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications)\nENSFEA (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de formation de l\u2019enseignement agricole)\nINP ENSIACET (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs en art chimique et technologique)\nINP ENSAT ('\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure Agronomique de Toulouse)\nINP ENM (\u00c9cole Nationale de la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie)\nEPITA (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les techniques avanc\u00e9es)\nEPITECH (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies or European Institute of Information Technology)\nIPSA (Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avanc\u00e9es)\nEIPurpan (\u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Purpan)\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThe most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Sernin.\nInternational schools serving area expatriates are in nearby Colomiers:\n\nInternational School of Toulouse\nDeutsche Schule Toulouse (German school)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThe main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nIn addition to an extensive bus system, the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tired trains.

Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaur\u00e8s.\nLine C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Ar\u00e8nes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named \"Gare des Capelles\", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened. Le TOEC station opened on 1 September 2003 with the creation of line C, allowing an urban train service in Toulouse and close western suburbs.Similarly, Line D runs south from Toulouse Matabiau to Muret.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\nThe tramway line T1 (operating since December 2010), runs from Beauzelle to Toulouse passing through Blagnac.

          "As with most of the tourist attractions in Toulouse they are clearly aimed at French people- which is totally fine of course. It\u2019s just that when the entry fee is \u00a325 each it\u2019s a bit disappointing to not understand much of it. Must improve \u2026",

          "It's a mix between a space theme park and a museum. With Ariane 5, soyouz and other satellites in a park. Inside there's some attractions like moonwalking which allow one to experience moon's gravity. A lot of expositions and attempts to interactive entertainments.",

          "Cite de l'espace was a nice afternoon out. As someone originally from Orlando, I ironically cannot compare it to Kennedy Space Center, as I've never been. However, in comparison, I've been told the latter is better by those who have been to both. Nonetheless, this place is good",
          "More interesting than I thought it would be. Plenty to do, and see. The IMAX presentation was particularly good. Walking through the MIR space station was eye opening. Other exhibits include Arianne 5 and Soyus capsule. Only niggle was only the main restaurant open with set",
          "We spend one afternoon at the cit\u00e9 and would easily have spend more time without getting bored. The expo is packed with small and bigger activities that learn you the science related to space travel in a fun and informative way. It is also well suited to visit with children",

          "This is a \"must\" day out for the family. Educationally brilliant by allowing all young at heart to experience the life of an astronaut and the likely future as we continue to find out more about the solar system and beyond. The real pleasures of this park are the interactive",
          "Not the largest park you will find but a great place for a day fun with kids all ages. Planetarium is aging and a bit boring but the IMAX movie is very nice and they have a large selection of activities to spend a full day there.",
          "Not that much choice inside the Cite de l'espace ... so you should be patient if you plan to eat in any of the park restaurants. Despite the wait the guys welcome in us was friendly and funny and the waitress was also very friendly despite the fact that it was 2:30PM of a",
          "It depends what you are looking for but this place is more for the children and teenagers and not so much for the couples. The best thing in it are the movies about the space which are made in a good quality and quite exciting.",
          "We stopped by here for a simple lunch before going-on the visit at le cite d'espace. Despite its tourist price menu, the food was quite ok considering it is a theme park restaurant. My baked Camembert cheese was yummy. Comfortable seat, nothing to complain.",

          "We read all the reviews and went hesitantly to see what we thought Some people have complained there is not enough in English which is. It true. I didn't see anything that didn't have a good English translation with it. It's a very intelligently designed, interactive way to",
          "We were disappointed by our visit, which costs a whopping 21 euros per person. It could be really interesting for both adults and children but the whole experience has been reduced to a very childish level. If you do decide to visit, the number 37 bus from town stops right",
          "We were looking for somewhere to spend a few hours after checking out of our gite and taking an early evening flight from Toulouse airport. The kids, now 13 and 11, had really enjoyed Kennedy Space Centre a couple of years ago and we realised we knew little of the European Space",
          "Cite de l'Espace is located about 15 minutes drive from Toulouse center. We went there on a tuesday in September. Parking is free and very close. There were no lines at all for buying tickets. For space lovers it is an interactive museum. Translations are provided for non french",
          "Took my 17 year old son here whilst the wife went shopping in Toulouse. We we're both quite disappointed. Ideal for school trips (for 10 year olds) but really...this is not a 'Space City'. Too many videos to watch, too many fake models, and not much more. Even the ''Rocket",
          "Not designed for anyone who does not speak French, but interesting nevertheless. Easy to get to from metro/bus. Lots of activities but timetable not well planned and we missed some events. Lunch was either a proper dinner or snack, but the baguettes had almost all sold out by",
          "You couldn't do this park justice without spending most of a day there, so when they have a hotel deal with free re-entry the following day it would be worth considering. Easy to buy your ticket on-line and then pick up your ticket at one of the machines in reception. Avoids",
          "We arrived at about 10.30am and stayed until closing time. Fascinating to see the Mir Space Station and various rockets up close. Not too big. Easy to wonder round and there are various seats and shade and a cafe. Indoor exhibition very good and interactive in parts. English",
          "This is a place for both space enthusiasts and kids, but be sure to have at least one full day if you want to explore it all. Pay a closer look at the program, since certain exhibitions are only open from certain hours. The price for the IMAX and Planetarium and all other",

          "Came here with my parents, my husband, my 6 year old and twin 11 month olds. It was lunchtime when we arrived so we went to the restaurant to eat first. The staff were very accommodating, moving the tables around to make space for us and our double buggy. The manager was really",
          "Loads of rockets spaced around the park to see. Descriptions in both French and English. Inside the main centre is 3 floors of interactive displays. A little way out of the city centre but really good transport connnections with bus stop right outside. Well worth a visit",
          "Everything about space travel is here. History of how it started, rockets, fuels, what they eat, wear and some good hands on interactive displays. There was even a prototype of the Mir station and you get to try moon walking.",
          "This is an amazing and a place to learn about space for both kids and adults. But have many activities for kids",
          "Bring your kids there. It's an amazing place to understand how space industry works. A lot of fun for kids especially and things are well maintained. Only set back is the lack of information at each points.",
          "while the daily menu looked great, we opted for a hamburger and a salad with chevre. the burger arrived luke warm and the french fries were terrible! worst I've ever had. The salad was good but at 15 euro a bit over-priced. not that hard to make nor costly. the service was",

          "I visited Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace with my 3 year old daughter and it was very enjoyable for her, even though the main public would be of older children. The exhibitions are amazing and the information provided very interesting. We also had lunch at the cafeteria and it was very good",
          "Child at heart here, loved all-things space as a kid and this place took me right back to that headspace. The planetarium is incredible, the exhibitions solid (especially learning while you quiz-off against mates) and the moon walk was incredibly novel. \u20ac22 Euros and no extra",
          "Recommended in Toulouse ! Have a good 3 hours there, including watching imax movie on mars expedition. Go inside Mir, I loved it",

          "This park is a little out of date and could do with some updating. What is there is great to look at, climb into, wander through, float in and be thrust into(almost) weightlessness. The exhibitions within the main building are good and comprehensive. There is a fair amount of",
          "We visited this museum with our young children and everyone loved it! The kids liked pretending to be astronauts on the moon. We ended up spending a few hours there and never did see it all. The restaurant on site is also excellent so there's no need to cut your visit short",

          "We spent the day here and our kids (8 and 10) loved it! There were a lot of interactive displays, far more English than I expected, and so very much to see and do. With just the IMAX and planetarium shows alone you could spend 4 hours. The kids favourite was easily the Moon",
          "My wife and I found this place a bit dull but our 7 year old science and space mad son rated it very highly. All of the exhibitions within the park can be done within half a day. Informative but not much fun. If you have nothing better to do on a rainy day then you could",
          "We prebooked to avoid queuing but found that it got busier in the afternoon anyway. There is so much to see and do and it's very well organised. You can quite easily spend the whole day there and it's great for adults as well as children. If you are staying in Toulouse then the",

          "The Cite de l espace is definitely a must to be seen museum among the numerous ones that offers Toulouse. Wether you are a tech fan or an history lover, the Cite de l espace is a comprehensive museum of what was the city's contribution to the space venture with companies or labs",

          "At the first sight it seems to be small, something for no more than one hour. But if you left your kids playing with all the things and you try to explain briefly only half of the things, you will be not able to finish in one entire day. Deserves a specific travel just for it.",
          "An excellent collection of both French and European space agency history and spacecraft. With full scaled mock-ups of the Ariane 5 rocket, Mir space station, and Soyuz module you have an opportunity to see the size of these projects and read the histories and technical data. Add",

          "The entrance fee includes all the activities on site, which I think is quite a good price. It includes the IMAX and Planetarium. The displays are well presented with lots of great activities both for kids and adults to try out. You can easily spend the entire day there... We",
          "Good day out with the kids - there is a lot of read and learn, interactive games etc.. The 3D cinema was mind blowing but perhaps lost on kids under the age of 4years old. if the weather is dry there is a great play area outside. Lunch at the restaurant was ok nothing to rave",
          "All my local friends laughed at me and my husband for visiting this but it was good fun (if you like space). Only issue is that quite a bit of stuff is in French only, but enough was in english to get by. Definitely go to the IMAX show - it's included in the admission price and",
          "An exciting outing for the whole family; make sure to set aside several hours to explore all that there is to offer (and to get value from the entrance tickets). The iMax is very impressive for young (8 plus) and old. We spent the rest of our time with our children looking at",
          "What the place is about is really interesting: it is a place for curious people to discover by multimedia means the exploration of space and all things space related. However the entry fee is really high. Around 20 euros per person. You can definetely understand why : there is a",
          "Absolutely recommended. Since I was a kid I was always passionate about space and stars, and visiting the City of Space was nothing short of magical. Everything is translated in French, English and Spanish except for a bunch of video-documentaries but they're not necessary to",

          "Well worth a visit,plenty to see and do, from exhibitions, interactive activities and film shows. The IMAX cinema is a must, all screened in 3D, make sure you get your head set as the commentary is in French, my advice is to get there 15 minutes before the start as it is the",

          "The reason I have not given it a 4 stars is because of the entry fee of 24 euros . It is a good day out with the kids but ensure you have enough time to spend there given the entry fees. I would suggest more explanations in English as a number of our fellow travellers were",
          "Good place to visit with children. It is quite interesting but people taking care of the explanations only did it in french in most cases. 3D imax (Hubble film) strongly recommended. Park is clean and the restaurant is correct. You can enter food and drinks into the park if you",

          "The place is nice, the exposition is well organized and there are a lot of things to see/do. On the other end, the place totally lacks of showmanship and is way too focus on France (like all the french exhibits ). Considering the 24 euros per adult admission fee, i would say",
          "This tribute to the French contribution to international space exploration makes for a great day out. For those with an adventurous heart and wish to go where no man has gone before this museum tells the story form the first rockets to life aboard the International space",

          "On arriving here we thought it was quite small but it is actually not possible to see and do everything in one day. Arrive early as there is a queue for tickets or book them on-line before you go. The park was open only from 10 to 18:00 and there is quite a lot to do in that",

          "Didn't know that this was in the city (on the outskirts), trip by bus, change of bus required from the centre of Toulouse. A well built park/attraction perfect for kids and adults. 2/3 hours needed to see it - if the weather is good, nice outdoor sections too!",
          "It is an interesting place to visit especially if you have kids. The price is a little expensive but it is worth to pay that amount because of the activities proposed. You will need at least 7 to 8 hours to really enjoy your time. Check the program so you will not miss the",
          "Interesting displays. The planetarium is good. The imax is as you would expect. There needs to be more interactive displays and technology for kids. For such a large facility, there is not a great deal to hold the attention for more than an hour or two, except for the",
          "Went to Cite de l'Espace thinking it would be a good way to spend a couple of hours and ended up spending the whole day. The educational parts are fun and interactive and the history is well done as well. In addition to the exhibits there is a planetarium show and an IMAX show",
          "The museum and space garden is great to see and have a short visit. You can observe and enter a few of the spacecrafts and learn about the history of space exploring. There is a planetarium closeby as well.",

          "This was on our list of places to visit this year but at about \u20ac100 for our family of 5 it was a bit rich. We then noticed it was open until 23.00hrs over the summer hols and is HALF PRICE after 7pm \u263a. We went and really enjoyed it. Make sure you get the headphones for the IMAX.",
          "Cite de l'espace has it all to be a top attraction. However, the queueing procedure made people behave badly. Getting in front of eachother was common practice. The service at the restaurant at the Imax theater was poor. The food was getting cold, the guys behind the counter",
          "The mockups of the Mir space station and the Soyuz capsule are good fun. I certainly had no idea how tiny the Soyuz was. Everything else is a bit mundane, so the whole experience, as a package, is, to my mind, well overpriced.",

          "This is a great place if you or your child have a keen interest in space - if you are only vaguely interested you might be better off dropping the space enthusiast's off and going shopping in Toulousse. There is loads of reading information & interactive activities but none",
          "I went with my 16 year old son who is interested in all things scientific and we both loved our visit here. The air condiitoned Imax cinema with two presentations - one on near miss collisions with earth and the other on the far galaxy was a good thing to do when the",

          "Extraordinaire place! There are so many things to do there, enough to entertain you for a full day. Many interactive things, very well presented, for adults and for kids, you don't even need to have astronomy as a hobby to get captivated. It is also well suited for non French",
          "Not a bad place to visit, but I went as a business group so we had the place to ourselves. The stellarium was ok but the focus of the projection was not very sharp. Some interesting displays and rocket parts to seee and touch. The full size Ariane5 is impressive, I didn't get",
          "We went in February. Weather was cold but clear sky. Easy to find carpark (for those who drive). The place is separated by indoor and outdoor. We went mostly outdoor where the spaceship is. There is also a children playground nearby which is really good for the children.",

          "We were travelling home via Toulouse and had stayed at Campanile Hotel opposite Cite de l'Espace before but didn't visit. Arrived 14.30 and was informed they closed at 17.00, but the receptionist told us the most important places to visit and in which order, she was spot on and",
          "With a planetarium and an IMAX included you can easily spend several hours here. Many exhibits are interactive, some multilingual. I was not aware of how strong Frances aerospace industry was so that was interesting. Make sure to see what interpretive talks are also going on.",

          "Interesting for all the family, with interactive games, although some are now dated. Only problem is that there is long wait for the most popular games and exhibits and the children got bored. Good cafe and outdoor playground. Not cheap!",
          "Even for those not particularly interested in aeroplanes this is a really nice visit. You do need to book in advance and provide information regarding your dob and place of birth",
          "Good family day out. Plenty to do for teenagers up, probably a bit much for younger children (ours aged 2 and 4). The imax movie was good and it engaged the younger ones.",
          "This place is an excellent spot for those who are interested in the stars and galaxies and those with children. A note of caution, it is mostly in French - although you can get an electronic translator for the Imax show on the hubble space telescope. It cost us 56 euro for two",
          "Absolutely a must for families visiting Toulouse. Your kids will enjoy a lot of attractions about space. Very interesting the visit to the Soviet space station. You can also experience what you'd feel by walking on the moon!",
          "It was an amazing experience being strapped to this machine that helped mimic how I would have walked on Mars! The place a definitely worth visiting. Apart from the 3D movie and the Awesome planetarium. It houses several space crafts including the the Russian Mir. I also like",

          "It's a great afternoon for families that don't necessarily want the crowds, noise and general excesses that come with a typical theme park visit. There aren't really any rides, just loads of interactive displays and a couple of simple but neat zero-gravity simulators. We live",
          "The park is located just off the A61, southeast of the Toulouse city centre with ample free parking on site. Entrance fee is about 20 euros but you'll need all day to explore all the activities so value for money. Lots of interactive displays and life size models. Things to see",
          "Put simply, there's just not enough to look at. Way too many interactive displays and not enough hardware. Not recommended.",
          "Lots to keep anyone interested. We spent 5 hours there and I'm not even that interested in space travel! Lots of interactive stuff. I recorded my own weather broadcast!",
          "This was a good place to take two 12 year old boys they really did love it. It does need a full day to explore everything especially if you want to see the shows. After reading bad reviews regarding the catering we opted to take a picnic. There is a good undercover picnic",
          "A magnificent place to understand the ljourney of space. Many interactive displays and amazing pieces. The most interesting hing is that it captures all ages and truly displays that space is a world thing not just to the Americans and Russians. Congrats to ll you must go there",
          "This was a good experience, but better if you had kids and wanted to give them a life sized experience. The headsets that they use in the shows are a bit hit and miss and mine didn't work at all. Despite that I still enjoyed the spectacular.",
          "Entry is very expensive though there's an interesting variety of exhibits. When we visited (a Saturday afternoon), the cafeteria had a very poor choice of pre-packaged food available. Disappointing and a bit lacklustre when compared to the NASA equivalent at the Kennedy Space",

          "A Nice park with several activities for kids up to 12. Good 3D movie, expositions and interactive toys. Cozzy playground with tematic toys. Restaurant with reasonable prices. If you don't speak French it will hard to translater to the kids.",
          "The Imax cinema with a film about the Hubble telescope was interesting and informative. So was the planetarium's exposition on the eight planets of the solar system - and the things to see in the night-sky today. There were short queues for both of these shows, but the park was",

          "The 22 euro entry price might seem expensive, but there is a lot to see and do here, so set aside a full day or you won't see it all. The mock-up of the Mir space station alone is worth the entry price, but there are lots of interactive exhibits to interest all ages. Children",
          "Great IMAX theatre with 3D films. Real MIR space station training module, full size models of Ariane rocket and satellites.",
          "Most other visitors were school parties, but the children were well behaved. The attraction does have information in English, although it is limited, but it is enough to get an understanding. All the films are in French, but you can wear headsets to listen in English (this was",

          "This is a great place to visit for children and adults. I went with my husband just as a way to pass the time but ended up staying there all day! There is so much packed into what appears to be a small site. The IMAX cinema and planetarium are a must during the visit. I think it",

        "wiki": "The Toulouse and Montauban shootings were a series of Islamist terrorist attacks committed by Mohammed Merah in March 2012 in the cities of Montauban and Toulouse in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region of France. He targeted French Army soldiers as well as children and teachers at a Jewish school. In total, seven people were killed and five wounded.\nMerah, a 23-year-old French petty criminal of Algerian descent born and raised in Toulouse, began his killing spree on 11 March, shooting an off-duty French Army paratrooper in Toulouse. On 15 March, he killed two off-duty uniformed French soldiers and seriously wounded another in Montauban. On 19 March, he opened fire at the Ozar Hatorah Jewish day school in Toulouse, killing a rabbi and three children, and also wounding four others. After the shootings, France raised its terror alert system, Vigipirate, to the highest level in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region and surrounding departements.Merah, who filmed his attacks with a body-worn camera, claimed allegiance to Al-Qaeda. He said he carried out his attacks because of France's participation in the War in Afghanistan and its ban on Islamic face veils, and justified his attack on the Jewish school because \"The Jews kill our brothers and sisters in Palestine\". He was killed on 22 March by a police tactical unit after a 30-hour siege at his rented apartment there, during which he wounded six agents. His brother and another man were later convicted of taking part in a \"terrorist conspiracy\" over the attacks, which were condemned by the French Council of the Muslim Faith, the United Nations and many governments around the world.\n\n\n== Background of shooter ==\nAccording to one of his brothers, unrelated with his criminal activities, Merah and his siblings were raised in an \"atmosphere of racism and hatred\" in their Muslim family, headed by their mother alone after their father left when Merah was young. They lived in the poor neighborhood of Toulouse. French investigators believe that Merah turned to Salafism after being imprisoned as a young man for petty crimes; he was believed to have become increasingly radical after taking two journeys to Afghanistan and Pakistan.Merah had tried to enlist in the French Army, but was rejected because of his criminal convictions. Some sources have noted connections of Merah's family (through his mother's second marriage) to a man who was aligned with the terrorist group al-Qaeda. They also reported Merah's history of psychological issues as factors in the shootings.Merah said he was a mujaheed and claimed ties to al-Qaeda, but French authorities found no evidence of that and denied his claim.President Sarkozy described the attack as isolated. The police investigation found that Merah had made more than 1,800 calls to over 180 contacts in 20 different countries, in addition to having taken several trips to the Middle East and Afghanistan, and they suggested he might have been in touch with others about his planned attacks.\n\n\n== Attacks ==\nPolice found that Mohammed Merah was the shooter (see below). Authorities determined that he used the same weapon in all the attacks: a .45 pistol. In all three attacks, witnesses observed that the helmeted shooter arrived and left on the same scooter, which was found to have been stolen.\n\n\n=== 11 March: paratrooper in Toulouse ===\nOn 11 March, Master Sergeant Imad Ibn-Ziaten, a 30-year-old off-duty French Moroccan paratrooper in the 1st Parachute Logistics Regiment (1er R\u00e9giment du train parachutiste), was killed by a point-blank shot in the head outside Toulouse. Ibn-Ziaten was known to be waiting to meet someone who said he was interested in buying a motorcycle from him. Police suspected that the shooter set up the meeting in order to attack the paratrooper. The perpetrator was described as wearing a helmet and riding a motorcycle.The family of Ibn-Ziaten buried him in their hometown of M'diq, Morocco.\n\n\n=== 15 March: three paratroopers in Montauban ===\nOn Thursday, 15 March, at around 14:00, two uniformed soldiers, 25-year-old Corporal Abel Chennouf and 23-year-old Private Mohamed Legouad, were shot and killed and a third, 27-year-old Lo\u00efc Liber, was seriously injured by shooting (and left tetraplegic) as the three were withdrawing money from a cash machine outside a shopping centre in Montauban, around 50 km north of Toulouse. They were all from the 17th Parachute Engineer Regiment (17e R\u00e9giment du g\u00e9nie parachutiste), whose barracks are close to the town. The security cameras showed the killer riding a powerful maxi-scooter and wearing a black helmet. While taking aim, the killer reportedly pushed aside an elderly woman waiting to withdraw money from the cash machine.\n\n\n=== 19 March: Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse ===\n\nThe Ozar Hatorah school in Toulouse is part of a national chain of at least twenty Jewish schools throughout France. It educates children of primarily Sephardic, Middle Eastern and North African descent, who with their parents have made up the majority of Jewish immigrants to France since the late 20th century. The school is a middle and secondary school, with most children between the ages of 11 to 17. It also serves as a transportation node for other schools. Many parents bring their younger children to Ozar Hatorah, to place them on shuttle buses that travel to the other schools in the area.\nAt about 8:00 am on 19 March, a man rode up to the Ozar Hatorah school on a Yamaha TMAX motorcycle. Dismounting, he immediately opened fire toward the schoolyard. The first victim was 30-year-old Jonathan Sandler, a rabbi and teacher at the school who was shot outside the school gates as he tried to shield his two young sons from the gunman. The gunman shot both the boys\u20145-year-old Ari\u00e9 and 3-year-old Gabriel\u2014as well before walking into the schoolyard, chasing people into the building.\nInside, he shot at staff, parents, and students. He chased 8-year-old Myriam Monsonego, the daughter of the head teacher, into the courtyard, caught her by her hair and raised a gun to shoot her. The gun jammed at this point. He changed weapons from what the police identified as a 9mm pistol to a .45 calibre gun, and shot the girl in her temple at point-blank range. Bryan Bijaoui, a 17-year-old boy, was also shot and gravely injured. The gunman retrieved his scooter and rode away.\nThe government increased security and raised the terrorist warnings to the highest level in the Midi-Pyrenees region in the immediate aftermath of the Toulouse school shooting. It was already providing continuous protection to many Jewish institutions, but it closed traffic on streets in France with Jewish institutions for additional security. The election campaign was suspended and President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as other candidates in the presidential elections, immediately traveled to Toulouse and the school. Sarkozy called for a minute of silence the following day in all schools in the nation.\n\nOn 23 March, Ange Mancini, intelligence adviser to President Sarkozy, said Merah had wanted to kill another soldier in Toulouse, but arrived too late and instead attacked the nearby Jewish school.The bodies of all four dead were flown to Israel on 20 March, accompanied by French foreign minister Alain Jupp\u00e9. They were buried by family members at the Har HaMenuchot cemetery in Jerusalem. The two deceased children of Jonathan Sandler were dual French-Israeli citizens, as are Sandler's widow and their surviving child.\n\n\n=== 19 March\u201322 March: manhunt ===\n\nThe police conducted one of the biggest manhunts in modern French history. They erected roadblocks in Toulouse and placed extra security outside Jewish and Islamic schools across France. Because of the ethnic identities of the victims, all of whom were of Jewish, North African or Afro-Caribbean descent, police initially suspected the involvement of neo-Nazis, which have expressed opposition to all these ethnic groups. Since Merah had previously drawn little police or security attention, police did not initially identify him as a suspect, even as he committed more murders. Merah cleaned the magazine and shell casings he left to prevent identification of fingerprints or DNA.\nThe search for Sergeant Ibn Ziaten's bogus motorbike buyer began to home in on the Merahs' computer, as cross-checks revealed that the Toulouse woman who owned the IP address had two sons on the government's anti-terrorism watchlist. Merah asked a motorcycle mechanic in Toulouse about removing a GPS anti-theft tracking device on his bike, and told the mechanic he had just repainted the bike white. The mechanic alerted the police to Merah's actions, who identified the motorcycle as the one used in the attacks.\n\n\n=== 22 March: siege and perpetrator's death ===\nAn hour before police surrounded his apartment, Merah called the French television channel France 24. Ebba Kalondo, the editor who spoke with him, reported that Merah suggested his \"acts were not only necessary, but that they were to uphold the honour of Islam.\" According to Kalondo, \"He said he was in connection with al Qaeda, that what he had done was only the beginning. He said he was against the French ban on face covering and fought against the French participation in operations of NATO in Afghanistan.\"At 03:00 local time (02:00 UTC), the French police tried to arrest Merah at his apartment on Sergent Vign\u00e9 Street in the C\u00f4te Pav\u00e9e neighborhood of Toulouse. Merah shot at the police through the door, injuring three police officers in the process.The elite police anti-terrorist unit, French: Recherche Assistance Intervention Dissuasion (\"Research, Assistance, Intervention, Deterrence\" \u2013 RAID), surrounded the 1960s-era five-storey block of flats soon after. Merah was later found to have been armed with an AK-47, an Uzi, a Sten, a Winchester 12 gauge pump-action shotgun, three Colt .45s, a 9mm Glock, and a Colt Python .357 Magnum. The police found additional weapons were found in a rented Renault Megane parked near the apartment building. Authorities evacuated the five-storey building block and nearby buildings, and trained powerful spotlights on Merah's building in an attempt to blind him and prevent him from observing police operations. They cut off electricity and gas supplies to the apartment block, and switched off the street lights in the neighbourhood.Merah exchanged a Colt .45 for a walkie-talkie as arranged by police; he told them the location of a bag containing the camera used to film his attacks. The police also arrested one of Merah's brothers; another turned himself into custody. Police found weapons and explosives in his brother's car. His mother was brought to the scene to help with negotiations, but she refused to become involved, due to her lack of influence on Merah.Merah informed the police that he intended to give himself up at 22:45. Contact was established with him at that time, but Merah said that he would not give up without a fight and would kill policemen if necessary. In the late evening of 21 March, blasts were heard at the apartment block, which were intended to intimidate Merah into surrendering. The police blew off the window shutters with a grenade, after which two shots were heard. After that there was no response from Merah until 11:00 the next day. The police continued the explosions at regular intervals, in an effort to wear Merah down. Officers did not know if Merah was alive, as he did not respond to the series of explosions during the night and on Thursday morning.\n\nAt 10:30 on 22 March, the police decided to arrest Merah. They threw grenades into the apartment but there was no response. A team of 15 specially trained officers decided to enter the flat first by the door, then using the windows, whose shutters had been removed during the night. The team deployed technical devices and video equipment to inspect the different rooms. No presence was detected until a device was introduced into the bathroom. At that point, Merah emerged, shooting long and frequent bursts. The officers returned fire and snipers opposite attempted to neutralise him. Merah jumped out of the window with weapon in hand and continued to shoot. Merah was shot in the head by a police sniper and was found dead on the ground.Less than one hour later, authorities announced to media in Toulouse that Merah was dead. Merah's death was later confirmed by President Sarkozy. Agence France-Presse reported that three police officers had been injured in the exchanges of gunfire, one of whom sustained \"fairly serious\" wounds. Merah was found to have a bulletproof vest, components of Molotov cocktails, and weapons parts stockpiled inside his flat.During the standoff with police, Merah told police that he intended to keep on attacking, and he loved death the way the police loved life. He also claimed connections with al-Qaeda. Police have not substantiated this claim.\n\n\n== Perpetrator ==\nMohammed Merah (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0645\u0631\u0627\u062d\u200e; 10 October 1988 \u2013 22 March 2012) was born to French parents of Algerian descent.\n\n\n=== Filming ===\nMerah filmed all of the killings using a GoPro camera strapped to his body. He made a video of them set to music and verses of the Koran. He sent the video to news agency Al Jazeera. After a request from French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Al Jazeera decided against airing the video. One video shows Merah shooting two French Muslim soldiers in Montauban, and shouting Allahu Akbar.\n\n\n=== Motivation ===\nPrior to the identification of Merah as the attacker, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said that the anti-semitic nature of the Jewish school attack appeared obvious. After Merah was identified, Sarkozy stated that \"the Islamic faith has nothing to do with the insane motivations of this man,\" and others have repeated this view. Merah admitted anti-Semitic motivations for his attack during the siege with police.Some media have described Merah as an \"Islamic terrorist\". Merah said that he resented France's ban on women wearing the burqa, and that \"the Jews have killed our brothers and sisters in Palestine.\"He also wanted to avenge the French Army's involvement in the war in Afghanistan. An editor at France 24 reported that Merah told him that these acts were not only necessary, but that they were to \"uphold the honour of Islam\". During the murders, Merah said, \"you killed my brothers, I kill you.\" Journalist Ed West described this as an expression of tribalism, not religion.Mohammed Merah's older brother, Abdelghani, said that Mohammed was raised in an \"atmosphere of racism and hatred.\" He blamed his family for Mohammed's attraction to extremist Islamism and antisemitism. Merah's sister Souad said, \"I am proud of my brother. He fought until the end... Jews, and all those who massacre Muslims, I detest them.\"\nAbdelghani stated that, during their childhood, their mother frequently stated that Arabs were born to hate Jews, and that there may be more \"Mohammed Merahs\" if families were allowed to teach such hatred. In 2003, Mohammed stabbed Abdelghani seven times as the latter refused to give up his Jewish girlfriend.Dan Bilefsky linked Merah's anger to the high unemployment and alienation of young immigrants in France, and said this affected his development as a self-styled jihadist. Canadian journalist Rosie DiManno argued that Merah was motivated neither by religion nor the treatment of immigrants in France. She noted that while Merah had familial links with militant Islam (his mother was married to the father of Sabri Essid, who was arrested in 2007 at an al-Qaeda safe house in Syria for militants en route to Iraq), there was no evidence that Merah was involved with militant groups or even any religious congregation. DiManno characterized Merah as a sociopath who \"sought posthumous grandeur\" and adopted a terror agenda as a cover for his pre-existing rage.Journalist Paul Sheehan attacked what he called progressives going into overdrive to \"dissociate the violence from Islam\" when it was revealed the killer was a Muslim who supported al-Qaeda. He observed that Merah had dubbed his film of the shootings with verses from the Koran invoking jihad and the greatness of Islam before he mailed it to Al-Jazeera. Merah had studied the Koran while in prison. Sheehan argues that Merah specifically targeted Muslim soldiers and Jews in a premeditated attack. President Sarkozy's intelligence adviser stated that Merah did not originally target the Jewish school, but attacked it only after arriving too late to ambush a soldier nearby.According to Christian Etelin, Merah's lawyer since he was 16, Merah was suffering from \"psychological difficulties\". Etelin stated that Merah was abandoned by his father as a child, and there were reports that he split with by his wife days before the attacks. Etelin denied that Merah was an Islamist. He said that Merah could have committed the shootings in an episode of \"paranoid schizophrenia during which he completely disconnected from reality.\" Bernard Squarcini, the head of DRCI (France's domestic intelligence agency), stated, \"you have to go back to his broken childhood and psychiatric troubles. To carry out what he did smacks more of a medical problem and fantasy than a simple jihadist trajectory.\"Intelligence documents later showed Mohamed Merah had made more than 1,800 calls to over 180 contacts in 20 different countries, in addition to having made several trips to the Middle East and Afghanistan. Haaretz reported that these facts cast doubt on Squarcini's view of Merah as a solitary figure who was not part of a terrorist network.\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\nThe attacks were condemned by many governments around the world. The United Nations condemned the killings \"in the strongest possible terms,\"\nand the French Council of the Muslim Faith also condemned the attacks.In a speech to Palestinian youths at an UNRWA event, the European Union's High Representative Baroness Ashton said, \"When we think about what happened today in Toulouse, we remember what happened in Norway a year ago, when we know what is happening in Syria, and we see what is happening in Gaza and Sderot and in different parts of the world \u2013 we remember young people and children who lose their lives.\" Israeli ministers harshly criticised her comparison of the Toulouse murders to the situation in Gaza. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, \"It is unthinkable to compare a massacre and the Israeli army's surgical, defensive actions against those who use children as human shields.\" Lady Ashton said that the press reporting of her speech was \"grossly distorted\" and that had she also referred to Israeli victims in Sderot, but this had been incorrectly omitted from the original transcript.The Palestinian Authority condemned the attacks as \"racist crimes\". Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad said terrorists must stop trying to justify their acts of violence \"in the name of Palestine.\"\n\n\n=== Reactions in French society ===\nOn 19 March, the date of the attack on the Jewish school, President Sarkozy declared the date to be \"a day of national tragedy.\" Both Sarkozy and Francois Hollande condemned the attacks.\nOn 20 March, cities across France observed a minute's silence in remembrance of the victims at the Jewish school. Dalil Boubakeur, Rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, condemned the attacks. Gilles Bernheim, the Chief Rabbi of France, called for strengthening the links between Jewish and Muslim communities. According to Rabbi Marc Schneier, thousands of Muslims and Jews joined together in solidarity marches throughout Paris.Many Jewish children in France were afraid to go to school after the shootings, and Jewish teenagers reported fears of dressing in a recognisably Jewish manner. Some Israeli politicians called on French Jews to emigrate to Israel to escape the anti-Semitism in France.A number of French media questioned the role of the security services during the operation and whether more could have been done to prevent the killings. French counter-terrorism expert Christian Prouteau criticised the siege operation, saying tear gas might have been used to capture Merah alive and reduce the chance he could attack police.Nicholas Vancour reported that the reaction in Les Izards, a \"sensitive urban zone\" with a large Arab Muslim population where Mohamed Merah grew up, was to regard Merah to be \"one of their own, no matter what he did.\" One woman was supportive of Merah's family; a family friend of the Merahs expressed sympathy for him, but said she did not condone his actions. A group of twenty youths accosted the police, and Mohamed Redha Ghezali, a 20-year-old man from the neighbourhood, was sentenced to three months in prison for praising Merah's actions. The man while haranguing police officers had said, \"My friend Mohamed is a real man \u2013 too bad he wasn't able to finish the job.\" He was convicted of \"provoking racial hatred\" and \"apology for terrorism,\" and the Toulouse prosecutor stated that France would \"systematically pursue\" people expressing support for Merah. Some young men of the neighbourhood found conspiracy theories more convincing than that one of their own could be a killer. A movement is under way to mount a demonstration in support of the imprisoned Abdelkader Merah, who faces charges of complicity in murder and conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism.Mohammed Merah's older brother, Abdelghani, later wrote a book condemning the hero-worship of Mohamed among some young French Muslims. He recalled \"whoops of joy\" and that people were congratulating his mother at the wake for Mohammed.\n\n\n=== Rallies ===\nOn 19 March, several thousand people marched silently in Paris in memory of the victims of the shootings.\nOn 24 March, hundreds of people gathered in Lyon and Rouen, to pay tribute to the victims in silent marches. Many held signs saying \"We will never forget\". In Toulouse, 6,000 people marched on 25 March, including mayor Pierre Cohen, Chief Rabbi of France Gilles Bernheim, and Hassen Chalghoumi, the imam at Drancy.Small demonstrations honouring Merah were held on housing estates, including in his hometown of Toulouse. A small rally of around 30 people held in Toulouse in tribute of Merah was dispersed by French police. The AGI reported that most protesters were young women wearing the burka, which is banned in France in public places. Several people acquainted with the killer attempted to leave flowers outside his flat. Members of the group said this was a gesture to restore dignity to the Muslim community of Toulouse and Merah's family and was not an attempt to vindicate Merah; others said that they did not wish to judge him harshly and that the vilification of Merah was unfair. The New York Times quoted Pierre Cohen, the mayor of Toulouse, stating that rumours of Muslims organizing a demonstration for Merah were \"false\".  Graffiti in Toulouse read \"Viva Merah\", \"Vengeance\" and \"Fuck the kippa\" before being cleaned.\n\n\n=== Criticism of media ===\n\nJoel Braunold criticised the \"airbrushing [of] anti-Semitism out of the Toulouse attack\" and the view that Merah was \"imbued neither with the values of Islam, or driven by racism and anti-Semitism.\" He criticised the \"dehumanization of Merah's victims\" and the way in which some have interpreted the killings as a symbol of attacking society in general. He was disturbed at the \"inabilities of some to even mention anti-Semitism as a cause\" despite the fact that some of Merah's victims were not random and were Jews.The media were also criticized for incorrectly labeling far-right groups as the perpetrators before the attacker was known.\n\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n\n=== Fears of backlash ===\nIn the aftermath, many French Muslims feared the stigmatization of the Muslim community and an increase in Islamophobia. President Sarkozy also warned against stigmatizing millions of French Muslims because of the actions of a single extremist.\n\n\n=== Internet law proposal ===\nPresident Sarkozy proposed a new law that would imprison those who repeatedly visit websites promoting terror or hatred. According to The Times of India, legal experts are concerned that such a law could curtail freedom of speech. Reporters Without Borders accused Sarkozy of trying to create an internet surveillance system.\n\n\n=== Anti-Semitic incidents ===\nThe French Jewish community documented 90 anti-Semitic incidents in the 10 days after Merah's attack. The Service de Protection de la Communaut\u00e9 Juive (SPCJ) recorded 148 anti-Semitic incidents in March and April, with forty-three of those classified as violent. The authorities also recorded 105 instances of anti-Semitic intimidation and threats during those two months. Jewish graves were vandalised in Nice. The SPCJ said the situation was \"deeply worrisome\" and reflected support for Merah's attack. Interior Minister Manuel Valls held a meeting with Jewish representatives, promising increased protection for Jewish institutions in France.The French police investigated email and telephone threats received by staff at the school in the days following the attacks. On 26 March, a 12-year-old boy was hit and punched in the back of his head as he left his Ozar Hatorah school in Paris \"by youths reciting anti-Semitic slogans\". In one attack, a Jewish man and his friend were attacked by people identifying themselves as Palestinians, who promised to \"exterminate\" the Jews. In Villeurbanne, three youths wearing Jewish skullcaps were leaving a Jewish school when they were attacked with a hammer and iron bars. Incoming French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault described the attack as \"intolerable violence\".\n\n\n=== Co-conspirators ===\nMohamed Merah's 29-year-old brother, Abdelkader Merah, was detained after the death of his brother and faced preliminary charges of complicity in murder and conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism. Investigators believed that he may have assisted Mohamed with the preparation of the killings. Abdelkader's lawyer denied these allegations, saying that press reports that Abdelkader expressed pride in his brother's acts were false, and that he had not been aware of Mohamed's plans. In Les Izards, where some planned to mount a demonstration in support of Abdelkader, many find the idea of an organised plot by the Merahs to be absurd.In 2017, Abdelkader Merah was found guilty of \"taking part in a criminal terrorist conspiracy\". He was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Fettah Malki was found guilty of the same crime and sentenced to 14 years in jail.\n\n\n=== Arrest and expulsion of Jihadists ===\nIn dawn raids in Toulouse and other cities, police arrested 19 suspected militants connected to Forsane Alizza. According to the BBC, the arrests appeared to be in response to the shootings. The arrested individuals were suspected of inciting violence and terrorism, according to the daily Le Parisien. CNN and the BBC reported that French authorities did not link any of those arrested to Merah. The French prosecutor has denied any link between the arrests, which were the product of an investigation begun in October 2011, and the shootings. President Sarkozy also said the arrests were not directly linked to Mohammed Merah.In discussing alienation and Les Izards, Nicholas Vinocur writes, \"The fear is, there may be more Mohamed Merahs in waiting among Europe's largest Muslim community, of some five million people in France \u2013 a worry that may partly explain Friday's roundup of 19 suspected militant Islamists as Sarkozy's government asserts a firm grip on security.\" Professor Olivier Roy doubts that disenfranchised youth are vulnerable to terrorism, writing that \"For every Qaeda sympathizer there are thousands of Muslims who don the French Army uniform and fight under the French flag.\"Sarkozy requested that the police increase its surveillance of \"radical Islam\" amid rising concerns of a jihadist threat in France.\nThere were suggestions that the government and DCRI were intensifying efforts to deal with suspected militants after being criticised for allowing Merah to slip through the net. The domestic intelligence agency seized several firearms, including five rifles, four automatic weapons and three Kalashnikovs, as well as a bulletproof vest, during the raids. French officials said that two radical Islamists were deported and three more are to be expelled. French Interior Minister Claude Gueant said that the two deported were a Malian imam who had preached anti-Semitism and promoted wearing the burka, and Ali Belhadad, an Algerian with involvement in a 1994 Marrakech attack. Two imams from Saudi Arabia and Turkey and a suspected Tunisian militant are also due for expulsion from France. A police source stated that some of the arrested were planning to kidnap a Jewish magistrate.On 4 April, French police arrested 10 people on suspicion that they were \"Islamist militants\". On 5 April, four of them were released after prosecutors found insufficient evidence to detain them. On 6 April, there were reports that the French police would release the last six individuals as well.The Interior minister commented \"We do not accept Islamic extremism. This is not a new policy... but after what happened in Toulouse and Montauban we have to be more vigilant than ever.\" President Sarkozy said the aim was to deny the entry of certain people to France who did not share the country's values and that, \"It's not just linked to Toulouse. It's all over the country. It's in connection with a form of radical Islam.\" He added that \"more suspected Muslim extremists will be rounded up,\" and that after the traumatic events in Montauban and Toulouse, it was necessary to \"draw some conclusions.\"The government banned six Islamist leaders from entering France for a Muslim conference expected to be held in Paris.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAntisemitism in 21st-century France\nCharlie Hebdo shooting\nChristchurch mosque shootings, also filmed with a GoPro\nList of Islamist terrorist attacks\nList of terrorist incidents in France\nTerrorism in the European Union\nMon Fr\u00e8re, ce terroriste (My brother the terrorist)\nFabien Clain mentor, friend and terrorist recruiter\nCannes-Torcy cell\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nShootings in Toulouse and Montauban: What we know at BBC News Online\nToulouse shootings: a timeline of events at The Guardian\nToulouse shootings collected news and commentary at The Guardian \nToulouse shootings collected news and commentary at France 24\n\"Mohammed Merah and Abdelkader Merah (Shootings in Toulouse, France) collected news and commentary\".

        "wiki": "The Augustinian Convent of Toulouse was founded in 1286 for members of the Augustinian religious order.  It was first established outside the city walls, near the Matabiau quarter, then, between 1310 and 1341 moved to the corner of rue du Mus\u00e9e and rue des Arts.  In 1790 it ceased to be a convent and today its buildings house the Mus\u00e9e des Augustins.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The construction of the convent ===\nIn 1269 a community of Hermits of St. Augustine was founded outside the city of Toulouse, near to the Montolieu quarter. The construction was due to the Chapter of Canons Regular of St. Sernin who undertook to build a convent in exchange for land and rights that newcomers granted them from the donations they had received (Departmental Archives of Haute Garonne, 101 H 638). As frequently happens in the history of religious foundations, this initial location proved inadequate to the needs of the community.\nIn 1309/1310, the hermits of St. Augustine obtained the Pope's Clement V approval to sell this first building, and purchase the land to build the existing buildings that lie within the walls of the city, in the parish of Saint-Etienne. The canons of Saint-Sernin objected to the transfer, but, in 1326 sold three houses to the hermits for the price of 3500 guilders in exchange of a part of the wax sheets received by the Augustinians for a burial.\nJean Lobres, prime contractor of Toulouse's cathedral participated in the construction of the apse of the church. The layout of the church is typical of the southern Gothic style. The apse has three chapels that open directly onto the large, single nave, there is no transept, and in the upper parts, sections have been cut out.  By 1341 the foundations of the monastery were well established.\nThe completed church was painted in the style typical of northern Spain during the first half of the fourteenth century and decorated with miniatures produced in the royal court at the time of Philip IVth of France (Philip the Fair). The campanile is built on a square and close to the chorus. Access is via the opening which is now located in the vestry. The construction of the eastern part of monastery began in 1341. Construction of the other three parts of the building were only begun in 1396 by the mason Jean Maurin. Ninety years later, in 1396, the cloister was completed.\n\n\n=== The fire of 1463 ===\nStarting on 7 May 1463 and lasting for nearly two weeks, a fire (started by a careless baker) destroyed much of the city of Toulouse. As was the case at the Carmelite convent, most of the roof collapsed. With the help of the faithful and the church, reconstruction of the roof began in 1495 through the work of masons Martin Pujol and Pierre d'Arroye. The work was quickly completed and the building was rededicated on 30 June 1504.\n\n\n=== The decline of the convent ===\nUp until the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the convent was home to two hundred monks. But then numbers started to decline; by 1518 there were no more than 140, and the fall continued. In 1649 there were only  60 and in 1680 there were only 31. By the time of the French Revolution only a few remained. In addition, in 1542, the convent was the victim of looting; many books and records were stolen from the Library, along with liturgical objects and valuable furniture. On 14 September 1550 (the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross), lightning struck the bell tower. The upper floors were destroyed, causing extensive damage in the surrounding area. This event marked the beginning of the decline of the monastery. The financial and material difficulties could not be overcome and the bell tower was never reconstructed, instead it was lowered by one floor.\nIn May 1562, in the aftermath of the revolt of the Huguenots, three Augustinians were flogged in public, apostatized, and married to three Augustinian nuns for having left their convent.  During this time, all the Augustinian nuns (bar one) of Toulouse became part of the Protestant Reformation, and the house was donated to the Jesuits (the Chapel of the Black Penitents).\nIn a decree of 2 November 1789 the convent became a national asset, and was decommissioned during the suppression of the monastic orders in 1790. Since 27 August 1795 it has housed the Toulouse Museum of Art.\n\n\n== See also ==\nToulouse Art Museum",

        "wiki": "The Jardin des Plantes (7 hectares) is a public park and botanical garden located on All\u00e9e Jules-Guesde, Toulouse, France.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first botanical garden in Toulouse was created in 1730 by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des sciences de Toulouse (Society of Sciences of Toulouse) and located in the Saint-Sernin district, not far from the Matabiau. However, the quality of the ground was unsatisfactory, and in 1756 the collection was moved towards S\u00e9n\u00e9chauss\u00e9e Street (now the Street of the Flowers). This second garden was surrounded by walls and in time proved to be too small. In 1794, thanks to naturalist Philippe-Isidore Picot de Lapeyrouse, the garden was relocated into part of the old enclosure of the Carmelite friars, where it remains.\n\nThis third site became both a large botanical garden and also a place where the poorest of the city could collect medicinal plants, growing to contain some 1,300 species, both local and acclimatised. By decree of July 27, 1808, Napoleon gave the grounds and the buildings of the garden to the city, and during the battle of Toulouse (April 10, 1814), the garden was used as artillery point. In 1885 the garden was slightly trimmed due to the construction of the Faculty of Medicine near the All\u00e9e Jules-Guesde, but at the same time it increased in size towards the Grand  All\u00e9e. The garden was transformed for the arrival of the international exhibition of 1887, becoming a park.\n\n\n== Present day ==\nToday's botanical garden, the Jardin botanique Henri Gaussen, lies in the south-east of the downtown area, in the district of Busca close to the district of the Bridge of the Young Ladies, near the Canal du Midi. Although it was originally outside the city walls, it is now within a zone of very dense habitat mixing old construction and the more recent buildings.\nIt is bordered by the Medical school, the Natural history museum, the Daniel-Sorano theatre and the Saint-Exup\u00e8re church. It is very close to Boulingrin but a broad avenue separates them. A metal footbridge makes it possible for pedestrians to travel between the two public parks.\nThe Garden has several old buildings or vestiges. The Natural History Museum dates to the end of the 16th century. The entrance door in the garden is a reconstitution of one of the doors of old Capitole, and dates back to 1886. The Northern door at Ozenne street was drawn by Virebent.\n\nSculptures\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in France\nJardin Royal (Toulouse)\n\n\n== References ==\n This article includes a translation of the French Wikipedia article.

        "wiki": "Toulouse (, too-LOOZ; French: [tuluz] (listen); Occitan: Tolosa [tu\u02c8luzo]; Latin: Tolosa [to\u02c8lo\u02d0sa]) is the capital of the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km (143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean and 680 km (420 mi) from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France, with 479,553 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (as of January 2017), and 1,360,829 inhabitants within its wider metropolitan area (also as of January 2017), after Paris, Lyon and Marseille, and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.\nToulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus (formerly EADS), the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It also hosts the European headquarters of Intel and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe. Thales Alenia Space, ATR, SAFRAN, Liebherr-Aerospace and Airbus Defence and Space also have a significant presence in Toulouse.\nThe University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 103,000 students, it is the fourth-largest university campus in France, after the universities of Paris, Lyon and Lille.The air route between Toulouse\u2013Blagnac and Paris Orly is the busiest in Europe, transporting 2.4 million passengers in 2014. According to the rankings of L'Express and Challenges, Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the Occitanie region, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.\nToulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname La Ville Rose (The Pink City).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nToulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nToulouse has a temperate humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified as a Mediterranean climate zone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age.\nThe historical name of the city, Tolosa (\u03a4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian, or from Iberian, but has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages.Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost.\nAfter the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city of Gallia Narbonensis. In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 (Battle of Vouill\u00e9).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n\n=== County of Toulouse ===\n\nThe town became the capital of the County of Toulouse during the Carolingian era.\nIn 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders.\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the military crusade, such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the Southern French Gothic.\nIn 1215 the Dominican Order was founded in Toulouse by Saint Dominic in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\nIn the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs, were started. They found home in Les Jacobins. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital.\n\n\n=== Within the Kingdom of France ===\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the kingdom of France and declared a \"royal city\". In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years. The Consistori del Gay Saber is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\nThe 14th century brought a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population by Crusaders in 1320, the Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years' War. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.The situation improved in the 15th century. Charles VII established the second parliament of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of pastel, a blue dye made from woad. The fortune generated by this international trade was at the origin of several of Toulouse's superb Renaissance mansions.\n\n\n=== Within the French Republic ===\nThe Battle of Toulouse (1814) was one of the final battles of the Napoleonic Wars, four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition.\nToulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by Marshal Soult.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of the city proper (French: commune) was 479,553 at the January 2017 census, with 1,360,829 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,187,686 at the January 2007 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area). Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.4% per year between 2007 and 2017, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2007 censuses.\nToulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\nFueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for metropolitan France), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.\nA local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Toulouse M\u00e9tropole ===\n\nThe Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Toulouse) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent communes, covering an area of 380 km2 (147 sq mi), totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communaut\u00e9 urbaine). This has become a m\u00e9tropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes.\n\n\n=== Local politics ===\n\nOne of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (Halle aux Grains) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (Z\u00e9nith, the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace was founded, etc.\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen.\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nToulouse has many interesting churches, but three of them are of remarkable architectural and historical interest.\nSaint-Sernin Basilica, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest remaining Romanesque church in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by Charlemagne to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\nCathedral of Saint Stephen is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\nThe convent of the Jacobins (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the Albi Cathedral, the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the Dominican order, for not having obtained the relics of Saint Dominic kept in Bologna, Pope Urban V made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar Saint Thomas Aquinas, one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Civilian buildings ===\n\nThe Capitole de Toulouse (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole (opera house). It is located on the Place du Capitole, a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (place royale). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th-century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (le donjon), which housed the archives of the Capitouls; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called h\u00f4tels particuliers) or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat, the H\u00f4tel de Bernuy, the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, the H\u00f4tel de Bagis...\n\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n\nThe banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the Pont-Neuf, it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the H\u00f4pital de La Grave. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe Jardin des Plantes is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a botanical garden (early 19th century).\nThe Cit\u00e9 de l'espace (Space City) is a theme park of space exploration.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nSights and monuments of Toulouse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe main industries are aeronautics, space, electronics, information technology and biotechnology. Toulouse hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320, A330, A350 and A380.  (A320 lines also exist in Hamburg, Germany, Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, USA.) Airbus has its head office in Blagnac, near Toulouse. Airbus's France division has its main office in Toulouse. Toulouse also hosts the headquarters of ATR, Sigfox, one of the two headquarters of Liebherr Aerospace and Groupe Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re.\nThe Concorde supersonic aircraft was also constructed in Toulouse.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nToulouse has the fourth-largest student population in France after Paris, Lyon and Lille with 103,000 students (2012).\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nThe University of Toulouse (Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse), established in 1229, is located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology\u2014inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts\u2014as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.\nCatholic University of Toulouse\nUniversit\u00e9 Toulouse I, Toulouse School of Economics, Toulouse School of Management and Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse\nUniversity of Toulouse-Jean Jaur\u00e8s (Formerly University of Toulouse II \u2013 Le Mirail)\nUniversit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III)Toulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:\n\nICAM Toulouse (Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers)\nINSA Toulouse\nISAE SUPAERO (Institut sup\u00e9rieur de l'a\u00e9ronautique et de l'espace)\nENAC (\u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile)\nINP ENSEEIHT (\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectronique, d'\u00c9lectrotechnique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique et des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications)\nENSFEA (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de formation de l\u2019enseignement agricole)\nINP ENSIACET (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs en art chimique et technologique)\nINP ENSAT ('\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure Agronomique de Toulouse)\nINP ENM (\u00c9cole Nationale de la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie)\nEPITA (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les techniques avanc\u00e9es)\nEPITECH (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies or European Institute of Information Technology)\nIPSA (Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avanc\u00e9es)\nEIPurpan (\u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Purpan)\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThe most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Sernin.\nInternational schools serving area expatriates are in nearby Colomiers:\n\nInternational School of Toulouse\nDeutsche Schule Toulouse (German school)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThe main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nIn addition to an extensive bus system, the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tired trains. Line A runs for 12.5 km (7.8 mi) from Balma-Gramont in the north-east to Basso Cambo in the south-west. Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaur\u00e8s.\nLine C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Ar\u00e8nes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named \"Gare des Capelles\", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened. Le TOEC station opened on 1 September 2003 with the creation of line C, allowing an urban train service in Toulouse and close western suburbs.Similarly, Line D runs south from Toulouse Matabiau to Muret.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\nThe tramway line T1 (operating since December 2010), runs from Beauzelle to Toulouse passing through Blagnac. All urban bus, metro and tram services are operated by Tiss\u00e9o. Tramway line T2 is a branch of the first line serving notably Toulouse Blagnac airport.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nIn 2007, a citywide bicycle rental scheme called V\u00e9l\u00f4Toulouse was introduced, with bicycles available from automated stations for a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly subscription.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nAirports include:\n\nToulouse Blagnac, the principal local airport\nToulouse Lasbordes\n\n\n=== Canal ===\nThe Canal du Midi begins in Toulouse and runs up to S\u00e8te.\n\n\n=== Toulouse public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Toulouse, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 44 min. 9.1% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 9 min, while 10.4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km, while 8% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Communications ==\nToulouse is the home of Bonhoure Radio Tower, a 61-metre high lattice tower used for FM and TV transmission. In 2001 a large (100 km) optical fiber (symmetric 360Gbit/s) network named\nInfrastructure M\u00e9tropolitaine de T\u00e9l\u00e9communications was deployed around the city and suburbs.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole is the home of opera and ballet; there has been a theatre on the site since 1736. The Orchestre National du Capitole, long associated with Michel Plasson, plays at the Halle aux Grains.Le Ch\u00e2teau d'Eau, an old 19th-century water-tower, was converted as a gallery in 1974 by Jean Dieuzaide, a French photographer from Toulouse and is now one of the oldest public places dedicated to photography in the world. Toulouse's art museums include the Mus\u00e9e des Augustins, the Mus\u00e9e des Abattoirs, the Mus\u00e9e Georges Labit, and the Fondation Bemberg in the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat. The Mus\u00e9e Saint-Raymond is devoted to Antiquity and the Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse to natural history.\nToulouse is the seat of the Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux, the equivalent of the French Academy for the Occitan-speaking regions of southern France, making Toulouse the unofficial capital of Occitan culture. The traditional Cross of Toulouse (from Provence, under the name of cross of Provence), emblem of the County of Toulouse and commonly widespread around all of Occitania during the Middle Ages is the symbol of the city and of the newly founded Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es r\u00e9gion, as well as a popular Occitan symbol.\nThe city's gastronomic specialties include the Saucisse de Toulouse, a type of sausage, cassoulet Toulousain, a bean and pork stew, and garbure, a cabbage soup with poultry. Also, foie gras, the liver of an overfed duck or goose, is a delicacy commonly made in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nStade Toulousain of the Top 14 is one of the most successful rugby union clubs in all of Europe, having been crowned European champions four times and French champions twenty times.Toulouse Olympique represents the city in rugby league, playing in the English/European 2nd tier Championship from 2017.\nThe city also has a professional football team, Toulouse FC, who play in Ligue 2, the second division of football in France, and who won the 1957 Coupe de France Final. The club play at the Stadium Municipal, which was a venue during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as hosting important club rugby games and several Rugby League World Cups. Toulouse was also a host of EuroBasket 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nSeveral notable Toulousains have been scientists, such as Jean Dausset, 1980 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; 17th-century mathematician Pierre de Fermat, who spent his life in Toulouse, where he wrote Fermat's Last Theorem and was a lawyer in the city's Parlement; Paul Sabatier, 1912 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry; Albert Fert, 2007 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics who grew up in Toulouse where he attended the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Jean Tirole, owner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, chairman and founder of the Toulouse School of Economics along with Jean-Jacques Laffont.\nMusically, Toulouse is one of the two controversial, disputed birthplaces of Carlos Gardel (the other being Tacuarembo, Uruguay), probably the most prominent figure in the history of the tango. The city's most renowned songwriter is Claude Nougaro. The composer and organist Georges Guiraud (1868\u20131928) was born in Toulouse.\nConcerning arts, Toulouse is the birthplace of Impressionist painter Henri Martin as well as sculptors Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re and Antonin Merci\u00e9. Moreover, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Antoine Bourdelle were trained at the Toulouse fine arts school. Post Impressionist painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's (1864-1901) father was Count Alphonse Charles de Toulouse-Lautrec Monfa (1838-1913) and was part of an aristocratic family of Counts of Toulouse, Odet de Foix, Vimcomte de Lautrec and the Viscounts of Montfa. French graffiti artist Cyril Kongo was born in Toulouse in 1969.\nRaymond IV, Count of Toulouse, one of the leaders of the First Crusade, was born in Toulouse. Aviation pioneer Cl\u00e9ment Ader and psychiatrist Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol were also natives.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nToulouse is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Other cooperations ===\nToulouse also has accords of cooperation with the following towns:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n138 Tolosa, an asteroid\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse\nAndr\u00e9 Abbal\nListing of the works of Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re\nThe works of Antonin Merci\u00e9\nList of the mayors of Toulouse\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nLe Stang, Anne (2006).

          "We went to the Quai to take a cruise on the Garonne. The Quai itself is a lovely place to be, with great views across the river and over to the Pont Neuf. There is a grassy area where you can sit and relax, a caf\u00e9 and a very sensible enclosure for dogs. What a pity, then, that",

        "wiki": "The Capitole (French for 'capitol') is the heart of the municipal administration of the French city of Toulouse and its city hall.\n\n\n== History and description ==\nIt is not the same Capitol as the one where St Saturninus was martyred, the latter referring to the Capitoline temple of the Roman city, while the first buildings of the current Capitole were erected on this site in the 12th century.\nThe Capitouls (governing magistrates) of Toulouse embarked on the construction of the original building in 1190 to provide a seat for the government of a province growing in wealth and influence. The name \"Capitole\" referred not only to the Roman Capitol but also to the capitulum, which was the chapter of the governing magistrates. It was a centre of contention during the 1562 Toulouse Riots, with Huguenot forces holding it with captured cannon.\nIn the first half of the 19th century, the structures surrounding the vast (2 ha)  Place du Capitole were redesigned, but the current fa\u00e7ade, 135 m long and built of the characteristic pink brick in Neoclassical style, dates from 1750, built according to plans by Guillaume Cammas. The eight columns represent the original eight capitouls. In 1873, Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc built a bell tower typical of the style of northern France on top of the donjon of the building. It was in this donjon that Jean Calas, a Protestant victim of a religiously-biased trial, was interrogated. Only the Henri IV courtyard and gate survive from the original medieval buildings. It was in this courtyard that the Duke de Montmorency was decapitated after his rebellion against Cardinal Richelieu. A thorough redesign of the Place du Capitole in 1995 reserved the space for pedestrians. Some of the interior of the Capitole can be traced back to the 16th century. Today the Capitole houses the city hall, as well as the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole de Toulouse opera company and the Orchestre national du Capitole de Toulouse. The Salle des Illustres contains 19th century works of art.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the mayors of Toulouse\nParliament of Toulouse\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nTurning, Patricia (2013), Municipal Officials, Their Public, and the Negotiation of Justice in Medieval Languedoc: Fear Not the Madness of the Raging Mob, Later Medieval Europe, No. 10, Leiden: Brill, ISBN 978-90-04-23464-2.",

          "I wish the Place du Capitole was more interesting but it did have a great night life. The bars and restaurants surrounding the square are as expected, touristy and a bit expensive (but good for a morning coffee).",
          "It is a museum right next to the mayor's office. A great collection of paintings of the aristocratic society of the 13th and 14th centuries France. The various facades of the building reflect the religious and political influences of Rome, Paris and Spain.",
          "We went to Place de Capitole to the tourist office it is a very impressive building. It was a Saturday morning and there were lots of wedding parties waiting outside on a beautiful morning in Toulouse .",
          "We went there today with a tour. It's nothing like the beautiful pictures you googled. The plaza in front of the town hall was blocked due to constructions. Homeless people sits outside shops in the surrounding places. You could see cigarette butts and trash every where on",

          "Lovely place! Great ambience, both by day and by night. Wonderful accessible restaurants: try Le Paradis du Fruits for dinner on a warm evening or have waffles at Le Florida. Little train tour of the city departing here: two available tours, 7\u20ac per person each.",

          "Looked nice. In the main square. There are a few restaurants which have the same type of menus and are really over priced.",
          "There are some beautiful buildings, many shops, restaurants and hotels. If you want to visit Toulouse taking a walk for 2 to 3 hours around this neighborhood is recommended. You can walk, watch the old and beautiful buildings, having food and do some shopping. Also the area",

          "Probably the beating heart of Toulouse with a market most days we were there. A busy road passes by and it is rather too diesel fumed for me! It does not compare with St Mark's Square in Venice or some squares in Rome or the main square in Bordeaux or even the square in Lille!",
          "The Place du Capitole is s huge square dominated by the stunning Capitole building which is now the town hall. It's definitely worth taking a photo or two. There's plenty of restaurants here where you can sit in the sun or shade and look at Toulouse's most popular attraction.",
          "A huge open space and an old and very interesting old building. A fabulous place inside for a wedding ceremony.",
          "We loved walkiing in Place du Capitole. There is always something going on there. The government building is very impressive and all the restaurants and businesses around the Place make it very lively. We were there on election night so we could have done without all the police",
          "The centre piece of Toulouse with an amazing atmosphere at any time of the day. There is always something going on here from markets to entertainment. One thing to be aware of are The restaurants around the square. They can be very expensive compared to ones a few blocks",

          "We visited here a number of times over the duration of our 4 day stay in Toulouse. It's a nice place to sit and have a coffee or some lunch and watch the world go by. Worth a visit",
          "Perfect place to hang out in the heart of the city. The square is surrounded by the Capitolium, Crown plaza hotel and the Grand opera hotel, each of which seem to stretch for eternity. There are quaint cafes and restaurants surrounding the area. There was also a flea market in",

          "I visited this city last week and was surprised by how vibrant the city's main square is ! Perhaps more so due to St Patty's day, there was a live music festival going on with a local food and crafts market. It was just so much fun..",

          "Has barely changed since my visit in 2007. It is good that the subway construction is finished. Not that many people when I visited so it was a good opportunity to really feel the place. The terrorist problem is felt once you see the roaming soldiers in full battle gear, but I",

        "wiki": "Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (French: A\u00e9roport de Paris-Charles-de-Gaulle, IATA: CDG, ICAO: LFPG), also known as Roissy Airport, is the largest international airport in France and second busiest airport in Europe. Opened in 1974, it is located in Roissy-en-France, 23 km (14 mi) northeast of Paris. It is named after statesman Charles de Gaulle (1890\u20131970).\nCharles de Gaulle Airport is located within portions of several communes in Val-d'Oise, Seine-Saint-Denis and Seine-et-Marne. It serves as the principal hub for Air France and a destination for other legacy carriers (from Star Alliance, Oneworld and SkyTeam), as well as a focus city for low-cost carriers easyJet, Vueling and Norwegian Air Shuttle. The Airport is operated by Groupe ADP under the brand Paris A\u00e9roport.\nIn 2019, the airport handled 76,150,007 passengers and 498,175 aircraft movements, thus making it the world's tenth busiest airport and Europe's second busiest airport (after Heathrow) in terms of passenger numbers. Charles de Gaulle is also the busiest airport within the European Union. In terms of cargo traffic, the airport is the twelfth busiest in the world and the second busiest in Europe (after Frankfurt), handling 2,150,950 metric tonnes of cargo in 2012.As of 2017, the airport offers direct flights to the most countries and hosts the most airlines in the world. Marc Houalla has been the director of the airport since 12 February 2018.\n\n\n== Location ==\nParis Charles de Gaulle Airport covers 32.38 square kilometres (12.50 sq mi) of land. The airport area, including terminals and runways, spans over three d\u00e9partements and six communes:\n\nSeine-et-Marne d\u00e9partement: Le Mesnil-Amelot (Terminal 2E, Satellites S3 and S4, and Terminal 2F), Mauregard (Terminals 1, 3), and Mitry-Mory (Terminal 2G) communes;\nSeine-Saint-Denis d\u00e9partement: Tremblay-en-France (Terminals 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and Roissyp\u00f4le) commune;\nVal-d'Oise d\u00e9partement: Roissy-en-France and \u00c9piais-l\u00e8s-Louvres communes.The choice of constructing an international aviation hub outside of central Paris was made due to a limited prospect of potential relocations or expropriations and the possibility of further expanding the airport in the future.\nManagement of the airport lies solely on the authority of Groupe ADP, which also manages Orly (south of Paris), Le Bourget (to the immediate southwest of Charles de Gaulle Airport, now used for general aviation and Paris Air Shows), several smaller airfields in the suburbs of Paris, and other airports directly or indirectly worldwide.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe planning and construction phase of what was known then as A\u00e9roport de Paris Nord (Paris North Airport) began in 1966. On 8 March 1974 the airport, renamed Charles de Gaulle Airport, opened. Terminal 1 was built in an avant-garde design of a ten-floors-high circular building surrounded by seven satellite buildings, each with six gates allowing sunlight to enter through apertures. The main architect was Paul Andreu, who was also in charge of the extensions during the following decades.\nFollowing the introduction of the brand Paris A\u00e9roport to all its Parisian airports, Groupe ADP also announced major changes for the Charles de Gaulle Airport: Terminals of the Satellite 1 will be merged, as well as terminals 2B and 2D. A new luggage automated sorting system and conveyor under Terminal 2E Hall L was installed to speed luggage delivery time for airlines operating Paris-Charles de Gaulle's hub. The CDG Express, the direct express rail link from Paris to Charles de Gaulle Airport, is planned for completion by 2023.\n\n\n=== Corporate identity ===\nThe Frutiger typeface was commissioned for use in the airport and implemented on signs throughout the building in 1975. Initially called Roissy, it was renamed after its designer Adrian Frutiger.\nUntil 2005, every PA announcement made at Terminal 1 was preceded by a distinctive chime, nicknamed \"Indicatif Roissy\" and composed by Bernard Parmegiani in 1971. The chime can be heard in the Roman Polanski film Frantic. The chime was officially replaced by the \"Indicatif ADP\" chime.\nOn 14 April 2016, the Groupe ADP rolled out the Connect 2020 corporate strategy and the commercial brand Paris A\u00e9roport was applied to all Parisian airports, including Le Bourget airport.\n\n\n== Terminals ==\n\nCharles de Gaulle Airport has three terminals: Terminal 1 is the oldest and situated opposite to Terminal 3; Terminal 2 is located at another side with 7 sub-terminal buildings (2A to 2G). Terminal 2 was originally built exclusively for Air France; since then it has been expanded significantly and now also hosts other airlines. Terminals 2A to 2F are interconnected by elevated walkways and situated next to each other. Terminal 2G is a satellite building connected by shuttle bus.Terminal 3 (formerly known as \"Terminal 9\") hosts charter and low-cost airlines. The CDGVAL light-rail shuttle connects Terminal 2 to Terminals 1/3 and their parking lots. Refer to Ground Transportation below for inter-terminal transfers and transport to central Paris.\n\n\n=== Terminal 1 ===\nThe first terminal, designed by Paul Andreu, was built in the image of an octopus. It consists of a circular terminal building which houses key functions such as check-in counters and baggage claim conveyors. Seven satellites with boarding gates are connected to the central building by underground walkways.\nThe central building, with a large skylight in its centre, dedicates each floor to a single function. The first floor is reserved for technical operations and not accessible to the public. The second floor contains shops and restaurants, the CDGVAL inter-terminal shuttle train platforms (for Terminal 2 and trains to central Paris) and check-in counters from a recent renovation. The majority of check-in counters, however, are located on the third floor, which also has access to taxi stands, bus stops and special pick-up vehicles. Departing passengers with valid boarding passes can reach the fourth floor, which houses duty-free stores and border control posts, for the boarding gates. The fifth floor contains baggage claim conveyors for arriving passengers. All four upper floors have assigned areas for parking and airline offices.\nPassages between the third, fourth and fifth floors are provided by a tangle of escalators arranged through the centre of the building. These escalators are suspended over the central court. Each escalator is covered with a transparent tube to shelter from all weather conditions. These escalators were often used in film shootings (e.g. The Last Gang of Ariel Zeitoun). The Alan Parsons Project album I Robot features these escalators on its cover.\nTerminal 1 is used by mainly Star Alliance members except those who operate from Terminal 2.\n\n\n=== Terminal 2 ===\nTerminal 2 is spread across seven sub-terminals: 2A to 2G. Terminals 2A to 2F are connected by inter-terminal walkways, but Terminal 2G is a satellite building 800 m (0.5 mi) away. Terminal 2G can only be accessed by shuttle bus from Terminals 1, 2A to 2F and 3. The CDGVAL inter-terminal shuttle train, Paris RER Regional-Express and high-speed TGV rail station, A\u00e9roport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV, is located within the Terminal 2 complex and between 2C and 2E (on one side) or 2D and 2F (on the opposite side).\nTerminal 2F was used for the filming of the music video for the U2 song \"Beautiful Day\". The band also had their picture taken inside Terminal 2F for the album artwork of their 2000 album All That You Can't Leave Behind.\nTerminal 2 is used by Air France, all SkyTeam and  Oneworld airlines, some Star Alliance members (most operate from Terminal 1) and other airlines.\n\n\n==== Collapse of Terminal 2E ====\n\nOn 23 May 2004, shortly after the inauguration of terminal 2E, a portion of it collapsed near Gate E50, killing four people. Two of the dead were reported to be Chinese citizens, one Czech and the other Lebanese. Three other people were injured in the collapse. Terminal 2E had been inaugurated in 2003 after some delays in construction and was designed by Paul Andreu. Administrative and judicial enquiries were started. Andreu also designed Terminal 3 at Dubai International Airport, which collapsed while under construction on 28 September 2004.\nBefore this accident, ADP had been planning for an initial public offering in 2005 with the new terminal as a major attraction for investors. The partial collapse and indefinite closing of the terminal just before the beginning of summer seriously hurt the airport's business plan.\nIn February 2005, the results from the administrative inquiry were published. The experts pointed out that there was no single fault, but rather a number of causes for the collapse, in a design that had little margin for safety. The inquiry found the concrete vaulted roof was not resilient enough and had been pierced by metallic pillars and some openings weakened the structure. Sources close to the inquiry also disclosed that the whole building chain had worked as close to the limits as possible, so as to reduce costs. Paul Andreu denounced the building companies for having not correctly prepared the reinforced concrete.\nOn 17 March 2005, ADP decided to tear down and rebuild the whole part of Terminal 2E (the \"jetty\") of which a section had collapsed, at a cost of approximately \u20ac100 million. The reconstruction replaced the innovative concrete tube style of the jetty with a more traditional steel and glass structure. During reconstruction, two temporary departure lounges were constructed in the vicinity of the terminal that replicated the capacity of 2E before the collapse. The terminal reopened completely on 30 March 2008.\n\n\n==== Terminal 2G ====\n\nTerminal 2G, dedicated to regional Air France and HOP! flights and its affiliates, opened in 2008. This terminal is to the east of all terminals and can only be reached by shuttle bus. Terminal 2G is used for passengers flying in the Schengen Area (and thus has no passport control) and handles Air France regional and European traffic and provides small-capacity planes (up to 150 passengers) with a faster turnaround time than is currently possible by enabling them to park close to the new terminal building and boarding passengers primarily by bus, or walking. A bus line called \"navette orange\" connects the terminal 2G inside the security check area with terminals 2E and 2F. Passengers transferring to other terminals need to continue their trip with other bus shuttles within the security check area if they do not need to get their bags.\n\n\n==== Terminal 2E Hall L (Satellite 3) ====\nThe completion of 750 m (2,460 ft) long Satellite 3 (or S3) to the immediate east of Terminals 2E and 2F provides further jetways for large-capacity airliners, specifically the Airbus A380. Check-in and baggage handling are provided by the existing infrastructure in Terminals 2E and 2F. Satellite 3 was opened in part on 27 June 2007 and fully operational in September 2007. It corresponds now to gates L of terminal 2E.\n\n\n==== Terminal 2E Hall M (Satellite 4) ====\nThe satellite S4, adjacent to the S3 and part of terminal 2E, officially opened on 28 June 2012. It corresponds now to gates M of terminal 2E. Dedicated to long-haul flights, it has the ability to handle 16 aircraft at the same time, with an expected capacity of 7.8 million passengers per year. Its opening has led to the relocation of all SkyTeam airlines to terminals 2E (for international carriers), 2F (for Schengen European carriers) and 2G.\n\n\n==== Future ====\nAir France has moved all of its operations previously located at 2C to 2E. In October 2012, 2F closed its international operations and became completely Schengen, allowing for all Air France flights currently operating in 2D to relocate to terminal 2F. Further, in April 2013, Terminal 2B closed for a complete renovation (all airlines relocated to 2D) and will receive upgrades including the addition of a second floor completely dedicated to arrivals. Once 2B is completed, 2D will close and receive similar upgrades, including the addition of a new floor. Low-cost carrier easyJet has shown its interest in being the sole carrier at 2B. To facilitate connections, a new boarding area between 2A and 2C was opened in March 2012. It allows for all security and passport control to be handled in a single area, allows for many new shopping opportunities as well as new airline lounges, and eases transfer restrictions between 2A and 2C.\nAccording to La Tribune newspaper a new Terminal 4 is likely to be built around 2025, when Charles de Gaulle Airport's maximum capacity of 80 million will be reached. This new Terminal 4, when constructed, will be able to accommodate 30\u201340 million passengers per year and will most likely be built north of Terminal 2E.\n\n\n=== Terminal 3 ===\nTerminal 3 is located 1 km (0.62 mi) away from Terminal 1. It consists of one single building for arrivals and departures. The walking distance between Terminals 1 and 3 is 3 km (1.9 mi) long, however, the rail station (named as \"CDG Airport Terminal 1\") for RER and CDGVAL trains are only at a distance of 300 m (980 ft). Terminal 3 has no boarding gates constructed and all passengers are ferried via boarding buses to the aircraft stands.\n\n\n== Roissyp\u00f4le ==\nRoissyp\u00f4le is a complex consisting of office buildings, shopping areas, hotels, and a bus coach and RER B station within Charles de Gaulle Airport. The complex includes the head office of Air France, Continental Square, the Hilton Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, and le D\u00f4me building. Le D\u00f4me includes the head office of Air France Consulting, an Air France subsidiary. Continental Square has the head office of Air France subsidiary Servair and the Air France Vaccinations Centre.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Ground transportation ==\n\n\n=== CDGVAL ===\nThe airport's terminals are served by a free automated shuttle rail system, consisting of two lines (CDGVAL and LISA). The shuttle train connects both railway stations for Terminals 1/3 and Terminal 2 in 8 minutes. It is based on the VAL design used in several French cities.\n\n\n=== RER ===\nCharles de Gaulle airport is connected to central Paris by the RER B Regional-Express services. During off-peak hours and weekends, there are two types of services:\n\n4 trains per hour to Saint-R\u00e9my-l\u00e8s-Chevreuse calling at all intermediate stations to Cit\u00e9 Universitaire, then Bourg-la-Reine, La Croix de Berny, Antony, Massy\u2013Palaiseau and then all stations to Saint-R\u00e9my-l\u00e8s-Chevreuse.\n4 trains per hour to Massy\u2013Palaiseau (on the Saint-R\u00e9my line), non-stop express until Gare du Nord and then all stations to Massy\u2013Palaiseau.The express RER B only calls at the railway stations of Terminal 1 (also for Terminal 3) and Terminal 2 before Gare du Nord. Journey time is 30\u201335 minutes. The stopping RER B takes about 35\u201340 minutes and is sometimes overtaken by the express RER B trains.\n\nA\u00e9roport Charles de Gaulle 1 station, located inside Roissyp\u00f4le (an area with hotels and company offices) next to Terminal 3 and is the preferred way to access Terminals 1 and 3;\nA\u00e9roport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV station, located in the middle of Terminals 2C and 2E or Terminals 2D and 2F.RER B is jointly operated by SNCF and RATP (Transport for Paris), but the Regional-Express used to suffer from slowness and overcrowding. For these reasons, French authorities have started two projects: CDG Express, which is supposed to link Charles de Gaulle Airport to Paris Gare de l'Est railway station (next to Gare du Nord) from 2023 with trains specifically designed for air travellers; RER B Nord Plus, which modernised and streamlined RER B rail traffic and network north of Gare du Nord from 2008 to 2013 then renovated the trains from 2010 to 2015.\n\n\n=== TGV ===\nTerminal 2 includes a TGV station on the LGV Interconnexion Est high-speed line. SNCF operates direct TGV services to several French stations from CDG, including Lille, Strasbourg, Dijon, Lyon, Avignon TGV, Marseille, Montpellier, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Nantes, Poitiers, Rennes, Toulon, as well as services to Brussels in Belgium.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nRoissybus, operated by the RATP (Transport for Paris), departs from Terminals 1 and 2 and runs non-stop to Palais Garnier.\n\"Le Bus Direct\" operates to several destinations: line 2 to Place de l'\u00c9toile, Porte Maillot Trocad\u00e9ro and Eiffel Tower, line 3 to Paris Orly (airport south of Paris), line 4 to Gare Montparnasse and Gare de Lyon railway stations.\nRATP buses 350 and 351 depart from the coach station in Roissyp\u00f4le (next to Terminal 1's RER railway station).\nBus \"Magical Shuttle\" departs from all three terminals for Disneyland Paris.After the last RER B service at 23:50, the Noctilien (Night Lines) N143 and N140 depart every 30 minutes and hour respectively from Terminal 1 Door D12, Terminal 2F Door 2 and Roissyp\u00f4le coach station. Both bus lines run to Paris Gare de l'Est railway station.\n\n\n=== Long-distance bus ===\nSince 17 December 2012, SNCF's national and international coach network, OUIBUS, serves Charles de Gaulle Airport, by terminal 3, station CDG 1 to London, Lyon, Lille and Brussels.  Flixbus serves CDG from at least Brussels and Amsterdam.\n\n\n=== Car ===\nCharles de Gaulle Airport is directly connected to Autoroute A1 which connects Paris and Lille.\n\n\n== Alternative airports ==\nThe two other airports serving Paris are Orly Airport (south of Paris, the other major airport in Paris) and Le Bourget Airport (for general aviation and private jets).\nSeveral low-cost airlines also advertise Beauvais\u2013Till\u00e9 Airport and Ch\u00e2lons Vatry Airport, respectively 85 kilometres (53 mi) and 165 kilometres (103 mi) from Paris proper, as serving \"Paris\" with Paris\u2013Beauvais and Paris\u2013Vatry. Beauvais airport has no railway connections, but there is a shuttle bus to central Paris 15 times daily.\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn 6 January 1993, Lufthansa Flight 5634 from Bremen to Paris, which was carried out under the Lufthansa CityLine brand using a Contact Air Dash 8\u2013300 (registered D-BEAT), hit the ground 1,800 metres (5,900 ft) short of the runway of Charles de Gaulle Airport, resulting in the death of four out of the 23 passengers on board. The four crew members survived. The accident occurred after the pilot had to abort the final approach to the airport because the runway had been closed: the aircraft immediately ahead, a Korean Air Boeing 747, had suffered a blown tire upon landing.\nOn 25 July 2000, a Concorde, Air France Flight 4590 from Charles de Gaulle to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, crashed into Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse, killing everyone on the aircraft and four people on the ground. Investigations concluded that a tire burst on take-off due to metal left on the runway from a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 that departed shortly before, leading to a ruptured fuel tank and resulting in engine failure and other damage. Concorde was conducting a charter flight for a German tour company.\nOn 25 May 2001, a freight-carrying Short SH36 (operated as Streamline flight 200), departing to Luton, England, collided on the runway with departing Air Libert\u00e9 flight 8807, an MD-83 jet. The first officer of the SH36 was killed when the wing tip of the MD-83 tore through his side of the flight deck. The captain was slightly injured and all others aboard survived.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\nThe following table shows total passenger numbers.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGroupe ADP\nParis A\u00e9roport\nCDG Express\nTransportation in France\nList of airports in France\nList of the busiest airports in France\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport travel guide from WikivoyageGeneral\n\nA\u00e9roports de Paris (official website) (in English)\nA\u00e9roport de Paris Charles de Gaulle (Union des A\u00e9roports Fran\u00e7ais) (in French)\nAccident history for CDG at Aviation Safety NetworkCollapse of Terminal 2E\n\nOfficial report of the administrative enquiry commission (in French)\nPhotos of Terminal 2E before and after the collapse and during reconstruction",

        "wiki": "Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa (24 November 1864 \u2013 9 September 1901), commonly known as just Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (UK:  ON-ree d\u0259 too-LOOZ loh-TREK, US:  on-REE -\u2060, French: [\u0251\u0303\u0281i d\u0259 tuluz lot\u0281\u025bk]), was a French painter, printmaker, draughtsman, caricaturist, and illustrator whose immersion in the colorful and theatrical life of Paris in the late 19th century allowed him to produce a collection of enticing, elegant, and provocative images of the modern, sometimes decadent, affairs of those times.\nToulouse-Lautrec is among the best-known painters of the Post-Impressionist period, with Paul C\u00e9zanne, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin.\nIn a 2005 auction at Christie's auction house, La Blanchisseuse, his early painting of a young laundress, sold for US$22.4 million and set a new record for the artist for a price at auction.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHenri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa was born at the H\u00f4tel du Bosc in Albi, Tarn, in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region of France, the firstborn child of Alphonse Charles Comte de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa (1838\u20131913) and his wife Ad\u00e8le Zo\u00eb Tapi\u00e9 de Celeyran (1841\u20131930). The last part of his name means he was a member of an aristocratic family (descendants of the Counts of Toulouse and Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec and the Viscounts of Montfa, a village and commune of the Tarn department of southern France, close to the cities of Castres and Toulouse). His younger brother was born in 1867 but died the following year. Both sons enjoyed the titres de courtoisie of Comte. If Henri had outlived his father, he would have been accorded the family title of Comte de Toulouse-Lautrec.After the death of his brother, Toulouse-Lautrec's parents separated and a nanny eventually took care of him. At the age of eight, Toulouse-Lautrec went to live with his mother in Paris, where he drew sketches and caricatures in his exercise workbooks. The family quickly realized that his talents lay in drawing and painting. A friend of his father, Ren\u00e9 Princeteau, sometimes visited to give informal lessons. Some of Toulouse-Lautrec's early paintings are of horses, a specialty of Princeteau, and a subject Lautrec revisited in his \"Circus Paintings\".In 1875, Toulouse-Lautrec returned to Albi because his mother had concerns about his health. He took thermal baths at Am\u00e9lie-les-Bains, and his mother consulted doctors in the hope of finding a way to improve her son's growth and development.\n\n\n== Disability and health problems ==\n\nToulouse-Lautrec's parents, the Comte and Comtesse, were first cousins (his grandmothers were sisters), and his congenital health conditions were attributed to a family history of inbreeding.At the age of 13, Toulouse-Lautrec fractured his right femur, and at 14, he fractured his left femur. The breaks did not heal properly. Modern physicians attribute this to an unknown genetic disorder, possibly pycnodysostosis (sometimes known as Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome), or a variant disorder along the lines of osteopetrosis, achondroplasia, or osteogenesis imperfecta. Rickets aggravated by praecox virilism has also been suggested. Afterward, his legs ceased to grow, so that as an adult he was extremely short (1.42 m or 4 ft 8 in). He developed an adult-sized torso while retaining his child-sized legs. Additionally, he is reported to have had hypertrophied genitals.Physically unable to participate in many activities enjoyed by boys his age, Toulouse-Lautrec immersed himself in art. He became a prominent Post-Impressionist painter, art nouveau illustrator, and lithographer, and, through his works, recorded many details of the late-19th-century bohemian lifestyle in Paris. Toulouse-Lautrec contributed several illustrations to the magazine Le Rire during the mid-1890s.After initially failing college entrance exams, he passed his second attempt and completed his studies.\n\n\n== Paris ==\n\nDuring a stay in Nice, France, his progress in painting and drawing impressed Princeteau, who persuaded Toulouse-Lautrec's parents to let him return to Paris and study under the portrait painter L\u00e9on Bonnat. He moved to Paris in 1882. Toulouse-Lautrec's mother had high ambitions and, with the aim of her son becoming a fashionable and respected painter, used their family's influence to get him into Bonnat's studio. He was drawn to Montmartre, the area of Paris famous for its bohemian lifestyle and the haunt of artists, writers, and philosophers. Studying with Bonnat placed Toulouse-Lautrec in the heart of Montmartre, an area he rarely left over the next 20 years.\nAfter Bonnat took a new job, Toulouse-Lautrec moved to the studio of Fernand Cormon in 1882 and studied for a further five years and established the group of friends he kept for the rest of his life. At this time, he met \u00c9mile Bernard and Vincent van Gogh. Cormon, whose instruction was more relaxed than Bonnat's, allowed his pupils to roam Paris, looking for subjects to paint. During this period, Toulouse-Lautrec had his first encounter with a prostitute (reputedly sponsored by his friends), which led him to paint his first painting of a prostitute in Montmartre, a woman rumored to be Marie-Charlet.\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nIn 1885, Lautrec started to exhibit his work at the cabaret of Aristide Bruant's Mirliton.With his studies finished, in 1887, he participated in an exposition in Toulouse using the pseudonym \"Tr\u00e9clau,\" the verlan of the family name \"Lautrec.\" He later exhibited in Paris with Van Gogh and Louis Anquetin.In 1885, Toulouse Lautrec met Suzanne Valadon. He made several portraits of her and supported her ambition as an artist. It is believed that they were lovers and that she wanted to marry him. Their relationship ended, and Valadon attempted suicide in 1888.\n\n\n=== Rise to recognition ===\nIn 1888, the Belgian critic Octave Maus invited him to present eleven pieces at the Vingt (the Twenties) exhibition in Brussels in February. Van Gogh's brother Theo bought Poudre de Riz (Rice Powder) for 150 francs for the Goupil & Cie gallery.\nFrom 1889 until 1894, Toulouse-Lautrec took part in the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants regularly. He made several landscapes of Montmartre. Tucked deep into Montmartre in the garden of Monsieur Pere Foret, Toulouse-Lautrec executed a series of pleasant en plein air paintings of Carmen Gaudin, the same red-headed model who appears in The Laundress (1888).\nIn 1890 during the banquet of the XX exhibition in Brussels, he challenged to a duel the artist Henri de Groux who criticized van Gogh works. Groux apologized, and the duel never took place.\n\n\n=== The Ladies ===\nIn addition to his growing alcoholism, Toulouse-Lautrec also frequented prostitutes. He was fascinated by their lifestyle and the lifestyle of the \"urban underclass\" and incorporated those characters into his paintings. Fellow painter \u00c9douard Vuillard later said that while Toulouse-Lautrec did engage in sex with prostitutes, \"the real reasons for his behavior were moral ones ... Lautrec was too proud to submit to his lot, as a physical freak, an aristocrat cut off from his kind by his grotesque appearance. He found an affinity between his condition and the moral penury of the prostitute.\"The girls in the brothels inspired Toulouse-Lautrec. He would frequently visit one located in Rue d'Amboise, where he had a favorite called Mireille. He created about a hundred drawings and fifty paintings inspired by the life of these women. In 1892 and 1893, he created a series of two women kissing called Le Lit, and in 1894 painted Sal\u00f3n de la Rue des Moulins from memory in his studio.He declared, \"A model is always a stuffed doll, but these women are alive. I wouldn't venture to pay them the hundred sous to sit for me, and god knows whether they would be worth it. They stretch out on the sofas like animals, make no demand and they are not in the least bit conceited.\"\nHe was well appreciated by the ladies, saying, \"I have found girls of my own size! Nowhere else do I feel so much at home\".\n\n\n=== The Moulin Rouge ===\nWhen the Moulin Rouge cabaret opened in 1889, Toulouse-Lautrec was commissioned to produce a series of posters. His mother had left Paris and, though he had a regular income from his family, making posters offered him a living of his own. Other artists looked down on the work, but he ignored them. The cabaret reserved a seat for him and displayed his paintings. Among the well-known works that he painted for the Moulin Rouge and other Parisian nightclubs are depictions of the singer Yvette Guilbert; the dancer Louise Weber, better known as La Goulue (The Glutton) who created the French can-can; and the much subtler dancer Jane Avril.\n\n\n== London ==\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec's family were Anglophiles, and though he was not as fluent as he pretended to be, he spoke English well enough. He traveled to London, where he was commissioned by the J. & E. Bella company to make a poster advertising their paper confetti (plaster confetti was banned after the 1892 Mardi Gras) and the bicycle advert La Cha\u00eene Simpson.While in London, he met and befriended Oscar Wilde. When Wilde faced imprisonment in Britain, Toulouse-Lautrec became a very vocal supporter of him, and his portrait of Oscar Wilde was painted the same year as Wilde's trial.\n\n\n== Alcoholism ==\n\nToulouse-Lautrec was mocked for his short stature and physical appearance, which led him to abuse alcohol.He initially drank only beer and wine, but his tastes expanded into liquor, namely absinthe. The Earthquake cocktail (Tremblement de Terre) is attributed to Toulouse-Lautrec: a potent mixture containing half absinthe and half cognac in a wine goblet. Due to his underdeveloped legs, he walked with the aid of a cane, which he hollowed out and kept filled with liquor in order to ensure that he was never without alcohol.\n\n\n== Cooking skills ==\nA fine and hospitable cook, Toulouse-Lautrec built up a collection of favorite recipes \u2013 some original, some adapted \u2013 which were posthumously published by his friend and dealer Maurice Joyant as L'Art de la Cuisine. The book was republished in English translation in 1966 as The Art of Cuisine \u2013 a tribute to his inventive (and wide-ranging) cooking.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nBy February 1899, Toulouse-Lautrec's alcoholism began to take its toll and he collapsed from exhaustion and the effects of alcoholism. His family had him committed to Folie Saint-James, a sanatorium in Neuilly-sur-Seine for three months. While he was committed, he drew 39 circus portraits. After his release, he returned to the Paris studio for a time and then traveled throughout France. His physical and mental health began to decline rapidly owing to alcoholism and syphilis, which he reportedly contracted from Rosa La Rouge, a prostitute who was the subject of several of his paintings.On 9 September 1901, at the age of 36, he died from complications due to alcoholism and syphilis at his mother's estate, Ch\u00e2teau Malrom\u00e9, in Saint-Andr\u00e9-du-Bois. He is buried in Cimeti\u00e8re de Verdelais, Gironde, a few kilometers from the estate. His last words reportedly were \"Le vieux con!\" (\"the old fool\"), his goodbye to his father, though another version has been suggested, in which he used the word \"hallali,\" a term used by huntsmen at the moment the hounds kill their prey: \"Je savais, Papa, que vous ne manqueriez pas l'hallali\" (\"I knew, papa, that you wouldn't miss the death.\").After Toulouse-Lautrec's death, his mother, Ad\u00e8le Comtesse de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa, and his art dealer, Maurice Joyant, continued promoting his artwork. His mother contributed funds for a museum to be created in Albi, his birthplace, to show his works. This Mus\u00e9e Toulouse-Lautrec owns the most extensive of his works.\n\n\n== Art ==\n\nIn his less-than-20-year career, Toulouse-Lautrec created:\n\n737 canvased paintings\n275 watercolors\n363 prints and posters\n5,084 drawings\nsome ceramic and stained-glass work\nan unknown number of lost worksHis debt to the Impressionists, particularly the more figurative painters like Manet and Degas, is apparent, that within his works, one can draw parallels to the detached barmaid at A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re by Manet and the behind-the-scenes ballet dancers of Degas. His style was also influenced by the classical Japanese woodprints, which became popular in art circles in Paris.He excelled at depicting people in their working environments, with the color and movement of the gaudy nightlife present but the glamour stripped away. He was a master at painting crowd scenes where each figure was highly individualized. At the time they were painted, the individual figures in his larger paintings could be identified by silhouette alone, and the names of many of these characters have been recorded. His treatment of his subject matter, whether as portraits, in scenes of Parisian nightlife, or as intimate studies, has been described as alternately \"sympathetic\" and \"dispassionate\".Toulouse-Lautrec's skilled depiction of people relied on his painterly style, which is highly linear and emphasizes contour. He often applied paint in long, thin brushstrokes, which would leave much of the board underneath showing through the paint. Many of his works may be best described as \"drawings in coloured paint.\"On 20 August 2018, Toulouse-Lautrec was the featured artist on the BBC television program Fake or Fortune?. Researchers attempted to discover whether he created two discovered sketchbooks.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Films ===\nMoulin Rouge (1952), portrayed by Jos\u00e9 Ferrer\nCasino Royale (1967): Tremble dresses as Toulouse-Lautrec for Vesper\nThe Aristocats (1970): As an animated painting kitten, voiced by Gary Dubin\nRevenge of the Pink Panther (1978), Clouseau, disguised as Toulouse-Lautrec, played by Peter Sellers\nLautrec (1998), directed by Roger Planchon\nMoulin Rouge!

        "wiki": "The Albigensian Crusade or the Cathar Crusade (1209\u20131229; French: Croisade des albigeois, Occitan: Crosada dels albigeses) was a 20-year military campaign initiated by Pope Innocent III to eliminate Catharism in Languedoc, in southern France. The Crusade was prosecuted primarily by the French crown and promptly took on a political flavour, resulting in not only a significant reduction in the number of practising Cathars, but also a realignment of the County of Toulouse in Languedoc, bringing it into the sphere of the French crown, and diminishing both Languedoc's distinct regional culture and the influence of the counts of Barcelona.\nThe Cathars originated from an anti-materialist reform movement within the Bogomil churches of the Balkans calling for a return to the Christian message of perfection, poverty and preaching, combined with a rejection of the physical to the point of starvation. The reforms were a reaction against the often scandalous and dissolute lifestyles of the Catholic clergy in southern France. Their theology, neo-Gnostic in many ways, was basically dualist. Several of their practices, especially their belief in the inherent evil of the physical world, conflicted with the doctrines of the Incarnation of Christ and Catholic sacraments. This led to accusations of Gnosticism and attracted the ire of the Catholic establishment. They became known as the Albigensians, because there were many adherents in the city of Albi and the surrounding area in the 12th and 13th centuries.\nBetween 1022 and 1163, the Cathars were condemned by eight local church councils, the last of which, held at Tours, declared that all Albigenses should be put into prison and have their property confiscated. The Third Lateran Council of 1179 repeated the condemnation. Innocent III's diplomatic attempts to roll back Catharism met with little success. After the murder of his legate Pierre de Castelnau, in 1208, Innocent III declared a crusade against the Cathars. He offered the lands of the Cathar heretics to any French nobleman willing to take up arms.\nFrom 1209 to 1215, the Crusaders experienced great success, capturing Cathar lands and perpetrating acts of extreme violence, often against civilians. From 1215 to 1225, a series of revolts caused many of the lands to be regained by the Cathars. A renewed crusade resulted in the recapturing of the territory and effectively drove Catharism underground by 1244. The Albigensian Crusade had a role in the creation and institutionalization of both the Dominican Order and the Medieval Inquisition. The Dominicans promulgated the message of the Church to combat alleged heresies by preaching the Church's teachings in towns and villages, while the Inquisition investigated heresies. Because of these efforts, by the middle of the 14th century, any discernible traces of the Cathar movement had been eradicated. The Albigensian Crusade is considered by many historians to be an act of genocide against the Cathars.\n\n\n== Cathar theology ==\n\nDerived in part from earlier forms of Gnosticism, the theology of the Cathars was dualistic, a belief in two equal and comparable transcendental principles: God, the force of good, and the demiurge, the force of evil. Cathars held that the physical world was evil and created by this demiurge, which they called Rex Mundi (Latin, \"King of the World\"). Rex Mundi encompassed all that was corporeal, chaotic and powerful. The Cathar understanding of God was entirely disincarnate: they viewed God as a being or principle of pure spirit and completely unsullied by the taint of matter. He was the God of love, order, and peace. Jesus was an angel with only a phantom body, and the accounts of him in the New Testament were to be understood allegorically. As the physical world and the human body were the creation of the evil principle, sexual abstinence (even in marriage) was encouraged. Civil authority had no claim on a Cathar, since this was the rule of the physical world. Accordingly, the Cathars refused to take oaths of allegiance or volunteer for military service. Cathar doctrine opposed killing animals and consuming meat.Cathars rejected the Catholic priesthood, labelling its members, including the pope, unworthy and corrupted. Disagreeing on the Catholic concept of the unique role of the priesthood, they taught that anyone, not just the priest, could consecrate the Eucharistic host or hear a confession. They rejected the dogma of the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist and Catholic teaching on the existence of Purgatory.Catharism developed its own unique form of \"sacrament\" known as the consolamentum, to replace the Catholic rite of baptism. Instead of receiving baptism through water, one received the consolamentum by the laying on of hands. Cathars regarded water as unclean because it had been corrupted by the earth, and therefore refused to use it in their ceremonies. The act was typically received just before death, as Cathars believed that this increased one's chances for salvation by wiping away all previous sins. After receiving consolamentum, the recipient became known as perfectus. Prior to becoming a \"perfect\", believing Cathars were encouraged but not required to follow Cathar teaching on abstaining from sex and meat, and most chose not to do so. Once an individual received the consolamentum, these rules became binding. Cathar perfects often went through a ritual fast called the endura. After receiving the consolamentum, a believer would sometimes take no food and rely only on cold water, a practice eventually resulting in death. The procedure was typically performed only by those close to death already. Some members of the Church claimed that if a Cathar upon receiving the consolamentum showed signs of recovery, the person would be smothered to death in order to ensure entry into Heaven. This did sometimes happen but there is little evidence that it was common practice.Despite Cathar anti-clericalism, there were men selected amongst the Cathars to serve as bishops and deacons. The bishops were selected from among the perfect.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nThe Cathars were part of a widespread spiritual reform movement in medieval Europe which began about 653 when Constantine-Silvanus brought a copy of the Gospels to Armenia. In the following centuries a number of dissenting groups arose, gathered around charismatic preachers, who rejected the authority of the Catholic Church. These groups based their beliefs and practices on the Gospels rather than on Church dogma and sought a return to the early church and the faith of the Apostles. They claimed that their teaching was rooted in Scripture and part of Apostolic tradition. Sects such as the Paulicians in Armenia, Bogomils from Bulgaria and the Balkans, Arnoldists in northern Italy, Petrobrusians in southern France, Henricans in Switzerland and France, and Waldensians of the Piedmont area on the border of France and Italy, were violently persecuted and repressed. The Paulicians were ordered to be burned to death as heretics; the Bogomils were expelled from Serbia and later subjected to the Inquisition and the Bosnian Crusade; Peter of Bruys, leader of the Petrobrusians, was pushed into a bonfire by an angry mob in 1131; A number of prominent 12th century preachers insisted on it being the responsibility of the individual to develop a relationship with God, independent of an established clergy. Henry of Lausanne criticized the priesthood and called for lay reform of the Church. He gained a large following. Henry's preaching focused on condemning clerical corruption and clerical hierarchy, and there is no evidence that he subscribed to Cathar teachings on dualism. He was arrested around 1146 and never heard from again. Arnold of Brescia, leader of the Arnoldists, was hanged in 1155 and his body burnt and thrown into the Tiber River, \"for fear\", one chronicler says, \"lest the people might collect them and honour them as the ashes of a martyr\". The Waldensians, followers of Peter Waldo, experienced burnings and massacres.Although these dissenting groups shared some common features with the Cathars, such as anti-clericalism and rejection the sacraments, they did not, except perhaps the Paulicians and Bogomils, subscribe to Cathar dualist beliefs. They did not specifically invoke dualism as a tenet. The Cathars may have originated from the Bogomils, as some scholars believe in a continuous Manichaean tradition which encompassed both groups. That view is not universally shared.By the 12th century, organized groups of dissidents, such as the Waldensians and Cathars, were beginning to appear in the towns and cities of newly urbanized areas. In western Mediterranean France, one of the most urbanized areas of Europe at the time, the Cathars grew to represent a popular mass movement, and the belief was spreading to other areas. One such area was Lombardy, which by the 1170s was sustaining a community of Cathars. The Cathar movement was seen by some as a reaction against the corrupt and earthly lifestyles of the clergy. It has also been viewed as a manifestation of dissatisfaction with papal power. In Cologne in 1163, four Cathar men and a girl who had traveled to the city from Flanders were burned after refusing to repent. Burnings for heresy had been very uncommon, and in the past had sometimes taken place at the behest of noblemen for political rather than religious reasons over the objections of leading Catholic clergy. After this event however, they grew more frequent.\n\nCatharism continued to spread. Cathar theology found its greatest success in the Languedoc. The Cathars were known as Albigensians because of their association with the city of Albi, and because the 1176 Church Council which declared the Cathar doctrine heretical was held near Albi. The condemnation was repeated through the Third Lateran Council of 1179. In Languedoc, political control and land ownership was divided among many local lords and heirs. Before the crusade, there was little fighting in the area and it had a fairly sophisticated polity. Western Mediterranean France itself was at that time divided between the Crown of Aragon and the County of Toulouse.On assuming the papacy in 1198, Pope Innocent III resolved to deal with the Cathars and sent a delegation of friars to the province of Languedoc to assess the situation. The Cathars of Languedoc were seen as not showing proper respect for the authority of the French king or the local Catholic Church, and their leaders were being protected by powerful nobles, who had a clear interest in independence from the king. At least in part for this reason, many powerful noblemen embraced Catharism despite making little attempt to follow its strict lifestyle restrictions. In desperation, Innocent turned to Philip II of France, urging him to either force Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse to deal with the heresy or depose him militarily. By 1204, he offered to bless those willing to go on a military campaign against the Cathars with the same indulgence given to crusaders travelling to the Holy Land. However, Philip was engaged in conflict with King John of England, and was unwilling to get involved in a separate conflict in the Languedoc. Hence, the plan stalled.One of the most powerful noblemen, Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse, did not openly embrace Cathar beliefs, but was sympathetic to Catharism and its independence movement. He refused to assist the delegation. He was excommunicated in May 1207 and an interdict was placed on his lands. Innocent tried to deal with the situation diplomatically by sending a number of preachers, many of them monks of the Cistercian order, to convert the Cathars. They were under the direction of the senior papal legate, Pierre de Castelnau. The preachers managed to bring some people back into the Catholic faith, but for the most part, were renounced. Pierre himself was extremely unpopular, and once had to flee the region for fear that he would be assassinated. On January 13, 1208, Raymond met Pierre in the hope of gaining absolution. The discussion did not go well. Raymond expelled him and threatened his safety. The following morning, Pierre was killed by one of Raymond's knights. Innocent III claimed that Raymond ordered his execution; William of Tudela blames the murder entirely on \"an evil-hearted squire hoping to win the Count's approval\".Pope Innocent declared Raymond anathematized and released all of his subjects from their oaths of obedience to him. However, Raymond soon attempted to reconcile with the Church by sending legates to Rome. They exchanged gifts, reconciled, and the excommunication was lifted. At the Council of Avignon (1209) Raymond was again excommunicated for not fulfilling the conditions of ecclesiastical reconciliation. After this, Innocent III called for a crusade against the Albigensians, with the view that a Europe free of heresy could better defend its borders against invading Muslims. The time period of the Crusade coincided with the Fifth and Sixth Crusades in the Holy Land.\n\n\n== Military campaigns ==\n\n\n=== Initial success 1209 to 1215 ===\nBy mid-1209, around 10,000 Crusaders had gathered in Lyon before marching south. Many Crusaders stayed on for no more than 40 days before being replaced. A large number came from Northern France, while some had volunteered from England. The crusaders turned towards Montpellier and the lands of Raymond Roger Trencavel, aiming for the Cathar communities around Albi and Carcassonne. Trencavel, Count of Foix, and nephew of Raymond of Toulouse, was a supporter of the Cathar movement. He initially promised to defend the city of B\u00e9ziers, but after hearing of the coming of the Crusader army abandoned that city and raced back to Carcassonne to prepare his defences.\n\n\n==== Massacre at B\u00e9ziers ====\n\nThe Crusaders captured the small village of Servian and then headed for B\u00e9ziers, arriving on July 21, 1209. Under the command of the papal legate, Arnaud Amalric, they started to besiege the city, calling on the Catholics within to come out, and demanding that the Cathars surrender. Neither group did as commanded. The city fell the following day when an abortive sortie was pursued back through the open gates. The entire population was slaughtered and the city burned to the ground. It was reported that Amalric, when asked how to distinguish Cathars from Catholics, responded, \"Kill them all! God will know his own.\" Historian Joseph Strayer doubts that Amalric actually said this, but maintains that the statement captures the \"spirit\" of the Crusaders, who killed nearly every man, woman, and child in the town.Amalric and Milo, a fellow legate, in a letter to the Pope, claimed that the Crusaders \"put to the sword almost 20,000 people\". Strayer says that this estimate is too high, but noted that in his letter \"the legate expressed no regret about the massacre, not even a word of condolence for the clergy of the cathedral who were killed in front of their own altar\". News of the disaster quickly spread and afterwards many settlements surrendered without a fight.\n\n\n==== Fall of Carcassonne ====\n\nAfter the Massacre at B\u00e9ziers, the next major target was Carcassonne, a city with many well known Cathars. Carcassonne was well fortified but vulnerable, and overflowing with refugees. The Crusaders traversed the 45 miles between B\u00e9ziers and Carcassonne in six days, arriving in the city on August 1, 1209. The siege did not last long. By August 7 they had cut the city's water supply. Raymond Roger sought negotiations but was taken prisoner while under truce, and Carcassonne surrendered on August 15. The people were not killed but were forced to leave the town. They were naked according to Peter of Vaux-de-Cernay, a monk and eyewitness to many events of the crusade, but \"in their shifts and breeches\", according to Guillaume de Puylaurens, a contemporary. Raymond Roger died several months later. Although his death supposedly resulted from dysentery, some suspected that he was assassinated.Simon de Montfort, a prominent French nobleman, was then appointed leader of the Crusader army, and was granted control of the area encompassing Carcassonne, Albi, and B\u00e9ziers. After the fall of Carcassonne, other towns surrendered without a fight. Albi, Castelnaudary, Castres, Fanjeaux, Limoux, Lombers and Montr\u00e9al all fell quickly during the autumn.\n\n\n==== Lastours and the castle of Cabaret ====\nThe next battle centred around Lastours and the adjacent castle of Cabaret. Attacked in December 1209, Pierre Roger de Cabaret repulsed the assault. Fighting largely halted over the winter, but fresh Crusaders arrived. In March 1210, Bram was captured after a short siege. In June, the well-fortified city of Minerve was besieged. The city was not of major strategic importance. Simon's decision to attack it was probably influenced by the large number of perfects who had gathered there. Unable to take the town by storm because of the surrounding geography, Simon launched a heavy bombardment against the town, and in late June the main well was destroyed and on July 22, the city, short on water, surrendered. Simon wished to treat the occupants leniently, but was pressured by Arnaud Amalric to punish the Cathars. The Crusaders allowed the soldiers defending the town as well as the Catholics inside of it to go free, along with the non-perfect Cathars. The Cathar \"perfects\" were given the opportunity to return to Catholicism. Simon and many of his soldiers made strong efforts to convert the Cathar perfects, but were highly unsuccessful. Ultimately, only three women recanted. The 140 who refused were burned at the stake. Some entered the flames voluntarily, not awaiting their executioners.In August, the Crusade proceeded to the stronghold of Termes. Despite sallies from Pierre-Roger de Cabaret, the siege was solid. The occupants of Termes suffered from a shortage of water, and Ramon (Raymond) de Termes agreed to a temporary truce. However, the Cathars were briefly relieved by an intense rainstorm, and so Raymond refused to surrender. Ultimately, the defenders were not able to break the siege, and on November 22 the Cathars managed to abandon the city and escape.By the time operations resumed in 1211, the actions of Arnaud-Amaury and Simon de Montfort had alienated several important lords, including Raymond de Toulouse, who had been excommunicated again. The Crusaders returned in force to Lastours in March and Pierre-Roger de Cabaret soon agreed to surrender. In May the castle of Aimery de Montr\u00e9al was retaken; he and his senior knights were hanged, and several hundred Cathars were burned. Cass\u00e8s fell easily in early June. Afterwards, Simon marched towards Montferrand, where Raymond of Toulouse had placed his brother, Baldwin, in command. After a short siege, Baldwin signed an agreement to abandon the fort in return for swearing an oath to go free and to not fight again against the Crusaders. Baldwin briefly returned to Raymond, but afterward defected to the Crusaders and remained loyal to them thereafter. After taking Montferrand, the Crusaders headed for Toulouse. The town was besieged, but for once the attackers were short of supplies and men, and Simon de Montfort withdrew before the end of the month. Emboldened, Raymond de Toulouse led a force to attack Montfort at Castelnaudary in September. Montfort broke free from the siege but Castelnaudary fell that December to Raymond's troops and Raymond's forces went on to liberate over thirty towns before the counter-attack ground to a halt at Lastours in the autumn.\n\n\n==== Toulouse ====\nTo repel the Crusaders, the Cathars turned to Peter II of Aragon for assistance. Peter II had been crowned king by Innocent III in 1204. He fought the Moors in Spain, and served in the Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa. However, his sister, Eleanor, had married Raymond VI, securing an alliance. His victories in the south against the Spanish, along with the persuasion of a delegation sent to Rome, had led Innocent III to order a halt to the crusade. Innocent trusted Peter and was hoping to bring an end to the Albigensian Crusade in order to launch a new crusade in the Middle East. On January 15, 1213, he wrote the legate Arnaud Amaury and to Montfort, ordering Simon to restore the lands that he had taken. He rebuked Simon for his alleged attacks on Christians. Peter petitioned the clergy at the Council of Lavaur to restore Raymond's lands, arguing that he was ready to repent. If this was unacceptable, the lands could be placed under the protection of his son while he went on crusade. The council rejected his recommendations, refusing to absolve Raymond and insisting that the lands Peter believed should be returned were still influenced by heresy.Peter rejected the council's verdict. Concerned that Simon had grown too powerful, he decided to come to the aid of Toulouse. The Crown of Aragon, under Peter II, allied with the County of Toulouse and various other entities to oppose Simon. These actions alarmed Innocent, who after hearing from Simon's delegation denounced Peter and ordered a renewal of the crusade. On May 21, he sent Peter a letter severely castigating him for allegedly providing false information, and warning him not to oppose the Crusaders. Peter's coalition force engaged Simon's troops on September 12 in the Battle of Muret. The Crusaders were heavily outnumbered. Peter and Simon both organized their troops into three lines. The first of the Crusader lines was beaten back, but Simon managed to outflank the coalition cavalry. Peter II was struck down and killed. The coalition forces, hearing of his death, retreated in confusion. This allowed Simon's troops to occupy the northern part of Toulouse.It was a serious blow to the resistance, and in 1214 the situation became worse. As the Crusaders continued their advance, Raymond and his son Raymond VII of Toulouse were forced to flee to England. In November, Simon de Montfort entered P\u00e9rigord and easily captured the castles of Domme and Montfort; he also occupied Castlenaud and destroyed the fortifications of Beynac. In 1215, Castelnaud was recaptured by Montfort, and the Crusaders entered Toulouse. The town paid an indemnity of 30,000 marks. Toulouse was gifted to Montfort. The Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215 solidified Crusader control over the area by officially proclaiming Simon the Count of Toulouse. It proclaimed that all of the lands previously Raymond VI that had been conquered by the crusade would be placed under the control of Simon IV de Montfort, and that the lands which had not yet been conquered would be placed under the protection of the Church until Raymond VII was old enough to govern them.\n\n\n=== Revolts and reverses 1216 to 1225 ===\nRaymond VI, together with Raymond VII, returned to the region in April 1216 and soon raised a substantial force from disaffected towns. Beaucaire was besieged in May. After three months, the occupants were running low on supplies, and reached an agreement with Raymond to surrender the castle in exchange for being allowed to leave with their arms. The efforts of Montfort to relieve the town were repulsed. Innocent III died suddenly in July 1216 and the crusade was left in temporary disarray. The command passed to the more cautious Philip II of France, who was reluctant to vigorously prosecute the crusade. At the time, he was still heavily involved in conflict with King John of England.Montfort then had to put down an uprising in Toulouse before heading west to capture Bigorre, but he was repulsed at Lourdes in December 1216. On September 12, 1217, Raymond retook Toulouse without a fight while Montfort was occupied in the Foix region. Montfort hurried back, but his forces were insufficient to retake the town before campaigning halted. Responding to a call from Pope Honorius III to renew the crusade, Montfort resumed the siege in the spring of 1218. On June 25 or 29, while attempting to fend off a sally by the defenders, Montfort was struck and killed by a stone hurled from defensive siege equipment. Toulouse was held, and the Crusaders driven back. Popular accounts state that the city's artillery was operated by the women and girls of Toulouse.The crusade continued with renewed vigour. Philip refused to command in person, but agreed to appoint his son, the also reluctant Prince Louis, to lead an expedition. His army marched south beginning in May, passing through Poitou. In June, an army under Amaury de Montfort, son of the late Simon, joined by Louis, besieged Marmande. The town fell in June 1219. Its occupants, excluding only the commander and his knights, were massacred. After capturing Marmande, Louis attempted to retake Toulouse. Following a siege of six weeks, the army abandoned the mission and went home. Honorius III called the endeavour a \"miserable setback\". Without Louis's troops, Amaury was unable to hold on to the lands that he had taken, and the Cathars were able to retake much of their land. Castelnaudary was retaken by troops under Raymond VII. Amaury again besieged the town from July 1220 to March 1221, but it withstood an eight-month assault. In 1221, the success of Raymond and his son continued: Montr\u00e9al and Fanjeaux were retaken and many Catholics were forced to flee. By 1222, Raymond VII had reclaimed all the lands that had been lost. That same year, Raymond VI died and was succeeded by Raymond VII. On July 14, 1223, Philip II died, and Louis VIII succeeded him as king. In 1224, Amaury de Montfort abandoned Carcassonne. Raymond VII returned from exile to reclaim the area. That same year, Amaury ceded his remaining lands to Louis VIII.\n\n\n=== French royal intervention ===\nIn November 1225, the Council of Bourges convened in order to deal with the alleged Cathar heresy. At the council, Raymond VII, like his father, was excommunicated. The council gathered a thousand churchmen to authorize a tax on their annual incomes, the \"Albigensian tenth\", to support the Crusade, though permanent reforms intended to fund the papacy in perpetuity foundered.Louis VIII headed the new crusade. His army assembled at Bourges in May 1226. While the exact number of troops present is unknown, it was certainly the largest force ever sent against the Cathars. It set out in June 1226. The Crusaders captured once more the towns of B\u00e9ziers, Carcassonne, Beaucaire, and Marseille, this time with no resistance. However, Avignon, nominally under the rule of the German emperor, did resist, refusing to open its gates to the French troops. Not wanting to storm the well-fortified walls of the town, Louis settled in for a siege. A frontal assault that August was fiercely beaten back. Finally, in early September, the town surrendered, agreeing to pay 6,000 marks and destroy its walls. The town was occupied on September 9. No killing or looting took place. Louis VIII died in November and was succeeded by the child king Louis IX. But Queen-regent Blanche of Castile allowed the crusade to continue under Humbert V de Beaujeu. Lab\u00e9c\u00e8de fell in 1227 and Vareilles in 1228. At that time, the Crusaders once again besieged Toulouse. While doing so, they systematically laid waste to the surrounding landscape: uprooting vineyards, burning fields and farms, and slaughtering livestock. Eventually, the city was retaken. Raymond did not have the manpower to intervene.Eventually, Queen Blanche offered Raymond VII a treaty recognizing him as ruler of Toulouse in exchange for his fighting the Cathars, returning all church property, turning over his castles and destroying the defences of Toulouse. Moreover, Raymond had to marry his daughter Joan to Louis' brother Alphonse, with the couple and their heirs obtaining Toulouse after Raymond's death, and the inheritance reverting to the king. Raymond agreed and signed the Treaty of Paris at Meaux on April 12, 1229.Historian Daniel Power notes that the fact that Peter of Vaux-de-Cernay's Historia Albigensis, which many historians of the crusade rely heavily upon, was published only in 1218 leaves a shortage of primary source material for events after that year. As such, there is more difficulty in discerning the nature of various events during the subsequent time period.\n\n\n== Inquisition ==\nWith the military phase of the campaign against the Cathars now primarily at an end, the Inquisition was established under Pope Gregory IX in 1234 to uproot heretical movements, including the remaining Cathars. Operating in the south at Toulouse, Albi, Carcassonne and other towns during the whole of the 13th century, and a great part of the 14th, it succeeded in crushing Catharism as a popular movement and driving its remaining adherents underground. Punishments for Cathars varied greatly. Most frequently, they were made to wear yellow crosses atop their garments as a sign of outward penance. Others made obligatory pilgrimages, which often included fighting against Muslims. Visiting a local church naked once each month to be scourged was also a common punishment, including for returned pilgrims. Cathars who were slow to repent suffered imprisonment and, often, the loss of property. Others who altogether refused to repent were burned.\n\nFriars of the Dominican Order, named after their founder, Saint Dominic, would travel to towns and villages preaching in favor of the teachings of the Church and against heresy. In some cases, they took part in prosecuting Cathars.From May 1243 to March 1244, the Cathar fortress of Monts\u00e9gur was besieged by the troops of the seneschal of Carcassonne and Pierre Amiel, the Archbishop of Narbonne. On March 16, 1244, a large massacre took place, in which over 200 Cathar perfects were burnt in an enormous pyre at the prat dels cremats (\"field of the burned\") near the foot of the castle. After this, Catharism did not completely vanish, but was practiced by its remaining adherents in secret.The Inquisition continued to search for and attempt to prosecute Cathars. While few prominent men joined the Cathars, a small group of ordinary followers remained and were generally successful at concealing themselves. The Inquisitors sometimes used torture as a method to find Cathars, but still were able to catch only a relatively small number. The Inquisition received funding from the French monarchy. In the 1290s, King Philip IV, who was in conflict with Pope Boniface VIII, limited its funding and severely restricted its activities. However, after visiting southern France in 1303, he became alarmed by the anti-monarchical sentiments of the people in the region, especially in Carcassonne, and decided to remove the restrictions placed on the Inquisition.Pope Clement V introduced new rules designed to protect the rights of the accused. The Dominican Bernard Gui, Inquisitor of Toulouse from 1308 to 1323, wrote a manual discussing the customs of non-Catholic sects and the methods to be employed by the Inquisitors in combating heresy. A large portion of the manual describes the reputed customs of the Cathars, while contrasting them with those of Catholics. Gui also describes methods to be used for interrogating accused Cathars. He ruled that any person found to have died without confessing his known heresy would have his remains exhumed and burned, while any person known to have been a heretic but not known whether to have confessed or not would have his body unearthed but not burned. Under Gui, a final push against Catharism began. By 1350, all known remnants of the movement had been extinguished.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\n\n=== Influence ===\nAs a result of the Albigensian Crusade, there were only a small number of French recruits for the Fifth and Sixth crusades. Strayer argues that the Albigensian Crusade increased the power of the French monarchy and made the papacy more dependent on it. This would eventually lead to the Avignon Papacy.\n\n\n=== Genocide ===\n\nRaphael Lemkin, who in the 20th century coined the word \"genocide\", referred to the Albigensian Crusade as \"one of the most conclusive cases of genocide in religious history\". Mark Gregory Pegg writes that \"The Albigensian Crusade ushered genocide into the West by linking divine salvation to mass murder, by making slaughter as loving an act as His sacrifice on the cross.\" Robert E. Lerner argues that Pegg's classification of the Albigensian Crusade as a genocide is inappropriate, on the grounds that it \"was proclaimed against unbelievers ... not against a 'genus' or people; those who joined the crusade had no intention of annihilating the population of southern France ... If Pegg wishes to connect the Albigensian Crusade to modern ethnic slaughter, well\u2014words fail me (as they do him).\" Laurence Marvin is not as dismissive as Lerner regarding Pegg's contention that the Albigensian Crusade was a genocide; he does, however, take issue with Pegg's argument that the Albigensian Crusade formed an important historical precedent for later genocides including the Holocaust.Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Solveig Bj\u00f6rnson describe the Albigensian Crusade as \"the first ideological genocide\". Kurt Jonassohn and Frank Chalk (who together founded the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies) include a detailed case study of the Albigensian Crusade in their genocide studies textbook The History and Sociology of Genocide: Analyses and Case Studies, authored by Strayer and Malise Ruthven.According to Edward Peters, the violence of the Albigensian Crusade was not in line with the reforms and plans of Innocent, who stressed confession, reform of the clergy and laity, and pastoral teachings to oppose heresy. Peters maintains that the violence was due to the crusade being under the control of mobs, petty rulers, and local bishops who did not uphold Innocent's ideas. The uncontainable, prejudicial passion of local mobs and heresy hunters, the violence of secular courts, and the bloodshed of the Albigensian Crusade sparked a desire within the papacy to implement greater control over the prosecution of heresy. This desire led to the development of organized legal procedures for dealing with heretics.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nLippiatt, G.E.M. (2017).

        "wiki": "The Pont de pierre, or \"Stone Bridge\" in English, is a bridge in Bordeaux, (in the Gironde department of France), which connects the left bank of the Garonne River (cours Victor Hugo) to the right bank quartier de la Bastide (Avenue Thiers).\nIt is 487 m (1,598 ft) in length and 19 m (62 ft) wide. It constitutes the legal frontier between the maritime domain and the river domain in the port of Bordeaux.\n\n\n== Name and translation ==\n\"Stone bridge\" is the usual translation of \"Pont de pierre\", however the real meaning of the french phrase \"pont de pierre\" is \"masson bridge\". As a matter of fact, the bridge is built mainly of brick and not stone.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nFirst bridge over the Garonne River at Bordeaux, the Pont de pierre was planned and designed during the First French Empire, under the orders of Napoleon I. As he campaigned in Spain, he needed his troops cross rapidly the river, and the original project envisaged a wood bridge, easier to build. Until then, it was necessary to cross the river by boat.\nDue to lack of resources, the construction took place subsequently, during the Bourbon Restoration, from 1819 to 1822. During these three years, the builders were faced with many challenges because of the strong current and the high tidal range, 6 m (20 ft), at that point in the river.  They used a diving bell borrowed from the British to stabilise the bridge's pillars.\n\nThe bridge has 17 arches (according to the legend the number of letters in the name 'Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte'). On the sides, each pile of bricks is capped by a white medallion that were to receive the cipher of Louis XVIII of France, a double L.\nIt was the only bridge until the construction of pont Saint-Jean in 1965.\n\nThe bridge and its tide is an important point in the Itin\u00e9raire \u00e0 Grand Gabarit, the logistic schedule transporting parts for the Airbus A380 production.Since 2016, the condition of the bridge makes it now permanently closed to traffic except for pedestrians, cyclists, trams and emergency vehicles.\n\n\n== Postage stamp ==\nOn 26 April 2004, a tourist stamp was issued for \u20ac0.50 in Bordeaux,.  It shows the bridge and a train Pierre tramway de Bordeaux inaugurated on 21 December 2003.  Contrary to what the stamp shows, the tram passes along the bridge and not on a second bridge alongside. The design is the work of Claude Andr\u00e9otto, engraved by Claude Jumelet for printing intaglio. The stamp was withdrawn from sale on 12 November 2004.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bridges in Gironde\nStation Porte de Bourgogne (Tram de Bordeaux) (left bank) and Station Stalingrad (Tram de Bordeaux) (right bank)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLe pont de pierre sur Google Maps",

        "wiki": "Toulouse\u2013Blagnac Airport (French: A\u00e9roport de Toulouse\u2013Blagnac) (IATA: TLS, ICAO: LFBO) is an international airport located 3.6 nautical miles (6.7 km; 4.1 mi) west northwest of Toulouse, partially in Blagnac, both communes of the Haute-Garonne department in the Occitanie region of France. In 2017, the airport served 9,264,611 passengers. As of April 2017, the airport features flights to 74 destinations mostly in Europe and Northern Africa with a few additional seasonal long-haul connections.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nThe airport resides at an elevation of 499 feet (152 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt-paved runways: 14R/32L is 3,500 by 45 metres (11,483 ft \u00d7 148 ft) and 14L/32R is 3,000 by 45 metres (9,843 ft \u00d7 148 ft). Both Airbus and ATR manufacture aircraft at nearby facilities and test them from the airport. A Concorde formerly operated by Air France with the registration F-BVFC is preserved at the Aeroscopia Museum near the airport. Airbus and ATR utilize runway 32L/14R for flight testing and delivery flights, while runway 32R/14L is used by commercial flights coming in to Toulouse (Airbus also uses this runway for formation flights). Also, the Airbus Delivery Center is on the runway 32L/14R side.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nToulouse\u2013Blagnac Airport SA is a limited liability company; the share capital is \u20ac148,000, and its shareholders are the French government (60%), the Toulouse Chamber of Commerce and Industry (25%), the Regional Council (5%), the Departmental Council (5%), and the Urban Area (5%). Toulouse\u2013Blagnac Airport SA has authority to operate the airport until 2046 under a franchise agreement awarded by the French government. The current CEO is Philippe Cr\u00e9bassa.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights to and from Toulouse:\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== Access ==\n\n\n=== Tram ===\nSince April 2015, the tram line T2 connects Toulouse with the airport every 15 minutes. The tram connects with metro ligne A at Ar\u00e8nes and metro ligne B at Palais de Justice. It takes about 35 minutes with a change to go to the town center by tram.\n\n\n=== Bus and coach ===\nShuttle buses to Toulouse city centre stop outside Hall B every 20 minutes. Faster than the tram, they take approximately 20 minutes to reach the city centre, stopping at Compans-Caffarelli and Jeanne d'Arc (both on Metro Line B), Jean Jaur\u00e8s (Metro Line A and B) and at Toulouse-Matabiau railway station. Three daily coach services connect Toulouse\u2013Blagnac Airport to Andorra, which does not have its own commercial airport.\n\n\n== Accidents and incidents ==\nOn 29 January 1988, Inter Cargo Service Flight 1004, operated by Vickers Vanguard F-GEJF, crashed when take-off was attempted with only three fully operable engines.\nOn 30 June 1994, an Airbus A330-300 performing a test flight crashed shortly after takeoff, due to a series of mistakes while conducting a flight test simulating an engine failure. All seven people on board died in the accident.\nOn 15 November 2007, a brand-new Airbus A340-600 due to be delivered to Etihad Airways ran up and over the top of a concrete sloped blast-deflection wall during an engine test at the Airbus factory at the airport. This was due to the crew not following proper test procedures, raising all four engines to maximum thrust while the wheels were un-chocked. The attempt to steer away from the wall resulted in decreased braking power. Five people were injured and the aircraft was written off.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of the busiest airports in France\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Toulouse Blagnac International Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nA\u00e9roport de Toulouse \u2013 Blagnac (Union des A\u00e9roports Fran\u00e7ais) (in French)\nRadar Toulouse (Realtime flight tracker)\nCurrent weather for LFBO at NOAA/NWS\nAccident history for TLS at Aviation Safety Network\nLiveATC.net (Toulouse)",

          "The new outside area featuring the A380, 340 and 320 is very nice. The interior of the A380 is very dissapointing, almost seems like the museum didnt know what to do with the space. Overall a worthy visit for all age groups!",
          "Get on board and discover this museum, which houses an exceptional collection of aircraft. Ideal for those who have always dreamed of entering the legendary Concorde cockpit. The 7000 m2 building near the Airbus works features playful and \u2026",
          "If you visit Toulouse and you like planes, you MUST take time to visit that museum\ud83d\udc4c",
          "Fantastic place! You can go inside several planes including one Concorde and one A380. And it is well prepared for complying with the social distancing rules imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic.",
          "Under normal circumstances, this place is every plane enthusiast's wet dream. During Covid... Not so much. We signed up for the tour of the Airbus factory through their website on which they proudly announced that they were open for \u2026",
          "There was some interesting history and a decent amount of different planes and helicopters. Unfortunately the outside A380 was not yet accessible and inside quite a few of the screens / pads that were supposed to display stuff didn't work. \u2026",
          "A must visit museum whether you\u2019re an aviation enthusiast or otherwise. A wide range of airplanes on display with detailed historical information and whatnot. Simulation areas too which is absolutely great for kids too",
          "Probably the most overrated place to visit in Toulouse. None of the interactive activities were working. Minimum selection of modern aviation memorabilia. Definitely not suited for a hardcore aviation enthusiast.",
          "Nice presentation of aircraft and was able to walk onto Concourde 001. Pretty cool experience!  I only rate a four as I have been to many larger air museums around the world with more variety.",
          "Fantastic experience to see closely the real size of airplane. What below and above our plane seat now reveal to our common eye. This is a must visit place if you come by Toulouse. Kid will love this place.",
          "Beautiful!!U can see allmost all the types aircrafts. U have the option to get inside the planes and understand their operations. It is a must visit place in Toulouse",
          "This museum has some very interesting artifacts including two examples of Concorde, an A400M, and an A300-B4 built in 1985.  They are soon going to have the A380 on display as well (I visited in December 2019)",
          "Good presentation of Airbus related aircraft interspersed with mainly classic French airframes with the  Guppy being a highlight. \nWould have been higher rated if outdoor exhibits like A400 were accessible. \nThe addition of a Beluga exhibit looks soon to be finished outside but wasn't open yet.",
          "Quite comprehensive overview of the french aviation industry and history. I didn't quite like the fact that if you're not an EU citizen, you have to book the Airbus tour 2 days in advance. Sounds discriminatory to non EU.",
          "It\u2019s a lovely museum.  The history of flight boards are hugely informative.  The beautifully preserved aircraft are excellent.  We enjoyed it hugely.  Going on board the Concorde was a thrill in a lifetime experience.  The museum isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s fantastic anyway.",
          "An amazing experience, you get to know a lot of the Airbus history as well as the history of aviation. It is totally recommended to combine the ticket with an excursion to Airbus\u2019 buildings as you will learn and see the manufacturing process of an Airbus plane.",
          "Wonderful museum that tells the story of aviation. You can find and visit a true Concord and other key examples of the evolution of flight, from the first prototypes of flying vehicles until today's technologies such as drones. Amazing \u2026",
          "A very interesting Museum about the history of Airbus and the European Aviation Industry. The presentation is very modern and support by Apps for you mobile device. The aircrafts in display are very impressive and partly have been partly \u2026",
          "Monumental and spectacular. Can board on a real Concorde. Recommended.",
          "You should definitely visit this museum. There is literally all the Airbus airplanes exhibited in there (a380 , a340 , 2 CONCORDES ?!?! AND MUCH MORE)",
          "Go there, if you want to learn the american-french history of the Super Guppy. #BroForever",
          "Worth a visit if you like aviation. Also, you can book a visit to production facilities (at least 2 days ahead) and have a combi ticket to museum.",
          "For the aviation lovers, this museum has a little bit of everything that will satiate your thirst for knowledge. It's also got many aircraft on display, and the classic concord that you can enter and see how it was. They also have some \u2026",
          "Great place to see aircraft close up and learn about the history of flight.",
          "I love this museum. Such great preservation of the exhibits. It will be nice when the new tarmac opens.",
          "A nice selection of aircraft throughout history and a very france-centric view of aviation development. Somewhat decoupled from Airbus works, though factory tours (overbooked) start from here as well. Expensive.",
          "Quite disappointed actually, only 3 planes to go inside and quite far from the centre and also from the airport terminal, can finish it all in 30 minutes. I found the air museums in Paris and New York, both also featuring the Concorde, much more worth a visit.",
          "We visited with our 11 yr old twins who wanted to try out the advertised flight simulators and visit concorde. The prices on the out of date website were higher than advertised.  50 euros for a family  of four which would have been ok had \u2026",
          "I recommend if you are interested in planes and/or history. This place contains a great amount of knowledge as things to see. Check if the mini-games are working before going, they are worth a shot.",
          "Interesting for people who are aware of aviation , enthusiastic of happy travels & high tech passenger airplanes or military jet planes !",
          "Quite a fun experience though no discovery tour to join without reservation two days in advance for non-eu passport holders. Enquired the staff but they also do not know why it takes extra time. \n\nThere are various types of aircrafts with \u2026",
          "A must for air and space lovers. Lots of planes to see on display, with a very well explained history of aviation. Plus you can have a tour inside airbus factory, but that needs reservation in advance",
          "I would propose to have access to all the aircrafts located at the tarmac display area",
          "It is worth to visit. Don't misst \"visit Airbus\" there is a combined ticket for both for ~\u20ac27 ( price from 2020)",
          "Great museum, loved the planes",
          "Great tour through the exposed airplanes: cargo, passenger, military. Very well detailed with videos, audio and readable information. Highly recommend this tour while visiting Toulouse.",
          "Awesome cant wait for next year to visit the Airbus A340",
          "Very good museum! There are a lot of different air vehicles and there is a lot of informative information provided.",
          "The place is good, 15 min walking from tram station. Be aware, the \"Visit the Airbus\" requires reservation in advanced.",
          "Very nice, just to be able to get inside the concorde already worth the visit.",
          "It was one of the main reasons I went to Toulouse, it was informative and a good day out",
          "Plenty of aircrafts to see.  Worth a visit to kill free time while waiting for flights.  The entrance is not free.",
          "Prices a bit expensive. The museum is very nice, but partially I was missing information, and in addition, the movie shown was in French only. The planes shown are interesting, but the concept seemed like it is not followed on...",
          "Amazing, if you visit Toulouse this is a must. Don't forget to try the simulator.",
          "Wonderful exhibition of Airbus, French and also planes from other countries. The Concorde and Supper Guppy are the highlights. The airplane models are also fantastic. Sadly some of the interactive were not operational when we went there \u2026",
          "It's great to get to walk inside Concorde!",
          "I hate beeing cheeted and that is happened on my visit on Oct. 9th. Your foodmachine did not deliver but took my money allright. The nice young man in the reception ensured me that a refund would occur the same evening. This of course never has happened.",
          "I was especting more. You are not allowed to see the cabine, just the passengers space...",
          "Amazing, French planes, fighter planes, even 2 Concordes!  Aviation history.",
          "A bit small as aerospace museums go, but a nice little collection. Don't plan on spending many hours, but good for an hour before an Airbus tour.",
          "Excellent aircraft museum ... Great for enthusiastics of all things aviation",
          "Good place to visit with kids.",
          "Really French. The Concorde is a must-see. The plains outside on the tarmac can only be visited with a guided tour. A lot of airplanes, but you want to have the audio tour (it's an app with we codes), making it more explainable. \n\nA lot of \u2026",
          "I had six hours to spend in Toulouse before flying back and was recommended to come here. \n\nIt\u2019s around \u20ac8 and ten minutes by Uber from the airport or \u20ac1,60 and an hour by tram and a short walk. \n\nLockers are available free of charge to \u2026",
          "Great museum for old aircrafts",
          "Good museum if you love airplanes...",
          "Excellent foamy-friendly museum!",
          "Quite disappointed with the museum. The facilities are old. You could only visit the interior of 2 old aircrafts. It\u2019s certainly not an up to date museum.",
          "A travel trough time that takes you through the aviation history from the airbus perspective. Really recommended for aviation lovers. I really enjoyed seeing the Concord aircraft, it was a shame it had to be retired, hopefully in the future we will have new technologies that makes us enter a new era on the aviation world.",
          "Interesting for fan of planes",
          "Development of technology through the history, aviation industry",
          "Absolutely worthwhile the visit, especially price wise! It holds a large collection of aircraft, especially with French history: Guppy, Concord, etc",
          "Amazing place for every avgeek! Mega friendly guides and staff.",
          "Nice museum. The public transport to and from the museum is worthless though.",
          "If you are into airplanes, you should definitely see this.",
          "Excelleny collections. Well organized exhibits. Has ample parking. Storage for carry on luggage and maybe a backpack. 2 concordes on display. Awesome for plane fanatics. Price for adults is 12.5 euros.",
          "Interesting to learn about the history of aviation and see some interesting aircraft like the legendary Concorde",
          "Good to experience but felt it needed to offer more. Great to see the A380.",
          "Great museum with a close look at the airplanes",
          "We just saw the museum. Very good explanation, big real aircraft. Unfortunatelly no more tickets for 380 factory. Good place to go with kids from 7 or 8. Not youngers",
          "Had a great time here. Well worth the visit.",
          "They have some really cool aircraft worth seeing. I love aircraft and I wanted more detail. They should focus on the aircraft and less on a cartoon character. The tours they offer are good. The A350 tour is the best",
          "Amazing place for anyone interested in Aviation!!!",
          "Definitely get the guided tour. Without it this is only 3 stars",
          "Good size for kids, nice restaurant",
          "Great location.... only needed the airbus aircraft series to complement it.",
          "If you are in Toulouse and you are at least a little interested in aeronautics, it's a place to visit without doubts.",
          "For the love of flying",
          "Could get lost in here for several hours if you have an interest in the history of flight. There are refurbished fighter jets like the bf109 on display as well as a Concorde you can walk into. I believe there are 30 aircraft in the hangar \u2026",
          "Interesting museum with info in French and English. English also spoken at reception. Two Corcordes, Super guppy and the A400M. Great exhibits. Much better than the Airbus factory tour.",
          "A must for aviation fans, you can see many aircraft here, including the Concorde.",
          "This is a place that you can spend for more than 2 hours to get familiar with the airplanes. The description is in both french and english. The boutique has varies gifts for you to choose. It is not air-conditioned except the reception and \u2026",
          "Lots to see, read and positive guides.",
          "Great museum with easy access and well laid out exhibits.",
          "Looking forward to the 380 visit.",
          "I liked the museum. If you're interested in airplane (history) this is a nice place to visit. I also booked the factory tour, but this was a bit disappointing. Just one visit to a large building where you see three planes from a large distance.",
          "Aeroscopia is a museum about the history of the aviation located in the surroundings of Toulouse. Here you can learn about the history of the aviation and see a lot of real planes, which now are not used. Really, it is a very interesting \u2026",
          "Really enjoyable... Luggage storage is on site also.",
          "The place to go for Airbus history and real aircraft museum. It is also adapted to children with specific activities",
          "Great museum! Diverse but not too overwhelming.",
          "Impressed with the place. Recommended!",
          "This place is a must if you're in Toulouse and you're into aviation",
          "Very good",
          "Interested in aviation?  Go and visit! Nice to have a look into the flight test Concorde,  to walk into the super guppy or touch the propellers of tbe A400M. But, some actual things are missing, things like tbe A350, 320Neo, 330Neo are not really present,  but think they are also important as a party of European aviation.",
          "Excellent as always.",
          "Aeroscopia is a must visit place when you are in Toulouse. They have a wide collections of aircrafts and the best part is you can go inside the Concorde and experience it's unique features.  You can easily spend about 2.5  hours to 4 hours \u2026",
          "Two stars because my son got stung by wasps when we were visiting the outdoor museum. Plus the airbus museum had to be reserved in advance if you are not EUROPEAN citizens... hence we were not able to visit it. PROBABLY the worst toys in \u2026",
          "Friendly staff. They have some fascinating aircraft, among which are the Concord and the Guppy.",
          "There is enough entry level detail for people without specialized knowledge to learn. For the enthusiast with advanced knowledge, you can get very close to most planes and walk inside others with hatches open - so you can really see lots of details.",
          "Awesome! Really in depth history and then you can walk around a number of planes including Concorde and a super guppy.",
          "Very nice Airbus tour",
          "Very fun attraction with a lot of information. Information through all medias - video, charts, stuff to touch and even plays.\nOne star less because the military plane was only visitable from another paid tour but still in the area of aeroscopia",
          "Good Space\nThe exterior Concorde was closed :-(\nBut overall is good",
          "Amazing, beautiful astonishing",
          "Quite impressive and totally recomendable, even though I think it is overpriced.\nThe concorde simulator wasn't working, you can't get close to any plane and you can only visit 2 of them on the inside, but everything there is fenced with \u2026",
          "This large airplane museum is run by Airbus and shows over two dozen different types of airplanes, from small single seaters to giant cargo airplanes. The highlight is the Concorde. There are informative and interactive displays in French and English. Worth a visit when you are in Toulouse!",
          "My main reason for the visit was seeing the interior of Concorde and Airbus A200M. Nothing special and not as good as the RAF museum in UK. As Aeroscopia is really a small one.",
          "Wonderful museum",
          "Excellent tour of the Airbus assembly line. Book in advance and see the A350s being built and what they did to make the production process more effectient. A must for ant AV geek",

Lockers are available free of charge to leave bags and rucksacks since these are",
          "My visit here followed my tour of the Airbus site and I was a little disappointed overall. There was some nice aircraft on display but having visited many aviation museums I hadn't seen anything notable except the Super Guppy transport plane which i hadn't seen before. I would",
          "We came here around 4pm in the afternoon and we are around 50 people. The exhibit of actual aircraft is great. Nice to see and have a picture. Worth the visit.",
          "The highlight is getting to walk inside a Concorde and A300. This isn't a museum you could spend all day at - we did it in about 2hrs or so without rushing. Despite one of us not being a huge aviation fan, we both enjoyed it and wish there were more planes open to the public.",

          "Really enjoyed getting so close to so many different aeroplanes, new and old, big and small and different uses. Liked being able to go into Concorde. My son enjoyed the flight simulator.",
          "This is a nice museum and the aircraft are well preserved. Its not that big and so it all can be seen in about a hour. Staff were very helpful and welcoming. My only comment is that it seems rather expensive what what is there.",
          "Aeroscopia is a museum about the history of the aviation located in the surroundings of Toulouse. Here you can learn about the history of the aviation and see a lot of real planes, which now are not used. Really, it is a very interesting place if you are interested in this",
          "The museum contains, in a huge hangar, many planes from different eras. Here, you can enter the famous Concorde, one of the first Airbus and a huge cargo plane that used to carry pieces of other planes. In December 2018 it also featured an exhibit about the planes that Herg\u00e9",
          "Well worth the visit and the theme is Tintin with his loyal dog Milou. You can get close up to the Concorde and visit the A400M military aircraft. Walk through the Concorde and the first European widebody the A300B. Impressive. You can also fly the A380 in a small simulator.",
          "Interesting place to visit, especially for the ones who loves avia etc. Exposition is not big, but there are some interesting things. There is an interactive area, however it's just for children, nothing interesting for adults. Great option is that you can come on board to some",
          "It is worth visiting for some planes not really seen elsewhere. Loved both the Concorde and the Caravelle, too bad one can enter the Airbus A400M only if paying for the Airbus tour... :(",
          "Great aviation museum with loads of facts and planes. Walk through Concorde and an A300 which shows you the wiring that goes on beneath your seat. There\u2019s also a super guppy which you can enter and learn more on a video presentation. Loads of other little \u201clight\u201d aircraft with",
          "Quite impressive and totally recomendable, even though I think it is overpriced. The concorde simulator wasn't working, you can't get close to any plane and you can only visit 2 of them on the inside, but everything there is fenced with polycarbonate. I understand they are quite",
          "you love it or not...you MUST be there!! with 25\u20ac you will make a tour to A380 (biggest passenger aeroplane of the world) assembly line and a pass to Aero Aviation Museum!! A small tour to a big aero industry!!",
          "Good way to spend 90 mins with your inquisitive son.....part science lesson, part French aviation advert. It was good to get up close to some machines. Having Concorde and a 'Guppy' almost next to each other demonstrates how diverse and interesting planes can be. All exhibits",

          "Well liad out museum, although not a huge number of exhibits. Obviously French biased but the info boards were generally pretty good (no mention of Alcock and Brown being first across the Atlantic was a big omission). The best exhibits were the Super Guppy, being able to walk",
          "Informative exhibition for the non aircraft buff. Infirmation in french and english. Fascinating insight into Herge and his love of aircraft which made its way into Tintin\u2019s adventures. of course, Concorde is the star attraction and you can go inside and marvel at how narrow the",
          "Aeroscopia has a lot to offer and you learn a lot of things there, also children as there a dedicated explanations for them. I really liked visiting some of the planes there with a bit of disappointment for the Concorde as you may not enter the Air France one on the tarmac but",
          "The location is well served by buses and trams. It also has ample free parking. The facility is impressive as you arrive with a Concorde and an A400 sitting outside. Once inside we went to collect our reasonably priced pre booked tickets. We had booked a ticket for the museum",
          "Lots of aircraft from the very earliest to the latest. If you are an aircraft nut you could probably spend all day there. A couple of hours did us. The interesting thing is that it\u2019s as close as you\u2019ll ever get to \u2018being on the apron\u2019 alongside the planes in which you fly. This",
          "If this sort of thing floats your boat, it\u2019s amazing!! The guided tour is fun and informative. Seeing all those beautiful aeroplanes in various stages of build was special. There was the original A380 prototype being refurbished as well as a Cathay Pacific A350 being completed.",
          "Aeroscopia is an aircraft museum adjacent to the Airbus facility. The museum covers a large area and houses some classic aircraft including the Concord and the first A300. You can actually go on board these aircraft. There is a great display of other aircraft as well. A visit to",
          "We visited the museum in the morning before lunch. We took the audiotour and since the museum was not very busy we just roamed around and reviewed all the planes. Also with a wheelchair you can visit the insite of the majority of planes. We had lunch at the museum restaurant",
          "Good for an hour, but not many planes to see. The Concorde and Caravelles outside had steps but were closed off. Would have been nice if we could have been allowed to enter them. Items in the shop were pricey.",
          "Perfectly organised museum. The TinTin exposition is cleverly woven into the regular exibits. Very exiting to see the very first Concorde 001. It\u2019s big enough to tell the sory and small enough to keep kids interested.",
          "Nice and tidy space with a lot of aviation history well documented. My kids wanted more hands on experience and a closer look at some of the aircrafts, trying out the cockpits etc but other than that it is not much to say. A bit small if you are used to sights like Kennedy space",
          "... but maybe a little pricey. The exhibits, both inside and out, are in excellent condition and well laid out. As well as aircraft ranging from the imposing Super Guppy, Airbus A.300 and Concorde(s) there are also interesting sections on aviation archaeology and models of",

          "The home of the A380 and a must for all Airbus fans. Visit here and also take an A350 and/or A380 tour. Well worth the visit.",

          "We all had different levels of interest in aviation and airplanes but all of us enjoyed this. It is an interesting place for everyone - the young and the old - the ones who know a lot about airplanes and those who know little but are curious. We enjoyed our time here and in fact",
          "This is a cool museum if you're a plane enthusiast. The hangar is very cold inside, so if you're visiting during winter time, don't bother to take off your coat. Most parts if the hotel have english translations and subtitles but there's a main film that is only in French.",
          "A very nice place and interesting visit giving you a retrospective of the aviation history in parallel of the AIRBUS story. You've got also a lot of aircrafts within the museum like a Supper Guppy, Concorde and an A300B that you can visit. If you want to extend your visit with a",
          "We thouroughly enjoyed this museum. There are many airplanes to look at and many activities for kids (parking the plane was fun and challenging). Most comments are in french and english which makes it easy. On the negative side: women are never mentionned except as flight",
          "Here you will find a cluster of aircraft sites from ancient wings to A380, with aeroscopia somewhere in the middle. There are some gems (concorde 001 and a cutaway A300, in my opinion). There is a series of presentations about materials, roles, etc. All in all quite good, but",
          "Even if you do not like Aviation, you will enjoy this visit to Aeroscopia. From the start it is very informative, and great for the little ones. You can go onto aircraft, including Concorde, and the games and interactive areas are really good (and educational). No one was",

          "If you are an aviation enthusiast, Aeroscopia should be on the top of the list of the places you need to visit in Toulouse. It is a museum of the history of planes and aviation industry in general. It is located very close to the Blagnac airport and the Airbus factory. You can",

          "Aeroscopia is more a collection of planes than a museum in my opinion. We spent 2 hours there in July 2017. You get to see a Caravalle, two concordes, an Airbus A300, A400M, the sky lift, and some other military jets. Boards are both in French and English. There are some",
          "Aeroscopia provides a big range of information and history about the evolution of the aerospace industry. It is a really nice visit for plane lovers. Houses the concorde and other amazing planes. Highly Recommended.",

          "My wife and I went to Blagnac in the outskirts of Tolouse, France to the new Aeroscopia Museum. It is a great museum, con a variety of airplanes, including Concorde, A400M, Me 109, and others. It is easy to get around. The shop is also very good.",
          "I had an hour before a pre booked Let's Visit Airbus tour so upon checking in I decided to visit the museum. A reduced rate was charged due to my your booking which was a pleasant surprise. There are a number of displays relating to the history of flight and it's development",
          "This museum is not just in front of the A380 assembly line. If you like Aircraft or just interested in technology you will find it amazing. It doesn't take long to give the whole tour so you won't spend there more that a short morning.",

          "Had a really good time here with my friend (she is a resident of Toulouse and it was her first time here). We both had a really great time looking at the history of flight and particularly enjoyed going on the planes they have there. The only thing to note is that the hanger can",

          "Intended to trace French aviation history, it showcases the best aircraft ever produced in France. Along the way, there's a nod to American aircraft used by the French military, such as the F8 Crusader and the F104 Starfighter. As expected, Airbus aircraft occupies a big chunk",
          "Nice spacious, well laid out and informative museum for those interested in aeronautics. Very well organised pity that it proved a bit difficult to get there by public transport. There are no signs to get you from the tram station to the museum. Overall a good experience.",
          "I like it very much The only negative point was that I wished if the guide take us around all planes rather than few of them",
          "Have visited here several times, always good. They run the tours of Airbus too. The panoramic tour is the best in my book, but they have recently changed it so for me its lost a bit of its usefulness.",

          "This museum gives a good presentation of the history of aviation with a French bias. There are many aircraft in the hangar and a couple outside as well. There are a number of interactive exhibits for kids. You could spend an enjoyable hour and a half here.",
          "Many reviews will have talked about the combined museum visit and Airbus tours, but first and foremost be aware that you can't do this on a Sunday as the Airbus tours don't run on Sundays. Similarly, the nearby Ailes Anciennes museum isn't normally open on Sundays, so choose",

          "Have to say I was like a kid again here! I done the museum and lets visit airbus and I was not disappoint! If you love aviation you will love it, it's as simple as that. I spent about 4 hours in just the museum! Recommend to any aviation/ airbus enthusiast!",

          "If you're at all interested in flight or air travel, feel free to spend a few hours at this museum. They have a open Guppy, you can visit inside of a Concorde and a A300, they have a (basic) flight simulator, etc... all good fun and very enlightening",
          "from airport i took taxi to aeroscopia cost 20 euro, then only i found out there is a shuttle bus (starline) run from city center and will stop at few stops including airport that only cost 5 euro (from airport). Very small area actually, one hanger and a outdoor small area,",
          "Very interesting museum for half a day visit with kids. The collection of aircraft it's small but outstanding. (Which is great for kids) They have the first flight Concorde that was also use for flight test. You can see all the flight test equipment. It has a lot of activities",
          "provides a french view of the development in aviation. I enjoyed it immensely, with 2 Concords for a start! clearly they have a pretty good record, ad the vision to carry it through, and this museum reflects that",
          "The whole museum is inside a specifically designed hanger, with ~ 20 planes inside. The highlights are a super guppy, a concord, a A300B, of which the last two you can enter. There are also a whole line of Airbus plane models. Outside the hanger, there are 3 real planes,",
          "Having been poorly informed about bringing our passports for the Airbus plant tour, we were 'forced' to take the B-trip and only visit the museum. Depending on what you have visited before this is a small(ish) display of a few aircraft but nicely done and sufficient to keep the",

          "Fantastic experience , a must see in Toulouse! You can see by person the airbus 400M, concorde , a mirage! Important! If you want to see the Airbus factory , you must book it 3-5 days in advance !",
          "good museum, lot of airplanes on display , inclusief 2 examples of the fameus Concorde. A clear walking route isn't market. Worth a visit tough the price is a bit too high I think. Don't take the audio guide, all the info is displayed, and there is not much extra info on the",
          "Wonderful exhibition of different planes, jets in addition to that simulator, exhibition and explanation of history, different plane development stages, something for the future thinking, lot of activities for kids. When getting here by public transport, take T1, get-off on",
          "It was surprisingly quite considering the quality of the museum. There is a real concorde among other things such as an airbus a300. A glass floor is a great idea to see all the cabling etc. Everything is clean and really well maintained. Highly recommended for all the aviation",
          "Very nice building, well climate controlled and very freindly staff. Nice little shop no restaurant. Easy acces by car or public transport, use the tram and exit at Beauzelle, then walk for app. 10 minutes. Combine it with let s visit airbus tour starts at the same building",

          "I loved the experience of seeing inside a Concorde, an A300, and a Supper Guppy. A wide range of military and civil aircraft from the last 100 years, but especially the last 60 were present and in top condition. Do not come too early if you want to see the Ancient aircraft",
          "This is in aeroplane nerd's dream! An A300 and Concorde you can walk around in. Numerous other aircraft inside the hanger on display as well as the first A400M, another Concorde and Caravelle parked outside. Overall an excellent display. Good audio guide. My tip would be to",
          "On a visit to my daughter and her partner in Toulouse, they had decided to keep me entertained by a visit to this museum. As others have already said, there is plenty to see here with descriptions mostly (but not all) in English as well as French. Not only are there many",

          "This aircraft museum is no doubt the best I've visited so far. Very informative, the aircrafts are well maintained. A lot activities for kids. The Concorde, A400M and Superguppy are the most significant metals displayed there.",
          "This is a museum and an educational place. I learnt a lot about aviation in general but also the french contribution to world aviation. The information is presented in french and english in text pictures and video. Interesting selection of planes, the choice reflects the fact",
          "I took my grandson to see this very well laid out museum which contains aircraft from Bleriot's flying wicker chair to Concorde. Everything is explained in French and English and there are various 'hands- on' for kids of all ages to try. You can go inside three of the biggest",
          "This museum has two Concorde airliners...and that's enough reason to visit. New museum, reasonably priced...Excellent.",
          "You can spend the whole day here. They have a collection of vintage planes and the modern ones, including the concorde.",
          "While perhaps smaller that most other aeronautical museums, the Aeroscopia museum had many to offer, including what was perhaps the highlight of our visit: a walk inside the first Concorde ever made and a replica of Airbus's first ever plane, the A300. The staff was very kind",
          "Very good collection of old aircrafts. The visit to the Concorde and the Airbus A300M are, simply speaking, espectacular. The kids will find it amazing and there are several displays explaining differents aspects of the aviation. For the grown ups, some words: Concorde, A300,",
          "This is a great museum, and the talks on Bleriot and Concorde are really interesting (only in French). I also enjoyed the interactive part, where you get to play the role of an airport organiser, making decisions on how to react to disruption. For the next few months, it's worth",
          "Nice collection of aircraft. You can go inside their Concorde, A300 and the cargo section of their Supper Guppy.",
          "This is a good day out and a worthwhile attraction to visit whilst in Toulouse. It can be combined with an \"Airbus Tour\" which is just across the road. We did the 'Airbus Tour\" on our last visit to Toulouse so didn't bother this time round but both on the same outing would be",
          "It is positive that this museum has been opened. But maybe visitors expect bit more. Museum exposition has just few aircraft from the long history of aircraft manufacturing in this region. It is a mixture of everything - aircraft models, audiovisual projects, technical details",
          "A rather small museum with lots of aviation packed inside. They have the first Concorde made, still with all the test equipment installed. There's plenty of other aircraft to see as well as a detailed history of Airbus. It's just a little pricey (11.50 Euro), but it's definitely",
          "We didn't have time to go on an Airbus factory tour, and it was suggested that a visit to aeroscopia may be a good alternative. It certainly was. There is a history of flying, along with information about the Airbus contribution to the history. There are also scale models of the",

          "In comparison with other aircraft and technical museums, Aeroscopia is rather small. But here you find a good variation between civil and military aircrafts. The kids had a lot of fun with the different electronic and mechanical exercises. Unfortunately you cannot enter the",
          "This is a respectable aviation museum although not a patch on the Museum of Flight in Seattle or the Smithsonian in Washington. It has some interesting aircraft but it's biggest weakness is that it is really about French aviation (in fact much of about Toulouse's contribution.)",
          "I went to the A380 tour at the Airbus Final Assembly Line (FAL) and to the museum afterwards. There is so much to see and learn. Great museum where you find two concordes, the planes I never saw in the sky :( I suggest you combine it with the A380 tour at Airbus.",
          "A half day is necessary to visit that interesting aircraft museum. Concorde,A300, Messerschmidtt 109, Mig 15, Caravelle and many others. A museum for the whole family.",
          "This aerospace museum opened in January 2015 and among its treasures are not one but two Concorde supersonic air frames. One in the hanger and you can walk both inside the plane and around the outside of it. The other is outside and only available for viewing the exterior. Other",
          "Great to experience the aviation history! Worth if you want to learn the history of flying or just to see Concorde ' face to face '",
          "It is long overdue to have a museum of aviation in Toulouse and this one is small but nicely built and presented. Outside standing guard is a Concorde and a Caravelle two icons of French aerospace. Easy to walk through, good parking space and right opposite the A380 factory.",
          "If You Like Aeroplanes this is a must. Also this is where you can book Tours of the Airbus Facility to see the Aircraft or the A380 being Built. There are about 20 planes here its well lit and very clean and well worth a look around",
          "Aeroscopia is supposed to be a museum about history of aviation and aircraft. Truth is this a museum about french aviation and airbus. The place is nice and there are some pretty cool stuff but it lacks animatiom. Even with the additon of the A400M to the Concorde the place is",
          "Spent a couple of hours here last week. Loads of things to see especially the first A300 every built and of course the Concorde and the amazing gubby. Very reasonable price to well worth a visit!.",
          "Tells the story aviation with focus on france and Airbus of course. All info is also in English. Great Concorde to walk inside. Very nice gift shop with lots of models and other cool stuff for the avgeek, not overpriced either. Gets one star less because it was missing two",
          "We visited Aeroscopia via tram. It is an easy and pleasant walk from the Beauzelle tram stop, through a new development of office buildings with a park in the middle. It is now cleary signed from the tram stop with new signage, and takes little more than 10 minutes. There are",
          "Having the trip last week and couldn't make a tour to \"lets visit airbus\" because It need to book advance for security reason so if you plan to visit this museum and the factory maybe you should call the museum for booked first. For young people who interesting on airplane, 2",
          "We visited this place on a saturday. No big queue though. The \"museum\" is set in a an aircraft hangar and gives a great look to the exhibition. Two levels : level 1 is a sort of gallery where you can Watch videos and read posters about the history of aircrafts. That's also where",
          "We were deterred from Airbus Factory Tour by the T A reviews and elected to go the new museum and are glad we did. Not surprisingly there is a French / Toulouse bias but if you accept this it was very interesting with access to a Concorde (for us the first time) and an Airbus",
          "This review isn't going to be laden with positives. First, there is only one sign post to Aeroscopia at the last roundabout before the entrance. The car park is as far away from the main entrance that is possible in the confines of the site. Ticket hall and sales are chaotic as",
          "We went with 2 children age 3 years old and 22 months old. Place was easy to find, parking was spacious and even an area to park your bicycle. Under 6 years old is free. The staff were friendly and spoke English. The Place is also wheelchair and stroller friendly. The planes",
          "Visited a week after it was opened with children 10 and 12. Thank you for having information written in English as well as French. This attraction has everything, history, planes to walk on, Concordes, computer games and lots more. After about 20 minutes the kids were bored",
          "Fantastic new museum! Lots to see and some unusual displays. The interactive displays were well thought through and interesting (displays all written in English and French). The Super Guppy was fascinating and was great to see inside Concorde. Great day out from Toulouse-"

        "wiki": "Toulouse (, too-LOOZ; French: [tuluz] (listen); Occitan: Tolosa [tu\u02c8luzo]; Latin: Tolosa [to\u02c8lo\u02d0sa]) is the capital of the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km (143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean and 680 km (420 mi) from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France, with 479,553 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (as of January 2017), and 1,360,829 inhabitants within its wider metropolitan area (also as of January 2017), after Paris, Lyon and Marseille, and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.\nToulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus (formerly EADS), the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It also hosts the European headquarters of Intel and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe. Thales Alenia Space, ATR, SAFRAN, Liebherr-Aerospace and Airbus Defence and Space also have a significant presence in Toulouse.\nThe University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 103,000 students, it is the fourth-largest university campus in France, after the universities of Paris, Lyon and Lille.The air route between Toulouse\u2013Blagnac and Paris Orly is the busiest in Europe, transporting 2.4 million passengers in 2014. According to the rankings of L'Express and Challenges, Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the Occitanie region, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.\nToulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname La Ville Rose (The Pink City).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nToulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nToulouse has a temperate humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified as a Mediterranean climate zone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age.\nThe historical name of the city, Tolosa (\u03a4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian, or from Iberian, but has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages.Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost.\nAfter the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city of Gallia Narbonensis. In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 (Battle of Vouill\u00e9).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n\n=== County of Toulouse ===\n\nThe town became the capital of the County of Toulouse during the Carolingian era.\nIn 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders.\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the military crusade, such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the Southern French Gothic.\nIn 1215 the Dominican Order was founded in Toulouse by Saint Dominic in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\nIn the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs, were started. They found home in Les Jacobins. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital.\n\n\n=== Within the Kingdom of France ===\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the kingdom of France and declared a \"royal city\". In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years. The Consistori del Gay Saber is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\nThe 14th century brought a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population by Crusaders in 1320, the Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years' War. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.The situation improved in the 15th century. Charles VII established the second parliament of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of pastel, a blue dye made from woad. The fortune generated by this international trade was at the origin of several of Toulouse's superb Renaissance mansions.\n\n\n=== Within the French Republic ===\nThe Battle of Toulouse (1814) was one of the final battles of the Napoleonic Wars, four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition.\nToulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by Marshal Soult.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of the city proper (French: commune) was 479,553 at the January 2017 census, with 1,360,829 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,187,686 at the January 2007 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area). Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.4% per year between 2007 and 2017, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2007 censuses.\nToulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\nFueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for metropolitan France), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.\nA local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Toulouse M\u00e9tropole ===\n\nThe Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Toulouse) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent communes, covering an area of 380 km2 (147 sq mi), totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communaut\u00e9 urbaine). This has become a m\u00e9tropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes.\n\n\n=== Local politics ===\n\nOne of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (Halle aux Grains) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (Z\u00e9nith, the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace was founded, etc.\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen.\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nToulouse has many interesting churches, but three of them are of remarkable architectural and historical interest.\nSaint-Sernin Basilica, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest remaining Romanesque church in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by Charlemagne to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\nCathedral of Saint Stephen is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\nThe convent of the Jacobins (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the Albi Cathedral, the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the Dominican order, for not having obtained the relics of Saint Dominic kept in Bologna, Pope Urban V made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar Saint Thomas Aquinas, one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Civilian buildings ===\n\nThe Capitole de Toulouse (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole (opera house). It is located on the Place du Capitole, a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (place royale). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th-century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (le donjon), which housed the archives of the Capitouls; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called h\u00f4tels particuliers) or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat, the H\u00f4tel de Bernuy, the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, the H\u00f4tel de Bagis...\n\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n\nThe banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the Pont-Neuf, it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the H\u00f4pital de La Grave. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe Jardin des Plantes is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a botanical garden (early 19th century).\nThe Cit\u00e9 de l'espace (Space City) is a theme park of space exploration.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nSights and monuments of Toulouse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe main industries are aeronautics, space, electronics, information technology and biotechnology. Toulouse hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320, A330, A350 and A380.  (A320 lines also exist in Hamburg, Germany, Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, USA.) Airbus has its head office in Blagnac, near Toulouse. Airbus's France division has its main office in Toulouse. Toulouse also hosts the headquarters of ATR, Sigfox, one of the two headquarters of Liebherr Aerospace and Groupe Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re.\nThe Concorde supersonic aircraft was also constructed in Toulouse.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nToulouse has the fourth-largest student population in France after Paris, Lyon and Lille with 103,000 students (2012).\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nThe University of Toulouse (Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse), established in 1229, is located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology\u2014inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts\u2014as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.\nCatholic University of Toulouse\nUniversit\u00e9 Toulouse I, Toulouse School of Economics, Toulouse School of Management and Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse\nUniversity of Toulouse-Jean Jaur\u00e8s (Formerly University of Toulouse II \u2013 Le Mirail)\nUniversit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III)Toulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:\n\nICAM Toulouse (Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers)\nINSA Toulouse\nISAE SUPAERO (Institut sup\u00e9rieur de l'a\u00e9ronautique et de l'espace)\nENAC (\u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile)\nINP ENSEEIHT (\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectronique, d'\u00c9lectrotechnique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique et des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications)\nENSFEA (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de formation de l\u2019enseignement agricole)\nINP ENSIACET (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs en art chimique et technologique)\nINP ENSAT ('\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure Agronomique de Toulouse)\nINP ENM (\u00c9cole Nationale de la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie)\nEPITA (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les techniques avanc\u00e9es)\nEPITECH (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies or European Institute of Information Technology)\nIPSA (Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avanc\u00e9es)\nEIPurpan (\u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Purpan)\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThe most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Sernin.\nInternational schools serving area expatriates are in nearby Colomiers:\n\nInternational School of Toulouse\nDeutsche Schule Toulouse (German school)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThe main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nIn addition to an extensive bus system, the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tired trains. Line A runs for 12.5 km (7.8 mi) from Balma-Gramont in the north-east to Basso Cambo in the south-west. Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaur\u00e8s.\nLine C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Ar\u00e8nes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named \"Gare des Capelles\", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened. Le TOEC station opened on 1 September 2003 with the creation of line C, allowing an urban train service in Toulouse and close western suburbs.Similarly, Line D runs south from Toulouse Matabiau to Muret.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\nThe tramway line T1 (operating since December 2010), runs from Beauzelle to Toulouse passing through Blagnac. All urban bus, metro and tram services are operated by Tiss\u00e9o.

        "wiki": "The term Black Madonna or Black Virgin tends to refer to statues or paintings in Western Christendom of the Blessed Virgin Mary and the Infant Jesus, where both figures are depicted as black. The Black Madonna can be found both in Catholic and Orthodox countries.\nThe paintings are usually icons which are Byzantine in origin or style, some made in 13th- or 14th-century Italy, others are older and from the Middle East, Caucasus or Africa, mainly Egypt and Ethiopia. Statues are often made of wood but occasionally made of stone, painted and up to 75 cm (30 in) tall. They fall into two main groups: free-standing upright figures or seated figures on a throne. There are about 400\u2013500 Black Madonnas in Europe, depending on how they are classified. There are at least 180 Vierges Noires in Southern France alone, and there are hundreds of non-medieval copies as well. Some are in museums, but most are in churches or shrines and are venerated by believers. Some are associated with miracles and attract substantial numbers of pilgrims.\nBlack Madonnas come in different forms, and the speculations behind the reason for the dark hue of each individual icon or statue vary greatly and are not without controversy. Though some Madonnas were originally black or brown when they were made, others have simply turned darker due to factors like ageing or candle smoke. The Jungian scholar, Ean Begg, has conducted a study into the potential pagan origins of the cult of the black madonna and child. Another speculated cause for the dark-skinned depiction is due to pre-Christian deities being re-envisioned as the Madonna and child.\n\n\n== Studies and research ==\nResearch into the Black Madonna phenomenon is limited due to a wide consensus among scholars that the dark-skinned aspect was unintentional. Begg has a different view: he links the recurring refrain from the Song of Solomon, \u2018I am black, but I am beautiful\u2019 to the Queen of Sheba. Recently, however, interest in this subject has gathered more momentum. \nImportant early studies of dark-skinned holy images in France were by Camille Flammarion (1888), Marie Durand-Lefebvre (1937), Emile Saillens (1945), and Jacques Huynen (1972). The first notable study of the origin and meaning of the Black Madonnas in English appears to have been presented by Leonard Moss at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science on December 28, 1952. Moss broke the images into three categories: (1) dark brown or black Madonnas with physiognomy and skin pigmentation matching that of the indigenous population; (2) various art forms that have turned black as a result of certain physical factors such as deterioration of lead-based pigments, accumulated smoke from the use of votive candles, and accumulation of grime over the ages, and (3) residual category with no ready explanation. In the cathedral at Chartres, there were two Black Madonnas: Notre Dame de Pilar, a 1508 dark walnut copy of a 13th-century silver Madonna, standing atop a high pillar, surrounded by candles; and Notre Dame de Sous-Terre, a replica of an original destroyed during the French Revolution. Restoration work on the cathedral resulted in the painting of Notre Dame de Pilar, to reflect an earlier 19th century painted style, rendering the statue no longer a \"Black Madonna\".Some scholars chose to investigate the significance of the dark-skinned complexion to pilgrims and worshipers rather than focus on whether or not this depiction was intentional. This is an important subject because many Black Madonnas turn the shrines in which they are housed into some of the most revered pilgrimage sites, by virtue of their presence. Monique Scheer, one of these scholars, attributes the importance of the dark-skinned depiction to its connection with authenticity. The reason for this connection is the perceived age of the figures and the idea that these depictions are more accurate to historical Mary, since many of the works are eastern in origin and since Mary herself likely had dark skin.\n\n\n== List of Black Madonnas ==\n\n\n=== Africa ===\n\nAlgeria, Algiers: \"Our Lady of Africa\"\nSenegal, Popenguine: \"Notre-Dame de la D\u00e9livrance\"\nSouth Africa, Soweto: \"The Black Madonna\"\n\n\n=== Asia ===\n\n\n==== Japan ====\nTsuruoka city, Yamagata prefecture: Tsuruoka Tenshud\u00f4 Catholic Church features a black Madonna statue given by France during Meiji period\n\n\n==== The Philippines ====\nAntipolo, Rizal: Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Paz y Buen Viaje de Antipolo (Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage of Antipolo)\nErmita, City of Manila: Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia (Our Lady of Guidance)\nLapu-Lapu, Cebu: Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Regla (Our Lady of the Rule)\nNaga, Camarines Sur: Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Pe\u00f1afrancia (Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia)\nPiat, Cagayan: Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Visitaci\u00f3n de Piat (Our Lady of Piat)\nJoroan, Tiwi, Albay: Mater Salutis (Mother of Our Salvation)\n\n\n=== Europe ===\n\n\n==== Belgium ====\nBrugge, \"Our Lady of Regla\"\nBrussels: \"De Zwerte Lieve Vrouwo\", St. Catherine Church\nHalle (Flemish Brabant) : Sint-Martinusbasiliek\nLi\u00e8ge: La Vierge Noire d'Outremeuse,\nLier: Onze lieve vrouw ter Gratien\nScherpenheuvel-Zichem: Our Lady of Scherpenheuvel\nTournai: Our Lady of Flanders in Tournai Cathedral\nVerviers: \"Black Virgin of the Recollects\", Notre-Dame des R\u00e9collets Church,\nWalcourt: (Notre-Dames de Walcourt)\n\n\n==== Greece ====\nHidden church of the Black Madonna, Vamos, Crete\n\n\n==== Croatia ====\nMarija Bistrica: Our Lady of Bistrica, Queen of Croatia\n\n\n==== Czech Republic ====\nBrno: Assumption of Virgin Mary Minor Basilica, St Thomas's Abbey, Brno\nPrague: The Madonna of Breznice; The Black Madonna in the Church Our Lady Under the Chain The Black Madonna on the House of the Black Madonna.\n\n\n==== France ====\n\nAix-en-Provence, (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne): Notre-Dame des Graces, Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Sauveur d'Aix\nArconsat: (Notre-Dame des Champs)\nAurillac, (Cantal): Notre-Dame des Neiges\nBeaune: Our Lady of Beaune\nBesan\u00e7on: Our Lady de Gray\nBesse-et-Saint-Anastaise,(Puy-de-D\u00f4me): Saint-Andr\u00e9 Church, Notre-Dame de Vassivi\u00e8re\nBourg-en-Bresse, (Ain): 13th century\nChartres, (Eure-et-Loir): crypt of the Cathedral of Chartres, Notre-Dame-de-Sous-Terre\nClermont-Ferrand, (Puy-de-D\u00f4me)\nCusset: the Black Virgin of Cusset\nDijon, (C\u00f4te-d'Or)\nDouvres-la-D\u00e9livrande, Basilique Notre-Dame de la D\u00e9livrande, \"Notre-Dame de la D\u00e9livrande\"\nDunkerque, (Nord) : Chapelle des Dunes\nGuingamp, (C\u00f4tes-d'Armor): Basilica of Notre Dame de Bon Secours.\nLa Chapelle-Geneste, (Haute-Loire: Notre Dame de La Chapelle Geneste\nLaon,(Aisne): Notre-Dame Cathedral, statue of 1848\n\nLe Havre,(Seine-Maritime): statue near the Graville Abbey (Abbaye de Graville)\nLe Puy-en-Velay: In 1254 when passing through on his return from the Holy Land Saint Louis IX of France gave the cathedral an ebony image of the Blessed Virgin clothed in gold brocade (Notre-Dame du Puy).

        "wiki": "The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and Franz Ferdinand's wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, occurred on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo when they were mortally wounded by Gavrilo Princip. Princip was one of a group of six assassins also containing Muhamed Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107, Vaso \u010cubrilovi\u0107, Nedeljko \u010cabrinovi\u0107, Cvjetko Popovi\u0107 and Trifun Grabe\u017e (one Bosniak and five Serbs consecutively) coordinated by Danilo Ili\u0107, a Bosnian Serb and a member of the Black Hand secret society. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia. The conspirators' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia. The assassination led directly to World War I when Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war on Serbia, triggering actions leading to war between most European states.\nThe Serbian military conspiracy was organized by Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107 with the assistance of Major Vojislav Tankosi\u0107 and spy Rade Malobabi\u0107. Tankosi\u0107 armed the assassins with bombs and pistols and trained them. The assassins were given access to the same clandestine network of safe-houses and agents that Malobabi\u0107 used for the infiltration of weapons and operatives into Austria-Hungary.\nThe assassins, the key members of the clandestine network, and the key Serbian military conspirators who were still alive were arrested, tried, convicted and punished. Those who were arrested in Bosnia were tried in Sarajevo in October 1914. The other conspirators were arrested and tried before a Serbian court on the French-controlled Salonika Front in 1916\u20131917 on unrelated false charges; Serbia executed three of the top military conspirators. Much of what is known about the assassinations comes from these two trials and related records.\nWhile various countries of the former Yugoslavia largely view Gavrilo Princip as a terrorist, the governments of Republika Srpska and Serbia continue to insist that Princip is a hero.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\nUnder the 1878 Treaty of Berlin, Austria-Hungary received the mandate to occupy and administer the Ottoman Vilayet of Bosnia, while the Ottoman Empire retained official sovereignty. Under this same treaty, the Great Powers (Austria-Hungary, the United Kingdom, France, the German Empire, Italy, and the Russian Empire) gave official recognition to the Principality of Serbia as a fully sovereign state, which four years later transformed into a kingdom under Prince Milan IV Obrenovi\u0107 who thus became King Milan I of Serbia. Serbia's monarchs, at the time from the royal House of Obrenovi\u0107 that maintained close relations with Austria-Hungary, were content to reign within the borders set by the treaty.This changed in May 1903, when Serbian military officers led by Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107 stormed the Serbian Royal Palace. After a fierce battle in the dark, the attackers captured General Laza Petrovi\u0107, head of the Palace Guard, and forced him to reveal the hiding place of King Alexander I Obrenovi\u0107 and his wife Queen Draga. The King and Queen opened the door from their hiding place. The King was shot thirty times; the Queen eighteen. MacKenzie writes that \"the royal corpses were then stripped and brutally sabred.\" The attackers threw the corpses of King Alexander and Queen Draga out of a palace window, ending any threat that loyalists would mount a counterattack.\" General Petrovi\u0107 was then killed when Vojislav Tankosi\u0107 organized the murders of Queen Draga's brothers. The conspirators installed Peter I of the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 as the new king.The new dynasty was more nationalist, friendlier to Russia and less friendly to Austria-Hungary. Over the next decade, disputes between Serbia and its neighbors erupted, as Serbia moved to build its power and gradually reclaim its 14th century empire. These conflicts included a customs dispute with Austria-Hungary beginning in 1906 (commonly referred to as the \"Pig War\"); the Bosnian crisis of 1908\u20131909, in which Serbia assumed an attitude of protest over Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (ending in Serbian acquiescence without compensation in March 1909); and finally the two Balkan Wars of 1912\u20131913, in which Serbia acquired Macedonia and Kosovo from the Ottoman Empire and drove out Bulgaria.\n\nSerbia's military successes and Serbian outrage over the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina emboldened Serbian nationalists in Serbia and Serbs in Austria-Hungary who chafed under Austro-Hungarian rule and whose nationalist sentiments were stirred by Serb \"cultural\" organizations. One notable example was a Serbian nationalist society Narodna Odbrana, which was formed in Belgrade on 8 October 1908 under the initiative of Milovan Milovanovi\u0107. Under the guise of cultural activities, it operated to undermine the loyalty of Serbs in Austria-Hungary to the Habsburg regime. In the five years leading up to 1914, lone assassins \u2013 mostly Serb citizens of Austria-Hungary \u2013 made a series of unsuccessful assassination attempts in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina against Austro-Hungarian officials. In Bosnia-Herzegovina, there existed a local revolutionary movement known as Young Bosnia, whose goal was the dissolution of Austria-Hungary.On 3 June 1910, Bogdan \u017deraji\u0107, a member of the Young Bosnia movement, attempted to kill the Austrian governor of Bosnia-Herzegovina, General Marijan Vare\u0161anin. \u017deraji\u0107 was a 22-year-old Orthodox Serb from Nevesinje, Herzegovina, who was a student at the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb and made frequent trips to Belgrade. (General Vere\u0161anin went on to crush the last Bosnian peasant uprising in the second half of 1910). The five bullets \u017deraji\u0107 fired at Vare\u0161anin and the fatal bullet he put in his own brain made \u017deraji\u0107 an inspiration to future assassins, including Princip and Princip's accomplice \u010cabrinovi\u0107. Princip said that \u017deraji\u0107 \"was my first model. When I was seventeen I passed whole nights at his grave, reflecting on our wretched condition and thinking of him. It is there that I made up my mind sooner or later to perpetrate an outrage.\"In May 1911, the Black Hand, a secret society dedicated to create a Greater Serbia through \"terrorist action\", was established by key members of the Narodna Odbrana including Dimitrijevi\u0107 and Tankosi\u0107. Within Bosnia-Herzegovina, the networks of both the Black Hand and Narodna Odbrana penetrated local revolutionary movements such as Young Bosnia.In 1913, Emperor Franz Joseph commanded Archduke Franz Ferdinand to observe the military maneuvers in Bosnia scheduled for June 1914. Following the maneuvers, Ferdinand and his wife planned to visit Sarajevo to open the state museum in its new premises there. Duchess Sophie, according to their eldest son, Duke Maximilian, accompanied her husband out of fear for his safety.As Sophie, although of high aristocratic birth, was not from a dynastic family, her union with the Habsburg heir presumptive could only be a morganatic marriage. Emperor Franz Joseph had only consented to their marriage on the condition that their descendants would never ascend the throne. The 14th anniversary of their marriage fell on 28 June. As historian A. J. P. Taylor observes:\n\n[Sophie] could never share [Franz Ferdinand's] rank ... could never share his splendours, could never even sit by his side on any public occasion. There was one loophole ... his wife could enjoy the recognition of his rank when he was acting in a military capacity. Hence, he decided, in 1914, to inspect the army in Bosnia. There, at its capital Sarajevo, the Archduke and his wife could ride in an open carriage side by side ... Thus, for love, did the Archduke go to his death.\nFranz Ferdinand was an advocate of increased federalism and widely believed to favor trialism, under which Austria-Hungary would be reorganized by combining the Slavic lands within the Austro-Hungarian empire into a third crown. A Slavic kingdom could have been a bulwark against Serb irredentism, and Franz Ferdinand was therefore perceived as a threat by those same irredentists. Princip later stated to the court that preventing Franz Ferdinand's planned reforms was one of his motivations.The day of the assassination, 28 June (15 June in the Julian calendar), is the feast of St. Vitus. In Serbia, it is called Vidovdan and commemorates the 1389 Battle of Kosovo against the Ottomans, at which the Sultan was assassinated in his tent by a Serb.\n\n\n== Preliminaries ==\n\n\n=== Planning direct action ===\nDanilo Ili\u0107 was a Bosnian Orthodox Serb. He had worked as a school teacher and as a bank worker but in 1913 and 1914 he lived with, and outwardly off, his mother, who operated a small boarding house in Sarajevo. Secretly, Ili\u0107 was leader of the Serbian-irredentist Black Hand cell in Sarajevo. In late 1913, Danilo Ili\u0107 came to the Serbian listening post at U\u017eice to speak to the officer in charge, Serbian Colonel C. A. Popovi\u0107, who was a captain at the time and a member of the Black Hand. Ili\u0107 recommended an end to the period of revolutionary organization building and a move to direct action against Austria-Hungary. Popovi\u0107 passed Danilo Ili\u0107 on to Belgrade to discuss this matter with Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence Colonel Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107, known more commonly as Apis. By 1913, Apis and his fellow military conspirators (drawn heavily from the ranks of the May 1903 coup) had come to dominate what was left of the Black Hand.There are no reports as to what took place between Ili\u0107 and Apis, but soon after their meeting, Apis's righthand man and fellow Black Hander, Serbian Major Vojislav Tankosi\u0107, who by this time was in charge of guerrilla training, called a Serbian irredentist planning meeting in Toulouse, France. Amongst those summoned to the Toulouse meeting was Muhamed Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107, a carpenter by trade and son of an impoverished Muslim noble from Herzegovina. He too was a member of the Black Hand, having been sworn into the organization by Black Hand Provincial Director for Bosnia-Herzegovina Vladimir Gacinovi\u0107 and Danilo Ili\u0107. Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 was (here quoting Albertini paraphrasing Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107) \"eager to carry out an act of terrorism to revive the revolutionary spirit of Bosnia.\" During this January 1914 meeting, various possible Austro-Hungarian targets for assassination were discussed, including Franz Ferdinand. However, the participants decided only to dispatch Mehmed Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 to Sarajevo, to kill the Governor of Bosnia, Oskar Potiorek.While Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 was travelling to Bosnia-Herzegovina from France, police searched his train for a thief. Thinking the police might be after him, he threw his weapons (a dagger and a bottle of poison) out the train window. Once he arrived in Bosnia-Herzegovina he had to set about looking for replacement weapons.\n\n\n=== Franz Ferdinand chosen ===\nThe search for new weapons delayed Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107's attempt on Potiorek. Before Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 was ready to act, Ili\u0107 summoned him to Mostar. On 26 March 1914, Ili\u0107 informed Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 that Belgrade had scrapped the mission to kill the governor. The plan now was to murder Franz Ferdinand, and Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 should stand by for the new operation. (Apis confessed to the Serbian Court that he ordered the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in his position as head of the Intelligence Department.)Ili\u0107 recruited the Serbian youths Vaso \u010cubrilovi\u0107 and Cvjetko Popovi\u0107 shortly after Easter (Orthodox Easter as given by Dedijer: 19 April 1914), for the assassination, as evidenced by the testimony of Ili\u0107, \u010cubrilovi\u0107, and Popovi\u0107 at the Sarajevo trial. Three youths \u2013 Gavrilo Princip, Trifko Grabe\u017e, and Nedeljko \u010cabrinovi\u0107 \u2013 Bosnian Serb subjects of Austria-Hungary, living in Belgrade, testified at the Sarajevo trial that at about the same time (a little after Easter), they were eager to carry out an assassination and approached a fellow Bosnian Serb and former guerrilla fighter known to be well connected and with access to arms, Milan Ciganovi\u0107, and through him Major Tankosi\u0107 and reached an agreement to transport arms to Sarajevo and participate in the assassination.\nAgreement in principle was quickly reached, but delivery of the weapons was delayed for more than a month. The assassins would meet with Ciganovi\u0107 and he would put them off. At one point, Ciganovi\u0107 told Grabe\u017e: \"Nothing doing, the old Emperor is ill and the Heir Apparent  [sic] will not go to Bosnia.\" When Emperor Franz Joseph's health recovered the operation was a \"go\" again. Tankosi\u0107 gave the assassins one FN Model 1910 pistol. They practiced shooting a few rounds of scarce and expensive .380 ACP pistol ammunition in a park near Belgrade.The rest of the weapons were finally delivered on 26 May. The three assassins from Belgrade testified that Major Tankosi\u0107, directly and through Ciganovi\u0107, not only provided six hand grenades and four new Browning FN Model 1910 automatic pistols with .380 ACP ammunition, but also money, suicide pills, training, a special map with the location of gendarmes marked, knowledge of contacts on a clandestine tunnel used to infiltrate agents and arms into Austria-Hungary, and a small card authorizing the use of that tunnel. Major Tankosi\u0107 confirmed to the journalist and historian Luciano Magrini that he provided the bombs and pistols and was responsible for training Princip, Grabe\u017e, and \u010cabrinovi\u0107 and that he (Tankosi\u0107) initiated the idea of the suicide pills.\n\n\n=== Tunnel ===\n\nPrincip, Grabe\u017e, and \u010cabrinovi\u0107 left Belgrade by boat on 28 May and traveled along the Sava River to \u0160abac where they handed the small card to Captain Popovi\u0107 of the Serbian Border Guard. Popovi\u0107, in turn, provided them with a letter to Serbian Captain Prvanovi\u0107, and filled out a form with the names of three customs officials whose identities they could assume and thereby receive discounted train tickets for the ride to Loznica, a small border town.When Princip, Grabe\u017e, and \u010cabrinovi\u0107 reached Loznica on 29 May, Captain Prvanovi\u0107 summoned three of his revenue sergeants to discuss the best way to cross the border undetected. While waiting for the sergeants to arrive, Princip and Grabe\u017e had a falling out with \u010cabrinovi\u0107 over \u010cabrinovi\u0107's repeated violations of operational security. \u010cabrinovi\u0107 handed over the weapons he was carrying to Princip and Grabe\u017e. Princip told \u010cabrinovi\u0107 to go alone to Zvornik, make an official crossing there using Grabe\u017e's ID card and then go on to Tuzla and link back up.On the morning of 30 May Prvanovi\u0107's revenue sergeants assembled and Sergeant Budivoj Grbi\u0107 accepted the task and led Princip and Grabe\u017e by foot to Isakovi\u0107's Island, a small island in the middle of the Drina River that separated Serbia from Bosnia. They and their weapons reached the island on 31 May. Grbi\u0107 passed the terrorists and their weapons to the agents of the Serbian Narodna Odbrana for transport into Austro-Hungarian territory and from safe-house to safe-house. Princip and Grabe\u017e crossed into Austria-Hungary on the evening of 1 June. Princip and Grabe\u017e and the weapons were passed from agent to agent until on 3 June they arrived in Tuzla. They left the weapons in the hands of the Narodna Odbrana agent Mi\u0161ko Jovanovi\u0107 and rejoined \u010cabrinovi\u0107.The Narodna Odbrana agents reported their activities to the Narodna Odbrana President, Bo\u017ea Jankovi\u0107, who in turn reported to the then Serbian Caretaker Prime Minister Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107. The report to Pa\u0161i\u0107 added the name of a new military conspirator, Serbian Major Kosta Todorovi\u0107, Boundary Commissioner and Director of Serbian Military Intelligence Services for the frontier line from Rada to Ljubovija. Pa\u0161i\u0107's handwritten notes from the briefing (estimated by Dedijer to have taken place on 5 June) included the nickname of one of the assassins (\"Trifko\" Grabe\u017e) and also the name of Major Tankosi\u0107. The Austrians later captured the report, Pa\u0161i\u0107's handwritten notes, and additional corroborating documents.\u010cabrinovi\u0107's father was a Sarajevo police official. In Tuzla, \u010cabrinovi\u0107 bumped into one of his father's friends, Sarajevo Police Detective Ivan Vila, and struck up a conversation. By coincidence, Princip, Grabe\u017e and \u010cabrinovi\u0107 boarded the same train for Sarajevo as Detective Vila. \u010cabrinovi\u0107 inquired of the detective the date of Franz Ferdinand's visit to Sarajevo. The next morning, \u010cabrinovi\u0107 passed on the news to his fellow assassins that the assassination would be on 28 June.On arriving in Sarajevo on 4 June, Princip, Grabe\u017e, and \u010cabrinovi\u0107 went their separate ways. Princip checked in with Ili\u0107, visited his family in Had\u017eici and returned to Sarajevo on 6 June taking up residence at Ili\u0107's mother's house with Ili\u0107. Grabe\u017e joined his family in Pale. \u010cabrinovi\u0107 moved back into his father's house in Sarajevo.On 14 June, Ili\u0107 went to Tuzla to bring the weapons to Sarajevo. Mi\u0161ko Jovanovi\u0107 hid the weapons in a large box of sugar. On 15 June, the two went separately by train to Doboj where Jovanovi\u0107 handed off the box to Ili\u0107. Later that day, Ili\u0107 returned to Sarajevo by train, being careful to transfer to a local train outside Sarajevo and then quickly transfer to a tram to avoid police detection. Once at his mother's house, Ili\u0107 hid the weapons in a suitcase under a sofa. Then, on approximately 17 June, Ili\u0107 traveled to Brod (Dedijer puts it on 16 June, but trial records put it on 18 June). Questioned at trial, Ili\u0107 gave a confused explanation of the reason for his trip, first saying he had gone to Brod to prevent the assassination and then saying he had returned to Sarajevo from Brod to prevent the assassination. Dedijer puts forward the thesis (citing Bogijevi\u0107) that Ili\u0107 went to Brod to meet an emissary of Apis, Djuro \u015carac, who had instructions to cancel the assassination and then later Rade Malobabi\u0107 was dispatched from Serbia to Sarajevo to reauthorize the assassination.\n\n\n=== Eve of the attacks ===\nIli\u0107 began handing out the weapons on 27 June. Until 27 June Ili\u0107 had kept the identities of the assassins from Belgrade secret from those he had recruited locally and vice versa. Then, that night, as Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 told Albertini:  \"On the eve of the outrage Ili\u0107 introduced me to Princip in a Sarajevo caf\u00e9 with the words 'Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 who to-morrow is to be with us.'\" The three sent a postcard to Black Hand Provincial Director for Bosnia-Herzegovina Vladimir Ga\u0107inovi\u0107 in France.The following morning, on 28 June 1914, Ili\u0107 positioned the six assassins along the motorcade route. Ili\u0107 walked the street, exhorting the assassins to bravery.\n\n\n== Assassination ==\n\n\n=== Motorcade ===\nOn the morning of 28 June 1914, Franz Ferdinand and his party proceeded by train from Ilid\u017ea Spa to Sarajevo. Governor Oskar Potiorek met the party at Sarajevo station. Six automobiles were waiting. By mistake, three local police officers got into the first car with the chief officer of special security; the special security officers who were supposed to accompany their chief got left behind. The second car carried the Mayor and the Chief of Police of Sarajevo. The third car in the motorcade was a Gr\u00e4f & Stift 28/32 PS open sports car with its top folded down. Franz Ferdinand, Sophie, Governor Potiorek, and Lieutenant Colonel Count Franz von Harrach rode in this third car. The motorcade's first stop on the preannounced program was for a brief inspection of a military barracks. According to the program, at 10:00 a.m., the motorcade was to leave the barracks for the town hall by way of the Appel Quay.Security arrangements within Sarajevo were limited. The local military commander, General Michael von Appel, proposed that troops line the intended route but was told that this would offend the loyal citizenry. Protection for the visiting party was accordingly left to the Sarajevo police, of whom only about 60 were on duty on the Sunday of the visit.\n\n\n=== Bombing ===\n\nThe motorcade passed the first assassin, Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107. Danilo Ili\u0107 had placed him in front of the garden of the Mostar Cafe and armed him with a bomb. Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 failed to act. Ili\u0107 had placed Vaso \u010cubrilovi\u0107 next to Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107, arming him with a pistol and a bomb. He too failed to act. Further along the route, Ili\u0107 had placed Nedeljko \u010cabrinovi\u0107 on the opposite side of the street near the Miljacka River, arming him with a bomb.\nAt 10:10 am, Franz Ferdinand's car approached and \u010cabrinovi\u0107 threw his bomb. The bomb bounced off the folded back convertible cover into the street. The bomb's timed detonator caused it to explode under the next car, putting that car out of action, leaving a 1-foot-diameter (0.30 m), 6.5-inch-deep (170 mm) crater, and wounding 16\u201320 people.\u010cabrinovi\u0107 swallowed his cyanide pill and jumped into the Miljacka river. \u010cabrinovi\u0107's suicide attempt failed, as the old cyanide only induced vomiting, and the Miljacka was only 13 cm deep due to the hot, dry summer. Police dragged \u010cabrinovi\u0107 out of the river, and he was severely beaten by the crowd before being taken into custody.\nThe procession sped away towards the Town Hall leaving the disabled car behind. Cvjetko Popovi\u0107, Gavrilo Princip, and Trifun Grabe\u017e failed to act as the motorcade passed them at high speed.\n\n\n=== Town Hall reception ===\n\nArriving at the Town Hall for a scheduled reception, Franz Ferdinand showed understandable signs of stress, interrupting a prepared speech of welcome by Mayor Fehim Cur\u010di\u0107 to protest: \"Mr. Mayor, I came here on a visit and I am greeted with bombs. It is outrageous.\" Duchess Sophie then whispered into Franz Ferdinand's ear, and after a pause, Franz Ferdinand said to the mayor: \"Now you may speak.\" He then became calm and the mayor gave his speech. Franz Ferdinand had to wait as his own speech, still wet with blood from being in the damaged car, was brought to him. To the prepared text he added a few remarks about the day's events thanking the people of Sarajevo for their ovations \"as I see in them an expression of their joy at the failure of the attempt at assassination.\"Officials and members of the Archduke's party discussed what to do next. The archduke's chamberlain, Baron Rumerskirch, proposed that the couple remain at the Town Hall until troops could be brought into the city to line the streets. Governor-General Oskar Potiorek vetoed this suggestion on the grounds that soldiers coming straight from maneuvers would not have the dress uniforms appropriate for such duties. \"Do you think that Sarajevo is full of assassins?\" he concluded.Franz Ferdinand and Sophie gave up their planned program in favor of visiting the wounded from the bombing, at the hospital. Count Harrach took up a position on the left-hand running board of Franz Ferdinand's car to protect the Archduke from any assault from the riverside of the street. This is confirmed by photographs of the scene outside the Town Hall. At 10:45 a.m, Franz Ferdinand and Sophie got back into the motorcade, once again in the third car. In order to ensure the safety of the couple, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the imperial motorcade should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital so that they could avoid the crowded city center. However, Potiorek failed to communicate his decision to the drivers. As a result, the Archduke's driver, Leopold Lojka, took a right turn at the Latin Bridge just as the two drivers ahead of him. According to the historian Joachim Remak, the reason for this is that Potiorek's aide Eric(h) von Merrizzi was in the hospital, and was therefore unable to give Lojka the information about the change in plans and the driving route. The Sarajevo Chief of Police Edmund Gerde, who had earlier repeatedly warned Potiorek of insufficient security precautions for the imperial visit, was asked by one of the Archduke\u2019s aides to tell the drivers of the new route, but in the confusion and tensions of the moment, he neglected to do so.\n\n\n=== Fatal shooting ===\n\nAfter learning that the first assassination attempt had been unsuccessful, Princip thought about a position to assassinate the Archduke on his return journey, and decided to move to a position in front of a nearby food shop (Schiller's delicatessen), near the Latin Bridge. At this point, the first and second cars of the Archduke's motorcade suddenly turned right into a side street, leaving the Appel Quay. When the Archduke\u2019s driver followed their route, Governor Potiorek, who was sharing the third vehicle with the Imperial couple, called out to the driver to stop as he was going the wrong way. As the driver applied the brakes to stop the car close to where Princip was standing, the assassin stepped up to the footboard of the car, and shot Franz Ferdinand and Sophie at point\u2010blank range using a Belgian-made Fabrique Nationale model 1910 .380 caliber pistol. Pistol serial numbers 19074, 19075, 19120 and 19126 were supplied to the assassins; Princip used #19074. According to Albertini, \"the first bullet wounded the Archduke in the jugular vein, the second inflicted an abdominal wound on the Duchess.\" Princip tried to shoot himself, but was immediately seized and arrested. At his sentencing, Princip stated that his intention had been to kill Governor Potiorek, rather than Sophie.After being shot, Sophie immediately fell unconscious and collapsed onto Franz Ferdinand\u2019s legs. The Archduke, too, lost consciousness while being driven to the Governor's residence for medical treatment. As reported by Count Harrach, Franz Ferdinand's last words were \"Sophie, Sophie! Don't die! Live for our children!\" followed by six or seven utterances of \"It is nothing,\" in response to Harrach's inquiry as to Franz Ferdinand's injury. These utterances were followed by a violent choking sound caused by hemorrhage. The imperial couple were dead by 11:30 a.m on 28 June 1914; Sophie was dead on arrival at the Governor's residence, and Franz Ferdinand died 10 minutes later.\n\n\n=== Funeral ===\nThe bodies were transported to Trieste by the battleship SMS Viribus Unitis and then to Vienna by special train. Even though most foreign royalty had planned to attend, they were pointedly disinvited and the funeral was just the immediate imperial family, with the dead couple's three children excluded from the few public ceremonies. The officer corps was forbidden to salute the funeral train, and this led to a minor revolt led by Archduke Karl, the new heir presumptive. The public viewing of the coffins was curtailed severely and even more scandalously, Montenuovo tried unsuccessfully to make the children foot the bill. The Archduke and Duchess were interred at Artstetten Castle because the Duchess could not be buried in the Imperial Crypt.\n\n\n=== Aftermath ===\n\nAll of the assassins were eventually caught. Those in Austro-Hungarian custody were tried together with members of the infiltration route who had helped deliver them and their weapons to Sarajevo. Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 was arrested in Montenegro, but was allowed to \"escape\" to Serbia where he joined Major Tankosi\u0107's auxiliaries, but in 1916 Serbia imprisoned him on other false charges (see criminal penalty section below).\nAnti-Serb rioting broke out in Sarajevo and various other places within Austria-Hungary in the hours following the assassination until order was restored by the military. On the night of the assassination, country-wide anti-Serb pogroms and demonstrations were also organized in other parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, particularly on the territory of modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. They were organized and stimulated by Oskar Potiorek, the Austro-Hungarian governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first anti-Serb demonstrations, led by the followers of Josip Frank, were organized in early evening of 28 June in Zagreb. The following day, anti-Serb demonstrations in Sarajevo became more violent and could be characterized as a pogrom. The police and local authorities in the city did nothing to prevent anti-Serb violence. Writer Ivo Andri\u0107 referred to the violence in Sarajevo as the \"Sarajevo frenzy of hate.\" Two Serbs were killed on the first day of pogrom in Sarajevo, many were attacked, while around 1,000 houses, shops, schools and institutions (such as banks, hotels, printing houses) owned by Serbs were razed or pillaged.Following the assassination, Franz Joseph's daughter, Marie Valerie, noted that her father expressed his greater confidence in the new heir presumptive, his grandnephew Archduke Charles. The emperor admitted to his daughter, regarding the assassination: \"For me, it is a relief from a great worry.\"\n\n\n== Trials and punishment ==\n\n\n=== Sarajevo trial (October 1914) ===\n\nAustro-Hungarian authorities arrested and prosecuted the Sarajevo assassins (except for Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 who had escaped to Montenegro and was released from police custody there to Serbia) together with the agents and peasants who had assisted them on their way. The majority of the defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit high treason involving official circles in the Kingdom of Serbia. Conspiracy to commit high treason carried a maximum sentence of death which conspiracy to commit simple murder did not. The trial was held from 12 to 23 October with the verdict and sentences announced on 28 October 1914.The adult defendants, facing the death penalty, portrayed themselves at trial as unwilling participants in the conspiracy. The examination of defendant Veljko Cubrilovi\u0107 (who helped coordinate the transport of the weapons and was a Narodna Odbrana agent) is illustrative of this effort. Cubrilovi\u0107 stated to the court:  \"Princip glared at me and very forcefully said 'If you want to know, it is for that reason and we are going to carry out an assassination of the Heir and if you know about it, you have to be quiet. If you betray it, you and your family will be destroyed.'\" Under questioning by defense counsel Cubrilovi\u0107 described in more detail the basis of the fears that he said had compelled him to cooperate with Princip and Grabe\u017e.\" Cubrilovi\u0107 explained that he was afraid a revolutionary organization capable of committing great atrocities stood behind Princip and that he therefore feared his house would be destroyed and his family killed if he did not comply and explained that he knew such an organization existed in Serbia, at least at one time. When pressed for why he risked the punishment of the law, and did not take the protection of the law against these threats he responded: \"I was more afraid of terror than the law.\" Another Narodna Odbrana agent, Mihajlo Jovanovi\u0107, also claimed to have been against the assassination.In order to refute the charge, the conspirators from Belgrade, who because of their youth did not face the death penalty, focused during the trial on putting blame on themselves and deflecting it from official Serbia and modified their court testimony from their prior depositions accordingly. Princip stated under cross examination: \"I am a Yugoslav nationalist and I believe in unification of all South Slavs in whatever form of state and that it be free of Austria.\" Princip was then asked how he intended to realize his goal and responded: \"By means of terror.\" Cabrinovi\u0107, though, testified that the political views that motivated him to kill Franz Ferdinand were views held in the circles he traveled in within Serbia. The court did not believe the defendants' stories claiming to hold official Serbia blameless. The verdict ran: \"The court regards it as proved by the evidence that both the Narodna Odbrana and military circles in the Kingdom of Serbia in charge of the espionage service, collaborated in the outrage.\"Prison terms, death sentences and acquittals were as follows:\nAt trial \u010cabrinovi\u0107 had expressed his regrets for the murders. Following sentencing, \u010cabrinovi\u0107 received a letter of complete forgiveness from the three young children the assassins had orphaned. \u010cabrinovi\u0107 and Princip died of tuberculosis in prison. Those under the age of 20 years at the time of the crime could receive a maximum sentence of 20 years under Austrian-Hungarian law. The court heard arguments regarding Princip's age, as there was some doubt as to his true date of birth but concluded that Princip was under 20 at the time of the assassination. Because Bosnia and Herzegovina had not yet been assigned to Austria or to Hungary, the Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister administered Bosnia and Herzegovina and had responsibility for recommending clemency to the Kaiser.\n\n\n=== Salonika trial (spring 1917) ===\nIn late 1916 and early 1917, secret peace talks took place between Austria-Hungary and France. There is circumstantial evidence that parallel discussions were held between Austria-Hungary and Serbia with Prime Minister Pa\u0161i\u0107 dispatching his righthand man Stojan Proti\u0107 and Regent Alexander dispatching his confidant Colonel Petar \u017divkovi\u0107 to Geneva on secret business. Charles I of Austria laid out Austria-Hungary's key demand for returning Serbia to the control of the Serbian Government in exile: that Serbia should provide guarantees that there be no further political agitation emanating from Serbia against Austria-Hungary.\n\nFor some time, Regent Alexander and officers loyal to him had planned to get rid of the military clique headed by Apis as Apis represented a political threat to Alexander's power. The Austro-Hungarian peace demand gave added impetus to this plan. On 15 March 1917 Apis and the officers loyal to him were indicted, on various false charges unrelated to Sarajevo (the case was retried before the Supreme Court of Serbia in 1953 and all defendants were exonerated), by Serbian Court Martial on the French-controlled Salonika front. On 23 May Apis and eight of his associates were sentenced to death; two others were sentenced to 15 years in prison. One defendant died during the trial and the charges against him were dropped. The Serbian High Court reduced the number of death sentences to seven. Regent Alexander commuted four of the remaining death sentences, leaving just three death sentences in place.\nAmongst those tried, four of the defendants had confessed their roles in Sarajevo and their final sentences were as follows:\nIn justifying the executions, Prime Minister Pa\u0161i\u0107 wrote to his envoy in London:\"...Dimitrijevi\u0107 (Apis) besides everything else admitted he had ordered Franz Ferdinand to be killed. And now who could reprieve them?\"As the three condemned men were driven to their execution, Apis remarked to the driver \"Now it is clear to me and clear to you too, that I am to be killed today by Serbian rifles solely because I organized the Sarajevo outrage.Vojislav Tankosi\u0107 died in battle in late 1915 and so was not put on trial.\n\n\n== Controversy about responsibility ==\n\n\n=== Serbia's \"warning\" to Austria-Hungary ===\nFollowing the assassinations, Serbian Ambassador to France Milenko Vesni\u0107 and Serbian Ambassador to Russia Miroslav Spalajkovi\u0107 put out statements claiming that Serbia had warned Austria-Hungary of the impending assassination. Serbia soon thereafter denied making warnings and denied knowledge of the plot. Prime Minister Pa\u0161i\u0107 himself made these denials to Az Est on 7 July and to the Paris Edition of the New York Herald on 20 July. Other voices eventually spoke out on the \"warning\". As Serbian Education Minister Ljuba Jovanovi\u0107 wrote in Krv Sloventsva, in late May or early June, Prime Minister Pa\u0161i\u0107 reviewed the plot of the impending assassination with members of his cabinet. On 18 June, a telegram, lacking in specifics, ordered Serbia's Ambassador to Vienna, Jovan Jovanovi\u0107, to warn Austria-Hungary that Serbia had reason to believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate Franz Ferdinand in Bosnia. On 21 June, Ambassador Jovanovi\u0107 met with Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister Bilinski. According to Serbian Military Attach\u00e9 to Vienna, Colonel Lesanin, Ambassador Jovanovi\u0107, spoke to Bilinski and \"...stressed in general terms the risks the Archduke heir apparent  [sic] might run from the inflamed public opinion in Bosnia and Serbia. Some serious personal misadventure might befall him. His journey might give rise to incidents and demonstrations that Serbia would deprecate but that would have fatal repercussions on Austro-Serbian relations.\" Jovanovi\u0107 came back from the meeting with Bilinski and told Lesanin that \"...Bilinski showed no sign of attaching great importance to the total message and dismissed it limiting himself to remarking when saying goodbye and thanking him:  'Let us hope nothing does happen.'\" The Austro-Hungarian Finance Minister took no action based on Jovanovi\u0107's remarks.\nIn 1924 J. Jovanovi\u0107 went public stating that his warning had been made on his own initiative, and what he said was that \"Among the Serb youths (in the army) there may be one who will put a ball-cartridge in his rifle or revolver in place of a blank cartridge and he may fire it, the bullet might strike the man giving provocation (Franz Ferdinand).\" J. Jovanovi\u0107's account changed back and forth over the years and never adequately addressed Colonel Lesanin's statement.  Bilinski did not speak openly on the subject, but his press department chief confirmed that a meeting had taken place including a vague warning, but there was no mention of an ethnic Serb Austro-Hungarian soldier shooting Franz Ferdinand.In the days leading up to the assassination, Pa\u0161i\u0107 was caretaker prime minister because during this period the Serbian Government briefly fell to a political alliance led by the Serbian Military. The military favored promoting Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 to Foreign Minister, and Jovanovi\u0107's loyalties one might expect to have been divided and his orders therefore carried out poorly. By choosing a military loyalist to convey the message, and by not including any of the specifics such as the conspirators' names and weapons, Pa\u0161i\u0107, a survivor, hedged his bets against the various possible outcomes and consequences of the impending assassination.\n\n\n=== Rade Malobabi\u0107 ===\nIn 1914, Rade Malobabi\u0107 was Serbian Military Intelligence's chief undercover operative against Austria-Hungary. His name appeared in Serbian documents captured by Austria-Hungary during the war. These documents describe the running of arms, munitions, and agents from Serbia into Austria-Hungary under Malobabi\u0107's direction.Owing to the suppression by Serbia of Apis's confession and of the Salonika trial transcripts historians did not initially link Malobabi\u0107 closely to the Sarajevo attack. Apis's confession, however, states that \"I engaged Malobabi\u0107 to organize the assassination on the occasion of the announced arrival of Franz Ferdinand to Sarajevo.\" At the Salonika trial, Colonel Ljubomir Vulovi\u0107 (head of the Serbian Frontiers Service) testified:  'In 1914 on occasion of my official trip from Loznica to Belgrade, I received a letter at the General Staff [signed by Marshal Putnik, Serbia's top military officer] noting that agents of Malobabi\u0107 would come and a teacher whose name I don't recall (Danilo Ili\u0107 was a teacher but it is unclear if the teacher in question was Ili\u0107 as Ili\u0107 can be placed in Brod but not Loznica) so I could sent  [sic] them into Bosnia.' Because of that 'I went to Loznica and either that day or very soon afterwards sent Rade and that teacher into Bosnia.'  Soon thereafter occurred the Sarajevo assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\" On the eve of his execution, Malobabi\u0107 told a priest: \"They ordered me to go to Sarajevo when that assassination was to take place, and when everything was over, they ordered me to come back and fulfill other missions, and then there was the outbreak of the war.\" Vladimir Dedijer in The Road to Sarajevo presented additional testimonial evidence that Malobabi\u0107 arrived in Sarajevo on the eve of the Sarajevo attack and gave the final go ahead for the operation to Danilo Ili\u0107. This meshes with Dedijer's theory that Djuro \u015carac had given instructions to Ili\u0107 on 16 June cancelling the assassination. Soon after their confessions, Serbia executed Malobabi\u0107, Vulovi\u0107, and Apis on false charges. Serbia published no clarifications of their confessions with regards to the Sarajevo attack.\n\n\n=== \"Black Hand\" or Serbian military intelligence? ===\n\nAn alternative theory to the Sarajevo attack being a Serbian Military Intelligence Operation was that it was a \"Black Hand\" operation. The \"Black Hand\" was a Serbian military society formed on 9 May 1911 by officers in the Army of the Kingdom of Serbia, originating in the conspiracy group that assassinated the Serbian royal couple in May 1903, led by captain Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107 (Commonly referred to as \"Apis\").After Serbia's victory over Bulgaria in Macedonia in the Balkan Wars, the \"Black Hand\" became moribund because of the death of its president and the failure to replace him, an inactive secretary, casualties, broken links between its three-man cells, and a drying up of funding. By 1914 the \"Black Hand\" was no longer operating under its constitution but rather as a creature of the Chief of Serbian Military Intelligence, Apis, and its active ranks were composed mostly of Serbian officers loyal to Apis. Apis's confession to ordering the operation that begins with the phrase \"As the Chief of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff\", the fact that the military chain of command was invoked, the moribund nature of the \"Black Hand\" and the fact that under the \"Black Hand\" constitution Article 16, such an assassination could only be ordered by a vote of the Supreme Council Directorate, the President or the Secretary and no such order was made, are factors in favor of assigning responsibility to Serbian Military Intelligence. The fact that Milan Ciganovi\u0107 was involved, that the key officers involved were \"Black Hand\" members, that \"Black Hand\" Provincial Director for Bosnia and Herzegovina Vladimir Ga\u0107inovi\u0107 was consulted and that there was no official budget for the operation favors assigning responsibility to the \"Black Hand\".\n\n\n=== The newspaper clipping ===\nAt trial, it was noted that the three assassins from Belgrade tried to take all blame on themselves. \u010cabrinovi\u0107 claimed the idea of killing Franz Ferdinand came from a newspaper clipping he received in the mail at the end of March announcing Franz Ferdinand's planned visit to Sarajevo. He then showed the newspaper clipping to Princip and the next day they agreed they would kill Franz Ferdinand. Princip explained to the court he had already read about Franz Ferdinand's upcoming visit in German papers. Princip went on to testify that, at about the time of Easter (19 April), he wrote an allegorical letter to Ili\u0107 informing him of the plan to kill Franz Ferdinand. Grabe\u017e testified that he and Princip, also at about the time of Easter, agreed between them to make an assassination of either Governor Potiorek or Franz Ferdinand and a little later settled on Franz Ferdinand. The defendants refused or were unable to provide details under examination.\nOn 26 March Ili\u0107 and Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107 had already agreed to kill Franz Ferdinand based on instructions from Belgrade predating the newspaper clipping and the discussions amongst the three assassins in Belgrade.\n\n\n=== Narodna Odbrana ===\n\nSerbian Military Intelligence \u2013 through remnants of the \"Black Hand\" \u2013 penetrated the Narodna Odbrana, using its clandestine tunnel to smuggle the assassins and their weapons from Belgrade to Sarajevo. In the 5 June 1914 report by the President of the Narodna Odbrana Bo\u017ea Milanovi\u0107 to Prime Minister Pa\u0161i\u0107 one can sense the frustration of the President over the hijacking of his organization in the final sentence dealing with Sarajevo:  \"Bo\u017ea has informed all the agents that they should not receive anyone unless he produces the password given by Bo\u017ea.\"\n\n\n=== Milan Ciganovi\u0107 ===\nPrime Minister Pa\u0161i\u0107 received early information of the assassination plan. The information was received by Pa\u0161i\u0107 early enough, according to Education Minister Ljuba Jovanovi\u0107, for the government to order the border guards to prevent the assassins from crossing. This places the cabinet minister discussions in late May and the information release to some time before that. Albertini concluded that the source of the information was most likely Milan Ciganovi\u0107. Bogi\u010devi\u0107 made a more forceful case.\nThe circumstantial evidence against Ciganovi\u0107 includes his sinecure government job, his protection by the Chief of Police and Serbia's failure to arrest him (Austria-Hungary demanded Serbia arrest Major Vojislav Tankosi\u0107 and Ciganovi\u0107, but Serbia arrested only Tankosi\u0107 and lied saying that Ciganovi\u0107 could not be found), Serbia's protection of Ciganovi\u0107 during the war, and the government's provision for Ciganovi\u0107 after it. In 1917, all of the Sarajevo conspirators within Serbia's control were tried at Salonika on false charges, except Ciganovi\u0107, who even gave evidence against his comrades at the trial.\n\n\n=== Russian military attach\u00e9's office ===\nApis's confession to ordering the assassination of Franz Ferdinand states that Russian Military Attach\u00e9 Artamonov promised Russia's protection from Austria-Hungary if Serbia would ever come under attack. While admitting funding of intelligence network in Austro-Hungary, Artamonov denied the involvement of his office into assassination in an interview with Albertini. Artamonov stated that he went on vacation to Italy leaving Assistant Military Attach\u00e9 Alexander Werchovsky in charge and though he was in daily contact with Apis he did not learn of Apis's role until after the war had ended. Albertini writes that he \"remained unconvinced by the behavior of this officer.\" Werchovsky admitted the involvement of his office and then fell silent on the subject.\nThere is evidence that Russia was at least aware of the plot before 14 June. De Schelking writes: On 1 June 1914 (14 June new calendar), Emperor Nicholas had an interview with King Charles I of Roumania, at Constanza. I was there at the time ... yet as far as I could judge from my conversation with members of his (Russian Foreign Minister Sazonov's) entourage, he (Sazonov) was convinced that if the Archduke (Franz Ferdinand) were out of the way, the peace of Europe would not be endangered.\n\n\n== Consequences ==\n\nThe murder of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire and his wife produced widespread shock across European royal houses, and there was initially much sympathy for the Austrian position. Ordinary people did not really care about what happened, and on the evening of the assassination the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened. Within two days of the assassination, Austria-Hungary and Germany advised Serbia that it should open an investigation, but Secretary General to the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Slavko Gruic, replied \"Nothing had been done so far and the matter did not concern the Serbian Government.\" An angry exchange followed between the Austrian Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires at Belgrade and Gruic.After conducting a criminal investigation, verifying that Germany would honor its military alliance, and persuading the skeptical Hungarian Count Tisza, Austria-Hungary issued a formal letter to the government of Serbia on 23 July 1914. The letter reminded Serbia of its commitment to respect the Great Powers' decision regarding Bosnia-Herzegovina, and to maintain good neighborly relations with Austria-Hungary. The letter contained specific demands that Serbia should accept, including the suppression of the publication of propaganda advocating the violent destruction of Austria-Hungary, the removal of the people behind this propaganda from the Serbian Military, the dissolution of the Serbian nationalist organization Narodna Odbrana, the arrest of the people on Serbian soil who were involved in the assassination plot and the prevention of the clandestine shipment of arms and explosives from Serbia to Austria-Hungary. It also demanded that Austro-Hungarian officials should take part in the Serbian inquiry into the assassination plot.This letter became known as the July Ultimatum, and Austria-Hungary stated that if Serbia did not accept all of the demands in total within 48 hours, it would recall its ambassador from Serbia. After receiving a telegram of support from Russia, Serbia mobilized its army and responded to the letter by completely accepting point #8 demanding an end to the smuggling of weapons and punishment of the frontier officers who had assisted the assassins and completely accepting point #10 which demanded Serbia report the execution of the required measures as they were completed. Serbia partially accepted, finessed, disingenuously answered or politely rejected elements of the preamble and enumerated demands #1\u20137 and #9. The shortcomings of Serbia's response were published by Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary responded by breaking diplomatic relations.The next day, Serbian reservists being transported on tramp steamers on the Danube crossed onto the Austro-Hungarian side of the river at Temes-Kubin and Austro-Hungarian soldiers fired into the air to warn them off. The report of this incident was initially sketchy and reported to Emperor Franz-Joseph erroneously as \"a considerable skirmish\". Austria-Hungary then declared war and mobilized the portion of its army that would face the (already mobilized) Serbian Army on 28 July 1914. Under the Secret Treaty of 1892 Russia and France were obliged to mobilize their armies if any of the Triple Alliance mobilized. Russia partially mobilized along its Austrian border on 29 July, and on 30 July Russia ordered general mobilization. Russia's general mobilization set off full Austro-Hungarian and German mobilizations. Soon all the Great Powers except Italy had chosen sides and gone to war.\n\n\n== Today ==\n\nThe consequences of his action were very bad for Bosnia. Bosnia ceased to exist in Yugoslavia, and Bosnian Muslims were not recognised until 1968. They were still much better rulers than the kingdom of Yugoslavia or communist Yugoslavia. You can look at the historical records and see how Austria-Hungary cared about issues like the rule of law. We lost so much in 1918.\nThe shots fired 100 years ago by Gavrilo Princip were not fired at Europe, they were shots for freedom, marking the start of the Serbs' fight for liberation from foreign occupiers.\nLater, referring to Franz Ferdinand's assassination, Vaso \u010cubrilovi\u0107 said: \"We destroyed a beautiful world that was lost forever due to the war that followed.\"Various countries of the former Yugoslavia, Bosniaks and Croats largely view Gavrilo Princip as a terrorist and an ethnic Serb nationalist. The 100th anniversary of the assassination was commemorated with a concert by the Vienna Philharmonic in the Sarajevo City Hall, in an event that was organized by the European Union. Austrian president Heinz Fischer was the guest of honour.The World War I commemorations were boycotted by Serb nationalists and dignitaries, who, along with Bosnian Serbs, view \"Princip as a hero.\" On the 100th anniversary of the assassination, a statue of Gavrilo Princip was erected in East Sarajevo. This was followed by another statue in Belgrade, which was erected in June 2015. Serbian history textbooks deny that Serbia or Princip were responsible for starting World War I, laying blame on the Central Powers instead. Milorad Dodik acknowledged that Bosnia is \"still divided\", but maintained that Princip was a \"freedom fighter\" and that Austria-Hungary had been an \"occupier\".Princip's weapon, along with the car in which the Archduke was riding, his bloodstained uniform and the chaise longue on which he died, are on permanent display in the Heeresgeschichtliches Museum in Vienna, Austria. The bullet fired by Gavrilo Princip, sometimes referred to as \"the bullet that started World War I\", is a museum exhibit in the Konopi\u0161t\u011b Castle near the town of Bene\u0161ov in the Czech Republic. The bronze medallion of Ferdinand and Sophie, which was part of a monument that was erected on the site of the assassination and demolished in 1918 during Yugoslav rule, is currently preserved in the Art Gallery of B&H in Sarajevo.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n28 June 1914 is a 2019 Bosnian bestseller novel by Zlatko Top\u010di\u0107. The novel, in fact, deeply undermines any absolute \"historical truth\", shatters and destroys the myth of the last illusions about history and its \"processes\", about official versions of great events, about movements, revolutionaries, heroes, rebels, about \"real\" causes and occasions for wars, bringing a completely unusual story, devoid of any romantic-ideological enthusiasm, about the Bosnian man.\n\n\n== See Also ==\n\nAnti-Serb riots in Sarajevo\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAlbertini, Luigi (1953).

        "wiki": "The Jardin Royal (Royal Garden) is a public park in the French city of Toulouse. Created in 1754 and  re-landscaped in the English style in the 1860s, it is the oldest park in the city and has been designated by the French Ministry of Culture as a \"Jardin remarquable\" (notable garden). It is located in the southeast area of Toulouse with its main entrance on the corner of Rue Ozenne and All\u00e9e Jules Guesde.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe park was created as part of a major urban renewal project for Toulouse designed in 1751 by the economist and urbanist Louis de Mondran (1699\u20131792). The project involved demolishing a large area of dilapidated buildings and slums to create a network of interconnected esplanades, parks, plazas, and embankments. A central part of the plan was to build broad tree-lined avenues radiating from an oval hub. One of the avenues led to what would become the Jardin Royal. The oval hub itself would become another park, now known as the Grand Rond.Although not all of de Mondran's plan was implemented, the Jardin Royal was created in 1754. During the French Revolution, its name was changed to the \"Park Public\", and the two names continued to fluctuate over the next 130 years depending on the political situation in France. However, its name was finalised as \"Jardin Royal\" in 1886 following a decree by the Toulouse City Council.In the early 19th century the Jardin Royal was also the site of a forestry school. From 1861 to 1863, during the height of the Second French Empire, the park was completely re-landscaped in the English style. It underwent a restoration project in 2016 which maintained the English style but with new plantings and park furniture. The project was completed in November 2018.\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe Jardin Royal encompasses 1.7 hectares with lawns, winding paths and a footbridge flanked by a large Ginkgo biloba tree that leads to the Grand Rond park. At its centre is a lake with a duck house and a rustic bridge at one end. The park contains several species of trees that are relatively rare to the area \u2014cedar of Lebanon, Himalayan cedar, Virginia tulip tree, Osage orange, and American copalme\u2014some of them 200 years old.The park has several statues and sculptures including a statue of The Little Prince in memory of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and one of the composer D\u00e9odat de S\u00e9verac sculpted by Auguste Gu\u00e9not (1882\u20131966). La Gloire de l'Aviation, a monument to French aviation pioneers sculpted in marble by Aristide Maillol stood in the park from 1948 until 1993 when it was removed after being damaged by repeated vandalism. An abstract steel sculpture by Theodoulos Gregoriou commemorating Jean Mermoz and the pilots of the A\u00e9ropostale was erected in its place in 2001.The Jardin Royal has been designated by the French Ministry of Culture as a \"Jardin remarquable\" (notable garden) since 2013. The designation is given to French gardens of particular cultural, historic, aesthetic or botanical interest.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in France\nTwo other gardens in Toulouse:\nJardin des Plantes\nJardin botanique Henri Gaussen\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nToulouse Tourist Office.

        "wiki": "The Acad\u00e9mie de l'air et de l'espace (AAE) is the French national Air and Space Academy. Established in 1983 in Toulouse on the initiative of Andr\u00e9 Turcat, the aims of the academy are the following: \"To encourage the development of high quality scientific, technical, cultural and Human Actions in the realms of Air and Space, promote knowledge in these areas and constitute a focal point for activities\". Its members, who come from all walks of aerospace life : pilots, astronauts, scientists, engineers, doctors, manufacturers, economists, lawyers, artists ...  all work together to achieve these essential goals.\nIts President is Gerard Brachet.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== The vow of Colonel Edmond Petit ===\nThe idea of an air academy dates to 1954. Colonel Edmond Petit, then Head of Information of the Air Force service and literary editor of the French Air Force magazine, published numerous articles campaigning in favor of such an institution since the year 1954. He saw it mainly as an academy for French language texts on aeronautics, where the French Academy was \"completely incompetent\" and as the place to be able to develop History of aviation.\n\n\n=== The establishment of the Academy because of the reputation of Andr\u00e9 Turcat ===\nThis project could not be completed until 1983, in a broader form. It is the former chief test pilot of the Concorde, Andr\u00e9 Turcat, who got the National Academy of Air and Space out of limbo as much through his reputation within French aeronautics as well as with the municipal authorities of Toulouse. The material support of La Ville Rose allowed the installation of the Academy on the site of the former Jolimont observatory and, for the hundredth anniversary of the first human flight, the thirty five founding members gathered on 21 November 1983, in a plenary assembly.\nIncorporated under the association law of 1901, declared a public utility in 1987, the Academy has declared its objectives to \"encourage the development of high quality scientific, technical, cultural and human actions in the realms of Air and Space, promote knowledge in these areas and constitute a focal point for activities.\"\n\n\n=== International Influence ===\nThe Academy organizes international conferences and forums, presents exhibitions, gives out awards or medals to people who have made distinguished contributions. It regularly publishes, every two or three months, \"The Letter of the Academy\" presenting several pages on a relevant aeronautical subject.  Works on a larger scale result in publications by the Academy itself (as papers) or by private publishers (as books).\nBy statute, the Air and Space Academy has sixty French members, thirty foreign associates, honorary members (chosen from amongst the pioneers of aeronautics and space), and correspondents who ensure an ongoing connection to the current activities of the aerospace world. Its members become honorary at the age of 75 or upon their request, while continuing, at their convenience, to take part in the work of the Academy.\nMembers may join different sections according to their speciality. These five areas are: \n\nscientific knowledge of air and space\napplied sciences and technology of air and space\nhuman presence and activities of air and space\nethics, law, sociology, and economics of air and space\nhistory, literature, and arts of air and spaceAt the request of one of the tenured or honorary members, committees may be established to deal with current issues.\nIn 2007 the academy adopted the name \"Air and Space Academy\".\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAcad\u00e9mie de l'air et de l'espace website",

        "wiki": "Saints Christopher, Jerome and Louis of Toulouse is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Giovanni Bellini, executed in 1513, and housed in the church of San Giovanni Crisostomo, Venice.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe painting dates to Bellini's late career, when he had adopted Giorgione's tonalism. It had been commissioned in 1494 by the Venetian merchant   Giorgio Diletti. It is however signed and dated 1513, but it is not known why there were some twenty years between the commissioning and the execution.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe layout is that of the Holy Conversation typical of the Venetian tradition, largely owed to works by  Bellini himself, with an arch opening to a landscape in the background, and three figures of saints. Instead of the usual throne with the Virgin, there is St. Jerome, portrayed as a hermit, on a rock, while reading the Bible. Below, separated by a parapet where is the cartouche with the signature, are St. Christopher and a Saint bishop.\nThe latter had been originally identified as St. Augustine based on text on the book  (De civitate Dei), which was later revealed to be apocryphal, as it is not placed on the front cover. Basing on the presence of lilies on the cloak, those of the House of Anjou, the character has been recognized as St. Louis of Toulouse.\nThe saints were perhaps chosen depending from Neoplatonic themes, with St. Louis symbolizing the contemplative and liturgic life, and St. Christopher symbolizing preaching. According to this view, Jerome would thus be the highest point of spiritual life. The arch above him is a symbol of the Catholic church, and has a Greek inscription of the Psalm 14, referring to St. Jerome as the sage mentioned in it. The use of Greek derives from San Cristomo's role as church of the Greek-speaking Venetians.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nOlivari, Mariolina (2004). \"Giovanni Bellini\".

          "I did not realize what this museum was when we decided to visit it. Just something to do. I learned so much, and saw so much - it was a great museum with old Roman sculptures and artifacts.",
          "Saint Raymond museum is located at a very close distance from Basilique saint Sernin. The museum focuses on the ancient history of Toulouse and its surrounding area. It has 3 floors, each specializing in one aspect of the city. The staff at the museum were very friendly and you",
          "Found this by walking close to the cathedral. Looked interesting from from the outside but did not look like much in there. 4 Euros admission - cheap. But inside WOW! We have been to loads of Roman Museums, but the number and quality of the sculptures and inscriptions was",
          "The Mus\u00e9e Saint-Raymond focuses on the earliest settlement of the region of Toulouse up unto the 4th century AD. There is lot to be seen, including some rare and valuable Roman statues. After the visit, you really have a clear view on the political and cultural dynamic in Roman",
          "Excellent little museum full Gallo Roman sculptures and busts from the local area and from a large roman villa.",
          "Just beside Basilique St-Sernin this museum is a 4 floor renovated building with interesting artefacts. Cost is \u20ac4 per adult. It is worth a visit and outside there is a beautiful walled courtyard with a cafe onsite serving drinks.",
          "The museum offers a great collections form the Roman ages, and each piece is presented with some information about the region in the old ages. It is very nice to see and also a good learning experience. All descriptions are also presented in English.",
          "Handsome building on the outside. Three floors with different themes. Top floor is artifacts from ancient Toulouse. A floor was dedicated to the finds of a settlement just outside Toulouse called Chirotan where a number of Roman busts were found. In the basement are a",
          "The museum's materials are exhibited in a medieval setting designed to allow you to walk through gardens, cloister, and halls. The displays of materials are done at a very high level of artistry. The museum is small enough not to be overwhelming for an older couple but high",
          "This museum has some interesting displays including a fantastic limestone sculpture collection of Hercules' labours. There is also a nice early history and mosaic. But the English translations are pared down from the full French info and in the basement English is missing",
          "I've been here several times and always enjoy it. There is so much history in this museum with guides in several languages including English. There is a whole floor full of roman relics and so much more. Down in the basement you can walk next to the original Toulouse roman",
          "I could have come back here several times! First, wonderful, warm, and caring staff. Next-- I've been to many art and history museums and have seen some incredible centers of classic statues, but this one beat all. The Chiragan villa collection was used to tell a story and my",
          "First, 2\u20ac entrance fee is crazy although one of the exhibits was closed, we still saw 2 and that took up about an 1.5 hours. The first floor had some artifacts but everything was in French. The second floor with the statues was interesting and most of the descriptions were in",
          "Close to the St Sernin Basilica, this museum has a historical section displaying statues and objects, a floor devoted to coins and busts from Chiragan, an area south of Toulouse, and a basement with Roman and early Christian sarcophagi and funeral monuments from the area. The",
          "This place has a lot of statues and other traces of Roman and later Toulouse. There is also some history of Toulouse, but it's kind of small. Most of the descriptions are only in French (there is some English), but you can get English audio guides. If you're really into",
          "It was a very hot day and we were looking for an indoor activity, something out of the glaring sun. We were just starting our stay in Toulouse and we thought: How about a little history? Musee Saint-Raymond - Musee des Antiques de Toulouse wasn't hard to find, a short jaunt",
          "Free to visit with a nice shop selling coin replicas and some good books. It had a little garden cafe too. The collection on three floors is well laid out. Mainly marble Roman busts and statues, the skill of the craftsmen who made them is incredible. There are some interesting",
          "It is hard to believe that this area was settled by Romans. Even harder to believe is how much of their stuff was left behind. The main problem here is the little to none of the information cards are also in English. Luckily, my husband knows a lot about Roman history so that",
          "The building itself is stunning, Renaissance architecture, restored recently. But pass the entrance, and the most fascinating collection of statues, bas-reliefs, busts of emperors, gods & goddesses & heroes of antiquity awaits the visitor. The only place, I think, where most of",
          "This lovely museum is across the street from the St. Sernin bascilica, it was connected to the bascilica in earlier times. Be sure and pick up a free audioguide which are available in several languages. The underground is a necropolis with beautifully carved sarcophagus",
          "We were really looking forward to visiting the museum as it had wonderful Roman exhibits. There were some very interesting pieces of jewellery, pottery and statues but unfortunately most of the information on the artefacts was in French with no translation - it was such a shame.",
          "We spend our last Christmas (2015) in Toulouse and on the second day we visited this Museum. It was just besides the Saint Sernin Basilica. This was just 15 mins walk from the metro station Capitol. The opening time is 10am till 6pm and 4 euro entry fee, however students and",
          "Only two of the three gallery floors were open so it was somewhat disappointing. The beautiful looking floor 1 (shown on the home page of the website) is closed. Thus, there are no windows and no large collection of busts. I was really looking forward to that. Only the",
          "Im sure this exhibition would be good for those who had an interest in the history of Toulouse and who can read French. There area three levels: in the basement is the old lime oven and sarcophages. On the other levels were lots of fragments of buildings, pottery, jewellery etc",
          "This mus\u00e9e contains archaeological finds from the Toulouse and south of France area from Roman and early Christian sites. The basement has C4th sarcophagi from the Visigoth early Christian settlement in the Toulouse area. I found them wonderful. There is a fascinating excavation",
          "Well organized, clean museum with many archeological treasures and several photos taken many years ago. Dedicated mainly to findings in the Bordeaux area. Tourist friendly with elevator that will cover four levels of treasures. Gift shop, bathrooms inside and a small caf\u00e9",

          "We went here not knowing what to expect but anticipating a museum based on modern era France (from the time of Raymond onwards). The museum however is dedicated to earlier history with a lot of amazing artefacts from Roman times. It's astonishing to be able to see these items up",
          "It was worth the visit, slightly out of the centre of Toulouse. I reached it by Metro and tram, about 20 minutes from the Tourist Information Centre. The site has been restored using the famous pink Toulouse bricks which probably weren't what the Romans used! The monument is run",
          "a lovely 4 story museum that covers Toulousan history from Roman times through medieval. Three floors are dedicated to a perfect little summary of the history and development of Toulouse with artifacts and models in a beautiful building next to Saint Sernin. On weekends, there",
          "Wonderful relics from the Roman days (100 yrs Before Christ onwards). The mind boggles to think of what was created in those days and how well preserved it is. Everything here is in French - so understanding it helps with building the story. The underground necropolis is a real",
          "This museum has an interesting collection of mostly Roman remains. It's housed in an attractive medieval building opposite the St Sernin basilica. There are three floors of exhibits and it's a pleasant way to spend an hour or two. Information in English is quite limited. I",
          "This museum is hosted by one of the oldest house in Toulouse, a medieval one. It nicely looks Roman, but it is not. And that's great because this museum presents a lot of things dating back to the times this land was part of tthe Great Roman Empire. This museum presents a bust",
          "This is more than a simple museum, actually the former Augustin church and cloister makes a very deep impression. The gothic statues, are an excellent collection",
          "Wonderful sculptures as well as precious miniature antiquities, tombs, ancient jugs and mosaics. Enjoyed finding the details and fine work in the various displays.",
          "After the cathedral I thought what to do and checked TripAdvisor. Don't go there. The audio guide helps understanding, but doesn't make it more exciting.",
          "Worth a visit after visiting the basilica of St Sernin and learning of the history of the martyred bishop. Here you can visit the excavated remains of a burial site and see lots of exhibits and models to show the development of the city from ancient times. Free with the pass",
          "On a rainy afternoon, we decided to visit this museum as an alternative to take a guided walking tour . We were surprised in many ways : first , for some obscure reason , we were granted a free access to the museum , second , the displays on the first and second floors were",
          "The collection is well laid out and very interesting. I struggled with the descriptions as they were only in French. (I found out afterwards that an English audio guide was available.) though it took me awhile to read the descriptions, it was so worth it! There are statues,",
          "We stumbled upon this museum by chance and spent an hour wandering around the exhibits which were laid out over three floors. Very interesting to see the local history",
          "Before travelling to Toulous I hadn't known just how long the city's history is. This museum is a fantastic example of this. There is a wonderful exposistion at the moment show casing Roman murals from the city and it even has a recreation which is beautiful and the film showing",
          "The wisigoth history of this part of France, very well presented, Not too much multi media fluff. Fabulous statuary. Real history here.",
          "If you are a fan of / expert in roman sculpture and artefacts, this is the place for you. I found it a little samey, but am more of a browser than a 'buff' of this period. It's right next to the Basilica, and there's a cafe just outside, so well worth a look if you are in the",
          "This museum gives a fascinating glimpse of the history of Toulouse from the earliest pre-Roman days up to the present. It is well worth a visit- the only problem may be that all the descriptive panels are only in French.",
          "I have visited Toulouse many times and find it a stimulating city, I went to the market on sunday and saw the museum was open so decided to take a look.... The museum is based over three floors with the 2nd floor (top) being the floor with the most interest to me, it has lots",
          "Right next to St. Sernin Bastilica, so plan to go to both. It is small, but if you are interested in the time period, you could spend hours. We watched school children drawing mosaics (art class?) and locals sketching some of the statues. We spent much more time than I thought",
          "Amazing small museum, full of nice pieces, especially the Ino's Mosaic ! The museum is free every first sunday of the month : ideal for a quick visit. You can also have a drink on the terrasse of the museum (quiet small garden) or visit some really closed places : St Sernin",
          "My wife and I found the St. Sernin basilica a quick walk-through, but figured we'd go into the next door museum as long as we were nearby. We were surprised at the number and quality of Roman-era sculptures, and fascinated by the basement sarcophogai -- placed in the area where",
          "The primary repository for the Roman presence in the region, the collection is well curated and the exhibits are of the highest quality. You will not be overloaded as the collections are not focused on volume - very much \"never mind the quantity, feel the quality\". Staff were",
          "This museum is small but has very nice pieces af roman art. It is well located, downtown. Very nice also to visit with children as it is of \"human size\".",
          "But ...the prime exhibits for me were the gold early celtic torques and a prehistoric statue of a female...stunning",
          "This museum is very close to the Basilica of Saint Sernin, but its strength is in its collections of ancient Roman art, and especially portraits from the Roman imperial period (1st to 4th centuries AD).",
          "Great museum but there are no explainations, tours, or help available in English.Otherwise a great getaway to see some history.",
          "Well worth a visit, this museum is chock full of ancient artifacts, an amazing look at human settlement over centuries in this locale. It really gives depth to the history of the place.",
          "Nice, small museum focusing on the Roman era of southwest France and Toulouse in particular. Antiquities include household items, and many statues and busts. The museum itself is housed in a rare medieval academic building dating from 1523, originally build as a dormitory for",
          "This looked unpromising, as a museum of antiquities (yawn) but it is a wonderful smallish museum with a huge amount about a truly amazing villa estate that was in Toulouse. There are countless lively statues and portraits and objects salvaged from this place, which clearly",
          "Interesting to see the history of Toulouse from Roman days to present. Great busts of all of the Roman leaders, lined up in order of their reigns.",

        "wiki": "Toulouse (, too-LOOZ; French: [tuluz] (listen); Occitan: Tolosa [tu\u02c8luzo]; Latin: Tolosa [to\u02c8lo\u02d0sa]) is the capital of the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km (143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean and 680 km (420 mi) from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France, with 479,553 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (as of January 2017), and 1,360,829 inhabitants within its wider metropolitan area (also as of January 2017), after Paris, Lyon and Marseille, and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.\nToulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus (formerly EADS), the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It also hosts the European headquarters of Intel and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe. Thales Alenia Space, ATR, SAFRAN, Liebherr-Aerospace and Airbus Defence and Space also have a significant presence in Toulouse.\nThe University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 103,000 students, it is the fourth-largest university campus in France, after the universities of Paris, Lyon and Lille.The air route between Toulouse\u2013Blagnac and Paris Orly is the busiest in Europe, transporting 2.4 million passengers in 2014. According to the rankings of L'Express and Challenges, Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the Occitanie region, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.\nToulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname La Ville Rose (The Pink City).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nToulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nToulouse has a temperate humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified as a Mediterranean climate zone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age.\nThe historical name of the city, Tolosa (\u03a4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian, or from Iberian, but has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages.Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost.\nAfter the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city of Gallia Narbonensis. In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 (Battle of Vouill\u00e9).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n\n=== County of Toulouse ===\n\nThe town became the capital of the County of Toulouse during the Carolingian era.\nIn 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders.\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the military crusade, such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the Southern French Gothic.\nIn 1215 the Dominican Order was founded in Toulouse by Saint Dominic in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\nIn the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs, were started. They found home in Les Jacobins. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital.\n\n\n=== Within the Kingdom of France ===\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the kingdom of France and declared a \"royal city\". In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years. The Consistori del Gay Saber is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\nThe 14th century brought a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population by Crusaders in 1320, the Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years' War. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.The situation improved in the 15th century. Charles VII established the second parliament of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of pastel, a blue dye made from woad. The fortune generated by this international trade was at the origin of several of Toulouse's superb Renaissance mansions.\n\n\n=== Within the French Republic ===\nThe Battle of Toulouse (1814) was one of the final battles of the Napoleonic Wars, four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition.\nToulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by Marshal Soult.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of the city proper (French: commune) was 479,553 at the January 2017 census, with 1,360,829 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,187,686 at the January 2007 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area). Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.4% per year between 2007 and 2017, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2007 censuses.\nToulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\nFueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for metropolitan France), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.\nA local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Toulouse M\u00e9tropole ===\n\nThe Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Toulouse) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent communes, covering an area of 380 km2 (147 sq mi), totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communaut\u00e9 urbaine). This has become a m\u00e9tropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes.\n\n\n=== Local politics ===\n\nOne of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (Halle aux Grains) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (Z\u00e9nith, the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace was founded, etc.\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen.\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nToulouse has many interesting churches, but three of them are of remarkable architectural and historical interest.\nSaint-Sernin Basilica, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest remaining Romanesque church in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by Charlemagne to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\nCathedral of Saint Stephen is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\nThe convent of the Jacobins (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the Albi Cathedral, the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the Dominican order, for not having obtained the relics of Saint Dominic kept in Bologna, Pope Urban V made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar Saint Thomas Aquinas, one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Civilian buildings ===\n\nThe Capitole de Toulouse (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole (opera house). It is located on the Place du Capitole, a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (place royale). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th-century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (le donjon), which housed the archives of the Capitouls; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called h\u00f4tels particuliers) or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat, the H\u00f4tel de Bernuy, the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, the H\u00f4tel de Bagis...\n\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n\nThe banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the Pont-Neuf, it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the H\u00f4pital de La Grave. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe Jardin des Plantes is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a botanical garden (early 19th century).\nThe Cit\u00e9 de l'espace (Space City) is a theme park of space exploration.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nSights and monuments of Toulouse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe main industries are aeronautics, space, electronics, information technology and biotechnology. Toulouse hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320, A330, A350 and A380.  (A320 lines also exist in Hamburg, Germany, Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, USA.) Airbus has its head office in Blagnac, near Toulouse. Airbus's France division has its main office in Toulouse. Toulouse also hosts the headquarters of ATR, Sigfox, one of the two headquarters of Liebherr Aerospace and Groupe Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re.\nThe Concorde supersonic aircraft was also constructed in Toulouse.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nToulouse has the fourth-largest student population in France after Paris, Lyon and Lille with 103,000 students (2012).\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nThe University of Toulouse (Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse), established in 1229, is located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology\u2014inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts\u2014as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.\nCatholic University of Toulouse\nUniversit\u00e9 Toulouse I, Toulouse School of Economics, Toulouse School of Management and Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse\nUniversity of Toulouse-Jean Jaur\u00e8s (Formerly University of Toulouse II \u2013 Le Mirail)\nUniversit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III)Toulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:\n\nICAM Toulouse (Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers)\nINSA Toulouse\nISAE SUPAERO (Institut sup\u00e9rieur de l'a\u00e9ronautique et de l'espace)\nENAC (\u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile)\nINP ENSEEIHT (\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectronique, d'\u00c9lectrotechnique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique et des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications)\nENSFEA (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de formation de l\u2019enseignement agricole)\nINP ENSIACET (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs en art chimique et technologique)\nINP ENSAT ('\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure Agronomique de Toulouse)\nINP ENM (\u00c9cole Nationale de la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie)\nEPITA (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les techniques avanc\u00e9es)\nEPITECH (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies or European Institute of Information Technology)\nIPSA (Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avanc\u00e9es)\nEIPurpan (\u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Purpan)\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThe most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Sernin.\nInternational schools serving area expatriates are in nearby Colomiers:\n\nInternational School of Toulouse\nDeutsche Schule Toulouse (German school)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThe main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nIn addition to an extensive bus system, the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tired trains. Line A runs for 12.5 km (7.8 mi) from Balma-Gramont in the north-east to Basso Cambo in the south-west. Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaur\u00e8s.\nLine C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Ar\u00e8nes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named \"Gare des Capelles\", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened. Le TOEC station opened on 1 September 2003 with the creation of line C, allowing an urban train service in Toulouse and close western suburbs.Similarly, Line D runs south from Toulouse Matabiau to Muret.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\nThe tramway line T1 (operating since December 2010), runs from Beauzelle to Toulouse passing through Blagnac. All urban bus, metro and tram services are operated by Tiss\u00e9o. Tramway line T2 is a branch of the first line serving notably Toulouse Blagnac airport.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nIn 2007, a citywide bicycle rental scheme called V\u00e9l\u00f4Toulouse was introduced, with bicycles available from automated stations for a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly subscription.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nAirports include:\n\nToulouse Blagnac, the principal local airport\nToulouse Lasbordes\n\n\n=== Canal ===\nThe Canal du Midi begins in Toulouse and runs up to S\u00e8te.\n\n\n=== Toulouse public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Toulouse, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 44 min. 9.1% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day.

The Orchestre National du Capitole, long associated with Michel Plasson, plays at the Halle aux Grains.Le Ch\u00e2teau d'Eau, an old 19th-century water-tower, was converted as a gallery in 1974 by Jean Dieuzaide, a French photographer from Toulouse and is now one of the oldest public places dedicated to photography in the world. Toulouse's art museums include the Mus\u00e9e des Augustins, the Mus\u00e9e des Abattoirs, the Mus\u00e9e Georges Labit, and the Fondation Bemberg in the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat. The Mus\u00e9e Saint-Raymond is devoted to Antiquity and the Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse to natural history.\nToulouse is the seat of the Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux, the equivalent of the French Academy for the Occitan-speaking regions of southern France, making Toulouse the unofficial capital of Occitan culture. The traditional Cross of Toulouse (from Provence, under the name of cross of Provence), emblem of the County of Toulouse and commonly widespread around all of Occitania during the Middle Ages is the symbol of the city and of the newly founded Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es r\u00e9gion, as well as a popular Occitan symbol.\nThe city's gastronomic specialties include the Saucisse de Toulouse, a type of sausage, cassoulet Toulousain, a bean and pork stew, and garbure, a cabbage soup with poultry. Also, foie gras, the liver of an overfed duck or goose, is a delicacy commonly made in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nStade Toulousain of the Top 14 is one of the most successful rugby union clubs in all of Europe, having been crowned European champions four times and French champions twenty times.Toulouse Olympique represents the city in rugby league, playing in the English/European 2nd tier Championship from 2017.\nThe city also has a professional football team, Toulouse FC, who play in Ligue 2, the second division of football in France, and who won the 1957 Coupe de France Final.

          "I visited in the first week of October as a follow up to the Musee Raymond and was not disappointed. The building itself is a good part of its interest and is filled with artifacts that give a glimpse into life in Toulouse 300 plus years ago. The welcoming volunteers supplied me",
          "We truly enjoyed our visit to this little museum - a series of rooms in an old Toulouse mansion. It has an intimate feel, with quite a broad assortment of objects from the city over time - discovered Roman objects, portraits of prominent local people, a case of objects dyed in",
          "Visited many museums in Europe and found this museum to be not that interesting. The actual building was for us the most interesting with its quirky rooms but most of the artifacts were paintings. Would not visit again",
          "This is indeed a little treasure and one which should not be missed by anyone visiting Toulouse. It is situated in the wonderfully charming Hotel Dumay, down a charming little street, a five-minute walk from the Capitole. It contains a huge amount of miscellaneous items relating",
          "I've given this an Average score, just so I could make public the fact that it is only open at limited times - check out their website, They open mid April to mid November, Monday to Saturday, 2pm to 6pm. It is also quite hard to find down an alley. We eventually found it but we",
          "This museum offers a collection of items telling the story of the city. This includes pictures, porcelain, some sculptures and a few clothes.",
          "My wife and I made the mistake of touring one too many venues in one day on our visit to Toulouse, and this, unfortunately, was the last one. The charge for admission was quite reasonable, just 4 euros each, with no senior rate. We found England much better about senior rates",
          "Museum of old Toulouse is located in one of the alleys leading out of the Capitole in an old building which is reminiscent of the old days of the city. The museum's focus in on the history of the city from the 18th century onward. The building has three floors but the area of",
          "This museum is a hidden gem in the center of Toulouse. Although it is small, it gives its visitors a peek at some of the less known qualities of Toulouse. Housed in a lovely building on a nearly hidden side street off of Rue de Rome, it is run by a dedicated staff who know a lot",
          "Museum is down an alley and has a nice courtyard. Five euros and not worth it in my opinion. Some objects of historical interest and some Roman stuff but very limited.",
          "I love museums but really fle this one needs some work. The ladies who are guides and docents are absolutely adorable and helpful. But the museum is very poorly organized. I wasn't sure if it was organized chronologically, topically or by size of object. Ther's also a real gap",
          "I went in expected very little - thought it's a private museum with some collection of daily items and that's it. I ended up being very surprised. A group of us had a guide going through each room and telling us all the interesting history of Toulouse. I ended up spending 2",
          "This private museum is in a beautiful old house very near to the Capitole, in the centre of Toulouse. It is small and with a modest collection of bits and pieces relating to Toulouse's past. Entry is just \u20ac2.50 and well worth the price. In 2015 it is open between April 13 and",
          "The Musee is an interesting look at the story of Toulouse. Its not big so easy to visit in an hour or less but there are lots of photos and interesting insights into the old Toulouse. I liked it.",
          "We visited and found that the museum left us flat. The art wasn't that good nor the artifacts. Maybe if you are from the area or if you have a rainy 1/2 hour to fill. There is an English booklet available.",
          "It's a small museum, only five rooms and a terrace, but I was lucky enough to be there when a fabulous guide was on duty. It's staffed entirely by volunteers, and they not only know their stuff, they love explaining it to people - I was wondering why the cathedral was such an",
          "I felt privileged to look around this museum, you enter the museum through a courtyard then go twice around an old wooden spiral staircase to reach the museum. Upon entry I was met by two wonderful ladies who were charming characters to talk to, I spoke only in French so do not",
          "Welcoming staff, guide books available in English (not sure about other languages), place to leave bags. Lots to see and rarely busy as not often featured in city guides, etc. 2.5 euro entry.",

        "wiki": "The Airbus A300-600ST (Super Transporter), or Beluga, is a version of the standard A300-600 wide-body airliner modified to carry aircraft parts and oversized cargo. It received the official name of Super Transporter early on; however, the name Beluga, a whale it resembles, gained popularity and has since been officially adopted. The Beluga XL, based on the Airbus A330 with similar modifications and dimensions, was developed by Airbus to replace the type in January 2020.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nSeveral major aircraft manufacturers are multinational, and it is not unusual for them to have plants in widely separated locations. Airbus is unique in that although it is today a standalone multinational corporation, it was originally a consortium formed by the major British, French, German, and Spanish aerospace companies. The geographic location of Airbus manufacturing is not only influenced by cost and convenience; it is also a matter of aviation history and national interest. Historically, each of the Airbus partners makes an entire aircraft section, which would then be transported to a central location for final assembly; even after the integration of Airbus into a single firm, the arrangement remained largely the same, with Airbus partners becoming subsidiaries or contractors of the multinational pan-European company. The details vary from one model to another, but the general arrangement is for the wings and landing gear to be made in the UK, the tail and doors in Spain, the fuselage in Germany, and the nose and centre-section in France, with final assembly in either Toulouse, France; Hamburg, Germany; or Seville, Spain.\n\nWhen Airbus started in 1970, road vehicles were initially used for the movement of components and sections; however, growth in production volume soon necessitated a switch to air transport. From 1972 onwards, a fleet of four highly modified \"Super Guppies\" took over. These were former Boeing Stratocruisers from the 1940s that had been converted with custom fuselages and the adoption of turbine engines to carry large volume loads for NASA's space program in the 1960s. Airbus' use of the Super Guppies led to the jest that \"every Airbus is delivered on the wings of a Boeing\". As time went on, the Super Guppies grew increasingly unsatisfactory for Airbus's ferrying needs: their age meant that operating expenses were high and ever-increasing, and growing Airbus production required greater capacity than could be provided by the existing fleet.Various options were studied to serve as a replacement transport medium for the Super Guppies, including methods of surface transportation by road, rail, and sea; these alternatives were discarded in favor of a principally air-based solution as they were considered to have reliability concerns and were time-consuming in operation; in addition, the assembly line in Toulouse was not conveniently accessible by any of the surface methods. A key requirement of the new air transporter was the need to accommodate every major component being manufactured by Airbus, including the then-heaviest planned part, that being the wing of the larger variants of the Airbus A340. A speedy development program was also necessitated in order to begin introducing the prospective type in time to take over duties from the Super Guppy fleet, which was scheduled to draw down in the mid-1990s.Several different types of aircraft were examined for potential use, including the Antonov An-124, Antonov An-225, Ilyushin Il-86, Boeing 747, Boeing 767, Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, and McDonnell Douglas C-17 Globemaster III; the use of any existing aircraft was eventually discounted due to a lack of internal space to accommodate the desired components, the use of a piggyback arrangement was also dismissed as impractical. Boeing made their own offer to convert several Boeing 767s for the requirement, but this was viewed as inferior to developing a purpose-built aircraft using Airbus' existing wide-body twin-engined Airbus A300-600R instead.In August 1991, A\u00e9rospatiale and DASA, two of the major Airbus partners, formed a 50/50 joint venture company, Super Airbus Transport International (SATIC), based in Toulouse, France, to develop a new-build replacement for the Super Guppy fleet. The selected starting point for the design was the Airbus A300, leading to the new airframe being designated as the A300-600ST Super Transporter. Following a pre-design period by SATIC, detailed design work was performed by A\u00e9rospatiale and DASA while subcontractors were selected to complete the 15 separate work packages; amongst these subcontractors, CASA was selected to produce the upper fuselage, Dornier provided the hydraulic systems, and Sogerma performed the final assembly work. The A300-600ST was not a like-for-like replacement, being larger, faster, and more efficient than the preceding Super Guppies. Airbus Industries elected to invest $1 billion into the program, this sum included the aircraft themselves, the cargo loading system, and program management.\n\n\n=== Entry into service and replacement ===\n\nIn September 1992, construction work began on the first aircraft, the maiden flight of which took place in September 1994. Following a total of 335 flight hours being performed during the test program, restricted certification of the type was awarded by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in October 1995, enabling the A300-600ST \"Beluga\" to enter service shortly thereafter. In addition to the first aircraft, four more Belugas were constructed at a rate of roughly one per year; from start to finish, each airframe reportedly took roughly three years to complete. Modification work was performed at Toulouse using components provided by the Airbus assembly line. Originally a total of four aircraft were to be built along with an option for a fifth aircraft being available, which was later firmed up.The fleet's primary task is to carry Airbus components ready for final assembly across Europe between Toulouse, Hamburg and nine other sites, and they do so 60 times per week. The Beluga fleet is owned by Airbus Transport International (ATI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Airbus Group that was established specifically to operate the type; through this organisation, the fleet is made available for hire by third parties for charter flight. In May 1998, ATI reportedly had an annual revenue target of $15 million to be achieved via leasing spare capacity. Over time, the Beluga has been used to carry a variety of special loads, including space station components, large and delicate artwork, industrial machinery, and intact helicopters. The A300-600ST's freight compartment is 7.4 m (24 ft) in diameter and 37.7 m (124 ft) long; maximum payload is 47 tonnes.\n\nIn late 1997, in response to the positive performance of the A300-600ST Super Transporter program, SATIC announced that they were in the process of evaluating several different prospective outsize freighter conversions; company chairman Udo Dr\u00e4ger indicated that a larger freighter based on the Airbus A340 could be developed in a similar manner to that of the A300-based Beluga. At the time, derivatives of both the Airbus A330 and the A340 were being studied, including combining the upward-swinging hinged door of the Beluga with a conventional upper deck as an alternative to a side-mounted cargo door in traditional freighter missions. During the 1990s, as a result of reported inquiries to Airbus regarding the type, a niche market for selling Beluga-type aircraft to military customers and freight operators was also examined; but sales were considered 'unlikely' to take place by the late 1990s.In November 2014, Airbus announced that it was proceeding with the development of a larger replacement based on the Airbus A330-200; five of which will start operating from 2019, replacing the last old Beluga in 2025. Airbus previously considered the A330-300 and A340-500, but each require too much of the limited 1,663 m (5,456 ft) runway 04 at Hawarden Airport near Broughton in Wales. In May 2015, Airbus confirmed that the new aircraft will have a 1 m (3 ft 3 in) wider cross-section than its predecessor and provide a 12% increase in payload. The Beluga XL is intended primarily for A350 work, and is designed with capacity to ship two A350 wings simultaneously. Five aircraft will be progressively assembled; the first two are considered essential to ramping-up production of the A350; the remaining three are to be introduced as the A300-600 Beluga fleet retires.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe A300-600ST Beluga shares many design similarities, although substantially differing in appearance, to the Airbus A300 upon which it was based. The wings, engines, landing gear, and the lower part of the fuselage remain identical to those used on the conventional A300, while the upper part of the fuselage forms an enormous horseshoe-shaped structure 7.7 m (25 ft) in diameter. In comparison with the Super Guppy, the payload was more than doubled and the volume increased by more than 30 per cent. The General Electric CF6-80C2 turbofan engines used are slightly uprated from those used on the standard A300 as well. The vertical stabilizer uses a modified Airbus A340 fin with a 1.12 m (3 ft 8 in) base extension while the tailplane was strengthened and fitted with auxiliary fins to maintain directional stability. The tailplane trim tank was also deleted.To provide access to the cargo area from the front without having to disconnect all electrical, hydraulic and flight control connections (and also avoiding the lengthy recalibrations before each flight that reconnection entailed), the standard A300 cockpit was relocated down below the cargo-floor level. By relocating the cockpit in this manner, loading times were reportedly halved from those encountered using the Super Guppy, which had needed to disconnect and reconnect such systems. Another reason for faster loading times was the adoption of a roll-on/roll-off loading system, as well as the ability to unload the aircraft in winds of up to 40 knots. The qualities and improved capabilities of the Beluga resulted in the costs associated with transporting Airbus components dropping to only one-third of those achieved by the Super Guppy.The cockpit of the Beluga is pressurized but the cargo deck is not, making it inaccessible during flight and unsuitable for cargoes that require a pressurized environment, such as live animals. However, the cargo deck is fitted with a heating module to keep the cargo within an appropriate temperature range. On at least one occasion, a pressurized container has been used for cargo (see Operational history). The aircraft is operated by a crew of three \u2013 two pilots and a loadmaster.The main deck cargo volume of the Beluga is greater than that of the C-5 Galaxy or the Antonov An-124 but still smaller than Antonov An-225. However, it is restricted by cargo-weight capacity of 47 tonnes, compared to 122.5 tonnes for the C-5 Galaxy and 150 tonnes for the An-124. Despite this width, the Beluga cannot carry most fuselage parts of the Airbus A380, which are instead normally transported by ship and road. The Beluga has been used to transport some A380 components.\n\n\n== Operational history ==\n\nIn January 1996, the Beluga was formally placed into dedicated service, ferrying components from various aerospace sites to the final assembly lines in Toulouse, France and Hamburg, Germany. On 24 October 1997, the last of Airbus Industrie's Super Guppy freighters was retired and its outsize cargo mission from that point onwards being exclusively performed by the new A300-600ST fleet. In 1997, the second year of Beluga operations, the fleet accumulated in excess of 2,500 flight hours across more than 1,400 flights. By 2012, the fleet was performing roughly 5,000 flight hours per year; Airbus expected this figure to double by 2017.Since entering service, the Beluga has been subject to several infrastructure upgrades. In 2011, Pau Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Airport, a site routinely visited by Belugas, became the first airport in Europe to deploy the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, which accurately guides the Beluga and other aircraft during landing. In 2015, a dedicated Beluga loading station was opened at Hawarden Airport, preventing high winds from disrupting future operations.In addition to its primary supply duties to Airbus' production facilities, Belugas have often performed charter flights for various purposes. In 1997, ATI claimed that it had to reject eight out of ten requests for commercial Beluga flights, the fleet being able to spare only 130 flight hours for such duties that year. But as more Beluga aircraft were put into service, availability increased drastically, rising to 600 flight hours in 1998 and around 1,000 flight hours in 1999; this effectively enabled one of the five Beluga aircraft to spend much of its operating hours performing charter flights. Amongst the early customers chartering Beluga flights was Boeing.In June 1997, a world record was set for the most voluminous payload to be carried by an aircraft when a Beluga was used to transport a chemical tank for a merchant vessel from Clermont-Ferrand to Le Havre, France. In February 2003, a single Beluga performed the farthest distance charter flight ever, having flown for 25 hours (not including refueling stops) to transport two complete NHI NH90 helicopters along with a single Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter from Marseille, France to Melbourne, Australia, for the Avalon Airshow.\n\nIn 1999, a Beluga carried a large painting, Liberty Leading the People by Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, which had hung in the Louvre in Paris since 1874. It was flown from Paris to Tokyo via Bahrain and Kolkata in about 20 hours. The large canvas, measuring 2.99 metres (9.81 ft) high by 3.62 metres (11.88 ft) long, was too large to fit into a Boeing 747. It was transported in the vertical position inside a special pressurized container provided with isothermal protection and an anti-vibration device.In 2004, a Beluga was used to deliver relief supplies to the Indian Ocean region following widespread devastation of coastal areas by a major tsunami. In 2005, the Beluga was employed to transport humanitarian aid and medical supplies from the United Kingdom and France to the Gulf Coast of the United States, in support of disaster-relief operations in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.The Beluga has seen recurrent use to transport bulky objects, including vehicles, for various different space programs. In 2001, sections of the unmanned Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) space vehicle were transported by a Beluga from Turin, Italy to Amsterdam, Netherlands. In 2004, multiple Beluga flights were made to Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan, to deliver Astrium-built satellites. In 2009, a Beluga was used to convey the Tranquility module of the International Space Station from Turin to Kennedy Space Center, United States.A two-bay loading dock was opened in Toulouse in 2019, receiving 85-100 flights a week, as the five A300-600STs are operated 7,600 hours a year together.\nIt encloses the forward section including the open large cargo door for less weather restrictions and faster 1h 20min turnaround down from 2h 30min.\n\n\n== Specifications (A300-600ST) ==\n\nData from Airbus, Airbus :BelugaGeneral characteristics\nCrew: 2\nCapacity: 47,000 kg (103,617 lb) typical load\nLength: 56.15 m (184 ft 3 in)\nWingspan: 44.84 m (147 ft 1 in)\nHeight: 17.24 m (56 ft 7 in)\nWing area: 260 m2 (2,800 sq ft)\nEmpty weight: 86,500 kg (190,700 lb)\nMax takeoff weight: 155,000 kg (341,717 lb)\nFuel capacity: 23,860 l (6,303 US gal)\nFuselage external diameter: 7.31 m (24 ft) (including lower fuselage)\nCargo cross-section diameter: 7.1 m (23 ft 4 in) in cargo compartment\nCargo hold \u2013 volume 1,500 m3 (53,000 cu ft), 37.7 m (124 ft) long \u00d7 7.04 m (23.1 ft) wide \u00d7 7.08 m (23.2 ft) tall\nPowerplant: 2 \u00d7 General Electric CF6-80C2A8 turbofan, 257 kN (58,000 lbf) thrust  eachPerformance\n\nMaximum speed: Mach 0.7 Maximum Operating Mach \u2013 MMO\nRange: 2,779 km (1,727 mi, 1,501 nmi) with 40 t (88,000 lb) payload - 4,632 km (2,501 nmi) with 26 t (57,000 lb) payload\nService ceiling: 10,668 m (35,000 ft) \n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of civil aircraftRelated development\n\nAirbus A300 \u2013 World\u2019s first twin-engine widebody jet airliner\nAirbus Beluga XL \u2013 Outsize cargo version of the A330-200 airlinerAircraft of comparable role, configuration and era\n\nAero Spacelines Pregnant Guppy \u2013 Outsize cargo conversion of the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser\nAero Spacelines Super Guppy \u2013 Turboprop conversion and enlarged version of outsize cargo carrier Pregnant Guppy\nAntonov An-124 Ruslan \u2013 Soviet/Ukraine four\u2013engine large military transport aircraft\nAntonov An-225 Mriya \u2013 Soviet/Ukrainian six-engine heavy strategic cargo aircraft\nBoeing Dreamlifter \u2013 Outsize cargo conversion of the 747-400\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nPhoto Tour of an Airbus Beluga A300-600ST",

          "Very interesting visit to this museum. Everything was in French, but if you ask at the entry, you will be given a handout in English. Have been teaching our children (10 and 12) about the French Resistance and this was very useful. It is free, and remember it does close for a",
          "This museum isn't big like the museums in the same theme in other cities. They got 2 stories with a permanent exhibition and temporary one. Main story for this museum is about the Resistants in the region. I find that's really interesting and in free for visiting.",
          "As another reviewer has said there is a handout in English if you don't speak good French. This is a well presented exhibition with plenty of artefacts. It was thought provoking, and highly educational. It is free entry to boot. There was a lot more content than Musee Saint",
          "A free museum open Monday-Friday only and closed 90 minutes for lunch. A bit out of the central historical center, it can be combined with walks through the Jardin Royal, Grand Rond, Jardin des Plantes. Also nearby is the Museum of Toulouse and the Monument a la Glorie de la",
          "The Tourist Board produces some very good literature, but some of the opening times are wrong, including this important memorial. Incidentally, the SNCF web-site is also out of date, e.g. for week-end schedules to Carcassonne.",
          "Well researched and displayed, with an English background script if you ask. It is not a fun visit, but every teenage child should make this a trip essential. The relationship between Vichy and the French people, the left and right and Laval publicly advocating a German victory",
          "If you are interested in modern history and want to understand the French perspective of ww 2 then this is an excellent place. They have an English script that takes you around the main part of the exhibition. It takes about 1 and a half hours to read and digest. Some parts may",
          "We arrived during the lunch break and needed to wait half an hour to get in. The display has information in French only. We were given a booklet with quite a number of pages of typed information in English which we read before looking at the exhibits. We found the typed",
          "A most informative place to visit with good displays and excellent explanations in English if you wish at reception. Very helpful staff. It was very quiet but for us it seems important to remember what happened to an earlier generation. I am always amazed at the young age of",
          "This museum is manned by volunteers, so closes promptly at 12 for lunch. It will also help to understand all the information if you read French - there are no translations - but the photographs and exhibits tell a clear story.",
          "This wasn't featured on the main tourist map sadly, and I saw no flyers for it - it was only mentioned in the really old Rough Guide I had! Pleased I made the effort to go. This is a subject I've read lots about in the past, but as a Brit I found the more French focused info",
          "This visit had real emotional impact, and the museum's subject is enduringly important. The museum is free and a lot of the descriptors are in French.. The top floor has a guide for English speaking visitors so you can read an English description of what you are seeing. This",
          "This is an extremely poignant museum dealing with both the resistance and the deportation of Jews from France. It is pretty hard-hitting, but well put together, with some great artifacts to bring the period alive.",

          "A very moving museum full of artifacts. Their English translation packet was very informative and well done. It increased our understanding of the history and the effects of the occupation and the deportation tremendously. Bravo!",
          "You need at least 2 hours to take in all the detail. Lots of exhibits and reading. Basic French is essential to get the most benefit although the photos and exhibits speak for themselves. There are some quite graphic photos. The museum is free and easily found. We used the metro"

There is only a bus ride in the parking lot of the finished and semi finished planes. The pictures you see in the site are not the places you will visit. Be wary of that.",

          "It is interesting albeit a bit short. But combined with the museum visit it makes a good day trip there",
          "We had a nice guide and the tour was really interesting! You will see the soon to be delivered aircrafts and the testing hall of the A380. Impressive! It was really interesting to hear about the challenges when building this huge plane.\nStudents pay 20\u20ac for the museum and tour - 13\u20ac for tour only.",
          "Well Guys, if you stay in Toulouse, I will suggest to consider visit at Airbus. \nThe proximity of the Airbus is reminiscent of the amazing silhouette of Beluga, flying from time to time in the sky of Toulouse. I believe many of you know \u2026",
          "Had a great time touring through the Airbus manufacturing, really enjoyed it.",
          "Excellent tour of the Airbus factory, for everyone, not only for aviation enthusiasts. Try to do both the A350XWB and A380 tour because both of them are scheduled after another. You must book it online beforehand to reserve a space. The \u2026",
          "It may look like a small museum, but it has a large and diverse collection. For aviation minded folks, reserve a good 3 hours tour of the museum. And don't forget to book 1 of the Airbus tours the same day. Really worthwhile the visit..",

          "Really fun day with two kids who were not totally airplane obsessed. The museum was maybe more fun than the tour itself. Would have been better if they hadn't just moved a plane out of the assembly bay the day before, but that's luck if the draw",

          "I had great expectations for this visit but the English guide was very boring. The French are so full of themselves they don't bother with the visit in English. Except for some aircrafts  and an almost empty factory,  we have seen nothing in this visit. Disappointing !",

          "First if you are going by Train, when you get off it is at least a 40 mins walk to the Centre.\nApart from one lady at reception all the staff are unfriendly.\nYou get to see a video at the start followed by a quick tour of the grounds to \u2026",
          "Very nice experience, which lasted for 1 hour and 1/2. I was expecting a bigger interaction with the factory and airplanes, but it's definitely a must to visit in Toulouse",
          "Nice planes, you learn a lot by going here",
          "Great museum to learn about the French aviation. Greatly recommend to all. All texts are only in French and limited English. Going to the old planes exhibit under the open sky is not worth it as to me.",
          "Great visit with a good explanation about the Airbus sites, logistics and overview about the planes! Not so much contact with the planes, only view from the bus, window inside manufacturing site but this was already expected!",
          "A must for aviation fans, you can see how the a380 is made, test flights and aircraft about to be delivered, plus you can really learn a lot.",
          "Absolutely enjoyed the 'Let's Visit Airbus' tour. It's probably less comprehensive than I expected, the only real difference to the museum is that you'll drive across into the A380 production hall. Once there the guide will talk you through production at an elevated viewing deck. Fantastic place to see.",
          "Amazing experience! Must go for aviation fans!",
          "Could use more simulators, we are in 2019 and maybe it was interesting 10 years ago but now it could use some AR VR experience. The tour started with 20min of videos from the first A380 flight in 2005, well we could see that on the internet now. Also just one simulator was working in the museum and was very old and beaten.",
          "the place is quite easy to find because you go from the tram and pick up the sign at the end of the platform \"Let's visit Airbus \". Then just carry on walking in a straight line. You will go over a bridge and then you will see Concorde that \u2026",
          "Not really good... better watch youtube A380 making..",
          "Tour in English, good. It takes a little time to adjust to the accent, but once you've adapted, the guide is easy to understand.\nThere's a restaurant, just one, on site. One the way between the parking lot and the visit. But don't count on \u2026",
          "Superbe. A lot of planes on display and open for watching in details. Very nice moment. Must to do.",
          "Truly not worth the time it takes to get there and definitely not worth the price. 85% of the tour was spent looking at videos on a TV, videos that they could easily put on the website. The only good part was when it was finally over. Waste of time and money",
          "Iinteresting visit of the factory of Airbus A380...good explication of the plane construction process..nice history of the A380...and the best is inside the factory with view on the construction of the plane, and at the end visit of \u2026",
          "A good tour. Extensive. They don't allow any photos and this is a shame. Book in advance to get the english tour but if you can't then there is a leaflet which gives he gist of things.",

          "Airbus factory visit very amazing",

          "Probably the best museum dedicated to commercial aviation in the world.",
          "The opportunity to visit the Airbus site is obviously excellent, but the actual tour was a little bit disappointing - partly because it's focused on the A380 plant which is almost mothballed, while all the new production is focused on \u2026",
          "Very nice",
          "Interesting must do",
          "Superb. If you are lucky you will see a beluga taking off \ud83d\ude00",
          "Not bad for aeroplane nutters. The planes waiting restoration just past the restaurant was the best as you can get up close and touch as opposed to the roped off areas of the official displays",
          "Very good to see and hear about Airbus. Obviously we would like to get closer to the factories but we understand about security too.",
          "Nice tour ... however they do not show assembly line of A380 ... only testing facility shown ... nobody was working there when i  visited",
          "Prise \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 ... you cant go inside \u2708 at all. You will see far distance inside your tour . Not allowed taje photos . No site views  . You can google all information what they given in tour .  ..much better to go airport and look 380 takeoff.. \nOnly allowed photos when u see military plane..",
          "I did the A380 tour, while it was not the most extensive tour you still got a nice view of the factory and a very knowledgeable guide. Be sure to check out the aerospace museum that's in the same place. It has some cool planes in it such as the first production prototype Concorde.",
          "Not as good as the Boeing tour. Visited the soon to close A380 line.",
          "Excellent. Informative. Hubby loved it. A380 tour. Nice gift shop on site too. English speaking tour guide. Great",
          "So let me sum up what I found out during my A380 tour package here. \n\nIf you have huge interest in aviation and have experience visiting other aircraft factories, the tour package here can be very disappointing : you don\u2019t walk along the \u2026",
          "The tour is only OK. Half the tour is driving the bus around the assembly hall. After this, visitors can see half assembled planes through the visitors window. A guide supports this with shallow information about Airbus. However, detailed \u2026",
          "You get to see the Airbus factory and see how the planes are made. Really cool. English tour available.",
          "Great tour , good tour guide he had a lot of experience and knowledge. We did the a350 tour that brought us up to the final assembly line.",
          "Anyone visiting Toulouse, should go and visit Airbus once. I recommend taking the full tour including a visit to the assembly line. Staff is knowledgeable, Museum will give you plenty of fun for at least two hours and is a nice place to visit for families and adults alike.",

          "Interesting for young and old to watch history being made\ud83d\ude09\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Exceptionally disappointed,  Exceptionally poor value for money. Would absolutely not recommend anyone take a visit.",
          "Great experience for all the aviation lovers. And not only Awesome overview of how the planes are made and put together. Very interesting. Shame you cannot actually enter the manufacturing area!",
          "We enjoyed ourselves and it's an experience to visit while in the area. They could make it better by having a better booking process and perhaps making one complete tour.\n\nThe Boeing tour seemed a bit better",
          "Petfect place to all of thoose who is interesting in engineering. For understood reasons it is not allowed to take pictures, but the view is awsome.",
          "Visiting the A380 site was very interesting. Although the visitor centre is located in a few containers next to the site the tour was very interesting and you get to see the control room of an airbus test site, the hangar where the A380 is assembled and the interior of a A380 mock-up. ",
          "Good little tour, got to see the A380 from the balcony. Guide was very good. She helped my friend who wasn't very well. He didn't enjoy the tour as much as the rest though. I would recommend",
          "The tour costs about 15 euros each and must be booked in advance ( >2 working days before for any non-EU citizen) with presentation of your passport on arrival. It is quite easy to get to and to avoid going to the wrong Airbus building \u2026",
          "Very interesting!",
          "Great experience for kids aviation enthusiasts pilots and student pilots for about 15 euro each",
          "Disappointed!!! They will show you the factory from a 50 meter tall  glass room.... You can hardly see things happening at the production...\n      Most of the time they will show you videos on the screen. It's kind of misleading the \u2026",
          "very nice place, has all the historical planes you want to see",
          "I have been through the Boeing tour, which I felt was more comprehensive than this one, since we were able to view the assembly process from multiple angles. This one is certainly different and the plane built here is much larger. Still interesting albeit procey",
          "The tour is great. You get to see a lot of airplaenes, sometimes even different types. The guid was wonderful, and explained interesring things.",
          "Best experience ever! The girl that guided us was clear and all was well explained.",
          "I'm really passionate about commercial aviation, and usually spend my whole holidays visiting aviation museum and taking scenic flight. The tour of Airbus factory was really disappointing. Paid a lot of money for two guided tours: in the \u2026",
          "Not worth visiting...if really want to visit... Go to aerospace.",

          "Need to book online. Not much to see, just video presentation and view empty factory from walkway on top of factory areas.",
          "Somehow disappointed. Very short guided tour. Not much interesting. Museum is also very poor. Difficult to understand which package to choose for the visit (Airbus, Aeroscopia, 350, 380, etc)",
          "The Campus is pretty interesting however the tour id very short and the Museum is the true highlight.",
          "not worth it. Kinda waste of time and money. Very short excursion to actual site, you not actually allowed there, and it is about 15 min from locked balcony behind glass. Not even photo allowed!!! And practically that is it. The rest is \u2026",
          "Tour is only ok. Photos prohibited and that was disappointing. Most of the time you are on the bus just 'passing-by'. I feel that this can be improved by allowing a special part where we can take photos for keepsake. Don't Google maps your \u2026",

          "Great experience",
          "The A380 site visit was a little disappointing, a lot of talk about things any aviation estusiast know ten years ago,  but a nice view of the final a380 assembly hangar and flightline with varios a350 too. ",
          "I was so eager to visit the Airbus factory, but it was such a disappointment and a rip off!\nI tried to book the tour of the factory + the A380 assembly line tour in English as my partner doesn\u2019t speak French and it is basically impossible \u2026",

          "I was so looking forward to the A380 tour, but finally it did not meet my expectations.\n\nFirst, I opted to go for the English tour, as my French are not that good for the moment. That was a big mistake, as the level of English of the guide \u2026",

          "Overall, an average experience.  You get a view to the A380 assembly room from a window and  a ca 30 min commented movie from A380 maiden flight. No real walk through the factory, photographing forbidden. You can get much more from visiting the museum at the same spot.",

          "When I was in Toulouse, I hopped right into time to visit A380 tour, which was very nice. Unfortunately there were only 2 far A380's inside, but that's not something you can really choose. Other 2 that were currently in production were outside in testing phase. Our tour guide",
          "If you don't speak and read fluent French, you will learn more with an hour on Wikipedia and YouTube about the history of aviation in France. The audio guide barely worked and was clunky to drag around. The staff was clueless and not particularly friendly. And the collection",
          "Although we were warned in advance, not only through TripAdvisor but by our local B&B as well, the only tour available on short notice was the panoramic one... and it is a waste of time and money. Though the english speaking tour guide does her best, and is very knowledgeable,",
          "We only had time to do the A380 tour today but wish we had seen the museum too. True that you need a little aviation geek in you to really enjoy this although I'm sure your regular plane passenger would be impressed by the care & detail taken in assembly and testing of these",
          "We bought our tickets through their website and (as most people do) just 'checked' the general conditions tab without reading....this way we missed the statement of mandatory identifications documents which we did not bring on our roundtrip and thus got refused access without",
          "Difficult to find this place but once there, quite well organised. We did the Airbus factory tour and got a view of the assembly platform. Saw some interesting videos and heard about some amazing facts. The museum was great and housed a number of aircrafts including the Concorde",
          "I was so eager to visit the Airbus factory, but it was such a disappointment and a rip off! I tried to book the tour of the factory + the A380 assembly line tour in English as my partner doesn\u2019t speak French and it is basically impossible to have them both tours in English on",
          "Fantastic experience ! There is one very very important thing : you must boom it 3-5 days before your visit, otherwise only you can visit the museum (which is also vey very good)",
          "With it's size of 20 football fields, A380's assembly hall is a mean monster. Accompanied by astonishing facts about the A380 development etc will keep you on your toes for 1,5 hours. Why didn't I give it 5 stars? Because at the time I visited the site, only 2 planes were being",
          "Great trip for anyone interested in aviation. Loads to see and do, interactive displays, real planes, including Concorde - which you can board and imagine what it must have been like to fly on this amazing aircraft. A really enjoyable experience for all.",
          "Relatively interesting tour, not something crazy though. The souvenir shop does not offer something very interesting unless you are a aviation fanatic.",
          "A must see for flight enthousiasts, little bit pricey but worth it. we took the tour in french, english was only possible at theend of the day. Would we nicer if they had offered headphones....",
          "Great aeroplane museum well worth the effort to get out there. Found this better than the A380 Tour although I did enjoy the tour. I just found the museum more interesting. Great to see the assembly plant for the A380. Very informative. You can use public transport to get out",
          "We learned about the whole process how to produce an A380. The tour was informative and give an insight to Airbus business. Impressive assembly hangar!!",
          "The tour including the factory visit to the A380 plant was very good and informative, I would reccommend this tour",
          "Good time discovering the facilities of Airbus, enjoyed the souvenirs shop. Only wish we could get closer to the planes",
          "Si usted NO es Europeo debe esperar 2 d\u00edas para que se verifique su identidad. Luego de lo cual PODRIA hacer el Tour. Esto no aparece indicado en la gu\u00eda de turismo de Toulouse. Uno es informado de esto al momento de iniciar el pago de la visita a AIRBUS. Esta situacion no est\u00e1",
          "It is nice to visit if you have time before your flight. They number of crafts display were limited. There were two concorde, a400m and a300. You cannot find antuque airplanes. 30 minutes to 1 hr is enough",
          "a 90 minute tour on making of the airbus A380. Good value for money. Both French and English version available. The tour guides are extremely pleasant and answered our questions to our satisfaction. PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU ARE AT THE RECEPTION 30 MINUTES PRIOR TO THE START OF YOUR",
          "The Airbus facility is only opened for business visitors, except for some study groups. But it is an eye opener for those privileged to visit. The facilities are huge.",
          "The Tour centre is now located in the same reception building as the Aerospace Museum, not at the separate building which has been demolished and is no longer there. It means that you can go on the tour and then go round the Museum which has two Concordes, an Airbus and a",
          "Was so exciting to see the A380 assembly line and aircrafts that are ready for delivery. Also saw a few A350s. This tour is a must see for any real aviation enthusiast. Also see a Air France Concorde up close, all with the backdrop of the Toulouse Airport. Amazing sights.",
          "Visited the place in a group of professionals from the air & space industry, and while they were impressed, they kept complaining it was too simple and the guide would not answer many of their too technical or commercial questions. All right, but I am a layman, and in my terms,",
          "We found and parked up at Let's Visit Airbus and checked in for our tour, which started a bit late due to a missing bus. We were taken to the A380 factory and given a talk about where the various components are built before going 20m up in a lift to a platform overlooking the",
          "We traveled from Barcelona to Toulouse to visit Airbus as one of the main reasons, and we were a bit disappointed with the Airbus 380 tour. Granted the airplane itself is impressive and the assembly hangar too, but besides that and the explanation about the complicated",
          "The key thing is to make sure you choose the right tour for you. We went on the visit to the A380 production line. Some reviewers seem to have gone on the Panoramic tour which does not go inside any buildings, and been disappointed. If you're keen on aviation like me you will",
          "We took the panoramic tour in English. The guide was very knowledgeable and told us a lot about Airbus in general and the aircraft in particular. However, the tour takes 90 minutes and it is by bus, you do not get off at all which was a shame, would have been nice to have at",
          "Definitely highly recommended! Very interesting and unique place to visit. Some people may complain you can admire some parts of Airbus halls from big distance, but in my opinion it should be totally understandable as Airbus is one of the biggest and one of the most protected",
          "I went on the Panoramic tour expecting to be driven around the newly built Airbuses and yes you do see quite a few but the coach seemed to stop in some very funny places and drove past areas with better views.",
          "Anyone interested in know more about Airbus and the aircraft industry will be delighted with this visit.",
          "Have been before and will go again......the Panoramic tour is the best, the A380 tour really is a waste of money in my book.",
          "Took both the factory tour and the panoramic tour (English language) & both were very informative courtesy of a knowledgeable guide. The gallery in the factory, overlooking the production line and where there were several videos shown, was quite warm & stuffy with very limited",
          "Need to book online at least a few days before the visit and you really need to arrive 30 minutes before. Don't forget your ID or passport (driving license is not accepted!). The tour lasts about an hour an a half . Starts with a short bus ride to the A380 assembly hall. After a",
          "I had read some negative reviews here, so wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I'm glad to say I enjoyed my visit very much. Also would like to add that I had visited the Boeing factory in Seattle which was a similar tour and enjoyed a lot, but I think the Airbus one was even",
          "Having read some off the reports I find them somewhat harsh. Yes it would be nice to go inside an A350 and an A380 and take photos but you can`t but don`t let that put you off from going. Having flown nice class with Emirates last year on a 380 I experienced by far the best",
          "Was a second time for me, first time for my husband. A380 Factory Tour - Interesting facts well presented by tour guide. Enormous work space filled with the aircraft they are assembling for the month - quite mind boggling after you have seen the convoi excepssional - moving",
          "Tried to book factory tour online before travelling to Toulouse, only to find site under construction. So decided to book when we got there, but was told had to book online in advance. Bought tickets for museum. First audio visual display giving history all in French with no",
          "It is difficult to underestimate my excitement for my visit as I am a huge fan of Airbus and have nothing but admiration for their product. When in toulouse what's to do but make sure you take a tour. What a let down. The pre-tour briefing was informative and the guide in",
          "Let's visit Airbus comprises three tours - the A380 tour, the Panorama tour (of other Airbus sites) and a Green tour. I took the A380 tour in English which showed an interesting video of the first flight, diagrams of where component parts are produced etc, and being transported",
          "The tour is very interesting, but kind of expensive. They give you a lot of information with the guide and the video projections, but you don't get to SEE much. Also the group was very large and this was kind of unconfortable, because there were kids and stupid people. The",
          "If you don't mind the 25minute walk from the Tram stop at Ardenes (look carefully for the \"Lets visit Airbus\" signs) the panoramic bus tour followed by the A380 technical tour is informative. The guides are knowledgeable and friendly tackling all sorts of tough questions Be sure",
          "We (family of 4 - 2 kids aged 13 & 9yrs) found this tour really interesting and worth making the effort to visit. The kids loved the Airbus tour and were presented with information and insight into something they wouldn't see at home and was a change from water parks for just a",
          "... or so said the Eastern European couple went met at the Androm\u00e8de-Lyc\u00e8e tram stop after their 'Let's Visit Airbus' tour, and as we tried to find directions to this site outside Toulouse. They were right - don't expect much. Positives: seeing video of the first test flight",
          "Went to Toulouse especially to see Airbus... Surely one of Europe (and Frances) most exciting companies. If you want a tour you need to sign up 2 weeks before, no chance when you are there on the spot. The visitor center is housed in what looks like a temporary makeshift",
          "Booking online is essential, as tours are numbered and fill up quickly. Upon checkin for our tour, our passports were checked and we were advised that no cameras are permitted, and i as i did not have a car to place my camera in, i had to surrender my camera to the checkin",
          "First, it's not fair to compare this to the Boeing tour. This is about one plane the 380. Boeing was about the history of their planes, with a museum and a film as well as a view of the assembly line. That said, the 380 tour was pretty lame. They only let you see planes that",
          "Nice to see some of the inner workings of Airbus but quite expensive for two tours which you, unfortunately, need to book to really see it all.",
          "Some friend and I visited the Airbus Factory at Toulouse airport, while staying in the city for a long weekend. The tours start from a rather inconsequential-looking building, just outside the main entrance to the Airbus factory. There is a bigger museum under construction,",
          "Took the A380 tour. The tour included an introductory talk by the guide follow by a visit in the assembly hangar where you watch from far. You can find out more on A380 on YouTube than taking this tour. Not worth the money unless you just want to see the assembly hangar with",
          "Fantastic tour. Excellently put together, we could only get onto a French speaking tour but our guide was also English speaking and kept us well informed. Tour left on time but made sure we saw every aircraft in production or completed. The mock A380 was excellent and my 11 year",
          "Before making this visit with friends, I naturally checked the Tripadvisor reports and far too many seemed to be coming in on the negative side, so I wasn't expecting much. However, this was a great way to spend 90 minutes, see some incredible manufacturing (the scale of the",
          "We had booked on the tour as had done the Boeing tour in Everitt, Seattle and expected similar. Guide was very knowledgeable, answering any questions as we went along - tour was approx hour and a half. Started in a room giving history of how the Airbus A380 came about, and",
          "I had read the reviews for the A380 tour and didn\u2019t expect much, and that is exactly what you get. It is all quite dull and uninteresting, even for a plane fan as myself. They need to seriously up their game if they want people to enjoy themselves. Nothing exciting happens, no",
          "I enjoyed the visit, particularly the first section where the first test flight was re-enacted. Having flown on the A380 a number of times, I did not find the mock cabin very interesting. The guides were very informative though, and I found a number of interesting things in",
          "I agree with everything MarkTBrizzy has said. The 'control room' section was second rate. You'd think Airbus had the resources to provide, for English-speaking tours, an English soundtrack for the sequence of cockpit conversations during the maiden flight - particularly since",
          "The tour was very predictable and the information given was no more than you could have read from the information on the posters. Very disappointing really, I think they just want people there to spend money in the gift shop!",
          "I did the A380 tour at lets visit Airbus today with my two sons (11 and 16), the company offers 2 more tours but we choose this. The tour starts with a 30 minutes wait in the gift shop and afterwards a short introduction to the A380 and first flight in a mockup control room.",
          "Just a very 'happening' place. As an amateur pilot it interested me. The tour guide was thorough and interesting. We saw the amazing new A380 Airbus, capable of carrying over 800 people.",
          "Being a plane lover, I was excited to visit the Airbus factory. Big let down. We did the A380 tour. The visit starts with a 30 minute wait, with not much other than a souvenir shop to pass the time by. Then you're taken into a room to watch a video of one of the first test",
          "We toured with a friend who works for Airbus. It was incredible to see the world's largest commercial aircraft, the A380, being built in the world's 2nd largest factory building (only the Boeing factory is larger!)"

        "wiki": "Fort Toulouse (Muscogee: Franca choka chula), also called Fort des Alibamons and Fort Toulouse des Alibamons, is a historic fort near the city of Wetumpka, Alabama, United States, that is now maintained by the Alabama Historical Commission. The French founded the fort in 1717, naming it for Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse. In order to counter the growing influence of the British colonies of Georgia and Carolina, the government of French Louisiana erected a fort on the eastern border of the Louisiana Colony in what is now the state of Alabama.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe fort was also referred to as the Post of the Alabama, named after the Alabama tribe of Upper Creek Indians, who resided just below the confluence of the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the Alabama River.\nThe number of troops in garrison varied between 20 and 50 French Colonial Marines.  Living and working at the fort, the Marines traded extensively with the local Creek Native Americans and cultivated friendly relations with them.  The French would trade European goods such as Flintlock guns, ammunition, and gunpowder, iron tools, knives, glass beads, copper pots, and wool blankets in exchange for local food stuffs, fur and deerskins. According to tradition, the French commander Captain Jean Baptiste Louis DeCourtel Marchand married the high-status Creek woman Sehoy in about 1720. Later generations of Sehoy's descendants include the Creek chiefs Alexander McGillivray, and William Weatherford, who inherited their status in the matrilineal tribe from their mothers' clans.\nDue to the poor living conditions at the fort, which was neglected by the French government, the troops mutinied in 1722. They killed Captain Marchand and captured the other officers, tying them up before leaving the fort.  The imprisoned officers managed to escape, and with the help of nearby Creek, they captured the mutineers and sent them to Fort Conde in Mobile for punishment.\nBy the early 1740s, conditions had improved at the fort.  Many soldiers had married French women from Mobile or intermarried with the local Creek.  They and other settlers developed numerous farms nearby, which led to improved food supplies. The humid climate caused deterioration of the fort by the late 1740s, and the French planned for a third fort to be built. Under the direction of Captain Francois Saucier, soldiers finished the reconstruction of Fort Toulouse about 1751.  It cost nearly half of the military budget for the whole Louisiana colony.\nIn 1763 the Treaty of Paris ended the French and Indian War. As the French had been defeated by the British and ceded their territory, the French garrison spiked their cannons and left for New Orleans and an eventual return to France for some. The British chose not to occupy the Fort, which eventually collapsed into decay. In 1776 the naturalist William Bartram noted visiting the area while studying local flora and fauna.\nDuring the War of 1812 and the simultaneous Creek War, General Andrew Jackson encamped his troops on the site of the old Fort Toulouse.  He ordered construction of a larger fort, which was named Fort Jackson by General Joseph Graham in honor of Jackson's victories against the Creek and in the Battle of New Orleans.\n\n\n== Fort Toulouse-Fort Jackson State Historic Site ==\n\nThe site was declared a National Historic Landmark by the Department of Interior in 1960. During the American Bicentennial, local groups supported reconstruction of Fort Toulouse. But the replica was incorrectly built upon the outline of the much larger Fort Jackson rather than the historic French fort.\nIn the 1980s the park was acquired by the Alabama Historical Commission.  It dismantled the incorrect replica and constructed a replica of Fort Toulouse near its original site. This will allow for a future reconstruction of Ft. Jackson on its site (occupied successively by the two forts).  Archeological excavations have been continuing at the site, supervised by Dr. Craig Sheldon of Auburn University at Montgomery.\nThe Fort Toulouse-Fort Jackson State Historic Site has living history programs to portray and interpret the lives of the Creek inhabitants, the French colonists and the U.S. military troops associated with the War of 1812. The fort is located southwest of Wetumpka, off of U.S. Highway 231.\nThe site also features the Taskigi Mound or \"Mound at Fort Toulouse \u2013 Fort Jackson Park\" (1EE1) a prehistoric South Appalachian Mississippian culture palisaded village with a central plaza area, and a rectangular platform mound. The mound is one of the locations included on the University of Alabama Museums \"Alabama Indigenous Mound Trail\".\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of National Historic Landmarks in Alabama\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHeldman, Donald P.  \"Fort Toulouse of the Alabamas and the Eighteenth-Century Indian Trade\".

          "I love walking around here - it's really cute and plenty of walking and biking trails all around to enjoy yourself! Bring a blanket and relax or even dip your feet in the river as well. Have fun!",
          "This is off below and to the side of this bridge downtown. Has a beautiful little canal, a fully paved sidewalk, and some railings around, so don't fall in. Really nice view from above. Great area to walk through (or possibly sit and chill) and enjoy the sounds of the water",
          "Not a lot going on here in winter. If you\u2019re there for the snow like I was, then you\u2019ll enjoy it. Full of dog walkers, runners/joggers, family\u2019s. Would like to see it in the summer.",
          "I love this park! People walk dogs, play frisbee, skate, play ball and even get in the water and canoe! It is definitely worth it. Walk to REI and it is right there. Enjoy!",
          "It's a decent place to spend some time looking at the running water and taking a walk but I've been to better places.",
          "This park has recently been upgraded with wider pathways and park benches. New residential development on the eat side creates an urban canyon feel. The Platte River is navigable for rafts and kayaks with a custom built water chute. Cyclists can choose from several bike path",
          "This is a lovely (long and narrow) park between Union Station and the South Platt River. Parts were lovely and well maintained grassy areas while a few parts seem to attract \u201cun-stable\u201d type of folks. As with any large city, Denver has worked hard to develop attractive urban",
          "Very nice park and trail system. You can get in the river or cherry creek to wade. There is a set of rapids to enjoy.",
          "This wasn't on my list of places to stop at in Denver, but I'm really happy to have inadvertently found it during my travels in the Mile High City. If the weather is cooperating, there are several places to enjoy the scenery while in the shadows of downtown. I took my lunch",
          "Enjoyed watching the waters come together. Lots of dogs in the water. Lots of places to just hang out.",
          "We always like to stop here and go to REI grab a Starbucks and sit and watch the people, it\u2019s a nice place to just sit and stare for a while",
          "We wanted to see the original REI building and also see Confluence Park. What a hidden oasis in the city! People were rafting over the Platte River, wading in the more shallow areas and lots of dogs were enjoying the water as well as the beautiful park. We were able to wading",
          "At the park there is an REI store - BUT.... the real value here is looking at the architecture. In the Starbucks (inside REI) there are old photos of the building which used to be the electricity generating station for the Denver Trams - it is AMAZING! All the old beams are",
          "This park is really a lovely way to escape the city. Tons of dogs romping in the river and a people watching prime location. We were there on Memorial Day, so it was crowded right by the REI store, but we rented bikes there and rode off to explore the park in both directions.",
          "There were a lot of people walking, biking, sitting on the grass, and just enjoying the day. Nice charming park spread out with water flowing through it. Lots of bikes and scooters available. Some very good graffiti as well.",
          "I am old enough to remember when this area was just ugly urban blight and the only people who hung out there were the homeless. That began to change when the Platte River Trail was put in in the early 80's. Denver continued to invest a lot in revitalizing the area, constructing",
          "This park is just near the REI store (across a bridge there) and at one end of downtown. Easy access too from near Elitches and the end of downtown to the West. There are a series of waterways there and even some rapids that have been created for water activities. There are a",
          "Everyone should check out this park at some point. We were on a bike ride and stopped to read informational signs and check out the pretty site of the creek. My son had gone there on a field trip and so was educating me further on history. There were representatives from RX Bars",
          "Pleasantly surprised by this lovely spot in downtown Denver. It was all covered in snow when I visited but the atmosphere was great. Despite the weather, people were enjoying the outdoors walking dogs and sliding down the hill with a sledge. Great place to spend a few hours.",
          "This is a charming area to visit. Can you believe that in Denver, CO we actually have a BEACH??? Well, we do! Go visit it.",
          "take some time walk around , good for all family and ages . take back pack lunch and enjoy it by the river",
          "In-the-know Denver dogs take their owners to this park at the confluence of the South Platte River and Cherry Creek, to wear their owners out with running, chasing, splashing, and swimming. Just downstream you may also see an angler casting a line, or just upstream watch some",
          "Confluence is a good place to relax by the water. If it is a hot day, maybe you would consider putting feet in the water too, but I am not really sure where the water is coming from...It is connected to other parks (btw Denver Parks are awesome!!!) along the river, so it would",
          "If you want to see people out and about, this is the place to go. If I lived in this area, I'd bring our doggies here as often as we could. If you want to people watch, do that here. If you want to read a book on the grass, or even take a nap, you can do that here as well.",
          "That\u2019s about it. Maybe before all the condos were built up around here the area was nicer. Not a destination.",
          "If you keep walking down 16th street you will come to the looming Millennial Bridge and after that Confluence Park. This parks overlooks the junction of South Platte River And Cherry Creek. It also gives a terrific view of the backend of downtown Denver.",
          "Nice area that has been redeveloped. There are walkways, some bridges- places to walk, ride a bike, picnic or dip you feet in the Platte River. You can even rent a kayak. Several good places to eat or get a craft beer nearby. Easy access by taking the mall shuttle to the end",
          "We stopped by here after having ice cream at little man ice cream on the way out of Denver. We parked at a meter near REI and walked up the trail next to the creek for a good ways. It was gorgeous. We even saw a river rat, which was hilarious because we didn't expect it. It's",
          "I've been to Denver a couple of time... not my favorite USA city. But I love Confluence Park. Nice river, outstanding REI store, Starbucks (if memory is correct) to buy a coffee and pastry to sit by the river and enjoy. We walked to here from the center of Denver but took a Lyft",
          "This is an interesting park right in the middle of the downtown area. It sits on a river. Some rapids and some good scenery. Nice to see a bit of nature in the middle of the city. There does tend to a few homeless people about if you get off the trails. Some people were also",
          "If you are a fan of REI definitely recommend coming to this location. I used to think the one in salt lake was really well stocked until i came to this location where its housed in a three story factory building with as much variety as the salt lake location. Now as to the park",
          "A dirty and run down park with plenty of homeless people, not the place where I want to spend time...",
          "This is a really pretty park right on the Confluence River in Denver. Unfortunately, when my friends and I went, they were doing some construction so it took away from it's beauty a bit but it was still a really lovely walk. There are great pathways and lots of open space to sit",
          "Unfortunately, this beautiful area as well as Riverfront Front Park havd been compromised by people frequently petitioning for Planned Parenthood (Save the Children are further up 16th Street), dog owners that don't pick up their dog crap, and bums and other people that don't",
          "They are currently topping out a 30 something story building so it is a little blighted with the construction work going on (and noisy). Sometimes there are festivals here and this is where the Platte River and Cherry Creek bike trails converge.",
          "While Denver has many pretty city parks, this one just happens to be in downtown. Worth a stop if exploring nearby 16th St. You can relax and enjoy the park before yo walk over to the many good restaurants in the LoHi area nearby or grab some ice cream at Little Man's after",
          "We stopped by here when we had a couple hours to kill in Denver. The weather was a little dreary and it was late in the day, so we didn't partake in any tubing or kayaking--there was a guy practicing SUP against some rapids but he was the only one in the water. There is a",
          "I have a condo just a few hundred yards from Confluence Park, and while I don't live in the condo any longer, it is a great draw to my renters. Fun atmosphere and it is great to go there for some of the different events that they have. On a busy day you can watch the kayakers.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed Confluence Park! What an awesome little park in the middle of the city. The trolley ride was fun and informative, with drop offs at the Aquarium and Children's Museum.",
          "Family with kids age 8 and 14. Very cool area if you are interested in white water rafting, kayaking, tubes or paddle boards. Great place to try out equipment- Confluence Kayak store representatives were there with rafts, life jackets and helmets for everyone to try out for",
          "This is a downtown park that every other major city should be jealous of. It is free, it is beautiful, and it is a lot of fun. I highly recommend anyone who loves natural beauty visit this park and picnic there and take the time to wade in the rivers",
          "Confluence Park is a delightful space in downtown Denver. Lots of opportunities for relaxing, playing, walking, biking, etc. Worth the stop if you are on a budget staying downtown Denver.",
          "Wonderful little park area with a beach as well as a park. At this point where the two rivers meet, you can ride down the small rapids in either a kayak or an innertube. Those using a tube said the ride was a little bumpy but still fun. Shallow areas for dogs or small kids as"

          "The Theatre du Capitole sits prominently at one side of the large public square of the Place du Capitole. It functions as the city hall and houses administrative offices and functions. The entrance comprises a rather grand staircase that leads up to large rooms housing paintings",
          "We only had a day in Toulouse, and hadn't known about this place. But we saw the building from the Place du Capitole, and went inside to have a look. It was full of wonderful massive murals and equally impressive statues, room after room of them, all connected with the history",
          "If the capitol building is open, it is free to go in and see the incredible murals and sculptures. You will have to go through security first where they check your bag, coat, purse, etc. I had a bottle of water in my back pack, but they were ok with letting me keep it. There",

          "Like much of Toulouse, this place promises much but delivers little. You can go into 2 or 3 rooms with some old paintings on the walls, but they are pretty mundane. Don't bother. In fact, give Toulouse a miss altogether if you have a choice, it's a filthy, smelly place with",

          "A great classical opera house interior with very comfortable seats and good acoustic. Well worth seeing.",
          "On the whole I love going to the opera but here I am always disapointed by the places available. Unless you book on the first day of ticket opening the view is often poor and the stqff are unable to advise whether the scenes will be visible or not. I prefer The Halle au Grain.",

        "wiki": "Toulouse (, too-LOOZ; French: [tuluz] (listen); Occitan: Tolosa [tu\u02c8luzo]; Latin: Tolosa [to\u02c8lo\u02d0sa]) is the capital of the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km (143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean and 680 km (420 mi) from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France, with 479,553 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (as of January 2017), and 1,360,829 inhabitants within its wider metropolitan area (also as of January 2017), after Paris, Lyon and Marseille, and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.\nToulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus (formerly EADS), the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It also hosts the European headquarters of Intel and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe. Thales Alenia Space, ATR, SAFRAN, Liebherr-Aerospace and Airbus Defence and Space also have a significant presence in Toulouse.\nThe University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 103,000 students, it is the fourth-largest university campus in France, after the universities of Paris, Lyon and Lille.The air route between Toulouse\u2013Blagnac and Paris Orly is the busiest in Europe, transporting 2.4 million passengers in 2014. According to the rankings of L'Express and Challenges, Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the Occitanie region, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.\nToulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname La Ville Rose (The Pink City).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nToulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nToulouse has a temperate humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified as a Mediterranean climate zone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age.\nThe historical name of the city, Tolosa (\u03a4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian, or from Iberian, but has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages.Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost.\nAfter the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city of Gallia Narbonensis. In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 (Battle of Vouill\u00e9).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n\n=== County of Toulouse ===\n\nThe town became the capital of the County of Toulouse during the Carolingian era.\nIn 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders.\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the military crusade, such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the Southern French Gothic.\nIn 1215 the Dominican Order was founded in Toulouse by Saint Dominic in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\nIn the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs, were started. They found home in Les Jacobins. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital.\n\n\n=== Within the Kingdom of France ===\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the kingdom of France and declared a \"royal city\". In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years. The Consistori del Gay Saber is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\nThe 14th century brought a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population by Crusaders in 1320, the Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years' War. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.The situation improved in the 15th century. Charles VII established the second parliament of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of pastel, a blue dye made from woad. The fortune generated by this international trade was at the origin of several of Toulouse's superb Renaissance mansions.\n\n\n=== Within the French Republic ===\nThe Battle of Toulouse (1814) was one of the final battles of the Napoleonic Wars, four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition.\nToulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by Marshal Soult.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of the city proper (French: commune) was 479,553 at the January 2017 census, with 1,360,829 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,187,686 at the January 2007 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area). Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.4% per year between 2007 and 2017, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2007 censuses.\nToulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\nFueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for metropolitan France), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.\nA local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Toulouse M\u00e9tropole ===\n\nThe Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Toulouse) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent communes, covering an area of 380 km2 (147 sq mi), totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communaut\u00e9 urbaine). This has become a m\u00e9tropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes.\n\n\n=== Local politics ===\n\nOne of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (Halle aux Grains) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (Z\u00e9nith, the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace was founded, etc.\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen.\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nToulouse has many interesting churches, but three of them are of remarkable architectural and historical interest.\nSaint-Sernin Basilica, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest remaining Romanesque church in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by Charlemagne to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\nCathedral of Saint Stephen is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\nThe convent of the Jacobins (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the Albi Cathedral, the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the Dominican order, for not having obtained the relics of Saint Dominic kept in Bologna, Pope Urban V made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar Saint Thomas Aquinas, one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Civilian buildings ===\n\nThe Capitole de Toulouse (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole (opera house). It is located on the Place du Capitole, a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (place royale). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th-century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (le donjon), which housed the archives of the Capitouls; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called h\u00f4tels particuliers) or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat, the H\u00f4tel de Bernuy, the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, the H\u00f4tel de Bagis...\n\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n\nThe banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the Pont-Neuf, it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the H\u00f4pital de La Grave. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe Jardin des Plantes is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a botanical garden (early 19th century).\nThe Cit\u00e9 de l'espace (Space City) is a theme park of space exploration.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nSights and monuments of Toulouse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe main industries are aeronautics, space, electronics, information technology and biotechnology.

It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Ar\u00e8nes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named \"Gare des Capelles\", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened.

          "One can spend a small boat trip on Canal Du Midi, by choosing this option. Either you can sit out in the sun or inside. There are English translations on the tour available which is handed ahead and as said by everyone, there is no English commentary. The water doesn't look",
          "For so long I had wanted to see the Canal du Midi and this trip was recommended by central Tourist Office. Despite promoting that there is English guide offered on their web page this was not the case. They had a few booklets in English but they pertained to the Garonne & not",
          "It is a simple tour along the river. There is not much to see, but the view is pleasant and worth some good photos if you take the night boat. The guide only speaks in French. At least a handout with an English translation of the important information should be given.",
          "The boat only travels a little distance up and down the river and there is not much to see. The English handout is not informative and the whole trip lasts less than an hour. Not worth the cost.",
          "The English handout was pretty useless (agree with DetteGalway there) but the boat was sweet. However there really was nothing to see it was a pootle around the river - pleasant enough but only worth it if you truly have an hour to kill and nothing else better to do.",
          "Waste of time and money. Nothing to see. English handout useless. Wish I hadn't bothered. It is easily the worst thing I have done on a city tour ever!",
          "For a family outing this was fun. Easy to get on board and we didn't book in advance. Pros: You see the rivers and canals and locks of the Garonne in action Lots of history along the way Fun for kids on a boat Relaxing Cons: Guiding is only in French But you get a handout",
          "It is a nice tour to see the beautiful view and relax. However, the commentary is only in french and the website says that there is english commentary. The route is boring sometimes and the price is too expensive.",
          "This was a waste of time and money. The website told us it was available in English and Spanish and when we arrived we found it was only in french. We asked about the English and Spanish offered as stated on the website and we were given a handout which was a rough guide of the",
          "Canal du midi I took this boat trip with my husband and it was a tad on the boring side. All narrative was in French which is fine if you're French or have a better than a very basic understanding of it, but thinking about it being a tourist attraction I would have at least",
          "Yestarday we decided to take the \"bateaux toulosaine\" it takes 1.10 hours to travel in the Garonna River. First I saw you can book by internet and it is only 5 euros kids 12 or younger, and 10 euros adults, finally we took the subway and you can leave at capitol and you cross",
          "No need to book in advance. We walked down to the river and there it was. Plenty of room on board. Very pleasant and informative boat ride. I was surprised to learn that the openings next to the Pont Neuf arches are not only decorative but help the bridge from being swept away",
          "In summer, the cruise is on the Garonne river and the Brienne canal. The guiding is only in French, but then again - we are in France. A written summary of the main sights that the boat passes is offered in various languages (English, German, Italian, and Spanish). You get to",
          "A nice one hour trip through a very nice and scenic canal, and then back again. The guide spoke only French, however. At the start of the tour the guide came out and talked to us though, still in French only, and may or may not have asked us if we all spoke French. I guess we",
          "On a beautiful day of May, an enlightened cruise along the Canal du Midi, but by a visionary, in the 17th century. The cruise lasts about one hour & a half. From the boat, you can see a lot of places of interests, past & present, such a several bridges, pass over the autoroute,",
          "I can imagine this would be more pleasant on a hot sunny day, rather than blustery and cold - which was how it was for us. Rows of plastic white seats are crammed into the outdoor area of the boat and it felt a bit like a school trip (with plenty of students also on board).",
          "This cruise on the canal takes you through 3 lochs. 60% of it is scenic. It's a nice relaxing way to see how the lochs work and take in a few nice spots of Toulouse at the same time. Overall it was OK and staff were friendly but I'm not sure I'd rush to do it again",
          "This tour of a small part of the river & canal midi is picturesque & pleasant. Be aware that it is only offered in French & although they give you an English print out, it is just basic so you miss out on what is being described.",
          "I always try to remain positive when writing reviews but unfortunately that is not easily achieved when an attraction is so poorly designed and woeful. The boat is extremely uncomfortable due to all riders having to sit on unsecured extremely cheap plastic picnic chairs. They",
          "I sat near the very loud speaker, so check you don't do this. The awning meant I stayed cool which was lovely as it was a very hot day. The English translation provided in print bore little resemblance to the narration over the speakers. There's not loads to see apart from the"

        "wiki": "Toulouse (, too-LOOZ; French: [tuluz] (listen); Occitan: Tolosa [tu\u02c8luzo]; Latin: Tolosa [to\u02c8lo\u02d0sa]) is the capital of the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km (143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean and 680 km (420 mi) from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France, with 479,553 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (as of January 2017), and 1,360,829 inhabitants within its wider metropolitan area (also as of January 2017), after Paris, Lyon and Marseille, and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.\nToulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus (formerly EADS), the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It also hosts the European headquarters of Intel and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe. Thales Alenia Space, ATR, SAFRAN, Liebherr-Aerospace and Airbus Defence and Space also have a significant presence in Toulouse.\nThe University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 103,000 students, it is the fourth-largest university campus in France, after the universities of Paris, Lyon and Lille.The air route between Toulouse\u2013Blagnac and Paris Orly is the busiest in Europe, transporting 2.4 million passengers in 2014. According to the rankings of L'Express and Challenges, Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the Occitanie region, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.\nToulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname La Ville Rose (The Pink City).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nToulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nToulouse has a temperate humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified as a Mediterranean climate zone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age.\nThe historical name of the city, Tolosa (\u03a4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian, or from Iberian, but has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages.Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost.\nAfter the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city of Gallia Narbonensis. In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 (Battle of Vouill\u00e9).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n\n=== County of Toulouse ===\n\nThe town became the capital of the County of Toulouse during the Carolingian era.\nIn 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders.\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the military crusade, such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the Southern French Gothic.\nIn 1215 the Dominican Order was founded in Toulouse by Saint Dominic in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\nIn the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs, were started. They found home in Les Jacobins. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital.\n\n\n=== Within the Kingdom of France ===\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the kingdom of France and declared a \"royal city\". In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years. The Consistori del Gay Saber is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\nThe 14th century brought a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population by Crusaders in 1320, the Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years' War. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.The situation improved in the 15th century. Charles VII established the second parliament of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of pastel, a blue dye made from woad. The fortune generated by this international trade was at the origin of several of Toulouse's superb Renaissance mansions.\n\n\n=== Within the French Republic ===\nThe Battle of Toulouse (1814) was one of the final battles of the Napoleonic Wars, four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition.\nToulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by Marshal Soult.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of the city proper (French: commune) was 479,553 at the January 2017 census, with 1,360,829 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,187,686 at the January 2007 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area). Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.4% per year between 2007 and 2017, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2007 censuses.\nToulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\nFueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for metropolitan France), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.\nA local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Toulouse M\u00e9tropole ===\n\nThe Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Toulouse) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent communes, covering an area of 380 km2 (147 sq mi), totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communaut\u00e9 urbaine). This has become a m\u00e9tropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes.\n\n\n=== Local politics ===\n\nOne of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (Halle aux Grains) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (Z\u00e9nith, the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace was founded, etc.\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen.\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nToulouse has many interesting churches, but three of them are of remarkable architectural and historical interest.\nSaint-Sernin Basilica, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest remaining Romanesque church in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by Charlemagne to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\nCathedral of Saint Stephen is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\nThe convent of the Jacobins (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the Albi Cathedral, the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the Dominican order, for not having obtained the relics of Saint Dominic kept in Bologna, Pope Urban V made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar Saint Thomas Aquinas, one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Civilian buildings ===\n\nThe Capitole de Toulouse (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole (opera house). It is located on the Place du Capitole, a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (place royale). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th-century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (le donjon), which housed the archives of the Capitouls; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called h\u00f4tels particuliers) or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat, the H\u00f4tel de Bernuy, the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, the H\u00f4tel de Bagis...\n\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n\nThe banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the Pont-Neuf, it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the H\u00f4pital de La Grave. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe Jardin des Plantes is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a botanical garden (early 19th century).\nThe Cit\u00e9 de l'espace (Space City) is a theme park of space exploration.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nSights and monuments of Toulouse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe main industries are aeronautics, space, electronics, information technology and biotechnology. Toulouse hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320, A330, A350 and A380.  (A320 lines also exist in Hamburg, Germany, Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, USA.) Airbus has its head office in Blagnac, near Toulouse. Airbus's France division has its main office in Toulouse. Toulouse also hosts the headquarters of ATR, Sigfox, one of the two headquarters of Liebherr Aerospace and Groupe Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re.\nThe Concorde supersonic aircraft was also constructed in Toulouse.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nToulouse has the fourth-largest student population in France after Paris, Lyon and Lille with 103,000 students (2012).\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nThe University of Toulouse (Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse), established in 1229, is located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology\u2014inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts\u2014as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.\nCatholic University of Toulouse\nUniversit\u00e9 Toulouse I, Toulouse School of Economics, Toulouse School of Management and Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse\nUniversity of Toulouse-Jean Jaur\u00e8s (Formerly University of Toulouse II \u2013 Le Mirail)\nUniversit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III)Toulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:\n\nICAM Toulouse (Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers)\nINSA Toulouse\nISAE SUPAERO (Institut sup\u00e9rieur de l'a\u00e9ronautique et de l'espace)\nENAC (\u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile)\nINP ENSEEIHT (\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectronique, d'\u00c9lectrotechnique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique et des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications)\nENSFEA (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de formation de l\u2019enseignement agricole)\nINP ENSIACET (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs en art chimique et technologique)\nINP ENSAT ('\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure Agronomique de Toulouse)\nINP ENM (\u00c9cole Nationale de la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie)\nEPITA (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les techniques avanc\u00e9es)\nEPITECH (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies or European Institute of Information Technology)\nIPSA (Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avanc\u00e9es)\nEIPurpan (\u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Purpan)\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThe most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Sernin.\nInternational schools serving area expatriates are in nearby Colomiers:\n\nInternational School of Toulouse\nDeutsche Schule Toulouse (German school)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThe main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nIn addition to an extensive bus system, the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tired trains. Line A runs for 12.5 km (7.8 mi) from Balma-Gramont in the north-east to Basso Cambo in the south-west. Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaur\u00e8s.\nLine C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Ar\u00e8nes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named \"Gare des Capelles\", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened.

        "wiki": "Albi (French pronunciation: \u200b[albi]; Occitan: Albi [\u02c8al\u03b2i]) is a commune in southern France. It is the prefecture of the Tarn department, on the river Tarn, 85 km northeast of Toulouse. Its inhabitants are called Albigensians (French: Albigeois, Albigeoise(s), Occitan: albig\u00e9s -esa(s)). It is the seat of the Archbishop of Albi. The episcopal city, around the Cathedral Sainte-C\u00e9cile, was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 2010.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nAlbi is the seat of four cantons, covering 16 communes, with a total population of 71,281.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first human settlement in Albi was in the Bronze Age (3000\u2013600 BC). After the Roman conquest of Gaul in 51 BC, the town became Civitas Albigensium, the territory of the Albigeois, Albiga. Archaeological digs have not revealed any traces of Roman buildings, which seems to indicate that Albi was a modest Roman settlement.\nIn 1040, Albi expanded and constructed the Pont Vieux (Old Bridge). New quarters were built, indicative of considerable urban growth. The city grew rich at this time, thanks to trade and commercial exchanges, and also to the tolls charged to travelers for using the Pont Vieux.\nIn 1208, the Pope and the French king joined forces to combat the Cathars, who had developed their own version of ascetic Christian dualism, and so a heresy considered dangerous by the dominant Catholic Church. Repression was severe, and many Cathars were burnt at the stake throughout the region. The area, until then virtually independent, was reduced to such a condition that it was subsequently annexed by the French Crown.\nAfter the upheaval of the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars, the bishop Bernard de Castanet, in the late 13th century, completed work on the Palais de la Berbie, a Bishops' Palace with the look of a fortress. He ordered the building of the cathedral of Sainte-C\u00e9cile starting in 1282. The town enjoyed a period of commercial prosperity largely due to the cultivation of Isatis Tinctoria, commonly known as woad. The fine houses built during the Renaissance bear witness to the vast fortunes amassed by the pastel merchants.\nAlbi had a small Jewish community during medieval times, until it was annihilated in the 1320s Shepherds' Crusade. Ever since, Jews were only allowed to transit the town by payment, without living in it. In 1967, approximately 70 Jews lived in Albi, most of them of North-African origin.Albi has conserved its rich architectural heritage which encapsulates the various brilliant periods of its history. Considerable improvement and restoration work has been done, to embellish the old quarters and to give them a new look, in which brick reigns supreme.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\nAlbi was built around the original cathedral and episcopal group of buildings. This historic area covers 63 hectares. Red brick and tiles are the main feature of most of the edifices. Along with Toulouse and Montauban, Albi is one of the main cities built in Languedoc-style red brick.\nAmong the buildings of the town is the Sainte C\u00e9cile cathedral, a masterpiece of the Southern Gothic style, built between the 13th and 15th centuries. It is characterised by a strong contrast between its austere, defensive exterior and its sumptuous interior decoration. Built as a statement of the Christian faith after the upheavals of the Cathar heresy, this gigantic brick structure was embellished over the centuries: the Dominique de Florence Doorway, the 78 m high bell tower, the Baldaquin over the entrance (1515\u20131540). The rood screen is a filigree work in stone in the Flamboyant Gothic style. It is decorated with a magnificent group of polychrome statuary carved by artists from the Burgundian workshops of Cluny and comprising over 200 statues, which have retained their original colours.\n\nOlder than the Palais des Papes in Avignon, the Palais de la Berbie, formerly the Bishops' Palace of Albi, now the Toulouse-Lautrec Museum, is one of the oldest and best-preserved castles in France. This imposing fortress was completed at the end of the 13th century. Its name comes from the Occitan word Bisbia, meaning Bishops' Palace.\nThe Old Bridge (Pont Vieux) is still in use after almost a millennium. Originally built in stone (in 1035), then clad with brick, it rests on eight arches and is 151 m long. In the 14th century, it was fortified and reinforced with a drawbridge, and houses were built on the piers.\nAlbi is a city known for its elite Lyc\u00e9e Lap\u00e9rouse, a high school with 500 students situated inside an old monastery. It has several advanced literature classes. Furthermore, it is one of the few holding a full-scale music section with special high-tech rooms for this section.\nThe Pacific explorer Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse is commemorated in the museum.\nLocated in an ancient mill (41 rue Porta), the Le LAIT Art Centre is a research laboratory dedicated to contemporary art.\n\n\n=== Toulouse-Lautrec ===\nThe Toulouse-Lautrec Museum houses more than 1000 works, including the 31 famous posters. This body of work forms the largest public collection in the world devoted to Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec who was born in Albi in 1864.\n\n\n== A World Heritage Site ==\nUNESCO's World Heritage Centre notes the Old Bridge (Pont-Vieux), the Saint-Salvi quarter, the quarter's church, the fortified cathedral (late 13th century) in unique southern French Gothic style from local brick, the bishop's Palais de la Berbie, and residential quarters, which help the Episcopal City of Albi form a \"coherent and homogeneous ensemble of monuments and quarters that has remained largely unchanged over the centuries... a complete built ensemble representative of a type of urban development in Europe from the Middle Ages to the present day.\"\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Transport ==\nAlbi is served by two railway stations on the line from Toulouse to Rodez:\n\nGare d'Albi-Ville\nGare d'Albi-MadeleineThe A68 motorway connects Albi with Toulouse (and Lyon N 88, future motorway).\n\n\n== Sport ==\nSC Albi \u2013 The city's rugby union team competing in the second-level Rugby Pro D2.\nRC Albi \u2013 A rugby league team that compete in the Elite One Championship.\nAlbi held Stage 13 of the 2007 Tour de France. The stage was a 55 km (34 mi) individual time trial which started and finished in the city.\nCircuit d'Albi, a motor racing circuit used for national racing surrounding Albi's airport.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\u00c9cole des mines d'Albi-Carmaux\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion University Center for Teaching and Research\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nAntoinette de Sali\u00e8s (1639\u20131730), writer, feminist\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864\u20131901), painter, caricaturist, illustrator\nJean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse (1741 \u2013 c. 1788), Pacific explorer, was born in Albi\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\nAlbi is twinned with:\n\n Girona, Spain\n Palo Alto, United States\n\n\n== Climate ==\nAlbi experiences a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfa) bordering oceanic climate (Cfb). Like much of southwestern France, the summers tend to be warmer and the winters milder than most areas of similar classification. Substantial summer rainfall prevents its climate from being classified as Mediterranean.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nLion and Sun\nTourism in Tarn\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nINSEE\nTourist Office of Albi\nAlbi official Website in french\nArchdiocese of Albi (Albia) \u2013 Article from the Catholic Encyclopedia 1908\nAlbi (in English)\nDetailed description of the Madeleine Church of Albi (in French)",

          "This place is incredible. I did not see information in English, but did not care all that much either. When I enter the place, I was so floored by the extraordinary beauty that all I wanted to look at was the place, its incredible Middle-ages paintings, its breathtaking ceiling,",
          "We took a day trip here from Carcassonne. It's a nice drive in the country. When we saw Sainte-Cecile, we were impressed. One is amazed by the number of bricks used to build the huge cathedral. I can't say it is the most beautiful church I have seen, but it is one of the",

          "Beautiful frescoes! Appreciated the English translations in the museum part of the cathedral. After 30 minutes though, we saw enough. Nice area to walk around.",
          "I've seen hundreds of churches, but this one took me by surprise. The fresco's are sublime. The heavenly blue colours in the ceiling tempt you, the dark images of hell scare you. Look at the colourful blocks behind a golden saint and all the different angels above the wooden",
          "This is one church you don't want to miss. For starters it is the largest brick building in the world. Not just in France or Europe but the world. Massive is a good word. It was built as both a place of worship and a fortress if need be centuries ago. But go inside and even if",

          "This is truly an amazing building. It is the tallest brick cathedral in the world (I think) and is a truly beautiful structure. It also has an ancient organ that was updated in the Baroque period that sounds amazing. You can't visit Albi without going here and it's worth",

          "This cathedral that took 200;years to build is reportedly the largest cathedral in the world constructed entirely from brick. However, the incredible architecture belies the beauty of the interior. The ceiling and walls are intricately painted with intricate stone carvings",
          "From the outside, Sainte Cecile was oddly elegant. Its solid brick exterior reflects its initial use as a fortress. But once you step inside the building, the drama of its painted walls and gilded altar are overwhelming. Having visited hundreds of cathedrals throughout Europe,",
          "The most unusual Cathedral i have ever seen.Firstly it is built entirely of brick,as are all the buildings around it ,including all the radiating streets. Secondly,it appears to double as a fortified church,which may have something to do with the troubles Albi experienced in the",
          "Very impressive building constructed with loads of bricks! We walked around the building which is enormous",
          "The tall and thick brick walls make this church look like a fortress from afar. The main gate gives you a hint of what you\u00b4re about to see, but nothing prepares you for such a splendor. The lattice that separates the church in half, the main altarpiece, the choir, the paintings,",

          "It is easy to visit it on 1/2 day trip from Toulouse. It is massive and does not look very pretty from outside, but the interior is one of the best I've seen. The paintings of the ceiling and walls, the survived old choir. You need to get a ticket to see the choir and walk",

          "From the outside, the cathedral looks like a fortress, expressing the power of the Roman Catholic church. The frescoes on the vaulted ceiling are mindblowing. Imagine what the population must have felt after the Cathars were wiped out and they were entering the cathedral.",
          "The cathedrale is completely free to enter, there is a guided tour which is payable. Very interesting to hear more about the history in detail. Worth going early in morning as it did get busier when we left around 11am.",

          "This is a truly amazing building, very unique. The architectural gem of Europe. To be standing in front of its mighty walls is really breathtaking. Interiors are equally beautiful, with great wall painting which is a bit uncommon. This is a really great site to tour. Note",
          "Superb Cathedral, A red massive jewel with another jewels inside. Construction is really impressive, paintings inside are fantastic.",
          "The exterior of the cathedral is fine example of the period. The interior is painted with an intersting and unusual day of judgement mural on both pillars on each side of the chancel. Well worth a visit.",
          "I visted Albi with my family on an impulse and was really pleased I did. It is a beautiful city with an amazing brick built cathedral in the centre. The city itself is well worth walking round and there are a number of easy to follow routes that lead you to all the interesting",

          "Definitely a must see if you are visiting Albi. Gorgeous cathedral and a nice audio tour available inside the cathedral. Would recommend.",
          "A most imposing building both inside and out. It was built to impress and a it certainly does so. The interior appeals to some but not others as the major depictions portray a view of heaven and hell. If you are in Albi you should visit.",
          "Astounded from a distance of the sheer size of the place the interior is just as impressive. Highly recommend getting the audio guide in English as it enhances the visit.",

          "The cathedral dominates the skyline of Albi, which is a lovely medieval city to visit. The outside of the cathedral is very impressive. We did not like the inside of the cathedral, but that is a matter of taste. For us there were far too many decorations and the interior is very",

          "The severe soaring architecture of the Cathedral does not prepare you for its interior. Walking through the entrance the reaction of most people is to stop, look up and gasp. Words cannot do justice to the decorated columns. The interior of the Cathedral is like walking through",
          "The largest brick cathedral in Europe is quite literally magnificent and a joy to behold. Like many cathedrals in France the city around it is small and not very well known. Entrance is free but you will need to pay to enter the Choir. The whole edifice takes your breath away.",

          "Awe inspiring. Dizzying height, raised hundreds of feet straight up. Built to humble lowly man and it achieves that purpose. The interior decoration of all surfaces was done in just 4 years. The whole town built from red brick and preserved as if frozen in time. I am amazed",

          "Visited the Cathedral in Albi this week. It is a very austere looking building in the old part of town. On the inside it is highly decorated with wood, murals, etc. It is the tallest brick building in the world. It was built after the awful killing of the heretics from Albi",

Absolutely phenomenal structure from the outside. Enormous int\u00e9rieur with little lighting. Gorgeous fresco work. I must say it was the first",
          "We saw many churches of various sizes and decorations on our latest trip to France, but this one was undoubtedly the best of all. My wife wrote, \"It is fantastic--decorated everywhere with paintings (frescoes). It's divided into two parts, with a carved screen in between. The",

          "One of the most Cathedral I have been. Beautiful drowning, and statues. I guess that in old times they affected people to fear the after life. Now days I wonder how much money was spent on decorating the place.",

          "The Cathedral built entirely from bricks, is imposing on the exterior more a fortress than a church, but once inside the decoration that covers every inch of the interior is to say the least impressive, go around the church, do not miss the back part and it gets more impressive",

          "This cathedral has all the usual attractions of a cathedral, but it has the added attraction of being made of brick. That changes not just the look but the feel of the building, especially from the exterior. Inside, the choir is worth a few euros to visit, with its amazing Stone",
          "This Cathedral is one that will always stand out in my mind as something very impressive! My wife and I stopped in Albi as we were doing a bit of a Cathar tour, and this Cathedral was one we were told not to miss - and we both agree 100%",
          "This is the second time we have visited Albi and the cathedral. Just as good the second time around. Albi itself is a lovely place to wander - cobbled streets and pleasant walks by the river. The cathedral is truly amazing. Apparently the largest brick cathedral in the world",
          "I visited this cathedral in a group with a guide and audio whilst on a tour of the South of France. It took about an hour, we later had a tour of the town. The building is magnificent, so much to take in. Restoration is still going on in part of the building. The inside more",
          "I had seen a photo of Albi's cathedral, but nothing prepares you for the immense size of this brick colossus. And when you have recovered from seeing the outside, the inside is quite breathtaking; every squire inch of the interior is painted. From the floor right up to, and",

          "I have been to a lot of Cathedrals and thought OK. But this one is one of the finest I have seen. Brick outside, but still looks impressive. The main body of the cathedral has great paintings on the wall. A great depiction of heaven and hell near the front. I particularly",
          "The Cathedrale Saints-Cecile in Albi is one of the most wonderful places I ever visited ... If you are in Albi this is a must visit",
          "This is a must see. The choir is a jewel box within a jewel box. The tiny wooden sculptures of angles that line the walls are perfect little Christmas cards. The stone work is delicate. The organ has over 3,000 pipes. We spent an hour marvelling at the inside of this building.",
          "No expense spared on that ceiling! Stunning building inside and out. It is huge! When we visited there were events in the square outside every evening. The gargoyles are awesome.",

          "Dramatic setting and construction. The outside provides some magnificent views and one marvels at how it was constructed and when. The inside is even more splendid... the choir stalls are a marvel. The cost of eur5 to visit them is money well spent.",
          "This imposing brick structure has been extensively renovated during the last 20 years and is now almost free of scaffolding. It has the largest organ in Europe and there are regular organ concerts. The roof is spectacular and the choir is worth visiting.",
          "One of the more fascinating cathedrals in all of the Western world, majestically imposing on the outside (among the largest brick buildings in the world), entirely painted on the inside. The excellent audioguide suggests that no restoration to paint has been needed in centuries",
          "This cathedral is very impressive from the outside, the dimensions and the inside decoration. It is definitely worth a detour!",

          "We visited this very unusual cathedral which is built with red bricks and is extremely high.Unusual decoration and bright colours to be found inside!! I don't want to give too much away but head inside and I'm sure you'll be surprised by the interior decor which includes 3d",
          "It has been a while that we visited, but it remains one of the most interesting and beautiful cathedrals. Grand, and, actually two churches in one cathedral.",

          "We weren't planning on going inside the cathedral but thought we might as well when we saw there is no admission charge and we're very glad we did! The inside is unlike any other cathedral I think I've seen. It has lots of interesting paintings and statues all around and you",
          "Very, very special cathedral as its exterior looks like a military fortress with high walls and openings reminding machicolations as well as gruesome history of the region in the Middle Ages. The exterior is in stark contrast with the interior which is a heaven of peace in",
          "This is one of the most special cathedrals in the world and it is a must see place if you visit Albi. Read the history of this place and you will understand why it is unique and how greed and fear played important roles in raising the money for its construction and completion.",

          "Incredible Cathedral but care if you are using audio system. Ours didn't work particularly well! Get a combined ticket with Musee Toulouse-Lautrec which is located next to cathedral.",
          "Stunning - this huge brick church is imposing from the outside. Inside the decoration is outstanding. I will compare future cathedrals against this one.",
          "What a stunning cathedral. The outside looks a little odd - a huge brick structure with the odd bit of gothic-style stone stuck to it which makes it look as though 2 different buildings have been fused together. But the inside is just breathtaking and one of the most stunning",
          "This is the largest brick built cathedral in the world. It was having some restoration work when we visited but you still got the grandness of the building",
          "Biggest brick built cathedral in the world! The building dominates the town of Albi. You can see the tower almost anywhere in the town. Very nice square where it is situated with nice cafes.",
          "The Albi Cathedral is just an amazing work of architecture, massive and yet full of details all around. Enjoy the ornate entrance as well as the choir inside. Sit in one of the cafes outside and enjoy how the sunlight does amazing things on the red brick walls.",
          "The entire interior of the church is beautifully painted. The choir area was gothic design and in good condition. The Audi guide was very informative.",
          "This cathedral, built mainly of red brick, is quite unlike any I have seen elsewhere in the world. Set against an azure sky, the structure is imposing and awe-inspiring.",
          "The sheer scale of this brick built Cathedral is breathtaking. As others have commented it looks more like a fortress than a place of worship. But that was the intention as the Catholic Church in the 12th Century was seeking to impress having been engaged in struggles with",
          "Splendid architecture. An audio tape tour was available in several languages. It was detailed and easy to follow. The site is a must see if you are in the area.",
          "Impressive, majestic, this Cathedral dominate all Albi (and your eyes). Is a fortress! When you enter the astonishment is more! Inside is conserved so perfectly that you can feel in the history. The colors are full, and the fresco on the altar is big and suggestive. Absolutely",
          "Breath taking in sheer scale especially height from the outside, this cathedrale's exterior belies its incredibly ornate interior. gazing at the detail and painting from within it felt like we had been transported back to the 12C when construction began. A must see in the",
          "The largest brick built building in the world, an amazing sight from both the outside and the splendour within.",
          "A huge brick built cathedral taking over two centuries to complete. A very plain exterior, but the interior is one of the most ornate I have seen. The fresco of judgement day needs time to view and absorb. A truly magnificent structure.",
          "Very huge, beautiful and of of a kind cathedral. Worth a special journey. Construction of this cathedral took over two centuries.",
          "Spent a whole day here. It is such an amazing cathedral. The artwork was memorising and captivated us upon arrival. Thankfully it was cool inside and we were pleased to have a break from the heat. If you visit Albi this place is a must see - the fresco of the Last",
          "We took the 40 stairs up to the tower, there were displays at the top. We rented the recorders which were extremely helpful in understanding the history of the cathedral.",
          "Built in the 13th century, this looks more like a massive fortress than a church, and the first sight as you approach the square is awe-inspiring. Made entirely of red (fading) brick, this is the most dominant structure along the Albi skyline, contributing to its \"pink city\"",
          "It's not the nicest cathedral from outside, but do go inside. As soon as I stepped into this cathedral I was speechless. The most beautiful cathedral I have ever seen.",
          "Beautiful church with an interesting history! Really worth listening to some of the audio-guide too if you have time - multiple languages were available. Free entry is also a bonus!",
          "The Albi Cathedral (Sainte-Cecile) was built after the Cathay Crusade, and is the largest all-brick building in the world. It is literally awesome in size and presence in the square of Albi. Inside it's very ornate and you can tell that during the 200 years it took to build, the",
          "Amazing site. Not to be missed. The choir is 'lace' but in white stone, so delicate it looks unreal. The painting of the ceiling by Italian masters is gorgeous. It is truly an exceptional site.",
          "After 3 weeks in France, we saw many Cathedrals and Basiliques but this one is the most impressive. It's huge and the inside is stunning. Very carved mainly in green and gold colours. It's not that know so it surpassed all expectations. We wished that we had allowed more time in",
          "Completely spoilt by noisy scaffolding work and noisy group visits. Handset inEnglish provided some detail, but not a lot of interest",
          "We did a day trip from Toulouse to Albi, and visited both the cathedral and museum. Both are highly recommended. There is much to see and do.",
          "This cathedral has a most interesting interior I've seen in quite a while. It is massive and ornate in its decorative painting. It must have been an awesome sight to the ordinary people of the past who walked through its doors. The immense painting of the last judgment would",
          "A beautiful and very interesting cathedral. the interior and the choir are not to be missed. the treasury is not so interesting.",
          "It is very impressive both outside and inside. Sainte-Cecile is really worth visiting and listening to the excursion.",
          "We visited the cathedral while in Albi and it is just breathtaking once you walk inside, they have a free area as well as a paid tour, we just elected to do the free visit. the size and d\u00e9cor is amazing and not to be missed while in Albi.",
          "excellent and interesting visit. we thoroughly enjoyed the fascinating tour. the cathedral is unique and its history fascinating.",
          "Really beautiful cathedral sadly parts closed due to renovation. Take the tour of the treasury and choir - well worth it. Also visit at night it is light up.",
          "This cathedral is absolutely huge and dwarfs all surrounding buildings. It's brick built and relatively plain on the outside but has a stunning interior, completely decorated on all surfaces and with areas of intricately detailed stonework. Well worth a visit.",
          "Interesting but not conducive to prayer when we were there as scaffolding being put up. The choir area seems to be of particular interest but you have to pay for it. Few information notices.",
          "We travelled to Albi from Toulouse by train. It's a 1 hour train ride. You need to get off at Albi station, not Albi Madeleine station. The cathedral is a 20 minute walk from Albi station. It is a World Heritage site that dates back to the XIII. And quite a sight to behold. The",
          "Wonderful building....amazing architecture and the inside takes your breathe away. Great photo opportunities all over the city of the cathedral.",
          "Huge brick building with fantastic, original art work on the walls. Audio guide was very informative and recommended because there is so much to take in.",
          "To be honest, it's the central point in Albi and you can't miss it. Every time I visit I love to go inside. The architecture is so overwhelming and grand. I love it and would recommend anyone to visit if they were in or close to Albi (Done miss the Toulouse-lautrec museum which",
          "The Ste-Cecile earns its reputation as a unique piece of architecture - a huge brick cathedral. However, the somewhat austere outer appearance belies the magnificence of the decorations within the sanctuary. Each chapel is decorated with frescoes and stained glass. The choir",
          "Visited Albi on a wet and blustery Sunday morning. The streets were very quiet but there were a few hardy souls around. The church is magnificent both inside and out and was the highlight of our visit.",
          "The greatest brick building in the world, but spiritual nonetheless. St Cecilia has special significance for us both, for quite different reasons. Even the lady asking for charity on the cathedral steps exuded class. There is something quite amazing about this cathedral that",
          "We visited this amazing and impressive Unesco site and stood in awe of its brilliance. We spent at least 2 hours walking thru its entire interior, including its treasure museum. Albi is about 1.5 hour drive from Toulouse. It is a must see to appreciate how human's determination",
          "The cathedral dominates the countryside for miles around and does the same for the town. Inside it is a riot of colour and imagery although somehow the opposite of the tardis being smaller on the inside and quite annoying that you have to pay if you want to see all of it.",
          "Beautiful cathedral, you should not miss the visit to the choir and the audio-guide. It gives us interesting info on the Cathar culture.",
          "Easily one of the most impressive sacral buildings i have visited. It looks like a silo from the outside, and isnt particularly inviting, but once inside, you will be in awe - high ceilings, every little space painted, and not over-run. There are interesting side-chapels",
          "This cathedral is set in an ancient area of old Albi. The cathedral itself is wonderful but it is also surrounded by other old buildings and lovely bars and restaurants. There are colourful gardens on many levels overlooking the wide and picturesque river. Next to the cathedral",
          "This cathedral is the largest brick structure in the Northern Hemisphere and is well worth a visit. I recommend getting the audio tour to fully take it all in",
          "Just go it must not be missed it is stunning both inside and out and information is plentiful, guided tours are also available.Cameras are allowed but no flash during services",
          "Regarded to be the worlds largest brick cathedral, it is inspiring. Outside the golden light plays beautifully on the red brick, but when you step inside it is just wonderful.",
          "My wife and I traveled to Albi on a tour of the Occitanie Region of France. Of the Cathedrals that we saw, this one was very impressive. The brick on the outside of the building is said to be the only Cathedral of that size in the world to be constructed out of brick. There is",
          "This cathedral is very unique. Made with bricks. Beautiful and impressive. The inside is also very nice. It is in the heart of Albi in a bery nice area with many restaurants and shopping areas.",
          "This rose brick edifice is an amazing creation in pale pink bricks. The interior is a feast of colour indulgence with virtually every surface being painted",
          "We had to look twice for the entrance for wheelchairs (at the backside close to the entrance of Toulouse Lautrec).",
          "Great architecture, lots of interesting side chapels and paintings to visit. The craftsmen explained what they were doing to restore the part they were working on.",
          "The largest brick built cathedral. The building is so impressive both structurally and in terms of the art inside. The ceilings alone are magnificent. Wheelchair access from the back but you will need help as the doors are heavy and the access ramp is on a slope.",
          "This cathedral is, in my opinion, the primary reason vacationers/travelers would come to Albi. It was amazing (and I'm not even religious)! First, the outside is made of brick instead of the normal stonework you see on most European cathedrals. Second and most amazing, the",
          "We were in Toulouse in last Christmas and visited this place. This appeared to me the best appealing Cathedral I had ever seen. We reached here on our Day 5. by train. We took 09-15am train and reached at Albi Ville station at 10 -25am. It was 70 mins journey from Toulouse",
          "Albi is about an hour from Toulouse. Looks smiler to Toulouse in terms of architecture and the way the city presents specially the brick work and the coluors. Cathedral Ste-Cecile is absolutely marvellous and in my knowledge the biggest cathedral in France. I am afraid to",
          "Splendid cathedral, a little different than those in northern europe. Great location, and plenty of other places around to visit. Not many selfie sticks, which was good. an easy day trip from Toulouse - an hour in the train and then a 15 min walk from the station",
          "Both from the outside and the inside, the cathedral is amazing, a true architectural wonder. It reflects the whole feeling and vibe the town of Albi is offering.",
          "This is an unavoidable cathedral. The best thing about it is the oltar situated in the back of a church from which you have to pay the fee and it is well worth to do it.",
          "There are places you look out, places you are recommended and places you happen upon. This was one of the latter for us. Something very special here. You can Google it but if you're nearby do not miss it. Exceptional in many ways.",
          "I think this Cathedral is an huge ecclesiastical monument built brick in Europe . This medieval noble building bedazzled you by its outside and inside",
          "Our viewing of the cathedral was enhanced by having a tour guide as part of an Odysseys Unlimited tour of France. The colors are still vibrant in the frescoes and some of the designs are quite modern looking for the time the cathedral was built. If you don't have a tour guide, I",
          "No trip to Albi is complete without a visit to the Cathedral, wonderful. Worth paying an additional \u20ac6.00 to get into the choir area, an audio hand set is essential. Pay a visits to the gardens outside. Enjoy.",
          "Like most cathedrals, this one was built to impress. But unlike any other I have seen this one is in brick and loos more like a fortress. From the outside it'd huge and you have to admire what was achieved 800 years ago.Worth sitting in the square and soaking up its magnitude.",
          "This is a lovely building and you can hire audio commentary for your own guided tour of the church. The church is an amazing place!",
          "This place leaves you in awe. First, the ornate architecture. And second, the beautiful frescos that still show the original colors that do not look faded at all. We spent a long time in there....",
          "The exterior and interior of this amazing building are breath taking, dedicated to st cecila There is so much to take in ... All the small altars are dedicated to different saints and have prayer cards and candles. The paintings are amazing especially behind the main altar.",
          "This cathedral dominates everything else around it. I have never seen the like, and even though the Toulouse Lautrec Museum is great, this cathedral is worth seeing on its own. The gardens and grounds are gorgeous and what views they provide!",
          "An amazing red brick building competing with Battersea Power Station in London for the title of the largest brick building in the world. Here the similarity ends as this is a great example of the power and wealth of the Catholic church in the Middle Ages! A magnificent and",
          "This is one of the most impressive cathederals I have been to. Huge and lavishly decorated inside, it's different to the normal French catherderal and defiintely worth a visit.",
          "Quite an impressive cathedral inside as it looks quite plan outside. The cathedral also has an inner chapel that you need to buy tickets for to visit.",
          "This building is enormous, and the ceiling decoration is amazing. As big as it the area inside open to visit is fairly limited and I was out in less than 10 minutes.",
          "A nice hour spent walking around the church looking at sculptures and paintings on the walls and ceiling. A service was in progress so the ambience was additionally special. Beautiful church.",
          "The outside of this cathedral looks quite unattractive and unwelcoming in some ways but the inside is a revelation. The are some beautiful patterned walls unlike decorations in some other cathedrals and is quite inspiring in its own way. Don't be put off by the outside but go in",
          "Must see because of the interior painted walls. Beautiful untouched and vaste so a must see but to go in the choir there is a fee which includes the audio guide.",
          "This cathedral is the largest brick building in the world. The interior is amazing especially considering that the entire church interior is painted and that the ceiling is original.",
          "Wow! What a building. As you approach Albi it's a huge red brick structure but this doesn't prepare you for the colourful and stunning interior. We paid to go in the choir but I wouldn't bother as the audio guide was complicated and boring and you would be better to just sit and",
          "I attended High Mass at the cathedral this morning. The bells rang at 10:45 to call us all and by the time I arrived it was almost full. This was a great opportunity to see the cathedral in full operation. All the pomp and ceremony of a high mass but involving over a hundred",
          "Don't miss this major cathedral if visiting southern France. Between the very unusual choir and rood screen, plus the painted columns and ceiling. Amazing place.",
          "This very large cathedral is mostly constructed of brick instead of stone. Quite fascinating to examine.",
          "Stunning, absolutely stunning. The largest brick-built building in the world (there must be millions of bricks, literally). Built by the victorious Catholics after the Albigensian Crusade, fascinating but austere on the outside in deference to the defeated (and murdered)",
          "I assumed the cathedral was quite modern due to its red brick construction but it is almost as old as the city and well worth a visit. From the outside it looks like a castle which was a part of the intent when it was constructed, but inside it is a lot more conventional, but",
          "The Cathedral Ste Cecile at Albi ought to be seen but the evil behind the funding and building of it and that the result is as much a fortress as a religious building - is this the least welcoming entrance to any church anywhere? More a barbican than a place to process into -",
          "But when you are in Albi, by all means, visit the cathedral. It is quite imposing, different from most any other cathedral, therefore, interesting. On the other hand, it is like any other ornate cathedral inside - a lot of gold, a lot of marbles, a lot of carvings. For the",
          "It's certainly monumental and you can't miss it if you're in historic Albi. There are many reasons to be awed...all explained via the hand-held audio guide for a fee. However, the exterior resembles a grain elevator and I didn't even take a picture. The interior is lavish but",
          "We visited the cathedral as something to do while we waited for the rest of our travelling party. The audio guide is useful and informative, explaining the history behind the breathtaking architecture, paintings and statues.",
          "The Cathedral makes a statement-more fortress than church, its sheer size was designed to assert the church's authority in a town famous for heresy-it was begun in the late thirteenth century after the defeat (and brutal liquidation) of the local adherents of the",
          "a perfect witness of the middle age. A martial exterior and a so rich interior. take the time to observe the fresco, some artist added a hidden wink.",
          "So many bricks, and so high too. Great interior. Town centre over looking the river, square and gardens.",
          "Incredible inside and out. Really dominates Albi as was completely intended. Interior amazing. Good if slightly confusing audio guide.",
          "You see the cathedral from afar but do not appreciate its size until you finally stand below its ever ascending walls. The brick exterior hides a magnificent interior of great architecture and frescos. Take one of the audio guides, its essential to get a true understanding of",
          "This cathedral is one not to miss. It is supposed to be the largest brick building in the world. Outside is so big your neck hurts from trying to see the top and inside is beautiful and calm. A must must see.",
          "Look, I'm not religious but this cathedral, is imposing both inside and out. Fresco paintings and architecture worth looking at",
          "The red brick exterior is a complete throw off to its beautiful significant interior.. Hand paintings and a very lovely decor this cathedral dominates the towns attractions",
          "This amazing cathedral dominates it's setting, it's made a millions of thin red bricks and must have been a real labour of love to build, it's huge. The interior is a surprise as it is completely covered in fresos, a bit too ornate for my taste, but unmissable,",
          "A stunning building inside and out. The austere exterior leads visitor into a false sense of security, as the interior is covered with intricate painting and ornate decoration. Would highly recommend the audio guide, we learned so much! The choir and the organ are particular",
          "The outside is majestic but can be misleading as one might expect the inside to be as \"bare\". Instead, there are wonderful frescos and do not miss the choir, which is not for free but it's very small amount.",
          "The cathedral well deserves its UNESCO rating, and doesn't disappoint. The painted interior is very different from one expects in such a cathedral, and the overall experience well worth putting Albi on your lists of places to stop and visit.",
          "Albi is amazing! If you like medieval, brick-and-wood buildings, fine restaurants and thousands of years of history, then don't miss it! What impressed me the most was The Saint Cecile Cathedral. Built in 1282 at the initiative of Bernard de Castanet, the cathedral needed to be",
          "The interior of Albi Cathedral is wonderful. The paintings on the ceiling are exquisite and very well preserved and the choir is fantastic. The audioguide is well done and it provides indepth details about the church.",
          "The interior is in great condition and a wonderful representation of how colourful a cathedral could be. Largely free entry but some areas need payment to gain access.",
          "This Cathedral is in very good condition, the architecture is wonderful , the outside is made of brick and looks like a fortress.The inside has Italian architecture and paintings, statues and altars of different saints are around the walls. An amazing place to visit.",
          "Gorgeous detail, amazing artwork. So much to see it would take days to take it all in. The sheer size is not to be believed. It sits right in front of the Toulouse Lautrec Museum and walking distance to great shopping a restaurants. Every foot of this Cathedral is ornate. I",
          "Albi Cathedral really should be on everyone's bucket list. It looks like a fortress from the outside, which is because it was the seat of episcopal power for centuries - the Bishop was the most important person in the town. If you are planning a visit it is worth doing some",
          "Absolutely beautiful cathedral in good condition (rare). The outside is petrifying in its militancy, but the inside is lovely with Italian painted decoration. The organ is absolutely fabulous, to look at and to hear.",
          "Albi Cathedral, (French: Basilique Cath\u00e9drale Sainte-C\u00e9cile d'Albi), was first built as a fortress in 1287 and was under construction for 200 years. The cathedral is incredible, extremely impressive and scary. Both the exterior and interior is intimidating and frightening, which",
          "Go to the tourist information centre to purchase a city pass, especially if planning on also visiting the museum next door - it's cheaper and gives discount off other local attractions for the rest of the year. It's a beautiful cathedral, and an audio guide gives lots of",

          "This cathedral made of brick is so imposing for its heights, and then you enter to see every interior surface painted with the most amazing designs. It requires a moment of just sitting quietly and looking all round to try and take it all in.",
          "Old awesome Cathedrel located in the heart of everything in Albi. I liked the way the \"visitors\" are not allowed near the Sacristy so those who wish to pray may do so undisturbed.",
          "If you have a day to spend in Albi (hopefully a Saturday, in which case you can enjoy the outdoor market), then make some time to wander through Cathedrale Saint Cecile. An imposing building, with a fascinating history. On the day of our visit, an organist and a trumpeter were",
          "Built from bricks (typical for the area) , 80 m high, with a phantastic gothic (flamboyant) choir. It was built to impress the Cathars after their defeat in the Albigensian crusade.",
          "The cathedral built in a strictly Gothic style is a masterpiece. Very strict on the outside but highly decorated inside with colours and sceneries rarely seen in churches. Almost as if Hieronimys Bosch made his entry in Albi",
          "We had a disappointing visit to the Cathedrale. There was a lack of interpretation in other languages and a number of important chapels were either blocked off or unavailable to view. We had come all the way from the UK specifically to visit one of the chapels and had contacted",
          "It looks like a fortress and it is very impressive, outside as well as inside. Especially particular is not alone that the cathedral is build up from bricks, but also the inside in his whole is painted. And what a beautiful organ.",
          "It is very impressive, though not quiite as beautiful, in my view, as the Romanesque churches in Toulouse. The archiitecture and the red color are almost unique and it certainly is the most impressive monument in a very beautiful city. I loved Albi, where we went for the",
          "we were there twice. the second time we shared a guide: we found a new way of looking. it needs at tleast an hour to be able to enjoy the variation of details in the architecture and the signification of them.",
          "Spectacular, definitely worth a visit. We visited many abbeys, churches, basilicas and cathedrals but this one was a definite stand out. Loved it.",
          "After getting used to the darkness, take a few minutes then take a look at the wonderful wall and ceiling decoration of centuries ago. Much to be admired.",
          "This is an amazingly decorated cathedral which is quite jaw dropping in its painted splendour. There are two parts to the cathedral - a free section which you can enter and see the vast part of the cathedral and the \"coeur\" which is the central part and which requires tickets",
          "This was a nice surprise. We did not realize the magnitude nor the history of this amazing brick built cathedral. It is well worth the 5 euro to have the audio talk as you enter into the chapel area. The history and delicate work is incredible.",
          "Well worth the visit to Albi. When at the cathedral, pay the fee for the audio guide --- to see all of the cathedral you must pay for the audio guide.",
          "Supposed to be one of the largest brick-built buildings in the world, constructed after the Cathar heresy and designed to teach the faithful who was boss. The scale is unbelievable. The interior walls and vaulting is completely decorated and reminds us of what our own cathedrals",
          "definitely worth walking to and reading the history of this very interesting cathedral. Hike down the river from thre is also very nice and give very nice views of old Albi.",
          "St Cecile is a beautiful and huge brick structure that dominates the town of Albi. It is filled with history, beauty and amazing art. The story of the Cathars is very important to the history of France in this region. This church plays a role in the end of the Cathar people.",
          "The outside of the building is hugely dramatic and impressive. The inside is also jaw dropping. There's a fantastic mural of the afterlife and sinners being punished and those people who were saved going up to heaven. There are also amazing paintings all over the walls of the",
          "Very interesting and beautiful church in a wonderful city on the banks of the river Tarn. It is situated very central and close to other tourist attractions e.g Lautrec museum.",
          "Outstandingly impressive Cathedral in the central square - however did they build it so long ago! Interior is also worth a visit, especially the altar painting by Hyronemus Bosch.",
          "Very impressed by the sheer size of the church. It was very imposing even when viewed across the river. Worth the visit.",
          "Best is to stop next door at the Tourist Office first to get all documentation in English. Then one can tour the Cathedral leisurely. However there is a part of the Cathedral that you have to pay to visit. First time that I visited the Cathedral a few years ago that was not the",
          "This cathedral looks stark and plain from the exterior, but what a surprise when you enter! Statues, stunning decorated ceiling, bizarre reversal of the alignment, so the choir at the East end is now the back of the cathedral. Awesome Last Judgement scene at the west end.",
          "There are a few things that make this a must see. First, it is Gigantic. But also... it is made of bricks, not stones. It is claimed to be the largest brick building in the world. It is the largest brick building I have ever seen, anyway. Actually BUILT of bricks. As it is",
          "from outside you see a impressive brick building with very nice city-surroudings. Inside the Cathedral you learn from former times and how one person could decide how many people had to make a contribution to his religious ideas. But the result is worth a visit!",
          "This fortress turned church is imposing. Unfortunately it was closed when we got there. So we only walked around, took photo outside. Our schedule didn't allow another visit, too bad.",
          "the outside gives a feeling of immensity, the inside is fully painted with that non-forgettable 'Jugement Dernier' fresque. You won't forget the place",
          "The Albi Cathedral is quite extraordinary as it is build entirely of bricks. The interior is memorable with its rich ornamentation and bright vivid colours. The Cathedral is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is really worth the visit.",
          "We were delightfully surprised. The cathedral has a beautiful interior. It is a very majestic building.",
          "I visited this as part of a guided tour, so the visit was briefer than I would have liked. It is just so ornate, it has to be seen to be believed. We heard the organ playing, what a powerful sound. The choir (which is extra to pay to visit normally) is worth the visit - and I",
          "As you arrive in Albi, the skyline is dominated by this large brick Cathedral. While it may not be a tourist's main reason for a visit, the nearby Toulouse Lautrec Museum is very interesting.",
          "This is a classic structure out side it is an amazing feat of construction, the interior is a great place of worship the friezes at the altar are well worth spending time over",
          "This cathedral was one of my favorite things we saw on our resent trip to France and Spain. It is spectacular inside and out. When you go in make sure you get the audiotour device, because it explains a lot of stuff about what you're seeing. There's a \"tower of treasures\"",
          "We visited this magnificant cathedral during our 2 days in Albi. On the first day we spent over 2 hours in awe of the interior. We called back early the following morning to see the building again without the crowds. Albi is really worth exploring but the Cathedral is the",

          "Worth a trip. The surroundings are beautiful and impressive, and the inside quite mad! Every inch is hand painted! Outside the whole area has been pedestrianised. You can see to the river and the old bridge or walk through the gardens",
          "The monumental Cathedral of Saint Cecile was built in the late13th c-15th c. to radiate political and religious power. With a severe exterior and sumptuous interior, it was built of red/pink/orange Languedoc brick in the Southern French Gothic style and may be the largest brick",
          "We only had the chance to browse around the exterior but this is one huge cathedral. It is beautiful and has amazing architectural features including as many gargoyles as you can shake a stick at. Wish we'd been inside but it is an inspiring sight anyway",
          "In the main square, this cathedral should be visited if in the area. Surrounding it are beautiful gardens which are worth walking through and where there are wonderful views of the river below. You can buy food nearby and picnic there.",

          "The cathedral in Albi looks like a fortress, and that's because it was built to show the might of the Roman Catholic Church - literally an imposing structure! It's also one of the largest brick-built structures in the world. So the ornate limestone portico really does look",

          "You have to stand a long way back from this building to get your friend into the shot along with the ground they're standing on, and the top of the tower. Easier said than done. It's a fortress-like southern Gothic cathedral built of unimaginable numbers of local red bricks,",
          "What a revelation this place is. Due to a shortage of local stone the cathedral is constructed entirely from bricks, and it huge! Very historic with several unique chapels within, well worth a visit.",
          "The largest brick building in the world.Tour the choir area and the treasury for a small cost and get the audio. The internal paintings are the best I have seen and are on a magnificent scale.Give yourself plenty of time (2-3 hours) to be able to appreciate all this cathedral",

          "The cathedral dominates the town of Albi and was built by the medieval ruling Catholic powers that be, as a warning and a means of controlling the local Cathars who were seen as heretics. The sheer scale of the building creates a symbol of power, oppression and control. On the",

          "As previous reviews have stated the cathedral is an immense structure and merits a visit when in Albi. We found it a bit gloomy inside and did not pay to enter the choir, but were very impressed. The whole ensemble of buildings around the cathedral is magnificent and the view",
          "We have lived in France all this year, traveled throughout, but this is one of the most stunning experiences we have had. By that I mean, a full experience, not just of seeing, but of feeling. The choir area looks like delicate lace, though it is made of stone. While the front",
          "Don't be put off by them upside of this rather austere, brick built cathedral. The fact that it is built of brick is a marvel itself, but the interior is what is so amazing. The whole place is painted, and the colours are still bright and wonderful. It is well worth getting an",

          "Very busy, but definitely worth a visit while in Albi is the large cathedral that dominates the city and countryside around it. The intricate art and carving is sumptuous. Once exterior restoration is complete it will look amazing. And right next door to the Toulouse-Lautrec",
          "As impressive inside as it looks from the outside, totally awestruck by the gargantuan size of it. I found it ironic that constructed to shjow the parish the church was not extravagant and therefore quell the popular uprising its very size and forbidding look negates that",
          "One of the most beautiful churches I've been in. It doesn't rival St. Peter's or Seville and Toledo, but at least it's in the same conversation.",
          "Certainly the highlight of our visit to Albi along with amazing Museum of Toulouse-Lautrec (buy a combination ticket for both in the nearby Tourist Office, extra charge for the audio guide which you can pick up right at the entrance). It is really striking to see fortress-like",

          "Theres not much of interest to Albi really. The river is nice enough but unspectacular and the old town has a limited atmosphere, but the Cathedral is cerainly unusual. Much of the town is built of brick - shallower than modern brick giving the impression of greater bulk. And",

          "This cathedral is significantly different than most, and well worth a visit. Standing just outside, your are struck by its size and the rounded contours which set it apart from many others. In addition to its brick construction and red colour, the painting and decoration inside",
          "Ste-Cecile Cathedral is simply amazing. Right now part of it is under maintenance, still it was a great visit. If you enjoy historical visits this is mandatory. This huge construction is made only with bricks. The paintings inside the cathedral are worth a long and carefull",
          "It's the biggest brick building in the world! Built after Catholic Church murdered the Cathars, it was built to look aggressive and deter more heresy. Interesting interior but ultimately rather gloomy",
          "This cathedral was made from clay stones. There is a nice tour (6 Euro including audio device) which I certainly recommend. I must say that compared to 4 years ago this church seemed a bit in deterioration. May it were the reconstruction works.",
          "Albi cathedral is really something else. The architecture, the colours, the accoustics, the surroundings. A hundred times more impressive than the circus at Carcassonne. The Toulouse Lautrec museum nearby, the beautiful river, the park, the views. The cathedral is the focus, but",
          "So different from the normal Gothic cathedral both inside and out. It is the worlds biggest brick cathedral with a huge organ and one of the largest paintings in the world (day of judgement fresco I think)",
          "A 900 year-old cathedral of monumental proportions built entirely of red brick that looks like it is no more than a hundred years old! A church that is built like a fortress (as, in effect, it was!). Sainte-Cecile cathedral has got to be unique among all the churches I've seem",
          "It was built to impress and it still does. I think the entrance doesn't match. The painting inside is incredible. So fresh and sometimes modern. You can keep watching ( that is if you don't run away from the organ testing/playing?). Didn't visit the second part as half of it",
          "Amazing brick built medieval cathedral with painted walls to show details instead of carved stone as brick",
          "The cathedral is interesting, and has some beautiful painted vaulted ceilings which are worth seeing. We paid extra to see the east end, treasury and central choeur where the priests etc sit. In retrospect I would not bother to pay extra for these sections as you get a very good",

          "Among the most beautiful churches I have ever visited. It is worth the trip to visit. I liked the frescoes and, specially, the final judgement one and the ceiling with the stars. The choir is also very beautiful with very nice alabaster figures of middle age representatives.",
          "This proved to be the biggest draw of the city. Turned out also to be quite noisy inside - expect only to see half the Cathedral for free. You have to pay to see the rear nave and aisles. The Cathedral appears to be memorable for its size - and the Renaissance paintings - than",
          "I would definitely recommend visiting this cathedral if you are in the Tarn. As others have mentioned, the outside gives little clue about what awaits on the inside. At the moment (June 2015) there is some construction going on, and mid-june some of the construction noise",
          "Absolutely stunning. Completely different style of Cathedral. Well worth paying for the audio guide for additional background information although it was a bit difficult to follow in a couple of places.",
          "While this cathedral isn't super attractive from the outside (at least in my opinion), it is STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL inside! Every wall and ceiling surface is painted with awesome frescoes. What is more, the original choir area and carved stone screen are intact, a very rare",
          "A very unusual building, being made of bricks. I wonder if this is the only brick built cathedral of the era ? Very impressive from outside, but rather gloomy inside.",
          "This building is enormous and to see a cathedral built of brick in the 13th and 14th centuries is remarkable. It is truly a statement of power. The inside is also a sight to behold. There is an enormous Last Judgement depicted on the walls under the organ. One can appreciate the",

          "Although it is not the most attractive building from the outside, indeed it looks as if the spire has gone missing at some stage(!), but inside it is stunning! The murals are quite outstanding, and in some ways shocking! The cloisters are lovely also, worth paying to take a",
          "Loved the headphone option ! Nice staff, amazing architecture. The story of St. Ceacilia is extremely sad but thankfully there is a cathdral",
          "Really unique cathedral. First church I have visited in France where they tell you nothing about it as they want you to purchase the audio guide. So guess I will have to read further about it on the Internet. Do your research first!",
          "This edifice is certainly a high point of a visit to Abbi. It is at the center of the historic district and well worth the admission, The interior has some unique features that add to its charm -- go see!",
          "Fabulous location by the river Tarn in Albi. Stunning building and incredible interior with rather spooky wall paintings.",

          "I enjoyed seeing the cathedral and paid to see the choir screen area and listen to the history. We paid additionally to see the relics upstairs but I wouldn't bother unless you are really keen.",
          "Great experience, unique building, fabulous interiors, wonderful story about the catholic clergy building themselves a fortified cathedral.",
          "Try to visit, when there are less people. If it is overcrowded, than less interesting.According to the statistics almost 800.000 tourist are visiting Albi, and 98 percent of them visits the cathedral. Which is not a question, it is a real wonder",
          "I liked the history surrounding the Cathedrale, as it's linked with the Cathars (originally called \"Albigeois\", so named for the city). The Cathars were descended from the Knights Templar order that both protected pilgrims and fought in The Crusades. In the early 13th C., the",
          "This is the largest brick cathedral in the world. And it looks it. The interior is spectacular. We did not however feel inclined to try and discover what the feee was to visit the other half of the church. Its a real pity when language is often a challenge that businesses don't",
          "A style that is unique to Albi. An all brick ( locally made... ) building and as tall and impressive, from afar. Inside, there is a crucifix that stands high up, with a visual effect that is stunning. The depth of field as you tilt your head to view it is engaging. The choir",
          "The audio was difficult to follow - signage was not clear. Probably because the interior of the church was being restored. The church is unique and you will spend about an hour just admiring this jewel.",
          "As you approach Albi by road or rail, you can\u2019t miss the cathedral. Its fortress-like structure dominates the skyline. It is the largest brick-built cathedral in the world, and was built to intimidate any Roman Catholics who were tempted to join the heretical Cathars. If the",
          "If ever the hymn \"A mighty fortress is our God\" was made incarnate in the form of a cathedral, Albi's is it. Particularly if seen from across the river, with the mighty bishop's palace below it, it seems as impregnable as religious. It was built beginning in the late 13th",
          "Albi is such a beautiful city which has been designated a World,Heritage Site. So much to see but one thing you must not miss is the cathedral which was built by the Catholic Church to intimidate the local populace in medieval times to ensure they did not veer towards the",

          "The cathedral is quite dark to begin with but the eyes adjust. It has a wonderful choir section (audio guide is a must) just crammed with carvings and statuary and richly decorated roof between the elegant arches and with a wonderful rood screen which has survived when so many",
          "The exterior is uninspiring and does not prepare you for the wonders inside. Words cannot describe it - you have to see it.",

          "The whole interior surface is covered with paintings 500 years old, wonderfully kept. About 18000 square meters. In the choir painting of the Last Judgment . this monument has recenttly received the label mankind patrimony. commentaries on headphones are available for 6 euros",
          "This is an enormous building with a fantastic exterior and interior. Sadly at the time of our visit the outside was partly sheathed in scaffolding and inside, the historic Choir was all but hidden away. It was also very cold inside.",

          "Simply needs to be seen for the wealth of its decorations and history. Besides that, Albi has got to be the cleanest town in France, with nice people living there. No graffiti\u2019s anywhere, no delinquents to be seen, very few uncared for houses... I just can't get over it how just",

          "Wonderfully decorated interior, amazing carving, beautiful choir (being renovated at the moment). Very interesting historically.",
          "all the employees/owners are very friendly. You feel at home and in your plate you get the famous cuisine of the south west of France. Not the one cooked to fast for the tourists in the large tourist centric cities but the real one Cooed and prepared with passion.",
          "Beautiful exterior, typically dismal but beautiful interior. The architecture is marvellous. Well worth visiting Albi to see this gem.",
          "This really is an outstanding building, fascinating in so many ways. One could spend hours here. With the ticket from the tourist office, one gets extras at no further cost. Obviously there is work going on, but it still leaves plenty to admire.",

          "This Cathedral is huge on the outside, and seems even bigger once you go in. It is beautiful and very interesting. Work is currently being done on it at the moment, so hard to get a photo without scaffolding. Still, worth going to.",
          "Big, it is one of the biggest churches we have seen, its quite beautiful, the paintings are remarkable as are the statues, Albi is a nice town to visit actually. We loved it, do yourself a favor and check it out.",

          "Very majestic monument, inside and out. Your really feel the wow! factor when inside. It is a location you will remember in your travels of France. You can pay for visiting extra locations (treasury and reserved alter) which are not very interesting but also the ticket is not",
          "One of the greatest Cathedrals I've ever seen. Two distinct parts to it and many symbolic paintings and symbols of the Catholics suppressing the Cathars. Highly recommended",
          "The size of the cathedral is surprising, given the relative size of Albi. The work that must have gone into building it is astonishing. The inside is equally impressive, and it is a good idea to take one of their audio tours ( available in several languages). There is a lot of",
          "We saw it from the distance, then approached and entered it. It is magnificient in the outside, but the interior is also fantastic. We also paid the extra to enter the choir (which is under work at the moment...) for 2 euro, it is worth it. What a gem.",
          "The purpose of this cathedral was to intimidate the populace who were thought to be insufficiently Catholic, so it's really a bit creepy. If I knew less history would like it better.",
          "Albi itself is a little gem of a town, the Cathedral is the main sparkle. Well worth a visit on the way to the Lavender Road. Inside one could see preserved the Southern Gothic Style architecture and the frescoes on the enormous vaulted ceiling comprise the largest and oldest",
          "Getting the audio tour will give you all sorts of inside information on how, when and why the cathedral was built. Well worth the extra!!",
          "It blew us away....the inside is not to be believed....the blus patterned painted walls are breath-taking. St. Cecelia's is now my favorite church in Europe....and that's saying a lot.",
          "The cathedral dominates the old city of Albi - which we visited almost be accident, but were so glad to have experienced. The cathedral is a riot of interesting features and provides a good audio tour to help understand the significance of what one is looking at. Allow a",
          "With an unusual ornate, side entrance, this Gothic Cathedral, built in the 13th century, is the largest brick building in the world. With a most impressive exterior, the interior of this cathedral is like non other. The central choir, or choeur, is reserved for members of the",
          "The most imposing building in Albi, the Sainte-Cecile Cathedral is unique. Its bell tower (78m) dominates the city and the surrounding region like a medieval watchtower. The cathedral is the world's largest brick-built cathedral and with the Berbie Palace, these two monuments",
          "Wonderful city and the Toulouse Lautrec museum. We found good restaurants and nice places for a coffee or drink.",
          "the audio guide is well worth using and the cathedral ranks with the best i've seen. great place to visit",
          "Last time we went was beautiful and atmospheric. This time just packed with noisy tourist parties, very unlike Albi",

          "As the largest brick built building in the world, you need to see it to get the full sense of the achievements of the construction. It was breathtaking in its beauty and sheer magnitude. Inside was surprisingly light and again breathtaking. Lots of cafes around the area",
          "I'd heard, and seen about Albi cathedral a few years ago, on a Dan Kruickshank programme, adventure in architecture, finally got the chance to go, a cathedral that is as much a fortress as a place of worship, we walked across the river to view the full majesty of the building",
          "The Cathedral is beautiful and the stone lace like screen is mind boggling. The audio guide is useful.",
          "I could feel no uplifting experience from this dark and gloomy building. It made me feel amazed at the power of the Catholic Church in times of poverty to put so much wealth into this dd brick building. From other cathedrals you feel enriched and thrilled, not yere",
          "The cathedral is very impressive from the outside and does indeed resemble a fortress. I wasn't prepared for the inside. It's a mishmash of style, painting and finishes. The frescoes are truly terrifying when you study them. If I'd been an illiterate peasant in the 14th c.",
          "Few except those with little imagination, cannot be impressed with the majesty and craftsmanship of the medieval builders. At the same time so stark in medieval brick on the outside yet with an entrance in elaborate stonework - Inside every wall is decorated in colour and",

          "What a gem of a place. Not only is Albi one of the most interesting Small cities in France, the Cathedral is so impressive. Pity the tower does not seem to allow access and the Treasury wasn't worth the extra \u20ac1.",
          "We have visited Ste Cecile twice, the most recent time in June 2014. At that time, renovations were in full swing, and made admission to the choir less desirable. However, the history and overwhelming magnificence of this cathedral make the trip to Albi worhtwhile. The",

        "wiki": "Toulouse (, too-LOOZ; French: [tuluz] (listen); Occitan: Tolosa [tu\u02c8luzo]; Latin: Tolosa [to\u02c8lo\u02d0sa]) is the capital of the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km (143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean and 680 km (420 mi) from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France, with 479,553 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (as of January 2017), and 1,360,829 inhabitants within its wider metropolitan area (also as of January 2017), after Paris, Lyon and Marseille, and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.\nToulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus (formerly EADS), the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It also hosts the European headquarters of Intel and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe. Thales Alenia Space, ATR, SAFRAN, Liebherr-Aerospace and Airbus Defence and Space also have a significant presence in Toulouse.\nThe University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 103,000 students, it is the fourth-largest university campus in France, after the universities of Paris, Lyon and Lille.The air route between Toulouse\u2013Blagnac and Paris Orly is the busiest in Europe, transporting 2.4 million passengers in 2014. According to the rankings of L'Express and Challenges, Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the Occitanie region, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.\nToulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname La Ville Rose (The Pink City).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nToulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nToulouse has a temperate humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified as a Mediterranean climate zone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age.\nThe historical name of the city, Tolosa (\u03a4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian, or from Iberian, but has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages.Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost.\nAfter the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city of Gallia Narbonensis. In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 (Battle of Vouill\u00e9).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n\n=== County of Toulouse ===\n\nThe town became the capital of the County of Toulouse during the Carolingian era.\nIn 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders.\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the military crusade, such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the Southern French Gothic.\nIn 1215 the Dominican Order was founded in Toulouse by Saint Dominic in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\nIn the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs, were started. They found home in Les Jacobins. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital.\n\n\n=== Within the Kingdom of France ===\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the kingdom of France and declared a \"royal city\". In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years. The Consistori del Gay Saber is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\nThe 14th century brought a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population by Crusaders in 1320, the Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years' War. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.The situation improved in the 15th century. Charles VII established the second parliament of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of pastel, a blue dye made from woad. The fortune generated by this international trade was at the origin of several of Toulouse's superb Renaissance mansions.\n\n\n=== Within the French Republic ===\nThe Battle of Toulouse (1814) was one of the final battles of the Napoleonic Wars, four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition.\nToulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by Marshal Soult.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of the city proper (French: commune) was 479,553 at the January 2017 census, with 1,360,829 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,187,686 at the January 2007 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area). Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.4% per year between 2007 and 2017, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2007 censuses.\nToulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\nFueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for metropolitan France), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.\nA local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Toulouse M\u00e9tropole ===\n\nThe Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Toulouse) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent communes, covering an area of 380 km2 (147 sq mi), totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communaut\u00e9 urbaine). This has become a m\u00e9tropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes.\n\n\n=== Local politics ===\n\nOne of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (Halle aux Grains) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (Z\u00e9nith, the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace was founded, etc.\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen.\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nToulouse has many interesting churches, but three of them are of remarkable architectural and historical interest.\nSaint-Sernin Basilica, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest remaining Romanesque church in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by Charlemagne to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\nCathedral of Saint Stephen is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\nThe convent of the Jacobins (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the Albi Cathedral, the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the Dominican order, for not having obtained the relics of Saint Dominic kept in Bologna, Pope Urban V made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar Saint Thomas Aquinas, one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Civilian buildings ===\n\nThe Capitole de Toulouse (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole (opera house). It is located on the Place du Capitole, a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (place royale). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th-century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (le donjon), which housed the archives of the Capitouls; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called h\u00f4tels particuliers) or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat, the H\u00f4tel de Bernuy, the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, the H\u00f4tel de Bagis...\n\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n\nThe banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the Pont-Neuf, it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the H\u00f4pital de La Grave. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe Jardin des Plantes is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a botanical garden (early 19th century).\nThe Cit\u00e9 de l'espace (Space City) is a theme park of space exploration.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nSights and monuments of Toulouse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe main industries are aeronautics, space, electronics, information technology and biotechnology. Toulouse hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320, A330, A350 and A380.  (A320 lines also exist in Hamburg, Germany, Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, USA.) Airbus has its head office in Blagnac, near Toulouse. Airbus's France division has its main office in Toulouse. Toulouse also hosts the headquarters of ATR, Sigfox, one of the two headquarters of Liebherr Aerospace and Groupe Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re.\nThe Concorde supersonic aircraft was also constructed in Toulouse.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nToulouse has the fourth-largest student population in France after Paris, Lyon and Lille with 103,000 students (2012).\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nThe University of Toulouse (Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse), established in 1229, is located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology\u2014inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts\u2014as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.\nCatholic University of Toulouse\nUniversit\u00e9 Toulouse I, Toulouse School of Economics, Toulouse School of Management and Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse\nUniversity of Toulouse-Jean Jaur\u00e8s (Formerly University of Toulouse II \u2013 Le Mirail)\nUniversit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III)Toulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:\n\nICAM Toulouse (Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers)\nINSA Toulouse\nISAE SUPAERO (Institut sup\u00e9rieur de l'a\u00e9ronautique et de l'espace)\nENAC (\u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile)\nINP ENSEEIHT (\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectronique, d'\u00c9lectrotechnique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique et des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications)\nENSFEA (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de formation de l\u2019enseignement agricole)\nINP ENSIACET (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs en art chimique et technologique)\nINP ENSAT ('\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure Agronomique de Toulouse)\nINP ENM (\u00c9cole Nationale de la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie)\nEPITA (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les techniques avanc\u00e9es)\nEPITECH (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies or European Institute of Information Technology)\nIPSA (Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avanc\u00e9es)\nEIPurpan (\u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Purpan)\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThe most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Sernin.\nInternational schools serving area expatriates are in nearby Colomiers:\n\nInternational School of Toulouse\nDeutsche Schule Toulouse (German school)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThe main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nIn addition to an extensive bus system, the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tired trains. Line A runs for 12.5 km (7.8 mi) from Balma-Gramont in the north-east to Basso Cambo in the south-west. Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaur\u00e8s.\nLine C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Ar\u00e8nes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named \"Gare des Capelles\", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened.

        "wiki": "Toulouse (, too-LOOZ; French: [tuluz] (listen); Occitan: Tolosa [tu\u02c8luzo]; Latin: Tolosa [to\u02c8lo\u02d0sa]) is the capital of the French department of Haute-Garonne and of the region of Occitanie. The city is on the banks of the River Garonne, 150 kilometres (93 miles) from the Mediterranean Sea, 230 km (143 mi) from the Atlantic Ocean and 680 km (420 mi) from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France, with 479,553 inhabitants within its municipal boundaries (as of January 2017), and 1,360,829 inhabitants within its wider metropolitan area (also as of January 2017), after Paris, Lyon and Marseille, and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.\nToulouse is the centre of the European aerospace industry, with the headquarters of Airbus (formerly EADS), the SPOT satellite system, ATR and the Aerospace Valley. It also hosts the European headquarters of Intel and CNES's Toulouse Space Centre (CST), the largest space centre in Europe. Thales Alenia Space, ATR, SAFRAN, Liebherr-Aerospace and Airbus Defence and Space also have a significant presence in Toulouse.\nThe University of Toulouse is one of the oldest in Europe (founded in 1229) and, with more than 103,000 students, it is the fourth-largest university campus in France, after the universities of Paris, Lyon and Lille.The air route between Toulouse\u2013Blagnac and Paris Orly is the busiest in Europe, transporting 2.4 million passengers in 2014. According to the rankings of L'Express and Challenges, Toulouse is the most dynamic French city.Founded by the Romans, the city was the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom in the 5th century and the capital of the province of Languedoc in the Late Middle Ages and early modern period (provinces were abolished during the French Revolution), making it the unofficial capital of the cultural region of Occitania (Southern France). It is now the capital of the Occitanie region, the second largest region in Metropolitan France.\nToulouse counts three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Canal du Midi (designated in 1996 and shared with other cities), and the Basilica of St. Sernin, the largest remaining Romanesque building in Europe, designated in 1998 along with the former hospital H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques because of their significance to the Santiago de Compostela pilgrimage route. The city's unique architecture made of pinkish terracotta bricks has earned Toulouse the nickname La Ville Rose (The Pink City).\n\n\n== Geography ==\nToulouse is in the south of France, north of the department of Haute-Garonne, on the axis of communication between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n=== Hydrography ===\nThe city is traversed by the Canal de Brienne, the Canal du Midi and the rivers Garonne, Touch and Hers-Mort.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nToulouse has a temperate humid subtropical climate (Cfa in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). Too much precipitation during the summer months prevents the city from being classified as a Mediterranean climate zone.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe Garonne Valley was a central point for trade between the Pyrenees, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic since at least the Iron Age.\nThe historical name of the city, Tolosa (\u03a4\u03bf\u03bb\u1ff6\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 in Greek, and of its inhabitants, the Tolosates, first recorded in the 2nd century BC), it is of unknown meaning or origin, possibly from Aquitanian, or from Iberian, but has also been connected to the name of the Gaulish Volcae Tectosages.Tolosa enters the historical period in the 2nd century BC, when it became a Roman military outpost.\nAfter the conquest of Gaul, it was developed as a Roman city of Gallia Narbonensis. In the 5th century, Tolosa fell to the Visigothic kingdom and became one of its major cities, in the early 6th century even serving as its capital, before it fell to the Franks under Clovis in 507 (Battle of Vouill\u00e9).\nFrom this time, Toulouse was the capital of Aquitaine within the Frankish realm.In 721, Duke Odo of Aquitaine defeated an invading Umayyad Muslim army at the Battle of Toulouse. Many Arab chroniclers consider that Odo's victory was the real stop to Muslim expansion into Christian Europe, incursions of the following years being simple raids without real will of conquest (including the one that ended with Charles Martel's victory at the Battle of Tours, also called the Battle of Poitiers).The Frankish conquest of Septimania followed in the 750s, and a quasi-independent County of Toulouse emerged within the Carolingian sub-kingdom of Aquitaine by the late 8th century. The Battle of Toulouse of 844, pitting Charles the Bald against Pepin II of Aquitaine, was key in the Carolingian Civil War.\n\n\n=== County of Toulouse ===\n\nThe town became the capital of the County of Toulouse during the Carolingian era.\nIn 1096, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, left with his army at the call of the Pope to join the First Crusade, of which he was one of the main leaders.\nAt the beginning of the thirteenth century the county of Toulouse was taken in another crusade, of which it was the target this time. The reason for this was the development of Catharism in the south of France, which the Pope wanted to eradicate by all possible means. This struggle took on several aspects, going beyond the military crusade, such as the creation of an original and militant Gothic architecture: the Southern French Gothic.\nIn 1215 the Dominican Order was founded in Toulouse by Saint Dominic in the context of struggle against the Cathar heresy.\nIn the Treaty of Paris of 1229, Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France. The county's sole heiress Joan was engaged to Alphonse, Count of Poitiers, a younger brother of Louis IX of France. The marriage became legal in 1241, but it remained childless so that after Joan's death the county fell to the crown of France by inheritance.\nAlso in 1229, University of Toulouse was established after the Parisian model, intended as a means to dissolve the heretic movement.Various monastic orders, like the congregation of the order of fr\u00e8res pr\u00eacheurs, were started. They found home in Les Jacobins. In parallel, a long period of inquisition began inside the Toulouse walls. The fear of repression forced the leading figures to exile, or to convert themselves. The inquisition lasted nearly 400 years, making Toulouse its capital.\n\n\n=== Within the Kingdom of France ===\nIn 1271, Toulouse was incorporated into the kingdom of France and declared a \"royal city\". In 1323 the Consistori del Gay Saber was created in Toulouse to preserve the lyric art of the troubadours by organizing a poetry contest; and Toulouse became the centre of Occitan literary culture for the next hundred years. The Consistori del Gay Saber is considered to be the oldest literary society in Europe, at the origin of the most sophisticated treatise on grammar and rhetoric of the Middle Ages, and in 1694 it was transformed into the Royal Academy of the Floral Games (Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux), still active today, by king Louis XIV.\nThe 14th century brought a pogrom against Toulouse's Jewish population by Crusaders in 1320, the Black Death in 1348, then the Hundred Years' War. Despite strong immigration, the population lost 10,000 inhabitants in 70 years. By 1405 Toulouse had only 19,000 people.The situation improved in the 15th century. Charles VII established the second parliament of France after that of Paris. Reinforcing its place as an administrative center, the city grew richer, participating in the trade of Bordeaux wine with England, as well as cereals and textiles. A major source of income was the production and export of pastel, a blue dye made from woad. The fortune generated by this international trade was at the origin of several of Toulouse's superb Renaissance mansions.\n\n\n=== Within the French Republic ===\nThe Battle of Toulouse (1814) was one of the final battles of the Napoleonic Wars, four days after Napoleon's surrender of the French Empire to the nations of the Sixth Coalition.\nToulouse, the regional capital, proved stoutly defended by Marshal Soult.\n\n\n== Population ==\nThe population of the city proper (French: commune) was 479,553 at the January 2017 census, with 1,360,829 inhabitants in the metropolitan area (within the 2010 borders of the metropolitan area), up from 1,187,686 at the January 2007 census (within the same 2010 borders of the metropolitan area). Thus, the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.4% per year between 2007 and 2017, the highest growth rate of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, although it is slightly lower than the growth rate registered between the 1999 and 2007 censuses.\nToulouse is the fourth largest city in France, after Paris, Marseille and Lyon, and the fourth-largest metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille.\nFueled by booming aerospace and high-tech industries, population growth of +1.49% a year in the metropolitan area in the 1990s (compared with +0.37% for metropolitan France), and a record +1.87% a year in the early 2000s (+0.68% for metropolitan France), which is the highest population growth of any French metropolitan area larger than 500,000 inhabitants, means the Toulouse metropolitan area overtook Lille as the fourth-largest metropolitan area of France at the 2006 census.\nA local Jewish group estimates there are about 2,500 Jewish families in Toulouse. A Muslim association has estimated there are some 35,000 Muslims in town.\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\n\n=== Toulouse M\u00e9tropole ===\n\nThe Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse (Communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration du Grand Toulouse) was created in 2001 to better coordinate transport, infrastructure and economic policies between the city of Toulouse and its immediate independent suburbs. It succeeds a previous district which had been created in 1992 with fewer powers than the current council. It combines the city of Toulouse and 24 independent communes, covering an area of 380 km2 (147 sq mi), totalling a population of 583,229 inhabitants (as of 1999 census), 67% of whom live in the city of Toulouse proper. As of February 2004 estimate, the total population of the Community of Agglomeration of Greater Toulouse was 651,209 inhabitants, 65.5% of whom live in the city of Toulouse. Due to local political feuds, the Community of Agglomeration only hosts 61% of the population of the metropolitan area, the other independent suburbs having refused to join in. Since 2009, the Community of agglomeration has become an urban community (in French: communaut\u00e9 urbaine). This has become a m\u00e9tropole in 2015, spanning 37 communes.\n\n\n=== Local politics ===\n\nOne of the major political figures in Toulouse was Dominique Baudis, the mayor of Toulouse between 1983 and 2001, member of the centrist UDF. First known as a journalist famous for his coverage of the war in Lebanon, 36-year-old Dominique Baudis succeeded his father Pierre Baudis in 1983 as mayor of Toulouse. (Pierre Baudis was mayor from 1971 to 1983.)\nBaudis tried to strengthen the international role of Toulouse (such as its Airbus operations), as well as revive the cultural heritage of the city. The Occitan cross, flag of Languedoc and symbol of the counts of Toulouse, was chosen as the new flag of the city, instead of the traditional coat of arms of Toulouse (which included the fleur de lis of the French monarchy). Many cultural institutions were created, in order to attract foreign expatriates and emphasise the city's past. For example, monuments dating from the time of the counts of Toulouse were restored, the city's symphonic concert hall (Halle aux Grains) was refurbished, a city theater was built, a Museum of Modern Art was founded, the Bemberg Foundation (European paintings and bronzes from the Renaissance to the 20th century) was established, a huge pop music concert venue (Z\u00e9nith, the largest in France outside Paris) was built, the space museum and educational park Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace was founded, etc.\nTo deal with growth, major housing and transportation projects were launched. Line A of the underground was opened in 1993, and line B opened in 2007. The creation of a system of underground car parking structures in Toulouse city centre was sharply criticised by the Green Party.In 2000, Dominique Baudis was at the zenith of his popularity, with approval rates of 85%. He announced that he would not run for a fourth (6-year) term in 2001. He explained that with 3 terms he was already the longest-serving mayor of Toulouse since the French Revolution; he felt that change would be good for the city, and that the number of terms should be limited. He endorsed Philippe Douste-Blazy, then UDF mayor of Lourdes as his successor. Baudis has since been appointed president of the CSA (Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel) in Paris, the French equivalent of the American FCC.\nPhilippe Douste-Blazy narrowly won in the 2001 elections, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Douste-Blazy had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.\nIn March 2004, he entered the national government, and left Toulouse in the hands of his second-in-command Jean-Luc Moudenc, elected mayor by the municipal council. In March 2008, Moudenc was defeated by the Socialist Party's candidate Pierre Cohen.\nAt the next elections in 2014 Moudenc defeated Cohen in a rematch to re-take the job with more than 52% of the votes.\n\n\n=== Mayors ===\n\n\n== Sights ==\n\n\n=== Religious buildings ===\nToulouse has many interesting churches, but three of them are of remarkable architectural and historical interest.\nSaint-Sernin Basilica, part of the Way of Saint James UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest remaining Romanesque church in Europe. With more than two hundred relics (including six apostles), most of them donated by Charlemagne to the sanctuary that preceded the present church, Saint-Sernin makes Toulouse the second city in Europe after Rome for the number of relics. The church was built at the end of the 11th century and at the beginning of the 12th century to welcome the crowds of pilgrims, its double-sided aisles and the ambulatory surrounding the apse make it the archetype of the great pilgrimage church, where pilgrims could make the circuit around the church and were able to stop for meditation and prayer at the apsidal chapels of the transept and the radiating chapels of the choir.\nCathedral of Saint Stephen is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse. Its construction, which was mainly done at the beginning and then at the end of the 13th century, reflects the history of this decisive century which saw the city lose its independence to become a French city. The single nave is the very first example of Southern French Gothic, at 19 metres wide it probably was at its completion the widest in Western Europe (1210-1220). The higher choir that adjoins it was built in the Gothic style of northern France shortly after the city became part of the Crown of France in 1271.\nThe convent of the Jacobins (late 13th century / early 14th century) is considered to be, together with the Albi Cathedral, the pinnacle of Southern French Gothic architecture. Like all Southern French Gothic churches it has a deliberately austere exterior, but it reveals the beauty of its architecture on the inside with an alignment of columns that are said to be the highest in Gothic architecture (28 metres high). The masterpiece of this church is the column that closes the choir (1275-1292), its palm tree shape was a hundred years ahead of the flamboyant gothic fan vaults. Because he thought it was the most beautiful Dominican church in Europe, and perhaps also to compensate Toulouse, the birthplace of the Dominican order, for not having obtained the relics of Saint Dominic kept in Bologna, Pope Urban V made the church of the Jacobins the burial place of the Dominican friar Saint Thomas Aquinas, one of the most famous philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages.\n\n\n=== Civilian buildings ===\n\nThe Capitole de Toulouse (mainly 18th century), houses the H\u00f4tel de Ville (city hall) and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole (opera house). It is located on the Place du Capitole, a large 19th century square that has the size of a royal square (place royale). The large neo-classical facade of the 18th century (1750-1760) hides elements from various periods: the Henri IV courtyard of the early 17th century with a remarkable Renaissance portal; a 16th-century tower, called \u00abthe keep\u00bb (le donjon), which housed the archives of the Capitouls; vast rooms and galleries with walls painted to the glory of the history of Toulouse (late 19th century)...\nToulouse has also preserved a rich civil architectural heritage from the medieval and Renaissance periods. Forty or so Gothic and Renaissance stair towers still dot the city, mostly hidden in inner courtyards. More than two hundred mansions (called h\u00f4tels particuliers) or remains of mansions give an account of the evolution of civil architecture since the 12th century. The most remarkable are those of the Renaissance, a period which constitutes a golden age for Toulouse. Among these are the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat, the H\u00f4tel de Bernuy, the H\u00f4tel du Vieux-Raisin, the H\u00f4tel de Bagis...\n\n\n=== Some other sights ===\n\nThe banks of the Garonne river offer an interesting urban panorama of the city. Red brick dykes from the 18th century enclose the river which is subject to violent floods. The only bridge to have withstood the floods of the past is the Pont-Neuf, it took almost a century to build it as the project was so ambitious (1545-1632). Further downstream, the Bazacle is a ford across the Garonne river, in the 12th century the Bazacle Milling Company was the first recorded European joint-stock company. On the left bank of the river, historically a flood-prone bank, stand two former hospitals whose origins date back to the 12th century: the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Saint-Jacques and the H\u00f4pital de La Grave. This is how the plague victims and other sick people were kept away from the city by the river.\nBuilt at the end of the 17th century, the Canal du Midi bypasses the city centre and has linked Toulouse to the Mediterranean Sea ever since. Its 240 kilometres were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996.\nThe Jardin des Plantes is a large park spanning several blocks, including the museum of Natural History, caf\u00e9s, activities for children and a botanical garden (early 19th century).\nThe Cit\u00e9 de l'espace (Space City) is a theme park of space exploration.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nSights and monuments of Toulouse\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe main industries are aeronautics, space, electronics, information technology and biotechnology. Toulouse hosts the Airbus headquarters and assembly-lines of Airbus A320, A330, A350 and A380.  (A320 lines also exist in Hamburg, Germany, Tianjin, China, and Mobile, Alabama, USA.) Airbus has its head office in Blagnac, near Toulouse. Airbus's France division has its main office in Toulouse. Toulouse also hosts the headquarters of ATR, Sigfox, one of the two headquarters of Liebherr Aerospace and Groupe Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re.\nThe Concorde supersonic aircraft was also constructed in Toulouse.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nToulouse has the fourth-largest student population in France after Paris, Lyon and Lille with 103,000 students (2012).\n\n\n=== Colleges and universities ===\n\nThe University of Toulouse (Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse), established in 1229, is located here (now split into three separate universities). Like the universities in Oxford and Paris, the University of Toulouse was established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Arabs of Andalus and Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology\u2014inspiring scientific discoveries and advances in the arts\u2014as society began seeing itself in a new way. These colleges were supported by the Church, in hopes of reconciling Greek philosophy and Christian theology.\nCatholic University of Toulouse\nUniversit\u00e9 Toulouse I, Toulouse School of Economics, Toulouse School of Management and Institut d'\u00e9tudes politiques de Toulouse\nUniversity of Toulouse-Jean Jaur\u00e8s (Formerly University of Toulouse II \u2013 Le Mirail)\nUniversit\u00e9 Paul Sabatier (Toulouse III)Toulouse is also the home of Toulouse Business School (TBS), Toulouse School of Economics (TSE), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de gestion group (ISEG Group), the Institut sup\u00e9rieur europ\u00e9en de formation par l'action (ISEFAC), E-Artsup and several engineering schools:\n\nICAM Toulouse (Institut catholique d'arts et m\u00e9tiers)\nINSA Toulouse\nISAE SUPAERO (Institut sup\u00e9rieur de l'a\u00e9ronautique et de l'espace)\nENAC (\u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile)\nINP ENSEEIHT (\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure d'\u00c9lectronique, d'\u00c9lectrotechnique, d'Informatique, d'Hydraulique et des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications)\nENSFEA (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure de formation de l\u2019enseignement agricole)\nINP ENSIACET (\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure d'ing\u00e9nieurs en art chimique et technologique)\nINP ENSAT ('\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure Agronomique de Toulouse)\nINP ENM (\u00c9cole Nationale de la M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie)\nEPITA (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les techniques avanc\u00e9es)\nEPITECH (\u00c9cole pour l'informatique et les nouvelles technologies or European Institute of Information Technology)\nIPSA (Institut Polytechnique des Sciences Avanc\u00e9es)\nEIPurpan (\u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Purpan)\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nThe most well known high schools in Toulouse are Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Sernin.\nInternational schools serving area expatriates are in nearby Colomiers:\n\nInternational School of Toulouse\nDeutsche Schule Toulouse (German school)\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Train ===\nThe main railway station, with regional and national services, is Toulouse-Matabiau.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nIn addition to an extensive bus system, the Toulouse Metro is a VAL (V\u00e9hicule Automatique L\u00e9ger) metro system made up of driverless (automatic) rubber-tired trains. Line A runs for 12.5 km (7.8 mi) from Balma-Gramont in the north-east to Basso Cambo in the south-west. Line B, which opened in June 2007, serves 20 stations north to south and intersects line A at Jean Jaur\u00e8s.\nLine C has existed since line A was completed. It is not VAL but an urban railway line operated by SNCF. It connects to line A at Ar\u00e8nes. Two other stations located in Toulouse are also served by line C. Lardenne, formerly named \"Gare des Capelles\", changed its name in September 2003 when line C opened. Le TOEC station opened on 1 September 2003 with the creation of line C, allowing an urban train service in Toulouse and close western suburbs.Similarly, Line D runs south from Toulouse Matabiau to Muret.\n\n\n=== Tramway ===\nThe tramway line T1 (operating since December 2010), runs from Beauzelle to Toulouse passing through Blagnac. All urban bus, metro and tram services are operated by Tiss\u00e9o. Tramway line T2 is a branch of the first line serving notably Toulouse Blagnac airport.\n\n\n=== Bicycle ===\nIn 2007, a citywide bicycle rental scheme called V\u00e9l\u00f4Toulouse was introduced, with bicycles available from automated stations for a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly subscription.\n\n\n=== Airports ===\nAirports include:\n\nToulouse Blagnac, the principal local airport\nToulouse Lasbordes\n\n\n=== Canal ===\nThe Canal du Midi begins in Toulouse and runs up to S\u00e8te.\n\n\n=== Toulouse public transportation statistics ===\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Toulouse, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 44 min. 9.1% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 9 min, while 10.4% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km, while 8% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\n\n== Communications ==\nToulouse is the home of Bonhoure Radio Tower, a 61-metre high lattice tower used for FM and TV transmission. In 2001 a large (100 km) optical fiber (symmetric 360Gbit/s) network named\nInfrastructure M\u00e9tropolitaine de T\u00e9l\u00e9communications was deployed around the city and suburbs.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Capitole is the home of opera and ballet; there has been a theatre on the site since 1736. The Orchestre National du Capitole, long associated with Michel Plasson, plays at the Halle aux Grains.Le Ch\u00e2teau d'Eau, an old 19th-century water-tower, was converted as a gallery in 1974 by Jean Dieuzaide, a French photographer from Toulouse and is now one of the oldest public places dedicated to photography in the world. Toulouse's art museums include the Mus\u00e9e des Augustins, the Mus\u00e9e des Abattoirs, the Mus\u00e9e Georges Labit, and the Fondation Bemberg in the H\u00f4tel d'Ass\u00e9zat. The Mus\u00e9e Saint-Raymond is devoted to Antiquity and the Mus\u00e9um de Toulouse to natural history.\nToulouse is the seat of the Acad\u00e9mie des Jeux Floraux, the equivalent of the French Academy for the Occitan-speaking regions of southern France, making Toulouse the unofficial capital of Occitan culture. The traditional Cross of Toulouse (from Provence, under the name of cross of Provence), emblem of the County of Toulouse and commonly widespread around all of Occitania during the Middle Ages is the symbol of the city and of the newly founded Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es r\u00e9gion, as well as a popular Occitan symbol.\nThe city's gastronomic specialties include the Saucisse de Toulouse, a type of sausage, cassoulet Toulousain, a bean and pork stew, and garbure, a cabbage soup with poultry. Also, foie gras, the liver of an overfed duck or goose, is a delicacy commonly made in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es.\n\n\n== Sport ==\n\nStade Toulousain of the Top 14 is one of the most successful rugby union clubs in all of Europe, having been crowned European champions four times and French champions twenty times.Toulouse Olympique represents the city in rugby league, playing in the English/European 2nd tier Championship from 2017.\nThe city also has a professional football team, Toulouse FC, who play in Ligue 2, the second division of football in France, and who won the 1957 Coupe de France Final. The club play at the Stadium Municipal, which was a venue during the 1998 FIFA World Cup and 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as hosting important club rugby games and several Rugby League World Cups. Toulouse was also a host of EuroBasket 1999.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nSeveral notable Toulousains have been scientists, such as Jean Dausset, 1980 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; 17th-century mathematician Pierre de Fermat, who spent his life in Toulouse, where he wrote Fermat's Last Theorem and was a lawyer in the city's Parlement; Paul Sabatier, 1912 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry; Albert Fert, 2007 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics who grew up in Toulouse where he attended the Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-de-Fermat and Jean Tirole, owner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, chairman and founder of the Toulouse School of Economics along with Jean-Jacques Laffont.\nMusically, Toulouse is one of the two controversial, disputed birthplaces of Carlos Gardel (the other being Tacuarembo, Uruguay), probably the most prominent figure in the history of the tango. The city's most renowned songwriter is Claude Nougaro. The composer and organist Georges Guiraud (1868\u20131928) was born in Toulouse.\nConcerning arts, Toulouse is the birthplace of Impressionist painter Henri Martin as well as sculptors Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re and Antonin Merci\u00e9. Moreover, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Antoine Bourdelle were trained at the Toulouse fine arts school. Post Impressionist painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's (1864-1901) father was Count Alphonse Charles de Toulouse-Lautrec Monfa (1838-1913) and was part of an aristocratic family of Counts of Toulouse, Odet de Foix, Vimcomte de Lautrec and the Viscounts of Montfa. French graffiti artist Cyril Kongo was born in Toulouse in 1969.\nRaymond IV, Count of Toulouse, one of the leaders of the First Crusade, was born in Toulouse. Aviation pioneer Cl\u00e9ment Ader and psychiatrist Jean-\u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol were also natives.\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nToulouse is twinned with:\n\n\n=== Other cooperations ===\nToulouse also has accords of cooperation with the following towns:\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n138 Tolosa, an asteroid\nRoman Catholic Archdiocese of Toulouse\nAndr\u00e9 Abbal\nListing of the works of Alexandre Falgui\u00e8re\nThe works of Antonin Merci\u00e9\nList of the mayors of Toulouse\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nLe Stang, Anne (2006).

        "wiki": "Carcassonne (, also US: , French: [ka\u0281kas\u0254n] (listen), locally: [ka\u0281kas\u0254n\u0259]; Occitan: Carcassona [ka\u027eka\u02c8sun\u0254]; Latin: Carcaso) is a French fortified city in the department of Aude, in the region of Occitanie. A prefecture, it has a population of about 50,000.\nInhabited since the Neolithic, Carcassonne is located in the plain of the Aude between historic trade routes, linking the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Sea and the Massif Central to the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es. Its strategic importance was quickly recognized by the Romans, who occupied its hilltop until the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In the fifth century, it was taken over by the Visigoths, who founded the city. Its strategic location led successive rulers to expand its fortifications until the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659.\nIts citadel, known as the Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne, is a medieval fortress dating back to the Gallo-Roman period and restored by the theorist and architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc in 1853. It was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites in 1997. Consequently, Carcassonne relies heavily on tourism but also counts manufacturing and winemaking as some of its other key economic sectors.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nCarcassonne is located in the south of France about 80 kilometres (50 mi) east of Toulouse. Its strategic location between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea has been known since the neolithic era.\nThe town's area is about 65 km2 (25 sq mi), which is significantly larger than the numerous small towns in the department of Aude. The rivers Aude, Fresquel and the Canal du Midi flow through the town.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first signs of settlement in this region have been dated to about 3500 BC, but the hill site of Carsac \u2013 a Celtic place-name that has been retained at other sites in the south \u2013 became an important trading place in the 6th century BC. The Volcae Tectosages fortified the oppidum.The folk etymology \u2013 involving a ch\u00e2telaine named Lady Carcas, a ruse ending a siege, and the joyous ringing of bells (\"Carcas sona\") \u2013 though memorialized in a neo-Gothic sculpture of Mme. Carcas on a column near the Narbonne Gate, is of modern invention. The name can be derived as an augmentative of the name Carcas.\nCarcassonne became strategically identified when the Romans fortified the hilltop around 100 BC and eventually made the colonia of Julia Carsaco, later Carcasum (by the process of swapping consonants known as metathesis). The main part of the lower courses of the northern ramparts dates from Gallo-Roman times. In 462 the Romans officially ceded Septimania to the Visigothic king Theodoric II who had held Carcassonne since 453. He built more fortifications at Carcassonne, which was a frontier post on the northern marches; traces of them still stand. Theodoric is thought to have begun the predecessor of the basilica that is now dedicated to Saint Nazaire. In 508 the Visigoths successfully foiled attacks by the Frankish king Clovis. Saracens from Barcelona took Carcassonne in 725, but King Pepin the Short (P\u00e9pin le Bref) drove them away in 759-60; though he took most of the south of France, he was unable to penetrate the impregnable fortress of Carcassonne.A medieval fiefdom, the county of Carcassonne, controlled the city and its environs. It was often united with the County of Raz\u00e8s. The origins of Carcassonne as a county probably lie in local representatives of the Visigoths, but the first count known by name is Bello of the time of Charlemagne. Bello founded a dynasty, the Bellonids, which would rule many honores in Septimania and Catalonia for three centuries.\n\nIn 1067, Carcassonne became the property of Raimond-Bernard Trencavel, viscount of Albi and N\u00eemes, through his marriage with Ermengard, sister of the last count of Carcassonne. In the following centuries, the Trencavel family allied in succession with either the counts of Barcelona or of Toulouse. They built the Ch\u00e2teau Comtal and the Basilica of Saints Nazarius and Celsus. In 1096, Pope Urban II blessed the foundation stones of the new cathedral.\nCarcassonne became famous for its role in the Albigensian Crusades when the city was a stronghold of Occitan Cathars. In August 1209 the crusading army of the Papal Legate, Abbot Arnaud Amalric, forced its citizens to surrender. Viscount Raymond-Roger de Trencavel was imprisoned whilst negotiating his city's surrender and died in mysterious circumstances three months later in his own dungeon. The people of Carcassonne were allowed to leave \u2013 in effect, expelled from their city with nothing more than the shirt on their backs. Simon De Montfort was appointed the new viscount and added to the fortifications.\nIn 1240, Trencavel's son tried to reconquer his old domain but in vain. The city submitted to the rule of the kingdom of France in 1247. Carcassonne became a border fortress between France and the Crown of Aragon under the Treaty of Corbeil (1258). King Louis IX founded the new part of the town across the river. He and his successor Philip III built the outer ramparts. Contemporary opinion still considered the fortress impregnable. During the Hundred Years' War, Edward the Black Prince failed to take the city in 1355, although his troops destroyed the Lower Town.In 1659, the Treaty of the Pyrenees transferred the border province of Roussillon to France, and Carcassonne's military significance was reduced. Its fortifications were abandoned and the city became mainly an economic center that concentrated on the woollen textile industry, for which a 1723 source quoted by Fernand Braudel found it \"the manufacturing center of Languedoc\". It remained so until the Ottoman market collapsed at the end of the eighteenth century, thereafter reverting to a country town.\n\n\n== Historical importance ==\nCarcassonne was the first fortress to use hoardings in times of siege. Temporary wooden platforms and walls would be fitted to the upper walls of the fortress through square holes in the face of the wall, providing protection to defenders on the wall and allowing defenders to go out past the wall to drop projectiles on attackers at the wall beneath, acting much like permanent machicolation.\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\n\n=== The fortified city ===\n\nThe fortified city consists essentially of a concentric design of two outer walls with 53 towers and barbicans to prevent attack by siege engines. The castle itself possesses its own drawbridge and ditch leading to a central keep. The walls consist of towers built over quite a long period. One section is Roman and is notably different from the medieval walls, with the tell-tale red brick layers and the shallow pitch terracotta tile roofs. One of these towers housed the Catholic Inquisition in the 13th century and is still known as \"The Inquisition Tower\".\nCarcassonne was demilitarised under Napoleon Bonaparte and the Restoration, and the fortified cit\u00e9 of Carcassonne fell into such disrepair that the French government decided that it should be demolished. A decree to that effect that was made official in 1849 caused an uproar. The antiquary and mayor of Carcassonne, Jean-Pierre Cros-Mayrevieille, and the writer Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, the first inspector of ancient monuments, led a campaign to preserve the fortress as a historical monument. Later in the year the architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, already at work restoring the Basilica of Saints Nazarius and Celsus, was commissioned to renovate the place.\nIn 1853, work began with the west and southwest walls, followed by the towers of the porte Narbonnaise and the principal entrance to the cit\u00e9. The fortifications were consolidated here and there, but the chief attention was paid to restoring the roofing of the towers and the ramparts, where Viollet-le-Duc ordered the destruction of structures that had encroached against the walls, some of them of considerable age. Viollet-le-Duc left copious notes and drawings upon his death in 1879, when his pupil Paul Boeswillwald and, later, the architect Nodet continued the rehabilitation of Carcassonne.\nThe restoration was strongly criticized during Viollet-le-Duc's lifetime. Fresh from work in the north of France, he made the error of using slate (when there was no slate to be quarried around) instead of terra cotta tiles. The slate roofs were claimed to be more typical of northern France, as was the addition of the pointed tips to the roofs.  Yet, overall, Viollet-le-Duc's achievement at Carcassonne is agreed to be a work of genius, though not of the strictest authenticity.\n\n\n=== Other ===\nAnother bridge, Pont Marengo, crosses the Canal du Midi and provides access to the railway station. Lac de la Cavay\u00e8re has been created as a recreational lake and is about five minutes from the city center.\n\nFurther sights include:\n\nThe Basilica of Saints Nazarius and Celsus\nThe Carcassonne Cathedral\nChurch of St. Vincent\n\n\n== Climate ==\nCarcassonne has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Cfa), though with noticeable hot-summer mediterranean climate influence (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Csa), a climate which is more typical of Southern France, with moderately wet and mild winters coupled with summers averaging above 28 \u00b0C (82 \u00b0F) during daytime with low rainfall.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nThe newer part (Ville Basse) of the city on the other side of the Aude river (which dates back to the Middle Ages, after the crusades) manufactures shoes, rubber and textiles. It is also the center of a major AOC winegrowing region. A major part of its income, however, comes from the tourism connected to the fortifications (Cit\u00e9) and from boat cruising on the Canal du Midi. Carcassonne is also home to the MKE Performing Arts Academy. Carcassonne receives about three million visitors annually.\n\n\n=== Transport ===\nIn the late 1990s, Carcassonne airport started taking budget flights to and from European airports and by 2009 had regular flight connections with Porto, Bournemouth, Cork, Dublin, Frankfurt-Hahn, London-Stansted, Liverpool, East Midlands, Glasgow-Prestwick and Charleroi.\nThe Gare de Carcassonne railway station offers direct connections to Toulouse, Narbonne, Perpignan, Paris, Marseille and several regional destinations. The A61 motorway connects Carcassonne with Toulouse and Narbonne.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\u00c9cole nationale de l'aviation civile\n\n\n== Language ==\nFrench is spoken. Historically, the language spoken in Carcassonne and throughout Languedoc-Roussillon was not French but Occitan.\n\n\n== Sport ==\nIn July 2018, Carcassonne was the finish city for stage 15, and the starting point of stage 16, of the 2018 Tour de France. Previously it was the starting point for stage 11 of the 2016 Tour de France, the starting point for a stage in the 2004 Tour de France, and a stage finish in the 2006 Tour de France.\nAs in the rest of the southwest of France, rugby union is popular in Carcassonne. The city is represented by Union Sportive Carcassonnaise, known locally simply as USC. The club has a proud history, having played in the French Championship Final in 1925, and currently competes in Pro D2, the second tier of French rugby.\nRugby league is also played, by the AS Carcassonne club. They are involved in the Elite One Championship. Puig Aubert is the most notable rugby league player to come from the Carcassonne club. There is a bronze statue of him outside the Stade Albert Domec at which the city's teams in both codes play.\n\n\n== Arts ==\nIn May 2018, as the project \"Concentric, eccentric\" by French-Swiss artist Felice Varini, large yellow concentric circles were mounted on the monument as part of the 7th edition of \"IN SITU, Heritage and contemporary art\", a summer event in the Occitanie / Pyrenees-Mediterranean region focusing on the relationship between modern art and architectural heritage. This monumental work is to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Carcassonne's inscription on the World Heritage List of UNESCO. Exceptional in its size and its visibility and use of architectural space, the exhibit extends on the western front of the fortifications of the City. The work can be fully perceived only in front of the Porte d'Aude at the pedestrian route from the Bastide. The circles of yellow colour consist of thin, painted aluminium sheets, spread like waves of time and space, fragmenting and recomposing the geometry of the circles on the towers and curtain walls of the fortifications. The work will be visible from May to September 2018 only.\n\n\n== In culture ==\nThe French poet Gustave Nadaud made Carcassonne famous as a city. He wrote a poem about a man who dreamed of seeing but could not see before he died. His poem inspired many others and was translated into English several times. Georges Brassens has sung a musical version of the poem. Lord Dunsany wrote a short story \"Carcassonne\" (in A Dreamer's Tales) as did William Faulkner.\nOn 6 March 2000 France issued a stamp commemorating the fortress of Carcassonne.\nThe history of Carcassonne is re-told in the novels of the Languedoc Trilogy Labyrinth, Sepulchre and Citadel by Kate Mosse. Together with Puivert and Toulouse, it features strongly in her 2018 novel \"The Burning Chambers\".\nThe board game series Carcassonne is named after this town, and depicts the architecture of the region.\nPortions of the 1991 film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves were shot in and around Carcassonne.\nA 1993 album by Stephan Eicher was named Carcassonne.\nIn the one-man show Sea Wall, starring Andrew Scott, Carcassonne is mentioned frequently as a setting.\n\n\n== Personalities ==\nPaul Lacombe, composer, 1837\nTh\u00e9ophile Barrau, sculptor, 1848\nPaul Sabatier, co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1854\nSuzanne Sarroca, (1927\u2013), operatic soprano\nGilbert Benausse, rugby league footballer, 1932\nMichael Martchenko, illustrator, 1942\nMaurice Sarrail, General of Division during the First World War, 1856\nDavid Ferriol, rugby league player, 1979\nOlivia Ruiz, pop singer, 1980\nFabrice Estebanez, rugby union player, 1981\nHenry d'Estienne, Painter\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ===\n\nCarcassonne is twinned with:\n Eggenfelden, Germany\n Baeza, Spain\n Tallinn, Estonia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVirtual tour of the fortified walls of the city of Carcasonne\nOfficial website of the city of Carcassonne  (in English, French, Spanish, German, and Dutch) \nCit\u00e9 de Carcassonne, from the French Ministry of Culture\nINSEE",

          "Welcome to the land of fairies and knights. We already know that this is not a very reliable reconstruction but the care and maintenance make it a special and magical place. Very touristy.",
          "An absolute must to visit. In my opinion Carcassonne is better than Dubrovnik. Yes it is very touristy and can be difficult to get away from the crowds, but definitely worth it.",
          "An excellent place to visit. You are instantly brought back in time. If you're keen on details the place filled with them. It is a must see definitely. It's nice to spend the whole day there.",
          "Nice city, great photo opportunities. Lots of great architecture and overall a really unique place to visit",
          "It's a nice place to be. You can walk along the towers, streets, shops... sit in coffee bars after your adventure of the history. You can even book a hunter game or a town tour with a knight. I did both, nothing comparable, I enjoied both a lot. I will come back with my kids to Carcassonne. I am sure they will like it.",
          "It is largely made up of elements preserved since the Middle Ages. Surrounded by a double wall 3 km long, inside it is preserved the appearance of medieval European cities with narrow and twisting streets.\nThe amazing thing about this place \u2026",
          "The medieval castle is so beautiful. I spend 2 hours walking around and take a lot of photos.",
          "The city was Majestic! It's like went out straight from a fairytale.. But be very careful if you go here.. There A LOT of PICKPOCKET. They are very professional that you won't notice. But beside that, the view and the food was fantastic. The price a bit pricey though but it's worth it :)",
          "Best medieval castle I have ever seen. If you love history, architecture or just like pretty small towns... this is the right place. I loved it!",
          "I\u2019m a total nerd for castles and medieval cities and Carcassonne was pretty much the picture perfect place to visit. Its conveniently connected by train to major cities, and the old city is easily walkable for anyone who doesn\u2019t mind a bit \u2026",
          "It is so beautiful. We took a quick walk early in the morning because we didn't really have time but we were still amazed. I highly suggest taking your time in this wonderful city and visiting the castle (which we didn't get the chance).",
          "To be completely honest, we were underwhelmed by the whole thing. The castle is best viewed from the outside, not really a point to pay to go inside as nothing is as it was, you just walk around through it and your done, maybe ten minutes \u2026",
          "A must visit, doesn't disappoint.",
          "Pretty castle which is a tourist magnet. It is crowded with bus loads of tourists. You have been alerted!\n\nThe views from the hilltop are beautiful with the town of Carcassonne below.\nVisit the town centre. It is a bustling attractive centre with myriad of cobbled alleys with shops, bars & restaurants.",
          "Nice place to visit, food and shops",
          "Fantastic. It's the only walled city that was never conquered and it's reconstructed to the detail. It's been an important place since Roman occupation and the visit is great: ramparts, the views, the castle, the documentary on the history \u2026",
          "An amazing complex. Unfortunately dogs aren't allowed in the castle itself so we can't say anything about that, but the citie is well worth looking round. There were very few shops open as we were there in early February but I think that improved the experience.",
          "Great intetesting place to visit for a night or two.  The walled city is very nice along with the castle.  Great little boutiques and nice bar and restaurants scattered about.  Parking is free at weekends which is a bonus.",
          "I now have a new found interest for ancient castles after visiting this place. Walking around the castle I realized that it has a unique vibe, sometimes i felt like it was a piece from my imaginations, childhood fantasies of castles coming \u2026",
          "Paid a visit at the end of feb. Not many tourist so it was very easy to get around. The weather was warm at 18 degree so it was a great time to visit. The cite is a wonderful place to visit and plenty of history here as well as a modern \u2026",
          "Great to explore this excellent restoration. It gives a good insight into the daily life of the citizens of the time and to walk around the ramparts.",
          "Founded during the Gallo-Roman period, the citadel derives its reputation from its 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) long double surrounding walls interspersed by 52 towers. The town has about 2,500 years of history and has been occupied in different ages by Romans, Visigoths, and Crusaders",
          "This is a very cute and nice little old town. Lots of history and nice ice cream. Little boutique stores on every corner with quirky and handmade goods everywhere. If you are in the area definetly worth a visit.",
          "As long as you like medieval Cit\u00e9s, you'll love it.\n\nThe only but I would find to it is the amount of shops, they bring absolutely nothing to the table.",
          "Visit the fortress, walk along the walls, and have so something to eat in the streets. Well worth the visit.",
          "well maintained. little small and not much information available. lots of souvinier shops. must have the cassoulet. duck with beans. really hearty & yummy.",
          "Incredible, detailed and complex example of 1300s fortress.   Be prepared to walk and explore.  Inner castle was worth touring - audio guide was good.  Spent an afternoon walking between the two sets of walls and walking and exploring the old city.  Spent the next morning touring the inner castle/fortress.",
          "It's well-worth a stop in Carcassonne to see the old walled city.  I first visited it in 1974 when I was an foreign exchange student at the University of Montpellier. I've been back several times and always am amazed how one is transported back in time 500 years.",
          "A must visit place for any one who is interested in thirteenth century European history.",
          "Well worth a visit. It's like stepping back in time. Free entry and then just walk around. There's quite a few shops and cafes to choose from once inside the walls",
          "Outstanding medieval city! The city walls and the castle are amazingly well preserved. \nThere are good restaurants inside the citadel serving traditional and innovative cuisine. No supermarkets in there though, if you are planning to go for a picnic in the surroundings you better come with all basket full.",
          "Great medieval town and castle/chateau. Never seen a medieval citadel still in use so it was lovely to see a vibrant and still looked after historical place. Plus the cite de carcassonne has days of free entry sooo what reason is there not to go and learn about the history and even enjoy a meal out.",
          "Fantastic experience.  We decided to make a short break here in route to Toulouse with our dog and managed to spend several hours here.  Amazing castle from the outside and inside there are many restaurants and gift shops.  Prices to suit \u2026",
          "Lovely medieval town well worth a visit, stay in the city walls in one of the two hotels if you can",
          "This is the definitive example of a fortified medieval city. For most people, this is what you envision when you think of castles. Well maintained and well displayed museum takes you through the history of the place. Great shopping, \u2026",
          "This is a historical village rich in beautiful places ! It worth a half a day visit.",
          "Reasonable price for entrance thoroughly enjoyed the walled city and the ramparts full of history #Amazing",
          "This place is amazing. We have been there as kids and now we returned with our kids and it is still as enchanting as it was before for us and for them. \n\nThere were some people in costumes walking around the city (paid pictures probably) \u2026",
          "We just love Carcassonne, but especially during off-season. Great visits and an awesome place to dream about ancient times!",
          "Amazing city - well worth a visit. Walk round the walls if you can, as it's free to access the space between the inner and outer walls (the \"lice\"). Staying there overnight is a good idea, as the crowds are thinner morning and evening.",
          "It's a cool place but very touristy and geared towards tourists with many shops within the walls.  Great if that's your thing but we like to visit historic sights sans commercialism.  We can buy T-shirts and toy crossbows in town.",
          "Stepping back in time. Walking in the tracks of men in old days. Great experience! \nSet aside a day to walk the streets, tour the many buildings, church and wall. Various restaurants are located within the walled city the offer a wide variety of cuisines.",
          "An incredibly restored medieval city! The castle and ramparts are a must see.",
          "Seen a few walled cities but this one is pretty impressive. In excellent condition. Information available in English. \nWorth the \u20ac9 to visit the Chateau and walk around the ramparts",
          "Excellent place for tourists. Well worth coming to see the castle city and the city outside. It takes a while to get to know the streets inside the castle walls. Done nice shops. Quite a few restaurants. Most places have English and Spanish translations.",
          "The name is legendary and the Cathar history of the old town and chateau live up to it.  If you're one who tries to read and absorb everything, allow at least 3 hours for the chateau and museum, before breaking off for lunch. Then go back over the draw bridge to tackle the castle walls. Carcassonne merits a full day. Enjoy :)",
          "A great hotel in a great location. Being inside the old city walls was a wonderful experience. The hotel is everything you can hope for. Get there early to experience the old town after all the day trippers have left. Also, the hotel restaurant is a Michelin starred restaurant, so get reservations.",
          "Amazing place. Very busy but not overly. Free to wander around but castle is a 9\u20ac entrance fee. Worth it if you like exploring castles. Plenty of places to eat. We ate in the square where there is a good atmosphere",
          "A must see if you're anywhere in the South of France. Make the effort to get there. I thought it was very beautiful in the early to late evening. That's not taking anything easy from a day visit. Also, the laser show from  the closest bridge was fantastic. Fabulous world heritage building.",
          "A must see! If you like the medieval era, you must visit this place. The castle and ramparts is a great visit to do. Definately not a tourist trap.\n\nLots of good restaurants inside the walls too. Just avoid most of shops though.",
          "It was a bit touristy but really fun to visit and stay there",
          "Very impressive,  very touristy and  worth a visit if you like shopping within the castle grounds. Lots of people even for out of season. Lots of parking lots around the castle. Free to go in the gate, but you must pay to see inside the museum part.",
          "Just spectacular.Old and historic and oozes charm as does much of France. Loved the narrow cobbles streets and the shopping.Always a bit pricey but too charming to miss and a memorable shopping experience.",
          "Its rich history is what makes it most famous medieval walled city and an important site to visit for those who are passionate about historical places. \n\nCarcassonne is so well preserved that when you find yourself standing before its \u2026",

          "beautiful city but now unfortunately over run by tourists",
          "Beautiful, go ! Stay at a room inside the walls for best experience, auberge de Lices is most amazing and has 2 rooms too. Anytime of year is awesome. We parked at last place before the walled city overnight.. It cost 25 EUR which sadly was half the cost of the room! Rip.. But lovely.",
          "Fantastic place .. despite the August crowds. It's easy enough to find less crowded streets and there are amazing views to photograph everywhere. Narrow streets filled with restaurants and cafes .. Quite spectacular.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful city.  Some of the exhibits are not quite as old as one may think but worth a visit. We explored on bikes with ease. V accessible off the motorway. Had pizza in town which was lush.",
          "We had a great day out today! Parking was easy, and free, and only a 15 minute walk to the city itself. We paid \u20ac9 per adult to visit the chateau and this included re-entry until 6pm the same day. The \u20ac9 also allowed us to visit the \u2026",

          "Magical European town!  What a cute place!  We spent half a day walking around, shopping, eating, taking pictures.  We went in the summer and everything was perfect.  Everything is really well maintained.  There\u2019s easy parking right outside of the city walls.",
          "Ok the day we went, it was free to get in! The walk around the perimeter wall was stunning. The wind was strong, but made it fun. Lots of steep spiral stairs enhanced the castle feel (but be warned if with hard of walking people, it was \u2026",

          "It's nice to see such a large and significant medieval style fortress. It would be amazing if the site was actually originally medieval. However, as it is merely a reconstruction in many places it seems to clean and too refined, more similar to Disneyland than a medieval fort.",

          "Beautiful. Really recommended. I look forward to my next visit from the UK",
          "A wonderfully intact medieval city. One of the few places you can reside in and find good selection of restaurants. Transports you back in time with its architecture and cuisine.",
          "Beautiful castle, with lots of history. Great wee shops to stroll around. Visit is a must do in Carcassonne",
          "An amazing medieval city. Lots of amazing views, lovely streets, and plenty of places to explore. A gorgeous place to visit.",
          "An amazing place to visit. A UNESCO world heritage site. Three million visitors every year and it's no wonder. I really don't know how they managed to build such a large castle many hundreds of years ago.",
          "A nice place overall but it is very big and you need time a lot of time to experience all of it but there are stores in the inside of the castle where you can eat or buy souvenirs. There are guided and self tours too.",
          "We read in a guide book that the castle inspired Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty castle. We were inspired also. Impressive buildings and fortifications. Little shops line narrow streets filled with the full range of wares from toys to fine \u2026",
          "Incredible medieval town. It's almost like a film set. Give the walled city 30 mins and I'm certain you could film Robin Hood. Many restaurants and bars to relax in. If you ever wonder about visiting, don't hesitate. Go.",
          "Great place to visit, very beautiful.",
          "Lovely old medieval city. Great walk around the walls and then through the old streets. Mainly restaurants and gift shops - other than that, we didn't think there was much else there. Glad we have seen it but not sure we will rush back .",
          "Fabulous. Good restaurants, bars and shops in an idyllic fairytale location",
          "Beautiful walled city - Christmas lights were lovely.",
          "Great family visit, kids loved the guided tour. The guide was dressed in medieval clothes. The chevalier spectacle was good too.  Definitely a sight to see. Watch out though, it's an expensive day out. The car park isn't cheap.",
          "A lovely place to visit. Some fantastic restaurant's (see my other review) and a chilled walk round steeped in history",
          "A city ... time travel !!! Walking on the cobbled streets ... you hear the hooves of the knights' horses ... the knocks that make the swords in the battles and the voices of the people who run to avoid the stones from the catapults !!!! Just a wonderful attraction !!!",
          "Great for a weekend break with beautiful scenery, nature, historical buildings and lovely places to eat",
          "Amazing. Worth the visit and spend a few hours wandering around the Citadel and the castle",
          "Our guide was easy to understand and very informative on the history and life of the city. She dispelled rumors or incorrect ideas. She tailored all to our age group. I loved walking the medieval streets . Would have liked to walked above the castle but age and mobility prevented that. It was an enjoyable day stepping back in history.",
          "Fantastic medieval walled city. Plenty to see without actually paying to walk the ramparts. Food in the foodie bit in the middle was surprisingly good. Very enjoyable afternoon.",
          "Brilliant day out. If you know the history of the Cathars then this region is very important and interesting. The castle is great. Very busy in June - August. Good today. Had to stop myself buying some boutique goodies.",
          "This has to be amongst the finest walled city anywhere. Beautifully restored, on Roman foundations, the castle itself within also worth a visit, the town itself possibly a little over commercialised, but there is enough to see and do besides that. The walking tour is great, book at the visitors  centre.",
          "If you want to feel like a round table knight go there",
          "Although much of the city was rebuilt in the nineteenth century, it's still an amazing medieval experience. The buildings, shops, restaurants etc. are wonderful. Very family friendly.",
          "Although terribly touristic the fact that it has been restored so well makes a visit almost mandatory. To eat try the small garden restaurant next to the inner keep. In July and August there is a jousting pageant which was great fun.",
          "Visited Carcassonne as we drove through Europe in a \u00a32000 long wheel-base car. (Long story.) Carcassonne is a well preserved and historic. Maybe because it was a hot day, I didn\u2019t really enjoy it that much. It is only really for tourists, \u2026",
          "Just the most wonderful walled city I know. Great central Chateau, side streets to explore, the stained glass windows in the church of St. Gratien and some excellent restaurants",
          "Great weekend with kids: middel age fair and shows, torches parade at night and many more activities for kids and families",
          "Really impressive medieval fortress city full of tourist shops and restaurants. Well worth a visit.",
          "It's a great place to visit, but it's very crowded. Only a few boutiques worth visiting,  otherwise restaurants and same souvenirs everywhere you look. It is a popular place, especially during the month of August.",
          "The entire castle has been made over for the tourists. That said it has been achieved tastefully\nThere are lots of things to both see and do.\nWell worth the visit if you are in the neighbourhood",
          "Well worth visiting, superb views and castle walls. Lovely atmosphere, caf\u00e9s on the pavement and lovely shops",
          "Beautiful and old. I suggest going in June or earlier when it is less busy. There are beautiful views over the city, gorgeous wall walks and cute little boutique shops. I would suggest also taking 2 days to see la cit\u00e9 and on the second day \u2026",
          "I love this castle and will definitely come back again.",
          "A must see! You can park in the city center and walk 10 to the Cit\u00e9. If you like the medieval era, you must visit this place and make a tour on his walls. Inside are a lot of shops and restaurants but be careful what you choose because some of them may be expensive and I think it\u2019s a better idea to eat in the city center.",
          "Only the French can turn such a well preserved medieval city into a shopping mall. Could be so much better.",
          "Really enjoyed the old fortress, fascinating history and very impressive structure. Lots of small shops and a huge selection of great places to eat. There are tours available but we chose to use the helpful signage around the castle and \u2026",
          "Just amazing. I've wanted to visit for years, and it exceeded my expectations. Gorgeous walls, lovely medieval lanes, some surprisingly good restaurants in what should be a tourist trap. The castle tour and audioguide are particularly great - we spent three hours there. The most beautiful place we visited in four weeks in France.",
          "This place this lots of fun events that you could to",
          "Best castle I have ever visited. Recommended",
          "Simply unbelievable. We drove the whole way across France to see it, and its was worth it! Also, it is free!!!",
          "Good place you can have a wonderful time",
          "Nothing like it, well-preserved, medieval walled city with photo opportunities at every turn. Don't miss it",
          "Bety beautiful place. It was totally worthy visiting it.",
          "Town close to Spain but totally French feeling over there. Interesting place to visit on the coast. Touristic :)",
          "An interesting and historic city that's well preserved. It is, of course, over run with tourists and full of shops and restaurants that are tourist traps, but there are also some good places. Try and get there early.",
          "Stunning architecture but a total tourist trap experience. Restaurants offer poor quality with little variation of dishes. Duck, duck, duck or pizza \ud83d\ude28",
          "Very nice place to visit for a couple of days",
          "What an amazing place. Well worth a visit and enough to do for a couple if days between the historic city and the lower city",
          "Nice place if you love history. From Gallo Roman to 19th century , the city retrace the history of this city behind those massive walls. Food is also great with the local cassoulet",
          "Wow! Incredible! What a city!\nBe aware that it can be very busy with all the tourists!",
          "Would recommend!",
          "This is a fantastic place to visit with lots of things for both young and old. Visit the castle or the inquisition museum and spend time walking through the streets filled with nick-nak shops. There are plenty of places to eat and so you will be spoilt for choice.",
          "Excellent for a long weekend and a super base for getting about the area. Convenient small airport.",
          "Out of the way, incredible sight. Walk the city walls by day and you have great views of surrounding countryside. Some great cassoulet can be found here. Vineyards nearby to tour and taste.",
          "Very beautiful place for one day trip.",
          "So picturesque. So full of Tourists. The locals are blase with customer service which is typically French. But it doesn't negate the beauty of this place.",
          "Great guide, great history!",
          "Medival city, worth the visit",
          "Very nice tourist attraction.",
          "A fantastic and beautiful place where you can travel to the medieval era. I recommend visit the inside of the citadel and see all the sites inside the castle. Really amazing!.",
          "Must have been a hell of a sight back in the day. Nowadays inside the walls is pretty touristic. The inner fortress is a museum which tries to revive the past. Nice views.",
          "Beautiful walled old city. Many shops and restaurants available. There is a cost to tour the castle inside the walled city.",
          "Amazing place just love to walk the walls & streets sit and eat , drink wine mint place",
          "Loved the old town - will definitely visit again - had the best cassoulet ever there",
          "Great view especially in the evening. There are quite a few restaurants in the cite.",
          "We had a good visit but there was an unexpected strike so we couldn't tour the castle instead , very disappointing.",
          "Well worth doing the tour of the castle and the ramparts. A lot of steep and uneven paths can catch you out so not for everyone.",
          "A must see and stay if possible when in the south of France.  Step back in time and enjoy shopping, food, and wine within the ancient walls.",
          "Although quite crowded as one would expect in summer, it is fortunately still possible to walk around freely and enjoy the feel of this great citadel. It is no wonder this is world heritage.",
          "Best to go early in the day to find parking and the streets are a little quieter. Amazing views and the old town shops are really interesting.",
          "Try the escargot in one of the restaurants. Delicious. Amazing view and there are audios you can listen to to learn about the place.",
          "Just stunning! So well preserved...\nI sure the walls plenty of small cozy restaurants and souvenir shops with \"quality\" souvenirs.",
          "The story of the restoration, as well as the medieval feel of the town inside, is great.  Take time to admire from the Pont Vieux.  Spend all day and more.",
          "Very nice and interesting historical sites to discover. Lovely place to spend a long weekend.",
          "The castle is a must. Just like a mini town with the castle walls. Lovely town square. Be aware of opening times for shops museums etc . Not many open on a Sunday. Lovely original cafes. Menu very French not one for the spice lovers",
          "Awesome. City is free to access with lots of eateries and shops. Found many artisan shops exceptionally good value even with the dire \u00a3/\u20ac rate. Chateau well worth a visit. Thought about cycling there from Camping de la City but was thankful \u2026",
          "What a place. Never really knew much about the city or the story behind the castle, but so glad I came to see it first hand. Really cute village outside of the town attached to the castle, with tonnes of charm. Was a little tricky figuring out the timings etc as many of the restaurants were closed (Tuesday afternoon around 4pm)",
          "The citadel is very picturesque, but a bit touristy.  Lots of souvenir shops, but also many outdoor restaurants.  Can get very crowded during peak season.",
          "We came in a road trip as family and we decided to visit Carcassonne. The town itself is very simple and cute, so you don't get lost, but the castle is magnificent. It actually made me think of a fairy tail \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe",
          "Fascinating, so many nooks and crannies to explore.",
          "Considering most of France is shut on Sundays it's good to come to a place where there's a bit of a buzz! Yes, it has some tourist tack but there's a lot more that's interesting. Wonderful views, interesting walks and come at the right time \u2026",
          "Great for a weekend away or day trip if you are in the surrounding area",
          "Very good old City to visit",
          "Unique medieval town. Climb the walls, see the town from the old bridge. Cathedral has beautiful coloured glass art.",
          "Unavoidably we went on a Sunday in August and the place was crawling with Japanese and other tourists and hideously hot. We had brunch in a little cafe which took far too long to muster up our order, despite there being few other guests. The buildings and battlements are impressive enough though.",
          "What an absolutely amazing place. If you don't visit this beautiful world heritage site then you really will have missed something special. The inquisition & torture museums were a favourite of the children's. 5 hours spent there felt like 5 minutes & not a single moan from a child.",
          "Just stunning.  Takes your breath away.",
          "Historic and beautiful views. Would be difficult to visit if u are in a wheelchair or need a walking stick because of the hilly ,narrow,cobbled streets. The battlements would be impossible ,with steep stairways but if u are able the cite is well worth the visit",
          "Beautiful Castle have stayed here before. Back again to take in more of the historical value and sites. Recommend for anybody traveling in the south of France. Just below to toulouse.",
          "Tourist trap. Nice but only souvenir shops. Food in restaurants is good. Lots of historical sites.",
          "On a quiet bright sunny Monday who couldn't love this wonderful place.  All the trappings of the tourist trade but I wasn't biting!  Still has all the charm that I was looking for.   I was content just walking the streets and soaking up both the atmosphere and the sunshine.",
          "Great place to visit very large allow good couple hours",
          "Amazing architecture and views. Well maintained.",
          "\u20ac8 to enter citadel and you can either have audio guide or leaflet. You walk for MILES so take comfy shoes and there are a lot of steps. Interesting video at start to explain history. No staff anywhere on tour so if you want anything it'll have to wait! Also no cafe inside just a drinks machine",
          "The cite is interesting,  but it feels too much like a tourist trap, disney-like.",
          "Beautiful historic walled city overlooking the more modern commercial part. You do get a feeling of what a medieval town was like. A short walk down from the old city is another old street where there are a few bars, restaurants and cafes. \u2026",
          "What can I say about the City of Carcassonne, firstly the City is actually the fort itself, not the city across the bridge. Once you enter inside the fortress gates across the drawbridge you enter an entirely new place. Cobbled streets and \u2026",
          "Lovely day out. Lots of little side streets and gift shops. The tour is great but I should have got ear phones to get a full history.",
          "Beautiful place. A lot of stores, restaurants and fun places inside this medieval city. A + if you like history.",
          "Very nice and romantic city to spend the weekend. Super hotels inside the medieval city. Excellent restaurants.",
          "Very crowded but very fun location for kids (if they love knights and castles). Full of history for the adults",
          "This is such a well preserved citadel, it really is a must visit.  Wandering around inside feels like you have been transported back in time, especially it is a 'working place' just like.it would have been way back in the day.   There are awesome little shops and a lot of choice for restaurants too. Great souvenir shops as well.",
          "Avsutely stunning. Marvellous historic city with Wall to wall tatt shops and plenty of restaurants. And there's the history and culture stuff tae.",
          "A beautiful place to spend a day. It is free entry for students under 26. And 9 Euros for others. It's at walkable distance from train station. Laid back City and a big fort. If you reach early you can enjoy the place more",
          "Beautiful place lots to see, wished we could stay longer.",
          "One of the few walled medieval cities in the world that fully retains it's historical buildings and is in almost complete condition. If you are interested in medieval buildings and architecture you can't miss Carcassonne. It has to be on everyone's list to visit at least once.",
          "Absolutely stunning. A must see during your trip to southern France.",
          "Definitely worth a visit. A magnificent French castle and walled city. A little touristy in spots but if you make the effort you'll have a good visit",
          "It's a great tourist attraction, a little walk up but the place can keep you plenty busy. Lots of shops and oddities.",
          "Fantastic place of historical significance. The light show is a must... A truly spectacular show.",
          "Amazingly fortified city. The view from the walls and the fort is great. There are many small and curved streets with interesting shops, nice caffes and restaurnts. The cathedral is pretty. There is a knight show at 3pm and 4:15pm, which is also nice.",
          "I enjoyed most of my visit, cassoulet for lunch was yummy. All the commercial outlets ruined parts for me. I did like wandering around the place just absorbing the history. We went early so we're not surrounded by crowds for the first couple hours. I can't imagine what it will be like next month.",
          "If you don't want to pay to go inside of the Castle, don't worry! Because the \"Ciudadela\" is very nice and free \ud83d\udc83",
          "A magnificent medieval town with many things to see. The sights from the city walls are beautiful, especially during sunset! While there, be sure to check the Chateau Comtal and the Basilique (church). If you can, try to spend a night in the city, as wandering through the empty streets in a summer night can be quite magical!",
          "Friendly service and good food. Price reasonable for where it is situated right in Cite.",
          "Amazing fortress...so many details still intact!  Get a local guide if possible!",
          "The most beautiful  medieval town .  Is a small town, with a medieval fort.  You can ride a trolly and a horse carriage.  There are also excellent restaurants and souvenir stores.  You can get there by car, bus or train.",
          "Very impressed with this place really deep in past when I was walking around outside and inside on the top was enjoying the view of lovely town by the river and enjoyed authentic French food in restaurants nearby",

          "love this place and cant get enough of it !",
          "It is absolutely excellent castle! I would highly recommend visiting it, there many shops and beautiful mediaeval streets and a wonderful church!",
          "Such a beautiful piece of history. Albeit the spire turrets were not of it's time, it makes them look fairytale and add to the mystery.",
          "A fantastic place to visit and explore.\nI'd recommend staying here. Thank you",
          "Impressive fortress, beautiful walk up the river to 'la cit\u00e9'",
          "Beautiful old city with fortifications. Lots of shops with souvenirs and local products. Try the ice creams and the cassoulet. Great views of the lower part of town.",
          "Wonderful experience!! Such a lovely and authentic setting. The medieval city is to be visited by any history buff in the area as it is so well preserved! Many still original buildings and locations, especially loved visiting the central \u2026",
          "Very fascinating structures. A part of history that we were glad we didn\u2019t miss. Recommend.",
          "Stunning city. Fortunately the parking is plentiful. Fascinating and well worth a visit",
          "Such an amazing city! So well restored and quaint. We visited the castle for \u20ac9 each and just bought tickets on their website while standing in the courtyard instead of waiting in line! The basilica is also beautiful to see! It was a bit \u2026",
          "Been there before. Enjoyed it before. But do not neglect the town which is very non tourist\nIf you get the right spots.",
          "Impressive but spoilt by over-tourism, shops selling tat. Beware of crowds.",
          "Great historical site, and nice town around. Easy to park, many places to eat and authentic medival sightseeing.",
          "Great views from here. Busy historic spot. Prices in the shops are reasonable.",
          "Great citadel! This is a must visit for everyone. If you are coming from the US, this is a Must visit. This is suitable for both kids and adults. There are good options for eating there (even there is a restaurant with a michelin star inside the citadel, but remember to book in advance)",
          "Stunning. Visit as early as possible in the day as it gets very crowded",
          "What a beautiful amazing place.",

          "Amazing. One of the most beautful medieval city in Europe",
          "First you're impressed by the huge and seemingly well preserved fortress on the hill. Then you climb there and you gind narrow streets filled with tourists, generic souvenir shops to spoil their taste, and somewhat spiritless restaurants \u2026",
          "Beautiful mediaeval town. Perfectly reconstructed with tons of shops and delicious food. Fantastic way to spend one day period",
          "Nice place, nice city, nice look at the castle, but there is no interesting exposition inside, in fact there is nothing except stone fragments from which were ornaments on the wall build.",
          "Excellent. Have to go to chateau to go to ramparts but worth the 9 euro.",
          "Lovely city to walk and dine about, can be easily seen in one day....the light show at the castle is worth the ticket",
          "Small town inside the defensive walls of this castle. Nice views of landscapes. You can: buy a great wine or different souvenirs in many shops, try to a great, special cuisine, take unique photos and know something about this historical, great monument.\nI do recommend Carcassonne!",
          "5 stars and absolutely worth it. Beautiful midievel city in these walls. You must read the wiki page to have any true understanding",
          "One of the most picturesque medieval vilages I have ever been to. You should have booked a guide tour in advance. Make sure that you will bring your camera together.",
          "The must see in the area. Nice place",
          "Worth a day visit to see the city and walk around the old walls. Not as much historic information as you would expect. A few nice shops in the town along with many places to eat. It can be nice to spend a night within the city as well. That \u2026",
          "Great historical site. Commercial and cultural history. But also, at this moment july 2019,  a festival of modern music and dance.",
          "One of the best historical site's in Europe. Partly rebuilded but gives a complete point of view of medieval towns.",
          "Not all authentic but all memorable. Stunning in many ways",
          "What a wonderful place !! Well worth the walk to see this completely intact medieval castle. Full of shops & restaurants.  Good buzz & beautiful views especially at night.",
          "Be ready to walk a lot and take many pictures. Great place",
          "Wanted to visit for many years. Well worth the wait",
          "Spectacular! Ten years between visits is far too long! Easy relaxed 8+h visit.",
          "Truly a magical place. It rises above the surrounding community, surrounded by its walls. While some will contend that it is too commercial, I found it delightful to wander it's streets and alleys. It can be very crowded during the daytime, \u2026",
          "Well worth a visit.",
          "Fantastic place to visit",
          "Beautiful castle containing several stores and restaurants on the inside with friendly individuals. Great for calm strolls with your loved ones. There is a very old-looking cemetery adjacent to the castle with very detailed tombstones",

          "See the castle and eat inside the walls. You won\u2019t regret see this beautiful place.",
          "Beautiful place, we stayed in the area for two days which was more than enough if you don't plan on visiting something outside of the Cit\u00e9. Two very different moods during the day and at night, so it's very nice to stay long enough to experience both. Great history and stunning visit.",
          "Cite de Carcassonne is an interesting tourist destination, especially if you are Middle Ages history lover. Legend has it that in this very castle (or fortress if you will) the Inquisition was re-established to combat Protestantism \u2026",
          "Outstanding medical fortress in like-new condition. Off season is best. Crowds are manageable. Many nice shops (high quality) along with the souviner shops",

          "Carcassonne is a stunning medieval citadel and has been well preserved. From the outside, it looks like a CGI created filmset but is a beautiful place to visit. As you'd expect, you pay a premium in the cafes etc but the restaurants seemed to be reasonable value. Well worth a visit.",

          "What an amazing place. We planned to visit here whilst touring with our caravan in France. We stayed at camping Des Pinhiers just to the north.\nThe city walls are almost complete following restoration in the 19th century, we paid \u20ac9 to \u2026",
          "Charming and hystorical city with brief taking views....lot of good restaurant where to eat tipical food at reasonable price. Suggested to be there very early to enjoy the city without queuing. The castle open at 10am and ticket price is 9 \u2026",

          "Such amazing history and architecture",
          "Nice. Just as you would expect. Visiting the castle and walking the walls isn't too expensive.",
          "It is a must trip for any lover of medium ages. It is a travel in time and you will be surrender of a 16th century village in the south of France. It is a travel offered by many cruise lines. Don't hesitate. It really worth it. Mass in the Village cathedral at 9.30h and 11am every Sunday",
          "I doubt I can add much this is a walled medieval city that still has residences living within its confines.  Stunning views and beautiful cobble lined streets the place should be a must stop on your trips to France. While some shops can be \u2026",
          "An amazing city to visit!  Walking all the way around between the inner and outer walls was a highlight. Zigzagging through the streets shopping andlooking for a place to eat was a close runner up!",
          "Great site to go checkout. Lots of shops and great restaurants",
          "Amazing historic city, with loads of little shops, places to eat and a bunch of interesting things to see!",

          "cool lil fort.. no entrance fee.. fun to run around the grounds",
          "Thoroughly enjoyed visiting Carcassonne. Amazed that there was no admission charge to enter La Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne, only an admission fee to enter the Ch\u00e2teau and walk the ramparts, which is worth doing. La Cit\u00e9 was busy but not packed, with plenty of lovely places to eat, and stacks of shops to browse.",

          "Fantastic day out, amazing fortress, tourist friendly.",
          "Amazing. You really feel transported to another era in this cit\u00e9 and the castle is stunning. It\u2019s worth spending a whole day here visiting the many monuments and browsing the cute shops filled with local and authentic produce. Many \u2026",

          "Beautiful, but very crowded. To be expected during the summer season, I guess.",

Many of the shops seem to close after 7 but most of the restaurants in the main square were open until 11 and after. Excellent spot for a weekend break. Very relaxing",

          "Extremely well cooked fresh food, strongly recomend",
          "This is a full on real castle - pretty amazing to see from Carcassonne, as you can really take in how fortified it is. Once you're inside the walls, you can see how it functioned as a small enclosed town. Everything is massive and just imagining how they brought all that stone up the hill will make your back ache.",

          "Beautiful fortress, well worth visiting but be careful in the summer it can get very busy. What is notable is that all the guides talk about exploring the countryside around Carcassonne. The fortress itself can be done oin a day. Not worth the overnight stay,",

The castle is fun for young children to look around and you can walk around the ramparts quite safely because there are discreet safety barriers protecting you from the drop. Great gift shop too.",

          "We visited in 2016 with a handicapped woman so had limited time to enjoy. Vowed to return. This was the return. Stayed within and adjacent to the walls. The most magnificent walled city on the planet. Better than Lucca, better than Le Mont St. Michel. Double walls,",

          "This castle is a castle within a castle it is absolutely amazing. Yes 2,000,000 tourists visit every year and it can be pretty crowded on days. We thoroughly enjoyed this experience as it gave you a huge insight in days gone by. We were blown away with the Cathedral it is",
          "What an amazing city. We walked everywhere we were allowed, including the main palace. The area is known for its wine and cassoulet, a hot dish containing duck, sausage, and beans. Several of the restaurants in the city make it. The entire family loved it!",
          "Shock, horror, one of the few people not to have enjoyed this beautiful monument!! The buildings themselves are amazing. Sadly inside this tourist trap, almost the entire area is filled with expensive tourist cafes (blocking much of the architecture) and lots of little shops",
          "If you\u2019re coming to Carcassonne and you must see this site it\u2019s absolutely amazing. You can definitely spend the whole day there possibly two. The guided tour is well worth the money however exploring individually is just as good. I highly recommend the night light shows it\u2019s",
          "We are pleased we took the time to visit as it is of course, very old and very interesting. We were however disappointed at how it is a real tourist mecca, selling anything and everything with a Carcassonne label on it, even the church had tables set up inside selling souveneirs",
          "As you approach the town of Carcassonne you are greeted by the imposing edifice of this massive castle and its double walled defences. Entering the castle compound you are greeted by numerous shops and restaurants crammed into the old historic buildings selling souvenirs and",
          "The old Cite Castle in Carcassonne was very beautiful. Not only was it a wonderful historical site, but it was filled with many shops and cafe's to indulge. I would highly recommend at least two days in Carcassonne, one for the castle and one for the city.",
          "For people who want to see the medieval castles in the Cathar areas, the Carcassonne castle is the place to go. But inside it is highly commercialized with shops and restaurants. I suggest that aside from this, visit one or two of the castle ruins in the area such as in",
          "Nothing like I imagined. This site is so so big and well maintained. The only way we reckon you can do it justice is with a Guided Tour. We learnt so much about the small stuff and got shown through secret doorways and entrances due to our small group numbers. Could spend a",
          "Very large fortified city with citadele. Best photos from a bridge. There is a cathedral and many shops and restaurants inside. Probably largest castle I have ever seen.",
          "We spent a few days here and enjoyed every moment. Despite the location the bars and restaurants were very reasonable and good (we didnt try them all!) The castle is worth a visit and if you are there in the Summer - do the light show at night. Top tip! Visit the castle first",
          "Nothing like expected could loose yourself here gladly. Nothing like we ever ever seen before. France is full of gems but nothing could have prepared us for the fortified city of Carcassonne. If making a trip to south of France please make a stop at this lovely place.",
          "Very enjoyable walk around the cite - inside and outside the walls. Good eating options. Unfortunately dogs not allowed in the chateau/ramparts. Good for a couple of hours.",
          "Well worth walking around at night. Loads of restaurants and shops. Very nice place to take pictures.",
          "For years I had dreamed of visiting spectacular Carcassonne La Cite and prebooked a skip the line ticket for the ramparts. Before entering, we took the little train ride around the outside of the fortifications, which was a useful way to get an understanding of the scale.",
          "Beautifull place to visit. Just walking there is a nice experience. A bit tricky to manover with a stroller in the crowded and small streets but feasable. Several restaurants and shops inside...with continous service at some restaurants.",
          "Just walking around inside the walls was interesting, but after you pay - not excessively - to get inside to actually walk the top of the walls, it was really great. The magnitude of the City became obvious and the passages, battlements and rooms all fitted into the whole scheme",
          "I took my girlfriend to Carcassonne for her birthday this year, and we loved it. The citadel is breathtaking, and the fact that people live and work within it makes it all the more special. With the castle, bars, restaurants and shops, it\u2019s a perfectly picturesque location ideal",
          "Our family of 4 really enjoyed our audio guided tour of the castle & its walls. The views are breathtaking at every turn. Would highly recommend for all ages.",
          "You need to be quite fit to walk the city and especially the ramparts. There is a horse drawn ride but I didn\u2019t like the horses up and down with up to 20 people onboard in the extremely hot temperature. There is also a little train which will take you up but depending on where",
          "We drove to paid P2 parking where was lot of space. Walking to town was about 500 m through the path with stairs. You can nicely see the the whole hilltop town during the walk. Path led us to glorious gate off the city wall. You can walk around the walls to other side of the",
          "Easy to find parking just outside the city walls, bit expensive but hey. We stayed for about two hours, wandering the narrow streets in the city and then visiting the castle and ramparts. We booked tickets in advance so were able to skip the queues. Bonus: children under 18 as",
          "Great place to visit. So interesting to walk around and soak up the history. We paid the extra (it's only \u00a39) and walked around the ramparts too. Well worth it.",
          "So cool to see how this city has been preserved and restored so that we can visit it today. It was great to be able to explore, unfortunately we didn\u2019t arrive until late and even in the high season it closes by 6.30pm. Restaurants, bars and shops were all still open tho. We",
          "Cassoulet is one of my favourite dishes, but this time I was not going to use up precious time in a restaurant. I had only 2 hours to 'do' Carcassonne. Ridiculous. I made my point to the shore excursion team but don't know if they were listening. It was in their power to extend",
          "We went in August and it was a beautiful day, so it was busy. Really, very busy. We parked in the main car park just outside the medieval town and it was one in/one out but the problem seemed to be paying to park rather than a lack of spaces. Cost about \u20ac9 for 4 hours. Then a",
          "It\u2019s like stepping back in time- such a beautiful medieval town. It was quite busy because it was nice weather and the summer holidays, but you could still find pockets of peace within the crowds. The castle tour is amazing and really informative. Walking the walls of the city",
          "This is our second visit in 2yrs. We love it. Arrived around 9.15 and were able to park at the closest car park. We only went in the areas that are free and had a really good explore. I know some people think it's too commercial but I like the little shops. I compared prices and",
          "There is an intellectual debate as to whether the restoration of the Medieval Citadel in the late 19th Century was the correct thing to do or if it should have been left in its dilapidated \u201cauthentic\u201d state. Considering that the French Government had originally decided in 1849",
          "This was a most enjoyable experience. The Medieval city, with its defences and fortifications, has been well preserved or reconstructed. To visit it is to have the opportunity to get a glimpse of what life must have been like in those far-off times. But one must remember that is",
          "Perfectly preserved walls and buildings the small walled city is filled with a myriad of shops, restaurants and bars. Quite simply Carcasonne is a must see destination, but be warned it is VERY busy!",
          "As many have said the interior of the medieval city is basically a tourist trap rammed with trinket shops. In medieval times the city would have been rammed with other types of shops and services I am sure....forges, herbalists, seamstresses, tanners, food sellers....cities",
          "This is really a fantastic place to visit but not in August. The buildings really make you feel like you are in a Harry Potter book. I loved it. However in future I would visit during the winter or off peak. Sometimes it was hard to move with all the people crammed in like",
          "This was a cool city to visit as part of a day trip, but I was glad that we didn\u2019t stay in a hotel here. It\u2019s a highly frequented tourist area filled with shops, restaurants, hotels, and ice cream shops. We did a tour inside the city and enjoyed it. We did have to watch the",
          "We arrived at Carcassonne with high hopes: despite the negative reviews we were hoping to experience the atmosphere of the Middle Ages in its purest form possible. Sadly, we ended up fleeing the place in horror and disappointment: massive hoards of tourists, as early as 10 AM;",
          "This place was recommended to us by friends, whose friendship will now have to be reconsidered following this visit. Externally it is impressive, as far as restorations go. However, internally, it is appalling. It is just restaurants, bars and shops selling tourist tat. Paying",
          "This castle was brilliant, entry to the outer parts are free and have lots of shops and dining. Castle entry is 14 euros! Had an amazing day, sightseeing, wining and dining. A Must see in Carcassonne",
          "Packed, well it is summer, unavoidable. However, there is nothing authentic or real here. Restored walls and towers surround dozens of tourist shops and over prices restaurants. It is a tourist trap...",
          "But seriously, you do feel as if you have stepped into the alternative world of Harry Potter here. It is such a wonderfully preserved medieval city with the alleys, buildings and city walls in amazingly great shape. Probably good for just one night as there is not a lot to do",
          "Good for a day out, very touristy and prices reflect this. Nice selection of food and bars and ice cream parlour, shops are really souvenir shops. We went during the day and then a couple of times in the evenings, the night market was tiny and not much to it compared to some",
          "We were there on Bastille day so it was crowded but you could still find areas that quieter. The old city of Carcassonne is absolutely a visual splendour. There are 52 roofed towers and serrated battlements that top almost 2 miles of double enclosure walls. It took almost 50",
          "This brilliant restored medieval city is a must see site in southern France. It is awe inspiring and a great way to spend a day. Entry is free over the portcullis and you can wander little medieval streets of cute shops and cafes or restaurants with brilliant views. Best we",
          "We stayed for couple hours walking around and had a great meal. Allthough crowded, very charming and photogenic.",
          "We stayed near the Bastide but it was an easy 20 minute walk using the footbridge at the end of Rue du Pont Vieux, which also had good photo opportunities for the River Aude and the Cite itself. The route naturally lends itself to entry at the Porte Narbonnaise, which gives onto",
          "Amazing fortifications and ramparts and castle buildings. The whole city has a wonderful historical feeling, in places it's a bit like the original that Harry Potter was based on. A little bit tacky on some small streets but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. A real",
          "It's all getting a little tacky in the main streets, with souvenir armour, swords and shields - who doesn't need a new suit of armour from time to time ... That said the place is a magical pseudo medieval place and seen from afar looks like it is magical - best viewed in its",
          "Very impressive from a long way off and the inside is a maze of small cobbled streets, all very photogenic. Yes it\u2019s very touristy, yes it can get very busy, but if you can see past all that then this is a place worth a visit and keep in mind most of the complex is free, it\u2019s",
          "What can I say besides that it was a truly magical experience. Climbing through the medieval streets of the walled city, poking among the alleys, walking around the inner and outer walls, it was all fantastic. Every time you think you\u2019re at a dead-end you find a small passage or",
          "Carcassonne is an exceptional place to visit, the history is amazing, there is an abundance of high quality restaurants to try, also an open air theatre featuring top music performers, please check performances well in advance for ticket availability",
          "What a wonderful place to spend several hours. This was our second visit to the Cite Histoire and we loved it. There is just something special about being in a fortified town that is hundreds of years old and still standing. Lots of places to eat in the square. People are",
          "Top medieval walled-city packed with souvenir shops, tourist restaurants and a modern theatre. Like chinese old towns turned onto a Disney world.",
          "We were told that the castle and battlements would open at 10 am (so timed our visit from 09:30) for the cost of 9 euros but the staff are currently striking so open the castle and battlements at a time to suit them e.g. 11:30. Some of the area was also not open due to them",
          "If you love to be packed with hundreds of others going thru 3000 over priced souvenir shops and bars in what is supposed to be a medieval city, then you just found it! I found it very disappointing, from the outside it looks stunning! Once you passed the gates you can as well",
          "Truly outstanding location with lots of history, narrow streets and gigantic fortifications. However in summer it is over run with tourists, so best to get there early in the day.",
          "Visiting on Bastille Day, I was worried about the crowds but the tour was still enjoyable and I was able to take my time wandering and imagining what life must have been like. Shopkeepers were friendly and I even got to meet some of theirs four legged helpers.was still worth",
          "Be sure to see it in both day and night. Great fun walking the streets and taking pictures. One of our favorites.",
          "lovely old city with its walls and narrow streets.Get there early, because it does get crowded and a little unconfortable.Huge choice of bars and restaurants",
          "Lots of things to do and see. We had a good sandwich. Lots of shops, castle is good and the jousting show was ok, kids enjoyed it. Walking up does not take long and well worth it.",
          "If you have been to one of the fortified towns in France you have a good idea what to expect. Same shops, same touristy restaurants, same crowds, same t-shirts and local specialities of some nature. If you were teleported to one of these, it would be difficult to tell them",
          "The Carcassone Fortress is a large fortification on top of a hill. Wiew from the walls are simply astonishing. I recommend taking a small train tour around the walls if you have conpany. Inside the fortress you can find many medieval knights and imitations of medieval equipment.",
          "This old city of Carcassonne is absolutely magical!! DO take the time to tour and DO pay for the ticket to enter the interior castle. It is worth every cent to hear the history of the old fortress, the architect who did the renovation and walk along the ramparts above the",
          "We walked the Ramparts, visited the castle, visited the Basilica and lodged within the city walls for 4 nights in total. It was unbelievably hot but we loved it. If you enjoy history this is a must do experience.",
          "Carcassonne is just simply amazing - the castle is fully intact and you can walk around the medieval city with half timbered buildings - it really is like stepping back in time. Sure there are tourist shops but don\u2019t you want to buy a knight get up anyways?",
          "History is alive here in the beautifully restored fortress at the top of the hill. A bit of a challenge if walking or biking to get up there, but well worth the effort. Yes, it's been touristified with all sorts of shops and things around the area",
          "If you are in Carcassonne, you cannot miss the fortress. Walking around the outside was magnificent, and views from afar are awe-inspiring. Within the fortress, it is highly touristic. If you know the town of Carmel, California, which is all fancified -- fixed up, cutesy, fancy,",
          "It is a popular tourist site and therefore you will get ALL the trashy bits that tourist site have as well as all the brilliant information too. But it well worth spending one day touring around the whole site. The information tapes and plaques are very good.",
          "Great strolling & sightseeing, enjoyable lunch, followed by shopping & dessert. Carcassonne was one of the absolute highlights of our trip to Toulouse!",
          "We always stop in here on our way across the south of France to have a stroll and some lunch. Even though it\u2019s clearly a tourist trap, it always seems to retain its charm as a well preserved medieval city.",
          "This not something to miss if traveling in this part of France. Try not to do it, however, on a blistering hot day. City is interesting both for architecture and history. Educational for the grandchildren. Probably best to do it outside the crazy, crowded, humid & hot",
          "A stunning historic fortified Cit\u00e9 Well preserved with very informative tours available. Lots of good restaurants and shops which some may consider over commercialised but I felt give give an idea of how busy such a a Cit\u00e9 could have been in Medieval times. If in this area it",
          "Fantastic place to visit. You can walk around the outer walls and basilica for free, but have to pay to enter the inner ramparts. Lots of little shops and restaurants and places selling ice cream \u2013 about 4.8 to 5.5 euros for 3 scoops. You can sign up for a guided tour, but the",
          "3000000 visitors per year cannot be wrong. This is the most arresting place. Stunningly rendered. Vast yet intimate. I proposed here and whilst that lays a heavy bias it is time to stop revelling in Carcassonne the board game, but the town itself. Stunning views. Great food. Not",
          "No trip to this area would be complete without a stop at this beautiful castle and town. Rent the audio guide for the castle it is only about an hour or so. There are plenty of nice cafes and restaurants and shops, both souvenir type and nicer places with fine goods. The",

          "I went with my parents and 20-year-olf son in June. This was really spectacular, and it is definitely worth to pay the fees (about 9 dollars for adults and free for students) to visit the castle. It is amazing to be able to walk inside a castle that is so well conserved, and to",
          "Had a wonderful week in Carcassonne, despite it coinciding with a record heatwave. As well as the medieval walled city, do have a walk around the La Bastide area, as well as along the River Aude, and a trip along the Canal du Midi.",
          "52 turrets surround this truly awe inspiring castle. We walked inside the grounds of the castle during the evening. It also houses an 'inner castle' which requires payment to enter. We didn't see the secrets of the inner castle. There are many photo opportunities from a",
          "Steep climb up to it unless you take the little train. I found I didn't need the audioguide in English although I took it, because the information boards in each room had enough info in English.",
          "Very pretty - unexpected amount of shops and restaurants within the walls - doesn't take long to visit and you can walk the walls in about 20 minutes but definitely worth visiting - we liked the road that linked lower and upper town best. Took a really lovely canal trip in the",
          "Stayed very close to the Citadel, it is great with lots of shops and restaurants, the lower Bastide is also worth a look and finally there is the Canal du Midi close by to take a canal trip.",
          "Our family visited because we like the Carcassonne board game. Had a great time and wish we\u2019d allowed more time to walk around. The huge projected movie was educational and interesting. The site is in good condition, with a dedicated tour route inside the \u201ccity\u201d. But the shops,",
          "A great family experience, touring the historic city of Carassonne. No line up today, and one of us paid for the headphones, to enrich our knowledge. The rest just paid for entrance. A big part of our experience was the city area (free), where there are many lovely shops, cafes",
          "We visited this citadel recently and did the walking audio tour before having a drink at one of the many restaurants. The city structure itself has been well maintained, further to its many assaults, additions and developments over the years. It\u2019s quite easy to walk around and",
          "Don't believe all of the positive reviews! Carcassone is a city with much historical significance. Unfortunately, that's been completely obliterated by heaving crowds of tourists, and the mediocre restaurants and cheesy trinket shops that serve them. The city itself has done",
          "Visited on a weekend in early June. Very busy but nice atmosphere. A large selection of restaurants and bars on practically every street with the added artisan shops. There is a charge for entrance to the chateau and ramparts but free elsewhere.",
          "We stayed two nights inside the walls (at the Hotel Donjon) and enjoyed both the busy days and the peaceful nights. Unfortunately the castle was closed (the workers were on strike!) but we walked around the walls and saw the rest pretty well. Lots of shops and restaurants. We",
          "I have been wanting to visit Carcassone for many years, as I have read so much about it. It lives up to my expectations, even though it is very much a tourist destination.",
          "Great views on our approach filled us with anticipation of a attraction worth seeing Came up the bastille hill passing lots of bars and restaurants got to the top and entered on the portcullis gate. Great historic atmosphere and well preserved. Once inside it was awesome.",
          "Definitely worth a day and a night. Partially Unesco Heritage site.The only completely intact medieval city left. But built on a much older site. A few dozen locals living inside the old walls and hundreds of tourists visiting. Only two small hotels (both excellent) inside so",
          "We enjoyed walking around the old castle and it\u2019s ramparts imagining the people who lived here and how they made their way around the castle. Some passages are very small, take walking shoes there\u2019s many steps.",
          "I\u2019m not generally a history buff, but we spent a day in the Medieval Cite and I could easily have stayed longer. Walking streets that were first constructed 800 years ago, marvelling at the construction feats that building the city entailed is mind-blowing. Seeing the city lit",
          "The city was restored some time ago and is now mellowing into what it needs to be. It is losing the \"Disney\" look that it had soon after restoration and now looks more authentic.",
          "The City looks great from all angles perched high up on the hills. Be aware that to get in you have to pay admission, even just for the streets and restaurants/shops in Le Cite.",
          "I love this place! There is so much to see and do that I could easily spend a month there. Would love to visit it again.",
          "A jump in the Middle Ages!! We like places full of history and romance. Carcassonne is one of those. Viollet-le-Duc's restoration at Carcassonne is agreed to be a work of genius, though not of the strictest authenticity.",
          "We got there early evening. So after viewing the fort and the church it was wonderfull just walking the city when hardly anyone was around. You had only to imagine what it was like hundreds of years ago. With the crowds gone you often found yourself alone on a medievel city",
          "Amazing to walk the ramparts and imagine the fierce struggles for survival which happened here. Tough for those with knee or hip problems but worth it. Do get tickets and E3 audio guide. Allow 2-3 hrs. Tons of souvenir, snack, and art shops adjacent. Need a toy Roman sword?",
          "This is one of the best historic walled cities and castle sites I have visited. Extremely clean and very accessable its a great days exploring for both young and old. Lots of greay food options inside too. We highly recommend.",
          "Great selection of eateries, magical towers and ramparts, vibrant and romantic, fabulous in every way",
          "We absolutely loved visiting here. Imagine a real life medieval town, Harry Potter fans would love this place. I loved everything thing about it .... from the cobbled streets, the amazing turrets, to the fantastic shops, the incredible history and being able who walk around in",
          "So much to see and so much history! Beautiful day for a walk - not too many people - great food and great ice cream! Love the history!",
          "Our second visit to Carcassonne medieval cite, looks like a fairy tale city from a distance. A must to visit with its great bars & restaurants, a few tourist shops & fashion. There a some hotels if you want to stay within the city walls. You can walk around the inner city walls",
          "It is a tourist attraction but there are several good restaurants and a haunted house that the teen agers loved.",
          "This is the most incredible because of its size and quality of restoration. Restaurants and shops were touristic but not outrageous in price. It is really possible to get a feel of a medieval castle.",
          "This place is really is wow, however you do not need to spend a penny! You can walk through the main streets , visit the top hotels reception areas and gardens and walk all around the outer ramparts. Still great views and if you only have one to two hours is a perfect stopover.",
          "Amazing views from the ramparts, to the Pyrenees in one direction and the massif central in the other. Gently sloping cobbled streets wind around this fabulous walled city, Interesting restorations add to the fascination. Lots of shops, some very good, and likewise lots of",
          "The medival city of Carcasonne is a very nice place to visit. Full of small, narrow alleys to walk around and get the feel of history. An impressive cathedral and castle/museum. We went by ourselves, and just enjoyed the athmosphere.",
          "I definitely recommend visiting the fortified city. It\u2019s fun to walk around the old streets and take a tour of the castle where there is lots to learn. There are also plenty of great options for eating every meal in charming, family-run restaurants.",
          "I was here on a four night stay in Carcassonne, visiting the citadel on two days. It is not too big and easy to get around in. The chateau and ramparts are certainly worth pating to get into. WE took the audio tour and were very pleased with it. The former cathedral is certainly",
          "The historic fortified city is impressive by day but really takes on a different mood at night. When the floodlighting takes over at night, the old city seems to become stronger and more spectacular after sunset. There are plenty of great places to eat too.",
          "Great place to visit so much to see walking around the turrets. Lots of shops and plenty of places to enjoy a coffee and eating out",
          "Having visited many castles in Europe and as an avid reader of French/English history, Carcassonne was exactly as expected. A bustling town inside the walls and crowds of people buying souveniers and eating. We paid to go inside the castle and walked one section of the ramparts.",
          "One of the Oldest Medieval City in Europe, lots of restaurants and walks in the City to visit this amazing medieval place.",
          "We loved everything about Carcassonne!! From the people, the food, the history, the safety everything was amazing. We stayed near the river Aude and would walk over to Le Cite (the fortified city) of the morning to get emerald in the Cather history and the experience of the",
          "This was a wonderful place to go and walk around. Just amazing to see all the history and the very old buildings. Lots of sight seeing to be done - well worth the trip.",
          "Obviously this is a popular attraction and crowds are to be expected. But is is so incredible, so overwhelming, so grand, so majestic. It's magical. You can easily spend 3-4 hours wandering around the fortified city.",
          "The old city of Carcassone is a must when visiting southern France. It has been rebuilt some 100 years ago and saved from disrepair.",
          "Enjoyed walking through the town and taking the tour along the walls. Lovely to look out over the town and walk through the museum inside. We didn\u2019t do the audio tour, we were more into passing through on our own but would definitely do the audio tour next time. Inner city quite",
          "The history is unbelievable, nothing to compare in Australia. So much to see and the church was amazing.",
          "This old town was rebuilt starting on the 19th century. Although it is not an exact replica of the original, it provides and excellent idea of how the town was. Just keep in mind you have to park outside and climb uphill.",
          "I did enjoy seeing this castle but there are more interesting and beautiful places to go in this region. So if you have time go.",
          "It goes without saying that Carcassonne is one of the must-sees of France. The historic city is a clear highlight: you feel as though you've been immersed in a fortified medieval city. Wandering around is very entertaining, but I thought that the number of touristy shops kind of",
          "It\u2019s impressive to view the walled city from the distance as you wall up the hill. It\u2019s fantastic that the walled city is intact and the city is so easily walkable. However, we have a car and travel off the beaten path, so we are spoiled when it comes to crowds. This place is",
          "This intact walled city is of historical importance and has been well taken care of. I would advise anyone to stay at the hotels within the walls. This is well worth the visit.",
          "Breathtaking views and fun little city to explore for the day. It is well-maintained with great little shops and surprisingly good restaurants.",
          "This town is breathtakingly beautiful and well worth the visit. With a mixture of Roman and medieval architecture, it is fascinating to see how this walled city evolved over time. Stay for one night - that\u2019s all that is needed.",
          "Absolutely love this place, magical and mysterious. Did two days exploring. Wonderful place to visit.",
          "I've been to Bruges, Aux de Provence, San Gimingiano, Sienna, etc. and I have to say that Carcassone is the most classically picturesque of them all (though once you stroll the cobblestone streets, Carcassone looks a lot like the others. We went out of our way from Avignon to",
          "Charming and ancient. It is fascinating to explore all of the inventive solutions for battle in this old city. Great restaurants and classic tourist shops. A fun day.",
          "This is an entirely fortified city, with a castle, church, houses. Nowadays it has also hotels, bars, restaurants and shops that make happy lots of tourists. The prices in the shops are expensive, but one can find some interesting products from the Provence region, like parfums,",
          "Unbelievable size and construction and so well preserved. With plenty of information in many languages for you to get to understand what is was like over the many hundred of years it to construct. My only criticism was why was there so much poor quality gifts on offer to",
          "Whole reason to come to Carcassonne so plan for a full day here. Steep climb in from City side but parking at opposite side has less of a climb. Castle inside worth a visit and plenty of bars, shops and restaurants",
          "This is a must. The history of the fortified city is very interesting. The walk around the wall is great exercise and the views are outstanding. I am planning my return sometime in the near future .",
          "The feel of the middle ages will come alive in the city. Cobblestoned streets, narrow avenues and lovely scenes abound.",
          "I am glad we had been to Carcassonne before because on this Spring weekend it was overrun with tourists. It was difficult to walk down the cobbled streets or really appreciate this medieval site. When we were here in the dead of winter, it was much easier to appreciate .",
          "The Cit\u00e9 of Carcasson, IE, the Tall Walled bit, is impressive, historic, and has a thousand stories to tell. It's worth paying to enter the Castle, as it's interesting in its own right, and you get the best views. It's a challenge to get the sheer number of different rulers/",
          "We planned a 2 day trip to Carcassonne and it was WAY too long. Touristy and little to do. Plus, we were pickpocketed in the train station. Beware if you go, or just avoid altogether.",
          "A most interesting historical site well worth a visit. Take the audio tour of the castle and ramparts to get the best of a visit. The cathedral is also a must.",
          "This medieval town is so beautiful and well preserved. It is nice to see that this complex has the walls, cathedral, fort and general town preserved and in great shape. There is so much to see and take in so allow 3 or 4 hours to see everything.",
          "We have been to many medieval cities so were not sure how this would rate but so glad we came. It was more of a working village inside the walls. Felt very authentic and natural. We were fortunate to be here on a beautiful sunny day with no crowds so made the walking extra",
          "A must to visit! The City of Carcasonne is very picturesque and impressive with its double outer walls and high towers. Entrance is free and is open most days. Its a mix of old and new as one can explore the fortress, the basilica of St Nazaire, taking you back through centuries",

          "Just fantastic and awe inspiring. wander the narrow cobbled streets, soak up the atmosphere, be amazed by the middle aged ramparts. A truely must see place.",
          "One for the bucket list. A fairytale imagined in the beautiful and atmospheric Languedoc. Having read the history of the Cathars I was eager to see if the citadel lived up to its reputation. So it\u2019s not original, most of it was reconstructed in the 29th century. The turrets for",
          "We have visited many medieval cities but Carcassonne is the best with a fantastic castle, 2 miles of imposing double walls around, and other attractions, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Visit for whatever time you can spare but the best experience is spending the night,",
          "It \u00b4s not a city but a tourist rip off. Nobody lives here anymore, they just want you to give them your money. Look at the pictures or look at the distance to this originally wonderful place, similar to so many other locations it is dead now, no real live. And that is what makes",
          "We had a great time in the medieval city wandering the streets and getting some lovely food and drinks on our many stops. A tour of the chateau is worth the price.",
          "This is worth at least a full day to browse the shops and enjoy the restaurants. The cathedral is magnificent. Definitely worth going to the museum. Rich in history.",
          "First time to carcasonne and was not disappointed. Well worth a visit. I really recommend that you pay to go into the chateau and ramparts. But pay for your ticket at the tourist office. Saves the queues",
          "This is an amazing ancient city. IT has been refurbished and makes Carcassonne a must stop while in southwestern France.",
          "We were lucky enough to stay within 20 mins of the city, but then nowhere in Carcassonne is far from here. Easy to find. In October quick and easy to get in anywhere. No need to buy tour tickets or quick access. Everything is clear and easy to do yourself.",
          "So, my husband and I put Carcassonne on our list of things to do on our drive around France, because we're huge fans of the Euro game of the same name. We also enjoy history and the city is a fairly in tact example of a medieval fortress, although most of what you see has been",
          "Mont St Michel, Domme, Rocamadour....tourist traps for centuries and just as an earlier reviewer said, you can add Carcassonne to the list. All are striking and well worth visiting but upon entering degenerate into a scrum of tourist shops. Best viewed from outside. Well worth",
          "I'm wondering a little about my trusty, go-to, Trip Advisor reviews as this place has thousands of 5 star reviews and we found it just...meh. From the outside driving up it is truly spectacular. It looks like you're approaching a city and castle from the Middle Ages that is",
          "Been here many times and although very touristy it's quaint and there are some good restaurants and querky shops. Great historical place to visit",
          "A lovely city, full of cobbled streets, it has a great feel for the place. i had been wanting to visit for years and certainly wasn't dissapointed. loved it",
          "A beautiful city that is well worth a visit; I would not be able to spend much more than a weekend here as there isn\u2019t too much to do, however it is well worth seeing at least once!",
          "A friend suggested that I would not even need 1/2 a day here and he was right. 5/5 for the castle from outside. It's impressive and the story behind it is really interesting. However...... 0/5 The old village inside disappears behind souvenir shops and restaurants. Similar to",
          "The medieval city sits high above \"modern\" Carcassonne. The ramparts are complete and within there are narrow streets and lanes, with many cafes, restaurants, hotels, artisans, etc. Amidst there is the castle, the church of St Nazaire, Museum of the Inquistion. It is well worth",
          "Wow. very happy to visit this place. The street to the Castle is nice with lovely bars and restaurants and when you reach the City walls and go inside there are many streets full of distinct shops and further places to eat, although these are more expensive. You can take a",
          "A well preserved medieval town, from the outside it's majestic and imposing. Inside the gates it is well preserved, however I was very disappointed to find undistinguished tourist shops and restaurants with unfriendly staff. The highlight of my time there, and worth the",
          "This medieval city well worth a visit great places to eat and drink within the walls and yes it is full of tourist shops but these shops hold interesting things for all the family from home made nougat which is absolutely delicious to little toys for kids a really enjoyable day",
          "Overlooking the \u201cnew\u201d city of Carcassone, this really is an imposing and magnificent walled city. The tour of the fortresse within the walls is excellent , as is the church. Lots of shops and restaurants in the city, an excellent and historic day out.",
          "This is a great preserved Medieval city. The walls and ramparts seem to be in great shape. I did not do the things that I had to pay an admission for. This is a hugely touristy spot that is really overrun with tourists, at least when I was there. It is a fascinating place to",
          "A bit of a walk uphill to get there but you can catch the shuttle bus from outside the train station or hop on the white city train tour to get to the other entrance. Once inside you can explore the medieval streets and pay to take a tour of the ramparts and castle.You can also",
          "It's hard not seeing yourself as a knight or a lady when you're walking around in this city. Absolutely stunning!",
          "The imposing sight of the Ch\u00e2teau and the ramparts of Carcassonne can be seen by the approaching visitor, long before actual arrival there. I accessed the Medieval City, hidden behind the Ch\u00e2teaus fortified walls by entering through the main entrance and walking over the old",
          "I had been there 20 years ago and came back to show my wife the walled city. We took the tour of the castle and walked the ramparts around it. There is not a lot there, there is short movie presentation that was worth watching but the rest is an old castle that you walk around",
          "If you have a chance, do not miss spending a day or two exploring this amazing old city. You walk in streets originally built by the Romans before Christ. We loved every minute here. Night time is beyond beautiful.",
          "This medieval fortress city has 52 towers and almost two miles of walls/battlements built on top of older Roman walls (there will be changes between the types of bricks/stone so look for those). The mid 1850's restoration under Viollet-le-Duc revitalized this old fortification",
          "A must visit place while traveling to Carcassonne. The quarter still keeps it\u2019s medieval atmosphere and is full of great restaurants and interesting shops.",
          "We loved Carcassonne. It has huge history to see and enjoy. Take the barge on the canal du midi. Explore the old city. Enjoy the huge selection of bars and restaurants. The locals are very nice but appreciate an effort to speak French. The taxis are a bit iffy and allow extra",
          "Well worth a visit especially if anybody studying history. The walk up the hill is very steep so suggest either a taxi or the little white tourist train. No entrance fee but you just pay to visit inside the inner castle walls. Atmosphere brilliant.",
          "Wonderful place to wander around for a few hours with lots of places to stop for coffee or shop for souvenirs. This is a must if you are visiting Carcassonne. The impressiveness of the walled city never fails to amaze when you catch a glimpse coming over the bridge out of",
          "Wonderful experience, walked the castle at night and then visited during the day, worth paying for the tour and walking the castle walls, a great piece of history!",
          "This was one of the trips we did on our cruise. We docked at Sete and took the coach to carcassonne. It took the best part of two and a half hours each way. We had a guided tour around this stunning medieval city, which is now full of shops, restaurants, hotels and gift shops.",
          "Had been on our bucket list for years and certainly did not disappoint. A glorious place, well preserved, clean and a total pleasure to walk within it's walls. French products everywhere, very little cheap rubbish, well done. A must for everyone to see, especially history buffs",
          "Carcassonne city is well worth the visit. Castle is the highlight especially around the walls. Great views but so many visitors. Good restaurants",
          "Easy walking medieval city a must see for any visitor to the region. Plenty of shops and restaurants and wonderful photogenic sights",
          "I visited this castle because I'm in love with the game \"Carcassonne\" and it didn't disappoint. It's beautiful and I really enjoyed exploring the walls, both inside and outside. My favourite part was walking along the outside walls. It's only \u20ac9 to enter the castle (free for",
          "This medieval City is a gem and is definitely worth the trip. However, it is better to avoid summer season and its crowd",
          "Simply stunning to wander through the ruins of this medieval beauty. We went when the much debated artwork was over the walls -very marmite - I loved, the rest of the group I was with hated it. There are some lovely shops and restaurants within the City, a little",
          "This is the reason why most people visit Carcassonne and you won't be disappointed. There is a lot of commercial activity, but also a lot of history on view. Make sure you see it at night under lights as well as during the day. Adelaide would be our choice of restaurant.",
          "The medieval city always impresses me. From a distance it is quite stunning. However, once there there I think you would really need a guide to enjoy it. The interior is mostly restaurant and gift shops and this really spoils this historic site. The cathedral is beautiful and",
          "Come early spend the day. Walk the town with all the great little shops and restaurants. Walk along the end side of the castle, that doesn't cost anything. Spend the 9 euros, to go inside it is well worth it. I also suggest to pay the 3 euros extra and get the audio",
          "Vibrant, charming, living medieval citadel. It is so more than a stunning place to visit, or an ancient Cathar citadel. Walking round les Lices (between the citadel walls) is a good idea if you want to connect with the energy here without the tourists. You can wander along tiny",
          "Nice walking tour with audio guide for 9 and 3 for the audio device. This is only for the keep. The rest of the cite is free to walk unless you try one of the many restaurants or shops. But that is on you. Very large site and so lots of walking. Beautiful church and lots of",
          "Yes its becoming evermore touristy, but as with most 'go to' places in France its well kept and mostly free to access. Walk the outer wall, see the internal citadel (you pay for this), shops, restaurants, church etc. Worth seeing if your in the area.",
          "This is a piece of history that can\u2019t be missed. Take a tour before you do too much exploring as it gives you a background to everything you\u2019ll see. Go to the Tourist Office in the centre. Guides speak English - Jaqueline was sensational. September was a perfect month - lovely",
          "Yes, \"awesome\" is a terribly overused word, but the fortress of Carcassonne truly deserves the word. Four of us spent the better part of the day there. The Lonely Planet Guide had an unusually detailed explanation of the fort, which made it all that much more interesting.",
          "Carcassone Score: 2.5 City itself: 2 Food: 2.5 Hospitality: 3 Transport: 1 Cleanliness: 4 . \u2795La Cit\u00e9 Fortifi\u00e9e is really beautiful. \u2795 Public toillets everywhere. \u2795 Amazing breads. (I finished this trip as a baguette!) \u2795 Cr\u00eaperie Le Bl\u00e9 Noir had the best cr\u00eape I've ever eaten in",
          "We stayed near the old city and enjoyed wandering round in the evenings and early mornings, when there were fewer people around. Lots of little alleyways to snoop around in and had a good tour of the main fortress. There are craftspeople working in some of the small shops.",
          "Great shops and restaurants as well as getting to walk around and through the medieval city. Catch the little train into the city centre for a nice day then return for just a few Euros. Great views of the city and surrounding mountains, just wonderful",
          "For many people Carcassonne might be out of the way. It would be a shame to miss seeing the walled city. It's really special. And just a short walk away is the town with many shops and restaurants. Overall, very worthwhile.",
          "Had a guided tour here which was excellent. Nice to find such a well preserved mediaeval city. Hundreds of restaurants-90 % of which have the same menu. There are no supermarkets in the city and buying provisions can be difficult.possibly best to stay elsewhere and visit the",
          "Whilst very busy with day trippers during the day, the city is quite magical at night. You have to pay approx. 9 Euros to see some parts however. We had hoped to walk the whole perimeter but \"Health and Safety\" have put a stop to such experiences !!!",
          "A city within walls. You can walk around it, go on a petite train or on a horse and carriage. Lots of artisan shops and cafes/restaurants to visit, a chateaux and beautiful church. The petite train can also take you into the modern town of Carcassone so allow plenty of time for",
          "This is the best castle I have ever been to. You can walk all around the ramparts and learn lots about it\u2019s history. The entry fee is well worth the money and there are plenty of shops and restaurants inside too",
          "Carcassonne wears its age well. Like an ageing matron she carries the superficiality of a dreamy theme park yet does not seem to mind the throngs of pilgrims who flock en masse to visit France\u2019s second most popular sight (after the Eiffel Tower). It\u2019s compact and easy enough to",
          "A wonderfully preserved walk through history itself. A highlight! Plenty of restaurants, cafes, shops and delights to satisfy you. With an incredible view of the city!",
          "The city of stone houses (mostly tourist shops & cafes) within the castle was in very good condition and depicted what life must have been like in the medieval ages. Lots of tourists in summer and some tourist trap cafes (poor quality food for the prices) but definitely worth a",
          "Came here for a weekend break with friends. The medieval city is slightly out of town, a 25 min walk from the town centre, or a 5 min taxi ride. As a tourist attraction it is nice, but all you get is slightly tacky shops and lots of resteraunts nestled within the walls. It",
          "We had visited before and so went out of our way when we we re ibn the south of France this year to go again. It is a magical place, you can feel the history as you are walking around it.# There are loads of places to eat and drink and shops selling everything from soap to",
          "This was the reason for our visit to Carcassonne and it didn't disappoint. A bit of a tourist trap but the place breathes history. A must see",
          "A must see if you are travelling in South West of France. Be prepared for lots of staircases & steps if you a viewing all rampart areas but the views are impressive. We took the self guided option with multi-language hand sets which provide great historical and architectural",
          "We visited the cite in the early evening and stayed for a few hours having dinner inside the walls, we had visited the chateaux remains at lastours in the afternoon and would suggest this also as part of a day visit to the region. In my opinion the cite is well worth visiting",
          "After the crowds of the day leave! Wandering the windy streets takes you to another time. Views from the ramparts are wonderful.",
          "The negative.....it's too commercial, and \"touristy\". But, it's the largest still intact Medieval fortress in Europe and an impressive structure. Football shaped and blocks long, it is very imposing. It's a must see in Carcassonne.",
          "Stopped here with a group tour for lunch. Lots of places to enjoy a relaxing meal while surrounded by such history. Get a map! Once inside the city gate there are so many very narrow streets. Be sure to see the basilica which is stunning. Learn about it\u2019s bloody past where many",
          "Took the guided tour and was well worth the fee. We also took the castle and ramparts tour. Superb views of the city of Carcassonne.",
          "As you approach the castle, it is impressive (except for the Tour-de- France stripes) An outside walk about the castle is also impressive. However inside the midevel village is a recreation. Lots of souvenir shops and mediocre food. However, young kids would love it!",
          "The medieval city has a beauty of its own that doesn\u2019t go with concentric yellow circles. It\u2019s not an original idea and was done by a Swiss artist so not even a French collaboration Otherwise, we like the city inside although go early in the day as it is packed with tourists",
          "A much renovated walled city with amazing history of conquest and resurrection. We took a walking tour at 9euro from tourist information. Absolutely fantastic resource and really helped us understand some of the building and cultural changes. Buzzing with tourists, a tiny bit",
          "The old, medieval city is incredible to see. As might be expected, the narrow streets were full of tourist shops. The church, the walls, the turrets are from story books for most people. Great to see the real thing.",
          "We walked from the train station . Easy 20 minutes. We also booked skip the line tickets from Viator which was just as well as the crowds are big and queues long . Skip the line was quick and allowed us in front of groups to stroll the ramparts . WOW this is castle. You only",
          "It is an iconic place to visit. Wear good walking shoes to experience it all safely and comfortably. Lots to see and quite busy most times, I expect. We were actually there in July 2017 but I could make that selection when writing this brief review over a year later. Sorry.",
          "An amazing place . It\u2019s visually incredible and has an atmosphere that\u2019s unique. There are some very good restaurants not cheap but not overpriced either taking into account were you are. Well worth going to for a weekend",
          "This is a neat medieval city, but is very crowded in the summer. I'd like to go back in the off-season, when I could actually see the sites, and not be trapped in a sea of overly warm humanity. Some neat little shops, but hard to enjoy any of the architecture in the throngs.",
          "Really just a tourist trap. Much better places in the area. Shop after shop of expensive rubbish. A few nice shops at the top",
          "Such an amazing place! A real medieval town with its charm. Also, it is very very clean. A lot of restaurants and shops. Will come back soon!",
          "My husband, five-year-old son, and I visited on a Sunday in early September. It was a warm and sunny day so we expected large crowds. I didn't realize that there is a lot of the medieval city to see without paying for admission, so that was nice. A few observations: there are",
          "The Cite in Carcassonne is well worth a visit, we paid to walk around the ramparts from where you get a wonderful view of the city. The Cite is also buzzing with shops and restaurants and many tourists. You can take the little train up to the Cite or back down into town after",
          "Two of us went to the old city on a hot busy day what a mistake! It was so busy it was like walking through a football crowd. It was so bad we left after an hour and returned another day at a later time which was slightly better. I think it would be such an amazing place to see",
          "Visiting the old city is a must if in the area. A good day out with many things to see with little shops and good restaurants within the walls of the city. Guided tours available but walking around at your own speed is just as good and well worth it.",
          "Just fantastic. Busy between 10am and 5pm...visiting tourists on 1 day excursions. Restaurants very reasonably priced for all across the eating spectrum. Visit is a must if you are in this area of France.",
          "Fantastic place to visit, the view as you round the bend and see it is beautiful. Very reasonably priced to get into the ramparts and free for children. If you don\u2019t want to go in the shops and restaurants are buzzing. Not at all what I expected!",
          "Lovely medieval city, very touristy too so very crowded but great for an afternoon out. Generally very expensive",
          "Worth a visit but a little bit \u201cdisney\u2019 with people dressing up in medieval costume and kids running about with wooden swords. Would much prefer to visit in spring or autumn and avoid the crowds.",
          "A place full of history. A place full of very good food places. A place full of \u2018touristy\u2019 shops. A place full of really helpful nice people. 3.5m people per year can\u2019t be wrong. Try it.....you\u2019ll love it!",
          "Beautiful city. I would love to live here. Great meals everywhere we went, friendly people all with good English and didn't scoff at our appalling attempt at French Check out the luminaire In the chateau stunning",
          "Approaching this city by road or rail presents extraordinary views of the walled town high on a hill above the more modern urban area. The walled city is a maze of medieval streets and alleys crammed with shops and restaurants within which visitors are encouraged to just wander",
          "Many times in Carcassonne and we always went to the Cite in the evening. By day it's a bustling experience with shops , bars, restaurants within the ramparts. Free entry to the street areas. Jousting was on its last day. 2 shows per day for a fee. Not sure how much though. Lots",
          "Well worth a visit. The architecture and cobbled streets are very impressive. Be careful not to go to the first cafe or restaurant you see as there are plenty of tourist traps around. But some good value and high quality restaurants inside the city if you search for them.",
          "We visited Carcassone as we traveled between Avignon and Cassis. It was most definitely worth the detour! You could walk the narrow streets within the walls and picture the past. There were also amazing views from the walls and many delicious spots to stop for a snack.",
          "Exceedingly touristy but beautiful never the less. Lots of restaurants and an awful lot of tourist tat shops. It is worth visiting but you will be part of the tourist excess.",
          "Really beautiful, definitely worth an overnight stop. Arrive late afternoon/early evening to avoid masses of tourists. Stay in between the bastide and medeival city (relatively well placed hotels we noticed were hotel vieux pont, hotel trois couronnes on river- great views of",
          "We spent five days in a XVIII century house just ta few blocks from the Porte de l'Aude, traveled around, all the way to Rocamadour, but dedicated a full day to explore the old citadel, did the walking tour and witnessed the July 14th festivities, fireworks and all and it was a",
          "I love the feeling of this town. The architecture is wonderful and really fires the imagination. Nice place to wonder around or sit and watch life go by. Good motorcycle parking just outside the walls. Lots of shopping if that\u2019s your thing. A good place to bring kids. Many, many",
          "On our way from Northern Spain to the Cote d'Azur, we stayed in Carcassonne for one night. Like everyone else, we visited the Medieval City and were disappointed by how touristy the place is. Don't go there unless you like places like Disney World!",
          "Two complete walls, 58 towers, castle with moat. A real medieval city with 136 residents. Life just like it was 1,000 years ago. Great restaurants, bars, shops & museums. The museum of torture is the real deal. Loaded with history.",
          "Carcassone is very small but very beautiful I visited about 35 years ago and only returned this summer It has not really changed but being summer was extremely busy A visit to the ramparts is a must and is well organised and good value The restaurants in the city were on the",
          "Stunning city and hitorical castle. Kids who are 6 and 10 enjoyed it. Lots to do and see but very busy during peak holiday times. Also found the whole area quite over priced but thats france for you. Had a fab holiday and would defo return.",
          "We visited on possibly the rainiest day of the year, yet it did not spoil the wonderful views of a magical Medieval City. The narrow streets inside and the shops, restaurants and bars were plentiful. Quite a unique experience",
          "We spent a day in Carcassonne in peak tourist season so it was very busy, but still fascinating to explore. We parked at the Gambetta car park, across the river from the old city, and walked across - about a 10 minute walk. We chose to pay to get into Chateau Comtal so we could",
          "Carcasonne is unique. The only problem is how busy it gets during the holiday season. So stay in a hotel inside the walls and enjoy the early morning or late evening when it's quieter and more atmospheric.",
          "Having read previous reviews that mark it down for being \"touristy\" I think they need to wake up and snell the coffee, IT IS A TOURIST PLACE!! The yellow cladding is a big big mistake as there is no rhume and reason for it, what is it meant to represent!?! We stayed locally",
          "The Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne, in other words the old walled town, never loses its allure. While much of the upper parts of the many towers and encircling walls are the result of mid nineteenth century restoration work, the end result is quite splendid. So, while architectural purists",
          "The guide book info on the old castle doesn't prepare you for the sheer scale and fairytale experience, though you will share that with thousands of others! When we visited the main elevation was striped in bright yellow foil that made the castle walls look like they had been",
          "The Most Beautiful Medieval City with some charming pedestrian routes when exploring that take you back to the middle age !!!",
          "We were last there in 2012 and loved it so much we went back to visit in 2018 and it DID NOT dissapoint. We just loved it as it's a fully working Medieval city not just an tourest attraction. One of the best.",
          "Our visit started walking from the camp-sit to the citadel along the river. We had a great day and we enjoyed ourselves in the many shops and attractions that we found there.",
          "Spent 3 days staying just outside the Cit\u00e9 what a great area I didn\u2019t expect it to be so huge and loads and loads of restaurants and bars and shops inside and outside the Cit\u00e9. Do the ramparts tour with audio it\u2019s well worth the 12\u20ac each we lined up for a ticket but only took 20",
          "We arrived early on a Sunday morning to ensure easy parking and to get ahead of the crowds for our visit to \u201cLa Cite\u201d. Although few of the commercial outlets were open we enjoyed a good breakfast in an attractive square before wandering around. There are many beautiful buildings",
          "We visited on a very hot August day and walked from the new part of the town into the old and up to the top of the hill. We did see a small train taking people up but not sure where that started. It was busy but fascinating- plenty of places to eat and drink, lots of gift",
          "A beautiful place to visit. There where a lot of people, which made certain places difficult to see properly. We chose to walk around in our own, which meant that we missed out on some things. But the place was beautiful and we had amazing and cheap food inside the walls.",
          "At the time of the visit, there were not many other visitors, so we walked alone through the little streets which added to the experience. It gave more feeling of travelling back in time. The views from the towers and castle walls were beautifull. There were good parking",
          "A fantastic trip into a bygone time with all mod cons present too. Food venues a little over-priced and was served that smallest cassoulet I have ever seen but it was nice.",
          "Stayed at Camping Cite for 6 days in July so visited the medieval city several times - avoid weekends if you can, weekdays were a little quieter. Lovely just wandering the cobbled streets. Lots of bars and restaurants many offering the traditional cassoulet which we tried and",
          "Be prepared for crowded streets & shops & eateries but it is still worth a visit. Best onion soup I have ever had! Bought the game Carcassonne too! Cobbled streets so wear good footwear. Take plenty to drink as it is expensive to buy.",
          "We parked by canal du midi and walked through the new town and approached the medieval city via the old gate and the concentric circle art installation. From a distance it looks odd but the effect is quite dramatic when you stand in the correct spot and view the city with the",
          "We were there this month during a very hot spell. The citadel is very popular and as the day goes on it gets more and more crowded. There's lots to see, plenty of restaurants, bars, cafes, souvenir shops. When we wanted a break we always were able to find a cafe or bar with",
          "Arrived at 10am and managed to park in Porte Narbonnaise P0 which is right near the entrance (\u20ac9.50 when we left at 4pm). Pre booked tickets which meant that we did not have to queue just showed email confirmation. Audio guide worth the \u20ac3. Had a lovely 3 course lunch at La"

        "wiki": "Stade Toulousain (French pronunciation: \u200b[stad tuluz\u025b\u0303]) (Occitan: Estadi Tolosenc), also referred to as Toulouse, is a French rugby union club from Toulouse in Occitania and the reigning Top 14 champion. Toulouse is one of the most successful clubs in Europe, having won the Heineken Cup a joint record four times \u2013 in 1996, 2003, 2005 and 2010. They were also runners-up in 2004 and 2008 against London Wasps and Munster, respectively. Stade Toulousain have also won a record 20 French Championship titles. It is traditionally one of the main providers for the French national team.  Their home ground is the Stade Ernest-Wallon. However, big Top 14 matches along with Heineken Cup games are often played at the Stadium Municipal de Toulouse. The club colours are red, black and white.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\nBefore 1907 rugby in Toulouse was only played in schools or universities. In 1893, students of secondary school \"Lyc\u00e9e de Toulouse\" got together in \"les Sans Soucis\". Once attending university the same students founded \"l'Olympique Toulousain\", which became \"Stade Olympien des Etudiants de Toulouse\" (SOET) a few years later in 1896. In the same period, 'non-students' grouped in \"le Sport Atl\u00e9thique Toulousain\" (SAT) while students of the veterinary school created \"l'Union Sportive de l'Ecole V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire\" (USEV). Both entities merged in 1905 and called themselves \"V\u00e9to-Sport\". Finally in 1907, Stade Toulousain was founded resulting from a union between the SOET and V\u00e9to-Sport.\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nStade Toulousain played its first final of the national title French Championship in 1909 and lost it to Stade Bordelais Universit\u00e9 Club (17\u20130) in Toulouse. In 1912 Stade Toulousain won its first national title. It had to wait until 1922 before it won its second. However the 1920s were a golden era for the club. Their first final action in the 1920s was in 1921, when they were defeated by USA Perpignan. Despite losing in 1921, the side went on to win the 1922, 1923, 1924, 1926 and 1927 championships.\n\n\n=== 1930s to 1950s ===\nThe following decades were relatively quiet after such a dominant era during the 1920s. Stade Toulousain would not make it to any grand finals during the 1930s, and it would not be until the late 1940s when they would return. However they did contest the Challenge Yves du Manoir with RC Toulon in 1934, though it ended in a nil-all tie and both teams were winners. The club made it to the final of the 1947 championship, and claimed the premiership, beating SU Agen, 10 to 3. However, no such championships followed, the club was again relatively quiet on the championship. It was 22 years in the waiting; Toulouse made it to the final, but were defeated by the CA B\u00e8gles club.\n\n\n=== 1970s to 1980s ===\nIn 1971 Toulouse contested the Challenge Yves du Manoir against US Dax, losing 18 to 8. Eleven years after the CA B\u00e8gles defeat, the club was again disappointed in the final, being defeated by AS B\u00e9ziers in the championship game of 1980. The latter end of the decade was however, reminiscent of the 1920s sides. Toulouse were again contesting the Challenge Yves du Manoir for the 1984 season, though they lost to RC Narbonne 17 to 3. They did however claim their first championship since 1947, defeating RC Toulon in the 1985 final. The following season saw them successfully defend their championship, defeating SU Agen in the final. After a number of defeats in the Challenge Yves du Manoir finals, Toulouse defeated US Dax to win the 1988 competition. Both Toulon and Agen won the following premierships (1987 and 1988) but Toulouse won another championship in 1989.\n\n\n=== 1990s to present ===\n\nThe dominance continued in the 1990s, starting with a grand final loss in 1991, and a Challenge Yves du Manoir championship in 1993, defeating Castres 13 to 8 in the final. The mid-1990s saw Stade Toulousain become a major force yet again, as the club claimed four premierships in a row, winning the championship in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, as well as the Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1995. The club emulated its success in the European Rugby Cup, becoming the first ever champions in the 1995\u201396 season.\nThe late 1990s and the 2000s saw the club again reach great heights. The club won the Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1998, defeating Stade Fran\u00e7ais Paris, and the 1999 championship as well as the 2001 championship and were runners-up in the 2003 season, losing to Stade Fran\u00e7ais in the final. As the club had done in the mid-1990s, Stade Toulousain replicated this success in the European Rugby Cup, winning the 2002\u201303 championship and the 2004\u201305 championship. The club made it to the final of the 2005\u201306 Top 14, and despite only trailing Biarritz 9\u20136 at half time, Toulouse could not prevent a second-half whitewash, eventually going down 40\u201313. They ended their seven-year title drought with a 26\u201320 win over ASM Clermont Auvergne on 28 June 2008.  In 2008 they narrowly lost a Heineken Cup Final to Munster by 3 points. In 2010 Toulouse defeated Leinster to reach the final where they faced Biarritz Olympique at Stade de France in Paris on Saturday 22 May 2010. Toulouse won the game by 21\u201319 to claim their fourth Heineken Cup title, making them the only club to ever win the title four times. Stade Toulousain is also the only French club to have taken part in all the editions of Heineken Cup since its creation (17, with the 2011\u201312 season).  They won the French championship in 2011 against Montpellier (15\u201310) and 2012 against Toulon (18\u201312). Stade Toulousain reached the semi-finals of the French championship 20 consecutive years (from 1994 to 2013).\n\n\n== Stadium ==\n\nToulouse play their home games at the Stade Ernest-Wallon, which was built in the late 1980s and was recently renovated. Stade Toulousain is one of the three teams (all sports included) that own its stadium. It has a capacity of 19,500. The stadium however cannot always accommodate all the fans of the Toulouse club. For the larger fixtures, such as championship or Heineken Cup games or play-offs, the fixture may be moved to Stadium Municipal, which has double capacity, 38,000. The stadium was used for numerous matches at the 2007 Rugby World Cup\n\n\n== Honours ==\n\n\n=== Rugby Union ===\nWorld Club Championship:\nChampions: 1986, 1990\nHeineken Cup:\nChampions: 1996, 2003, 2005, 2010\nRunners-up: 2004, 2008\nFrench Champions:\nChampions: 1912, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1926, 1927, 1947, 1985, 1986, 1989, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2019\nRunners-up: 1903, 1909, 1921, 1969, 1980, 1991, 2003, 2006\nChallenge Yves du Manoir:\nChampions: 1934, 1988, 1993, 1995, 1998\nRunners-up: 1971 1984\nFrench Cup:\nChampions: 1946, 1947, 1984\nRunners-up: 1949, 1985\n\n\n=== Football ===\nChampions of Midi:\nChampions: 1905, 1906, 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1912, 1913, 1914\n\n\n== European record ==\nToulouse qualified for the Heineken Cup in every season of that competition's existence (1995\u201396 to 2013\u201314), and played in the inaugural season of the replacement competition, the European Rugby Champions Cup.

        "wiki": "Henri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa (24 November 1864 \u2013 9 September 1901), commonly known as just Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (UK:  ON-ree d\u0259 too-LOOZ loh-TREK, US:  on-REE -\u2060, French: [\u0251\u0303\u0281i d\u0259 tuluz lot\u0281\u025bk]), was a French painter, printmaker, draughtsman, caricaturist, and illustrator whose immersion in the colorful and theatrical life of Paris in the late 19th century allowed him to produce a collection of enticing, elegant, and provocative images of the modern, sometimes decadent, affairs of those times.\nToulouse-Lautrec is among the best-known painters of the Post-Impressionist period, with Paul C\u00e9zanne, Vincent van Gogh, and Paul Gauguin.\nIn a 2005 auction at Christie's auction house, La Blanchisseuse, his early painting of a young laundress, sold for US$22.4 million and set a new record for the artist for a price at auction.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nHenri Marie Raymond de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa was born at the H\u00f4tel du Bosc in Albi, Tarn, in the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region of France, the firstborn child of Alphonse Charles Comte de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa (1838\u20131913) and his wife Ad\u00e8le Zo\u00eb Tapi\u00e9 de Celeyran (1841\u20131930). The last part of his name means he was a member of an aristocratic family (descendants of the Counts of Toulouse and Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec and the Viscounts of Montfa, a village and commune of the Tarn department of southern France, close to the cities of Castres and Toulouse). His younger brother was born in 1867 but died the following year. Both sons enjoyed the titres de courtoisie of Comte. If Henri had outlived his father, he would have been accorded the family title of Comte de Toulouse-Lautrec.After the death of his brother, Toulouse-Lautrec's parents separated and a nanny eventually took care of him. At the age of eight, Toulouse-Lautrec went to live with his mother in Paris, where he drew sketches and caricatures in his exercise workbooks. The family quickly realized that his talents lay in drawing and painting. A friend of his father, Ren\u00e9 Princeteau, sometimes visited to give informal lessons. Some of Toulouse-Lautrec's early paintings are of horses, a specialty of Princeteau, and a subject Lautrec revisited in his \"Circus Paintings\".In 1875, Toulouse-Lautrec returned to Albi because his mother had concerns about his health. He took thermal baths at Am\u00e9lie-les-Bains, and his mother consulted doctors in the hope of finding a way to improve her son's growth and development.\n\n\n== Disability and health problems ==\n\nToulouse-Lautrec's parents, the Comte and Comtesse, were first cousins (his grandmothers were sisters), and his congenital health conditions were attributed to a family history of inbreeding.At the age of 13, Toulouse-Lautrec fractured his right femur, and at 14, he fractured his left femur. The breaks did not heal properly. Modern physicians attribute this to an unknown genetic disorder, possibly pycnodysostosis (sometimes known as Toulouse-Lautrec Syndrome), or a variant disorder along the lines of osteopetrosis, achondroplasia, or osteogenesis imperfecta. Rickets aggravated by praecox virilism has also been suggested. Afterward, his legs ceased to grow, so that as an adult he was extremely short (1.42 m or 4 ft 8 in). He developed an adult-sized torso while retaining his child-sized legs. Additionally, he is reported to have had hypertrophied genitals.Physically unable to participate in many activities enjoyed by boys his age, Toulouse-Lautrec immersed himself in art. He became a prominent Post-Impressionist painter, art nouveau illustrator, and lithographer, and, through his works, recorded many details of the late-19th-century bohemian lifestyle in Paris. Toulouse-Lautrec contributed several illustrations to the magazine Le Rire during the mid-1890s.After initially failing college entrance exams, he passed his second attempt and completed his studies.\n\n\n== Paris ==\n\nDuring a stay in Nice, France, his progress in painting and drawing impressed Princeteau, who persuaded Toulouse-Lautrec's parents to let him return to Paris and study under the portrait painter L\u00e9on Bonnat. He moved to Paris in 1882. Toulouse-Lautrec's mother had high ambitions and, with the aim of her son becoming a fashionable and respected painter, used their family's influence to get him into Bonnat's studio. He was drawn to Montmartre, the area of Paris famous for its bohemian lifestyle and the haunt of artists, writers, and philosophers. Studying with Bonnat placed Toulouse-Lautrec in the heart of Montmartre, an area he rarely left over the next 20 years.\nAfter Bonnat took a new job, Toulouse-Lautrec moved to the studio of Fernand Cormon in 1882 and studied for a further five years and established the group of friends he kept for the rest of his life. At this time, he met \u00c9mile Bernard and Vincent van Gogh. Cormon, whose instruction was more relaxed than Bonnat's, allowed his pupils to roam Paris, looking for subjects to paint. During this period, Toulouse-Lautrec had his first encounter with a prostitute (reputedly sponsored by his friends), which led him to paint his first painting of a prostitute in Montmartre, a woman rumored to be Marie-Charlet.\n\n\n=== Early career ===\nIn 1885, Lautrec started to exhibit his work at the cabaret of Aristide Bruant's Mirliton.With his studies finished, in 1887, he participated in an exposition in Toulouse using the pseudonym \"Tr\u00e9clau,\" the verlan of the family name \"Lautrec.\" He later exhibited in Paris with Van Gogh and Louis Anquetin.In 1885, Toulouse Lautrec met Suzanne Valadon. He made several portraits of her and supported her ambition as an artist. It is believed that they were lovers and that she wanted to marry him. Their relationship ended, and Valadon attempted suicide in 1888.\n\n\n=== Rise to recognition ===\nIn 1888, the Belgian critic Octave Maus invited him to present eleven pieces at the Vingt (the Twenties) exhibition in Brussels in February. Van Gogh's brother Theo bought Poudre de Riz (Rice Powder) for 150 francs for the Goupil & Cie gallery.\nFrom 1889 until 1894, Toulouse-Lautrec took part in the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants regularly. He made several landscapes of Montmartre. Tucked deep into Montmartre in the garden of Monsieur Pere Foret, Toulouse-Lautrec executed a series of pleasant en plein air paintings of Carmen Gaudin, the same red-headed model who appears in The Laundress (1888).\nIn 1890 during the banquet of the XX exhibition in Brussels, he challenged to a duel the artist Henri de Groux who criticized van Gogh works. Groux apologized, and the duel never took place.\n\n\n=== The Ladies ===\nIn addition to his growing alcoholism, Toulouse-Lautrec also frequented prostitutes. He was fascinated by their lifestyle and the lifestyle of the \"urban underclass\" and incorporated those characters into his paintings. Fellow painter \u00c9douard Vuillard later said that while Toulouse-Lautrec did engage in sex with prostitutes, \"the real reasons for his behavior were moral ones ... Lautrec was too proud to submit to his lot, as a physical freak, an aristocrat cut off from his kind by his grotesque appearance. He found an affinity between his condition and the moral penury of the prostitute.\"The girls in the brothels inspired Toulouse-Lautrec. He would frequently visit one located in Rue d'Amboise, where he had a favorite called Mireille. He created about a hundred drawings and fifty paintings inspired by the life of these women. In 1892 and 1893, he created a series of two women kissing called Le Lit, and in 1894 painted Sal\u00f3n de la Rue des Moulins from memory in his studio.He declared, \"A model is always a stuffed doll, but these women are alive. I wouldn't venture to pay them the hundred sous to sit for me, and god knows whether they would be worth it. They stretch out on the sofas like animals, make no demand and they are not in the least bit conceited.\"\nHe was well appreciated by the ladies, saying, \"I have found girls of my own size! Nowhere else do I feel so much at home\".\n\n\n=== The Moulin Rouge ===\nWhen the Moulin Rouge cabaret opened in 1889, Toulouse-Lautrec was commissioned to produce a series of posters. His mother had left Paris and, though he had a regular income from his family, making posters offered him a living of his own. Other artists looked down on the work, but he ignored them. The cabaret reserved a seat for him and displayed his paintings. Among the well-known works that he painted for the Moulin Rouge and other Parisian nightclubs are depictions of the singer Yvette Guilbert; the dancer Louise Weber, better known as La Goulue (The Glutton) who created the French can-can; and the much subtler dancer Jane Avril.\n\n\n== London ==\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec's family were Anglophiles, and though he was not as fluent as he pretended to be, he spoke English well enough. He traveled to London, where he was commissioned by the J. & E. Bella company to make a poster advertising their paper confetti (plaster confetti was banned after the 1892 Mardi Gras) and the bicycle advert La Cha\u00eene Simpson.While in London, he met and befriended Oscar Wilde. When Wilde faced imprisonment in Britain, Toulouse-Lautrec became a very vocal supporter of him, and his portrait of Oscar Wilde was painted the same year as Wilde's trial.\n\n\n== Alcoholism ==\n\nToulouse-Lautrec was mocked for his short stature and physical appearance, which led him to abuse alcohol.He initially drank only beer and wine, but his tastes expanded into liquor, namely absinthe. The Earthquake cocktail (Tremblement de Terre) is attributed to Toulouse-Lautrec: a potent mixture containing half absinthe and half cognac in a wine goblet. Due to his underdeveloped legs, he walked with the aid of a cane, which he hollowed out and kept filled with liquor in order to ensure that he was never without alcohol.\n\n\n== Cooking skills ==\nA fine and hospitable cook, Toulouse-Lautrec built up a collection of favorite recipes \u2013 some original, some adapted \u2013 which were posthumously published by his friend and dealer Maurice Joyant as L'Art de la Cuisine. The book was republished in English translation in 1966 as The Art of Cuisine \u2013 a tribute to his inventive (and wide-ranging) cooking.\n\n\n== Death ==\n\nBy February 1899, Toulouse-Lautrec's alcoholism began to take its toll and he collapsed from exhaustion and the effects of alcoholism. His family had him committed to Folie Saint-James, a sanatorium in Neuilly-sur-Seine for three months. While he was committed, he drew 39 circus portraits. After his release, he returned to the Paris studio for a time and then traveled throughout France. His physical and mental health began to decline rapidly owing to alcoholism and syphilis, which he reportedly contracted from Rosa La Rouge, a prostitute who was the subject of several of his paintings.On 9 September 1901, at the age of 36, he died from complications due to alcoholism and syphilis at his mother's estate, Ch\u00e2teau Malrom\u00e9, in Saint-Andr\u00e9-du-Bois. He is buried in Cimeti\u00e8re de Verdelais, Gironde, a few kilometers from the estate. His last words reportedly were \"Le vieux con!\" (\"the old fool\"), his goodbye to his father, though another version has been suggested, in which he used the word \"hallali,\" a term used by huntsmen at the moment the hounds kill their prey: \"Je savais, Papa, que vous ne manqueriez pas l'hallali\" (\"I knew, papa, that you wouldn't miss the death.\").After Toulouse-Lautrec's death, his mother, Ad\u00e8le Comtesse de Toulouse-Lautrec-Monfa, and his art dealer, Maurice Joyant, continued promoting his artwork. His mother contributed funds for a museum to be created in Albi, his birthplace, to show his works. This Mus\u00e9e Toulouse-Lautrec owns the most extensive of his works.\n\n\n== Art ==\n\nIn his less-than-20-year career, Toulouse-Lautrec created:\n\n737 canvased paintings\n275 watercolors\n363 prints and posters\n5,084 drawings\nsome ceramic and stained-glass work\nan unknown number of lost worksHis debt to the Impressionists, particularly the more figurative painters like Manet and Degas, is apparent, that within his works, one can draw parallels to the detached barmaid at A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re by Manet and the behind-the-scenes ballet dancers of Degas. His style was also influenced by the classical Japanese woodprints, which became popular in art circles in Paris.He excelled at depicting people in their working environments, with the color and movement of the gaudy nightlife present but the glamour stripped away. He was a master at painting crowd scenes where each figure was highly individualized. At the time they were painted, the individual figures in his larger paintings could be identified by silhouette alone, and the names of many of these characters have been recorded. His treatment of his subject matter, whether as portraits, in scenes of Parisian nightlife, or as intimate studies, has been described as alternately \"sympathetic\" and \"dispassionate\".Toulouse-Lautrec's skilled depiction of people relied on his painterly style, which is highly linear and emphasizes contour. He often applied paint in long, thin brushstrokes, which would leave much of the board underneath showing through the paint. Many of his works may be best described as \"drawings in coloured paint.\"On 20 August 2018, Toulouse-Lautrec was the featured artist on the BBC television program Fake or Fortune?. Researchers attempted to discover whether he created two discovered sketchbooks.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\n\n=== Films ===\nMoulin Rouge (1952), portrayed by Jos\u00e9 Ferrer\nCasino Royale (1967): Tremble dresses as Toulouse-Lautrec for Vesper\nThe Aristocats (1970): As an animated painting kitten, voiced by Gary Dubin\nRevenge of the Pink Panther (1978), Clouseau, disguised as Toulouse-Lautrec, played by Peter Sellers\nLautrec (1998), directed by Roger Planchon\nMoulin Rouge!

          "If you like Toulouse-Lautrec then you will be captivated by this art gallery. No other artists are represented here. All exhibited in an historic building with walks outside by the river. Well worth a couple of hours here.",
          "Very rarely you can will find a Museum located in such a great historical building. At times you don\u2019t know if you are enjoying more the displays (specially Toulouse-Lautrec or the incredible building than house it. I loved Albi and this feature is one of the key reasons",
          "I do love Toulouse-Lautrecs art, but even people unfamiliar or disinclined to like his work will enjoy this museum. It is in the former Berbie Palace so the rooms and building materials, as well as the magnificient view of the gardens from a few windows of the museum were",
          "Toulouse-Lautrec was an amazing artist who died far too early (in his late 30's). There were sketches and painting that he did in his teens and even as young as 11. A must see if you are in Albi!",
          "This beautifully restored building with its cool, elegant interior offers an interesting counter-point to such an artiste of the demi-monde. Toulouse-Lautrec's work is pointed social commentary, and often somewhat shocking in his somewhat cynical, or at least disillusioned view",
          "Not my favorite artist, but well represented, early and late, sketches and final works. Audio guide is not the best.",
          "Anyone with an interest in the works of Latrec must go. The convenient location next to St Cecile's maximizes your time.",
          "I\u2019ve seen Toulouse-Lautrec pieces in almost every art galley I\u2019ve visited, and there have been hundreds. But here, in the converted Berbie Palace, are hundreds more. So many that I began to wonder. How prolific can one man have been in such a short life? I realized that the",
          "Not being a fan of Toulouse Lautrec I went to this museum with as much an open mind as possible, simply because I was there, and thought that I should. I regret to say that I am still not won over in any way, mostly because the display was so poor and badly lit. It is also",
          "This museum is not to be missed. We had a wonderful tour guide who clearly loved what she was doing and really knew her stuff. The collection is so impressive that the guide can only address some of the works but it is worth going back and taking your time to truly enjoy the",
          "Toulouse-Lautrec, modern art, artifacts, the artist\u2019s life, pictures, posters, the photographs, the building itself - Pleasant helpful staff, good information sheets....... We gave ourselves an afternoon but ideally I suggest two visits of 3 - 4 hours max or you are into",
          "My wife and I toured the Toulouse-Lautrec museum with our tour group during our visit to Albi. It's in the former (fortified) Bishop's Palace. Because it was or had been raining, our group was armed with umbrellas. We had to lock them outside in a machine with a key. Then, we",
          "In this museum you'll see the greatest collection of art work of this artist, and some information of his life and how it was linked to his paintings and posters. It's very close to the cathedral and it's one of the main attractions of this town.",
          "Large posters and small works. It all adds to get the taste of this famous artist. All situated in an old complex edifice. Entrance fee, but this is part of the holiday expense and someone has to sweep the floors and clean the toilettes.",
          "The paintings are great and the museum is located in a beautiful restaured old brick building. If you have time, take a walk in the gardens.",
          "Went to this museum to see Henri Toulouse-Leutrec art work. The building is magnificent! The ceiling are stunning and the formal gardens and canal that runs beyond is magical. Well worth a visit, especially if you enjoy art!",
          "If you enjoy TL, you will enjoy learning and seeing more of his work. This is the premier exhibit for him.",
          "Everything you ever wanted to know about Toulouse-Lautrec. The exhibition is great, full of details. Great paintings!",
          "This small museum housed in a renovated mediaeval building just behind the cathedral is a superb tribute to one of Albi's most famous sons, Toulouse Lautrec. It probably contains the best selection anywhere of this interesting artist's work and is well worth visiting.",
          "If you love the work of the artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, this museum (in his hometown of Albi) is a must for you. I admit his work has never resonated with me personally, but I appreciate his work and it was a wonderful experience to be in Albi and view the museum that",
          "Being a museum in such a small town, it definitely has a very good collection (besides one of Toulouse-Lautrec). You can also find some interesting historical exhibitions connected with the archeology of the place.",
          "I wanted to come here for over 30 years. I was not disappointed. It has many works of his early days, then it follows his artistic development. The audioguide and the laminated sheets are comprehensive. The museum closes for two hours for lunch time but you can go back in",
          "In Albi the Musee Toulouse-Lautrec is a must see. It is located in the Palais de la Berbie next to the Sainte-Cecile Cathedral. The Palais it self is worth the visit, never mind the Lautrec collection. The collection of his art displays all of the phases of his career.Audio",
          "This is a superb museum. Everything is beautifully displayed in a great building. There is a good audio guide too. My only criticism was that the numbers displayed on the paintings for the audio guide were difficult to spot! But this museum is well worth visiting. Very",
          "This is a wonderful collection of works by Toulouse Latrec. Especially interesting are his early works. No prints or reproductions can give any idea of tbe superb quality and colors of the originals, We were there for hours.",
          "a must go in the area. you will appreciate this beautiful place and the master pieces. sehr sch\u00f6n ! good !",
          "The place to see a lot of HTL's works. Most people are familiar with his commercial posters and you can see how he put these works together. Probably more of his works are here as he was somewhat misunderstood and, I believe, his works did not sell well. The museum itself",
          "It has many works by him before and after living Paris.

          "Unbelievably talented Lautrec at an early age. I was not aware of his \"eye\" for horses, much less his later works of the ladies. The Museum building carried a lot of history also. The gardens were a treat and so were the views of the River Tarn.",
          "In general this museum has the world's largest collection of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings, posters and sketches. Cost and hours: 8 euros, open daily with break from 12 noon and 2pm, just next door to TI on the Main city plaza. The museum occupies several floors in",

          "I've always enjoyed Lautrec's art, so it was a real pleasure to see so much of it, from his early works to his late ones, in a variety of mediums. Because of a temporary problem walking, I was afraid I would have to forgo this visit, but the museum has a wheelchair available for",
          "Probably the most extensive collection of Toulouse Lautrec's work in the world. The large exhibition is housed in the old bishop's palace which is well worth a visit in its own right.",
          "A very nice collection of Toulouse-Lautrec paintings and lithographs. The lighting could be better in some parts of the exhibition (lights were very dim) and they could offer more languages for the descriptions since everything is mostly in French. The gift store is very weak,",

          "Spent a too-short time here but it was part of a tour and we had a time schedule. The museum is definitely worth a leisurely visit so one can really read the information provided, take in the work, and visit the gardens. The building itself is wonderful and worth taking note of.",
          "Located in the old bishops palace built like a fortress. The day I went was a cultural celebration day and museum entry was free. Plenty of works by Toulouse-Latrec. An excellent visit!",

          "A must-see on visiting Albi, and good value. Plenty of works from all stages of the artist's career. These were well displayed, and helpfully complemented by information sheets in several languages. We spent the best part of two hours looking round the museum, and also enjoyed",

          "I love the art work by Toulouse-Lautrec so this museum was high on my 'To Do! ' List whilst in Albi. A great collection of the artist's oils, drawings and posters. Some iconic works and some I have never seen before.",
          "Visited the museum whilst on a recent visit to Albi. Depending on how long you want to spend at each painting, the visit lasted about 90 mins, and that was just the T-L part, there was another floor offering other paintings. We hired the audio guides, but to be honest the",
          "We love art and have visited many art galleries around the world. We discuss the paintings, how they are painted and how they move us. We liked the Toulouse Lautrec paintings but soon after we arrived a coach party arrived which made the gallery very crowded and noisy. We",
          "The collection is housed in a magnificent building, not to be missed. As for the collection, if you appreciate art, you will enjoy this exhibition tremendously. The scope of his work was far beyond anything that I had imagined. Known mostly for his iconic posters, he was an",
          "While not a big fan of Toulouse-Lautrec myself I still enjoyed learning more about the life and the work of this popular Fin de Si\u00e8cle painter. You'll find that you know many of his paintings and posters. No Montmartre shop is without a T-L collection of trays, mouse pads, bags",
          "Set in a fantastic, restored building this collection of works by Toulouse-Lautrec is fascinating. An audio guide is available as are explanatory cards (in various languages) in many of the rooms. These chronicle the life and times of HTL giving a narrative to the works on",

          "A comprehensive collection of the works of Toulouse-Lautrec, child of Albi. The vibrancy, brilliance and creativity of each work was mesmerising. His portrayal of people from the spectrum of humanity is both sensitive and respectful. It is a must-see on your visit to Albi.",
          "Monsieur Lautrec was a talented painter of posters but looking at the rest of his art it was not great shakes. Compare him to Renoir (or perhaps that is not fair) then he certainly falls short. sorry no pun intended but it does go to show why cousins should not marry! Anyway",
          "This is a stunning museum dedicated to the work of Toulouse-Lautrec. It follows his life and development as an artist with a huge collection of his works. A visit is an excellent way of getting to know this artist. This was our third visit and on each occasion we have learned",
          "This is a very comprehensive and well-laid collection of Toulouse-Lautrec works. Each room highlights a specific aspect or theme in his work - and no room is overwhelming in displaying too much. A must for anyone aficionado of Impressionist art. The collection goes beyond",
          "World's largest collection of artworks by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in a 13th-century palace. The Mus\u00e9e Toulouse-Lautrec is an art museum in Albi, southern France, dedicated mainly to the work of the painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec who was born near Albi.",
          "We visited Albi primarily to see the art museum. We were not disappointed. There were some great exhibits.",

          "Historically developed to educate all on the painter and his works, you will need at least two hours for it. Set in the Archbishops spacious palace, it has generous room to display his work, It crowded at all when we were there in the morning. I was always a fan, now even more",
          "This museum is housed in a large complex that was once a Bishop's palace. At the time of division of church and state, its use was changed. I had heard that Albi was a beautiful place to visit and it is. We didn't have time to see much and had specifically planned to visit the",
          "There is so much more to Toulouse-Laureen than the posters we all know. The museum is built into the public rooms of the old bishops palace and the setting alone is worth a visit. The paintings are very well laid and and superbly lit and labelled. His sympathetic understanding",
          "My memories of this museum are predominantly of going up and down in lifts and wandering round not knowing precisely where we were headed. There is a film show outlining TL's story which we happened on by chance but unfortunately we were not proficient enough in French to be",
          "Beautifully restored, sensitively inserted modern exhibition spaces with a vast collections of Lautrec artwork over 3 stories, but the main event is that amazing view over the gardens an river from the terraces!",

          "You may be familiar with Toulouse Lautrec's posters of the Moulin Rouge but this gallery shows what a talented all-round artist he was. In his short life he achieved a great deal and the gallery presents the full range of his outputs. The exhibition is cleverly curated and the",

          "Who doesn't know Toulouse-Lautrec for his vivid posters and his intense works reflecting sometimes the seedier side of life in Paris. His early life was spent around the Albi area and in this museum you can see how his talent was already very apparent at the age of 15 or 16",

          "A chronology of a local artist, well presented with a spread of famous and other works. A good intro to Lautrec's life of work from teen sketcher to the famous Pigalle pieces. The teaser questionnaire (offered in multiple languages) was a nice touch, keeping children focused on",

          "We hummed and hawed about paying the 9 Eurostar to get in but am glad we went. The museum gave a good history to the development of Tolouse lautrec's art. Well laid out and small amounts of information available. An audio set was another 4 euros.",
          "An outstanding museum in a lovely historic building. The exhibits well planned and give you overview of the painter's life and how his work changed over time. This might the one of the cheapest museum in EU. Very well done! I hope I get to see this museum again.",

          "Wow. Is all I can say. The collection is huge, well displayed and informative. It shows the ages and techniques Henri Toulouse-Lautrec went through before he came famous with his classic Moulin Rouge poster type art. For \u20ac9 it's a bargain and the views as you walk around are",
          "A nice collection of Lautrec. The museum description boasts of a grand collection, which I would say is exaggerated. Most of the later works include posters and drawings, which is fitting because Lautrec was a consummate draughtsman. There are some very nice paintings done late",
          "Albi is a really pretty medieval town, easily accessible from Toulouse by train, and the Toulouse-Lautrec museum is very much worth a visit. It's housed in the beautiful old bishops' palace, next to the famous, must visit cathedral. The collection of the artist's work is",

          "This museum looks small from the outside, but actually rambles on and on in the bishops' palace. The collection of the work of Toulouse is extensive and includes drawings, posters and paintings. A must see!",
          "An amazing collection of Lautrec's work. Wall to wall enjoyment. It was surprising to see the range of his talent. The museum building itself is fantastic.",
          "What with all the sketches and draft- drawings there a a large number of rooms to see. It therefore pays one (in tme saved) to be selective over which works to dawdle in front of. The curator's prepared information on some of the works are (likewise) somewhat sketchy.",
          "Set in the Archbishop's palace between the cathedral and river Tarn, this rambling ancient edifice contains the most exceptional collection of Toulouse-Lautrec works of art. This museum for art lovers is well worth an extensive detour just to see",

          "Works byToulouse-Lautrec can be found in many places but this museum demonstrates extremely well his work and the evolution of his work in a broader context.We have learned a lot here .Very well build up....and the bishops palace is well worth visiting too offering great views",
          "The building and content are really good. Great also for the travelers with special needs. But they need more of a varied exhibition to attract return visitors.",
          "I had spent extensive time here in 1991 and, while still worth seeing, I was sad to see that the staff now closes off the windows that look out over the Tarn River and the wonderful gardens. That was my favorite part, though it is also good to see the biographical record of this",
          "Not only was this a fascinating pictorial story of Toulouse Lautrecs art and life, which was larger than I had anticipated, but the building in which it was housed was equally interesting. It is housed in the old Bishops Palace, next to the cathedral. The architecture was simple",
          "I have loved Toulouse-Lautrec's art for many years and was keen to visit this museum. It was a lovely place and informative with the audio guide. I felt it was more of an art gallery with explanations along the way, rather than a museum about the artist. I'd have liked some more",
          "This was a long awaited trip and very worthwhile. This is an excellent collection, there is much to see which is familiar and iconic,; the Folies Bergere, Aristide Bruant and Jane Avril posters, then there is so much more. Wonderful oil paintings of his mother, stunning",
          "Apart from there being a distinct lack of absinthe -- TL's favourite tipple - on offer methinks he would heartily approve of the gallery sporting hundreds of his works from his original posters to portraits and the seamier demi monde of late 19th century Paris. Well laid out,",
          "This museum has lots of works not taken by the Paris museums after Toulouse-Lautrec died. Lots of early drawings (from age 11!) and preliminary sketches of well known works. A great way to see the process!",
          "This extensive and comprehensive exhibition of the works of Toulouse-Lautrec should not be missed. The building, itself, is stunning and its conversion to art gallery has been done in a most sensitive and creative way. We rented the audio guide. It worked very well and gave just",
          "The best collection of Toulouse-Lautrec's paintings for sure. He is my favorite post-impressionist, so we went to Albi specifically to see his work. I was very concerned that our visit fell on Ascension Day which is a Holiday in France. I had emailed the museum staff ahead of",
          "Fantastic collection of Toulouse Lautrec housed in a wonderful building (Berbie Palace).Put this on the \"must do\" list even if you're not a fan of the artist - the building is wonderful.",
          "Set in the pretty town of Albi, the museum is a fantastic collection of Lautrec's work. Well curated and with excellent explanations on the audio guide.",
          "Just below the Cathedral, and in the former bishop's palace is the highlight of a visit to Albi: the collection of paintings by the city's most famous inhabitant. First of all, the building itself is great - well maintained, well signed and fascinating architecturally.",
          "The life of Toulouse Latrouc himself is very interesting. His representation of the life around the cafe scene in Paris in the late 1800s is really good. Added to this are the prints of the advertising posters that are a separate art form altogether. The building in which the",
          "Went early and got plenty of time to visit the museum. The garden and buildings are worth a visit. Good value museum with lots to see",
          "I was really worried that the museum would be closed on a Monday.......as it was the only day we were in Albi......but it was open. It's a beautiful building, an amazing exhibition. It was very interesting to find out about the life and art of Toulouse-Lautrec. Very special! Go",
          "I wasn't a huge fan of Toulouse-Latrec until visiting this magnificent museum in Albi. He was born in the region and the city celebrates him around every corner. The significant collection is displayed chronologically, affording you a true appreciation for Toulouse-Latrec's",
          "This is a wonderful collection of paintings and posters by Toulouse-Lautrec. The building, Palais de la Berbie is also worth seeing, and do not miss the garden with its view over the Tarn River.",
          "This museum is amazing, could spend an entire day there. The exhibitions are very well laid out over lots of rooms. Definitely worth a visit, and great to see the professionalism of Toulouse Lautrec, a very talented artist, much wider than the well known poster type paintings.",
          "As I think most people visiting Albi will be going to the excellent Lautrec museum I thought that this warning about the perils of parking in one of the near by municipal car parks was appropriately put here. On Thursday July 30 I and my family were visiting Albi to see the",
          "Albi is a magnificent town-I will remember those red bricks forever,and this museum does a beautiful job introducing various aspects of the life of its favorite son. A mix of painting, media, posters,with a fantastic audio guide-highly recommend this place, as well as the town",
          "Incredible. Really worth a visit. One does not realise just what a gifted and tallented artist Toulouse-Lautrec was. One knows of the poster art but there is so much more. The museum is well laid out and one can spend as long or as short as necessary. After visiting the museum,",
          "The town of Albi is quiet and quite beautiful. The church is magnificent and towers over the square. The museum is excellent. A glimpse into the life of Toulouse Lautrec. Old photos and art work; some very familiar pieces and some very different from what you expect from this",
          "This is a beautiful museum dedicated to the works of Toulouse-Lautrec. It is just next to the Cathedral, so it's convenient to see them together. There are many interesting works to see, and the gardens in the back are very beautiful. Great views of the river and the bridge from",
          "A day-trip out of Toulouse. We took train from Matabiau Gare to Albi, a short walk into town, a lovely lunch across from the cathedral & museum, the museum & gardens, a walk down to the old bridge, a cold cup of frozen glace before leaving town...a delightful day. The museum",
          "Very interesting with informative historical information in each room. Don't get caught taking photos! Students from the 70's will recognise Les Ambassadeurs / Aristide Bruant posters",
          "Excellent celebration of the career and works of Lautrec. Good English language laminated guide notes supplied. Amazing seeing his poster art.",
          "One the first visit 35 years ago, the museum was a dark forbidding place. It took seven years of arduous restoration, but what's offered now is wonderful experience with good supporting information and old photos of Latrec alongside his studies for famous painting handing",
          "I was so excited to see this museum and was disappointed. So many wonderful paintings byLautrec and his counterparts. It gave. Avery informative explanation on the Audio guide but there were also laminated pieces of information in English German and French that were a nice",
          "Without doubt the best attraction in Albi and a stunning collection of work by Toulouse Lautrec with interesting displays in a great setting",
          "Toulouse Lautrec is well known name, nevertheless his work is not so wide known, he died young but one can see the potential he had. Many of his work is unique, he is good imitating, creating his own style, depicting his time and the idiosyncrasy of France. If you like art this",
          "This exhibition was an eye opener. As well as all the posters and paintings we all know there were T-L's fabulous drawings and paintings of animals and people, most revealing a sharp sense of humour.",
          "Very nice small museum with a lot of Toulouse Lautrec drawings and a few pictures. You really get a good sense of what a brilliant artist he was...",
          "This is an excellent museum, housed in a beautiful space, located a few yards from the spectacular and unique Saint Cecile Cathedral. When I was there, there were small groups of what looked like five and six year old school kids being given lessons on various works of art as",
          "Every room has an information sheet (french, english and spanish). You have information on the painter and the theme. And some information about 3 paintings/drawings. Which is enough. Lots of similar stuff. Some people had a guide and they talked a lot about the building,",
          "Whilst in Albi a must visit to this museum of artist Toulouse - Lautrec excellent exhibits and not to be missed",
          "The Bishops palace is interesting, and a number of rooms have been stripped back to reveal original floors, walls etc from the 14th -16th century. The formal gardens (which can be accessed without ticket) are gorgeous, and there is a lovely view from the terrace across the",
          "Visited this museum several times over last few years. Building itself, typically 'albigeois' has been restored and is stunning. Toulouse Lautrec's life and story are told beautifully through the museum, I'm not 'arty' but love that I can see how his story unfolds.",
          "Large museum with lots of interesting art and local historic information as well as the Toulouse Lautrec works. Spent all morning here. Next to the Berbie Palace gardens - small but perfect.",
          "The museum has been set up in the old diocese. Going from one large room to another requires stairs, some of which cannot be reached by elevator, so a bit tricky for canes, wheelchairs and the like. The exhibit mostly covers Toulouse-Lautrec's younger, formative years, though I",
          "I personally enjoyed the architecture as much as the art work in it. Was expecting a riot of color in the famous Latrec posters so was disappointed as to how drab and basic much of what was on show here. FYI - they insist you ditch all your bags in the lockers first. Plenty of",
          "Can't say I'm a massive fan of his work...but even I was impressed with the collection and even found something here I loved. For me his poster work is what impressed me the most and also the collection on French brothels largely due to the story behind the work. As impressive",
          "Albi is a lovely charming place and I particularly wanted to visit the museum. It was an interesting experience and I learned a lot. I bought a few cards and things in the gift shop.",
          "The gardens at the Toulouse Lautrec museum are absolutely lovely. The museum is ok, but it seems a little dysfunctional. Probably worth a visit.",
          "Recommends the guided headset tour, you will have a richer experience doing so! Helpful and friendly staff.",
          "It's hard to believe that at one time no one wanted his work. A very special view of one mans' humanistic presentation of his times.",
          "Great surprising collection of Toulouse Lautrec. Most of the work was donated to the museum by his mother. A lot of his early work. I allotted 2 hours to the museum and I could have stayed longer to view their more extensive collection of other artists. In a beautiful historic",
          "While visiting Albi I spent hours in and really enjoyed this wonderful museum for an amazing artist.",
          "this is a definite spot to visit in albi. But go to the tourist info office first and buy a pass, it is cheaper if you want to visit the musee and the cathedral - plus gives discounts to other sites too. the musee closes over lunch but your pass allows you to re-enter as often",
          "Visited this very distinctive museum in the centre of Albi and found it fascinating. I learned a lot about the man eg he was Henri of Toulouse- Lautrec ie Toulouse Lautrec were not his two names! The big discovery was the range of his painting other than the Moulin Rouge type. I",
          "Hundreds of works by the very squirrelly reprobate Toulouse Lautrec. Well worth several hours. Rent the head sets. Easy to use and informative",
          "If somebody likes Toulouse-Lautrec oevre, this is a must! From his childhood, till the late paintings, and drawings and posters, a wonderful collection in a very nice set up.",
          "All those Toulouse-Lautrec posters of Jane Avril and The Moulin Rouge you know - well, you'll find some of the original works here, as well as his very fine oil paintings, for which he is far less known",
          "Great building with an impressive garden outside. The largest collection of Toulouse Lautrec art with a good English audio commentary. Includes posters and paintings with preparatory sketches and some of his early work.",
          "The museum is located in a building which is in the grounds of the fortified area that cathedral Saint Cecile is located too. Visiting Albi is in fact visiting these 2 areas. Undoubtedly, the original works of Henri Lautrec is inspiring and as in all works of art, time is",
          "The vastest collection of Toulouse Lautrec , we had only 45 minutes ad we had to rush - Wished we had allocated more time. We did not see the works of other artists just concentrated on Toulouse Lautrec because of the time. Spectacular views of the Tarn from the gardens.",
          "Good history and paintings regarding Toulouse-Lautrec, if would be nice to take a few photos(without flash of course) but could not, probably have trouble with those who do not understand the damage flash does, so bettere to not have photos at all. Overall a enjoyable Musee.",
          "Toulouse-Lautrac (T-L) was one of the first artists I \"discovered\" back in my school days - I was living near Washington DC and saw a few of his posters/art works in the National Gallery of Art. Frankly this museum wasn't my prime interest for visiting Albi, as I wanted to see",
          "Was expecting much more since I am a big art fan. The posters you can buy show up more favorably than the actual works at the museum. First time in my life have I encountered this bizarre experience. Even the gift shop was a disappointment since this is their chance to make a",
          "This museum offers a very comprehensive look at Lautrec; both in terms of his family background and the development of his craft. It requires some hiking through its extensive displays and different venues. Be sure to leave enough time -- it opens at 2PM and requires some",
          "We specifically came to Albi to see the Lautrec museum and his works on display. His artwork housed and displayed here is extensive and spans most of his life. We were very pleased both with the museum itself and the Lautrec exhibits---they have other artists' works on display",
          "To be honest I did not take to T-L's style; too raw, sketchy, unfinished. Much of the interest is in the life and times of the artist, e.g. his depiction of \"low life\" in 19th century Montmartre; less so in his technical abilities. But some may love it. You need to love",
          "Until early we arrived in Albi we were ignorant of the fact that the artist was a sone of the city-although he did leave for Paris at the age of eight. We concentrated on the Lautrec paintings and drawings, but the museum does include other collections, both permanent and",
          "This is a sizeable museum with a good range of works by, and of, Toulouse-Lautrec, housed in a beautiful building beside the river. Well worth the admission, a good place to spend a couple of hours.",
          "The museum was a highlight of our brief visit to Albi. It\u2019s really three museums: (1) a retrospective of the work of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (d.1901), who was born in Albi; (2) an exhibition from the general collection; and (3) a presentation of the building itself, which",
          "Who knew that T-L would be so interesting. We got there at 10:30 am, they closed at noon for lunch, when we were only half way through, so we went back in the afternoon to see the rest.",
          "If you are a true fan of T-L, this is the place for you, over 60% of his works are contained within the magnificent building located next to the Albi Cathederal. Truly a wonderful experience made better with the use of the audio guides. The gift shop is great and the staff",
          "This exposition in a wonderful envirement gives a good impression of the days and live of this special member of the french impressionists.It shows the drive and development of a fantastic artist and beautiful work from every stage in his life.",
          "I have to confess at the beginning I went there to please my wife. But the reality is that many performances from Henry de Toulouse-Lautrec are there. The exhibition is done so we follow the evolution of the style and compare with artists from the same period. really interesting",
          "A great museum showing a great deal of the painters work. Explanation is given at every room through out the museum. relaxed atmosphere with attentive staff who are willing to discuss the works of art.",
          "Art lovers cannot ask for mor. This beauifully laid out museum, inside a historical fortlike palace contains all aspects of the artist Toulouse- Lautrec's work. As you walk though the rooms, the growth of his work and career becomes evident. More important is the quiet that",
          "This was set out in such a way that one could trace his whole career. Excellent selection of his work. The building itself is very interesting too.",
          "Really enjoyed this as you got to see works in all stages of design by Toulouse Lautrec. Everything from simple charcoal drawings to paintings.",
          "If you travel in the South of France, don't forget to visit ALBI, the splendid Cathedral and the splendid TPOULOUSE LAUTREC Museum, closed to the Chatedral. You could see a lot of pictures from the famous Henry de TOULOUSE LAUTREC painter and some picture from his \"impresionists",
          "This was a great way to see Toulouse-Lautrec's life story and many of his works set out in a very sympathetic way. The exhibition told his life story, through his work. The building and grounds are also superb and give a great vista of the River Tarn.",
          "Well laid out, great explanations in French, English and Italian, really pleased we went. The building itself is magnificent with lovely architecture and gardens. Brilliant",
          "Wonderful portrait of the artists work. Good audio guide. The layout is a little confusing. But this is well worth the trip.",
          "If you go to Albi and you like French painters, go see. Heck, together with the cathedral, it is worth a detour. Just a spoiler/teaser: Toulouse Lautrec was the trend starter for artsy ad posters. He also experimented with photography. River bridge view from the Episcopal",
          "When you are in Albi you must visit the Musee Toulouse Lautrec The building is very impressive , but the most impressive of that visit are the gardens . As regards the exhibition it is quite interesting but I suppose that some of the most improtant pieces of the artist where",
          "The collections is astonishing and the presentation is amazing. Using the historic old building to weave people in and out of rooms was fun and the gardens were beautiful.",
          "This is a delightful place to visit you will see so much you recognise. The staff were friendly and helpful \u2026.I was captivated the moment I walked in if I am ever back in Albi I will be going back",
          "Thanks to the parents of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, the museum possesses the largest collection of the artist in the world. Over 1000 works, pictures, lithographs, drawings, preparatory studies including all 31 posters afford a complete documented approach of the artist and",
          "I do recommend the audioguide (for the four extra euros), because without it, the experience will be much less absorbing. That mentioned, actually finding some of the paintings that the audioguide is linked to is a royal pain. After the tour (of about two hours), I had a",
          "This museum had the comprehensive collection of the works of Toulouse-Lautrec. He may not be your favourite impressionist but he was the first notable commercial artist and it was worthwhile to visit. The bonus is that the museum is in the bishop's palace just beside the",
          "A well put together exhibition and time line of T-L from his early years to his more renown works. Also the explanations of the processes he used are very informative. The other galleries are worth a look too in this lovely building.",
          "This beautiful red brick building provides an appropriate setting to discover the works of Toulouse-Lautrec and other artists. I was initially put off by the list of 'dont's' that greets the visitor, in particular 'no photography' but having got immersed in the atmosphere",
          "Amazing building, amazing collection and amazing story about the artist. Very worth it to make a visit.",
          "Not over crowded, and a tranquil environment to look at the pictures. Very modern clean facilities. Could do more with the signage",
          "Since I did not know much about this artist, I wasn't sure what to expect. I not only learned about this famous artist but I enjoyed seeing all of his works. In each room there is an informational fact sheet in various languages giving explanation to what you are viewing.",
          "We visited as part of a day trip to Albi and were not disappointed. I didn't know much about Toulouse-Lautrec beforehand, but the volume and variety of his work was huge. The museum is very well presented and housed in a stunning bishop's palace next to the cathedral, which is",
          "Museum is in an old archbishop's palace and spaced out over two large floors. Have audio guides in various languages as well as descriptive sheets to read in the rooms in three or so languages. Art well laid out in periods of the artist life and well done. Well worth a couple",
          "Get an Albi Town pass at the Tourist Office. The exhibit is well documented and well worth a couple if hours.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our time in the museum galleries as well as the breathtaking surroundings. Staff is very helpful and accommodating. There is a great deal of free information in each phase of the galleries to help to learn about the artist and his inspirations. Don't miss",
          "Really enjoyed both the building and the exhibition. The paintings show the progression of Lautrec's work and are beautifully hung. The written cards are clear and informative in several languages.",
          "I visited here perhaps 20 years ago and again in September 2014. The building is the ancient Bishops Place of Albi. It is vast - enormous. Apart from the great exposition of T-L's works - so many one cannot really absorb it all, there are some features of the medieval",
          "Housed in an old Abbey, itself interesting to walk through, the museum is one of the best I have been in. The collection of Toulouse-Lautrc's works are extensive, well laid out and information is offered in many languages. Well worth 2 hours of your time.",
          "Would recommend anyone to visit, take the audio guide is a must and is highly informative. The museum say the average visit takes a little more than an hour but it took us 2 hours.",
          "A great collection of his work spread over 20+ rooms in this amazing old palace. It was good the ticket allowed access to have a break for lunch.",
          "Well curated exhibits in a lovely, historic building. Toulouse-Lautrec's mother kept everything he ever doodled or drew, including the end pages of his schoolbooks, and it is all here. The museum leads you through his life and work, showing his progression from a skilled",

          "Toulouse Lautrec is not my favourite artist, but the museum seemed to do him justice and made me want to know more about him and his life.His art does seem to reflect the turbulance of his existence The museum is easy to find being beside the Tourist Information Office.",
          "The combination of a great collection of Toulouse-Lautrec's work (as well as some historical exhibits) with the Palais de la Berbie, where it is housed, made for a satisfying experience. In addition, the Palais includes a magnificent garden with gorgeous views of the river and",
          "Don't get us wrong, we love all sorts of art and we really appreciate all types, but this guy struggled. Occasionally we saw a painting worth looking at but most of the time we were thinking our kids have done better! Given that Albi, as beautiful as it undoubtedly is, is not",
          "My traveling companion and I found Albi to be a lovely quintessential French village and the Toulouse Lautrec museum surprisingly well designed for an enlightening 'tour' of the artist's work and too short life. I would recommend this exhibit and museum for young and old as",
          "This is more than just a museum about Toulouse-Lautrec as there is a really good exhibition about the history of the city of Albi and the construction of the palace where the museum is located. I would definitely recommend visiting the museum before you visit the cathedral.",
          "Do not miss this. Beautiful museum. Very well done. Excellent collection and explanations. Fantastic building.",
          "1. Great audio tour, not too long, not too short - just right! 2. Well rounded collection, over Lautrec's entire life span. 3. The building has been beautifully restored - tremendous! 4. The two rooms that hold his posters are spectacular! 5. Lots of great restaurants",
          "This is a world-class museum. I had no idea how talented Toulouse-Lautrec was, or that most of his work was done in the 10 years before his premature death at 37. We thought we would go for an hour and stayed for three! Definitely rent the audio guide. You will miss too much",
          "In a characteristic building with wonderful gardens one finds the museum with an overview of the career of Toulouse-Lautrec. Next to some other works, his pieces are on show in a chronological order, so that it is possible to get a good idea of his development. Very interesting!",
          "No trip to Albi is complete without checking out the amazing cathedral, reputedly the largest brick building in the world, and then the Musee Toulouse-Lautrec built into the adjoining Palais de la Berbie, formerly the Bishops' Palace. Those familiar with Toulouse Lautrec's work",
          "We were holidaying nearby and wanted to visit Albi as we had heard it was a beautiful town. I did a bit of research and discovered that Toulouse Lautrec was born here and there was an entire Museum full of his paintings. We didn't know a lot about him (what we did know was",
          "Albi is an impressive small town to wander round but felt rather over hyped until we went into this amazing museum. Far from what we had expected it was chocked full of Toulouse Lautrec's own work (from his teens to the time shortly before his death) and it had multilingual",
          "The museum is both a great tribute and excellent collection of the artist's works. Whilst not an art gallery expert, it was just a great experience to walk through the gallery and appreciate the painting and sketches of this famous artist whom I have been a fan of, and now",
          "Sadly we did not have the time to visit the museum and instead chose to walk around the garden. Beautifully designed and laid out flower beds and a stunning riverside walk. Quite a bit of climbing involved but, if you can, it's worth it.",
          "Due to lack of time on our visit and the glorious weather, we just visited the gardens adjoining the Musee. There was no charge for entrance. It was lovely to stroll through and also view the river below and other areas of Albi. Check out some of the photographs to get a",
          "The building in which the Musee Toulouse-Lautrec is housed is extremely interesting by itself. Added to that the Toulouse-Lautrec collection is fascinating, especially if, like me, you are a fan of the artist. There was also a visiting exhibiton by Maillol which was superb -",
          "Adjoining the Cathedrale Sainte - Cecile, is the Palais de la Berbie , with its high walls and formal gardens, now housing the Musee Toulouse - Lautrec. The building itself has a fascinating history. Originally built as a stronghold in the thirteenth century, it was",
          "A visit to the Toulouse-Lautrec Museum shows the skills of this artist to perfection. There are several rooms to explore with not only the portraits expected of him but also several studies of horses.",
          "Well laid out, well illuminated and in a sympathetically restored ancient building. This is a place to keep on returning to, as there is so much to see. It contains many of Toulouse-Lautrec's well known and also minor works, in addition to those of other artists. Recommended.",
          "We're not much of art buffs, but Lautrec is very accessible. The range and variety of his work is quite remarkable, with many works quite unlike what you would expect. Interesting building too.",
          "This museum is situated in a beautiful building, with the art work well lit and well displayed. There is plenty of information in three different languages (French, German and English) in all the rooms. There is so much to see, not only the work of Toulouse Lautrec, but of",
          "The largest collection of Toulouse Lautrec, and well worth a visit. Interesting to see the lesser known paintings.",
          "I must say my husband was much more enthusiastic about the museum of Toulouse-Lautrec. But once I was inside, WOW. The museums has done a superb job of exhibiting this 20th century artist. What I especially found useful were these laminated pages, available in three or four",
          "Room after room of Toulouse La Trec paintings. Heaven if you like his style. A few spoke to me but I didn't stay for the entire tour as Albi contained so many other places to visit.",
          "The museum displays the left overs of Toulouse-Lautrec's work after the Paris museums have had their pick, so the pictures aren't great. The worst thing is that we were kicked out at noon and told to return at 14.00!!!! What an arrogant way to treat your tourists. Not worth",
          "Wonderful museum in central area of beautiful, historic Albi\u2026could take as much time as you want to see this artist's work from the time he was a child until the end\u2026.got free passes from our chambre d'h\u00f4te, and went early in the morning\u2026.got the audio guides and spent lots of",
          "Loved the paintings and posters - Originals by the famous painter. The building itself is very nice..situated in the old palace as far as I could make out..Very big ..You would need not to be in a rush to take it all in..You can pay a little extra to hire the ear-phones for",
          "To see Toulouse's works was fantastic! Have to line up though as very popular museum and it cost us \u20ac8 each to walk around. Since it was a very busy day with schools and tours we just did the Toulouse works and was very happy for that. Each section of his works there are cards",
          "Last year, we visited Albi but it was pouring with rain and although we saw the Cathdral, the petit train and the Lautrec museum were just closing. We also had to move on so we couldn't wait another two and a half hours for them to re-open. This year we stayed in central Albi",
          "There is not much more to say. You will have the opportunity to see the incredible Toulouse-Lautrec paints.",
          "Large collection of Henri Toulouse-Lautrec's works. We hadn't realised how varied his work was. The information in English was very welcome, it gave a good understanding of his life and art. As a bonus, the museum is in a beautiful old building and there is information about the",
          "A very nice place for the Museum which is located in a Palace. Surprised to see the other face of his work which is not all related to Paris, Moulin Rouge, etc. Take into consideration that the museum closes at 12:00 until 14:30 every day so plan well in advance how you're going",
          "We enjoyed the setting for the Museum which is in the Palace, and a museum of its' own. Oftentimes I was the only person in a gallery, and could enjoy the paintings completely without distractions. Compare this to the Dali Museum in Figueres when it was impossible to move,",
          "A lovely place with stunning views and fireplace. Its a must do if you happen to be in the Midi Pyrenees. A trip to Albi does not stop with the Cathedral! A beautiful tribute the artist! Make time to read the descriptions of each artwork in each of the rooms in the cards",
          "Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec was born in Albi, hence the siting of this museum. It's interesting to see the originals of his works, but I can't say I'm blown away by them. On the other hand......the museum is set within the Palais de la Berbie, which dates from the 13th century.",
          "Do not fail to read the descriptions in each room on the plastic cards. They were written superbly by the musuem's conservator (also the author of catalogues in the shop) and convey a real sense of the demimonde in which Touslouse-Lautrec worked, as well as how his talents",
          "Probably the most important place to visit in Albi - the museum contains many of his works and illustrates what a great artist he was. His sketches and portraits, in particular, are stunning.",
          "We were passing Albi on the way to Sarlat and had little time. We chose the Musee Toulouse Lautrec as the highlight of our visit. We were disappointed, maybe we do not know much about the artist but the presentation was unattractive to us. Albi is a beautiful city select other",
          "Beautiful exposition sadly the audio is not available in enough languages . Make sure to go visit it and have a look at the little garden on the left side just before to enter the museum.",
          "We went to Albi for this museum and as we were already fans of Lautrec's art, we were not disappointed. The info panels were effective unlike many other museums in France and we learned new things about artist's life. The palace gardens and the view from them were also beautiful.",
          "First, the renovated all brick building is outstanding, its location by the river and its interior courtyard is the perfect environment for exhibiting the works of Toulouse-Lautrec. This is one of the most comprehensive exhibitions of his work that I ever seen as it includes its",
          "Never had I thought that Toulouse-Lautrec would have such an appeal. This museum is laid-out superbly. The tale of TL life is fascinating and shown in detail. A tremendous range of art. The bookshop has wonderful souvenirs from miniatures to full size paintings. Only problem;",
          "One of the most beautiful museum buildings, adjacent to the Unesco acclaimed cathedral, the former archbishop's residence houses an excellent collection of local Poster-Boy Toulouse-Lautrec's works.",
          "We went to the museum out of a sense of duty, since we were next door at the cathedral. It turned out to be one of the high points of our trip to France. This is a very well organized and very well interpreted museum, and the collection of about a thousand of",

        "wiki": "Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres ( ANG-gr\u0259, French: [\u0292\u0251\u0303n\u203fo\u0261yst d\u0254minik \u025b\u0303\u0261\u0281]; 29 August 1780 \u2013 14 January 1867) was a French Neoclassical painter. Ingres was profoundly influenced by past artistic traditions and aspired to become the guardian of academic orthodoxy against the ascendant Romantic style. Although he considered himself a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David, it is his portraits, both painted and drawn, that are recognized as his greatest legacy. His expressive distortions of form and space made him an important precursor of modern art, influencing Picasso, Matisse and other modernists.\nBorn into a modest family in Montauban, he travelled to Paris to study in the studio of David. In 1802 he made his Salon debut, and won the Prix de Rome for his painting The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles. By the time he departed in 1806 for his residency in Rome, his style\u2014revealing his close study of Italian and Flemish Renaissance masters\u2014was fully developed, and would change little for the rest of his life. While working in Rome and subsequently Florence from 1806 to 1824, he regularly sent paintings to the Paris Salon, where they were faulted by critics who found his style bizarre and archaic. He received few commissions during this period for the history paintings he aspired to paint, but was able to support himself and his wife as a portrait painter and draughtsman.\nHe was finally recognized at the Salon in 1824, when his Raphaelesque painting of the Vow of Louis XIII was met with acclaim, and Ingres was \nacknowledged as the leader of the Neoclassical school in France. Although the income from commissions for history paintings allowed him to paint fewer portraits, his Portrait of Monsieur Bertin marked his next popular success in 1833. The following year, his indignation at the harsh criticism of his ambitious composition The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian caused him to return to Italy, where he assumed directorship of the French Academy in Rome in 1835. He returned to Paris for good in 1841. In his later years he painted new versions of many of his earlier compositions, a series of designs for stained glass windows, several important portraits of women, and The Turkish Bath, the last of his several Orientalist paintings of the female nude, which he finished at the age of 83.\n\n\n== Early years: Montauban and Toulouse ==\nIngres was born in Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne, France, the first of seven children (five of whom survived infancy) of Jean-Marie-Joseph Ingres (1755\u20131814) and his wife Anne Moulet (1758\u20131817). His father was a successful jack-of-all-trades in the arts, a painter of miniatures, sculptor, decorative stonemason, and amateur musician; his mother was the nearly illiterate daughter of a master wigmaker. From his father the young Ingres received early encouragement and instruction in drawing and music, and his first known drawing, a study after an antique cast, was made in 1789. Starting in 1786, he attended the local school \u00c9cole des Fr\u00e8res de l'\u00c9ducation Chr\u00e9tienne, but his education was disrupted by the turmoil of the French Revolution, and the closing of the school in 1791 marked the end of his conventional education. The deficiency in his schooling would always remain for him a source of insecurity.In 1791, Joseph Ingres took his son to Toulouse, where the young Jean-Auguste-Dominique was enrolled in the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture, Sculpture et Architecture. There he studied under the sculptor Jean-Pierre Vigan, the landscape painter Jean Briant, and the neoclassical painter Guillaume-Joseph Roques. Roques' veneration of Raphael was a decisive influence on the young artist. Ingres won prizes in several disciplines, such as composition, \"figure and antique\", and life studies. His musical talent was developed under the tutelage of the violinist Lejeune, and from the ages of thirteen to sixteen he played second violin in the Orchestre du Capitole de Toulouse.From an early age he was determined to be a history painter, which, in the hierarchy of artists established by the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture under Louis XIV, and continued well into the 19th Century, was considered the highest level of painting. He did not want to simply make portraits or illustrations of real life like his father; he wanted to represent the heroes of religion, history and mythology, to idealize them and show them in ways that explained their actions, rivaling the best works of literature and philosophy.\n\n\n== In Paris (1797\u20131806) ==\n\nIn March 1797, the Academy awarded Ingres first prize in drawing, and in August he traveled to Paris to study in the studio of Jacques-Louis David, France's\u2014and Europe's\u2014leading painter during the revolutionary period, in whose studio he remained for four years. Ingres followed his master's neoclassical example. In 1797 David was working on his enormous masterpiece, The Intervention of the Sabine Women, and was gradually modifying his style away from Roman models of rigorous realism to the ideals of purity, virtue and simplicity in Greek art.  One of the other students of David, \u00c9tienne-Jean Del\u00e9cluze, who later became an art critic, described Ingres as a student: He was distinguished not just by the candor of his character and his disposition to work alone ... he was one of the most studious ... he took little part in the all the turbulent follies around him, and he studied with more perseverance than most of his co-disciples ... All of the qualities which characterize today the talent of this artist, the finesse of contour, the true and profound sentiment of the form, and a modeling with extraordinary correctness and firmness, could already be seen in his early studies. While several of his comrades and David himself signaled a tendency toward exaggeration in his studies, everyone was struck by his grand compositions and recognized his talent. He was admitted to the painting department of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in October 1799. In 1800 and 1801, he won the grand prize for figure painting for his paintings of male torsos. In 1800 and 1801 he also competed for the Prix de Rome, the highest prize of the Academy, which entitled the winner to four years of residence at the Acad\u00e9mie de France in Rome. He came in second in his first attempt, but in 1801 he took the top prize with The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles. The figures of the envoys, in the right of the painting, are muscular and solid as statues, in the style taught by David, but the two main figures on the left, Achilles and Patroclus, are mobile, vivid and graceful, like figures in a delicate bas-relief.\nHis residence in Rome was postponed until 1806 due to shortage of state funds. In the meantime he worked in Paris alongside several other students of David in a studio provided by the state, and further developed a style that emphasized purity of contour. He found inspiration in the works of Raphael, in Etruscan vase paintings, and in the outline engravings of the English artist John Flaxman. His drawings of Hermaphrodite and the Nymph Salmacis showed a new stylized ideal of female beauty, which would reappear later in his Jupiter et Thetis and his famous nudes.In 1802 he made his debut at the Salon with Portrait of a Woman (the current whereabouts of which is unknown). Between 1804 and 1806 he painted a series of portraits which were striking for their extreme precision, particularly in the richness of their fabrics and tiny details.  These included the Portrait of Philipbert Rivi\u00e9re (1805), Portrait of Sabine Rivi\u00e8re (1805\u201306), Portrait of Madame Aymon (also known as La Belle Z\u00e9lie; 1806), and Portrait of Caroline Rivi\u00e8re (1805\u201306).  The female faces were not at all detailed but were softened, and were notable for their large oval eyes and delicate flesh colours and their rather dreamlike expressions. His portraits typically had simple backgrounds of solid dark or light colour, or of sky. These were the beginning of a series that would make him among the most celebrated portrait artists of the 19th century.As Ingres waited to depart to Rome, his friend Lorenzo Bartolini introduced him to Italian Renaissance paintings, particularly the works Bronzino and Pontormo, which Napoleon had brought back from his campaign in Italy and placed in the Louvre. Ingres assimilated their clarity and monumentality into his own portrait style. In the Louvre were also masterpieces of Flemish art, including the Ghent Altarpiece by Jan Van Eyck, which the French army had seized during its conquest of Flanders. The precision of Renaissance Flemish art became part of Ingres's style. Ingres's stylistic eclecticism represented a new tendency in art. The Louvre, newly filled with booty seized by Napoleon in his campaigns in Italy and the Low Countries, provided French artists of the early 19th century with an unprecedented opportunity to study, compare, and copy masterworks from antiquity and from the entire history of European painting. As art historian Marjorie Cohn has written: \"At the time, art history as a scholarly enquiry was brand-new. Artists and critics outdid each other in their attempts to identify, interpret, and exploit what they were just beginning to perceive as historical stylistic developments.\" From the beginning of his career, Ingres freely borrowed from earlier art, adopting the historical style appropriate to his subject, and was consequently accused by critics of plundering the past.\n\nIn 1803 he received a prestigious commission, being one of five artists selected (along with Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Robert Lef\u00e8vre, Charles Meynier, and Marie-Guillemine Benoist) to paint full-length portraits of Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul. These were to be distributed to the prefectural towns of Li\u00e8ge, Antwerp, Dunkerque, Brussels, and Ghent, all of which were newly ceded to France in the 1801 Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville. Napoleon is not known to have granted the artists a sitting, and Ingres's meticulously painted portrait of Bonaparte, First Consul appears to be modelled on an image of Napoleon painted by Antoine-Jean Gros in 1802.In the summer of 1806, Ingres became engaged to Marie-Anne-Julie Forestier, a painter and musician, before leaving for Rome in September. Although he had hoped to stay in Paris long enough to witness the opening of that year's Salon, in which he was to display several works, he reluctantly left for Italy just days before the opening.Ingres painted a new portrait of Napoleon for presentation at the 1806 Salon, this one showing Napoleon on the Imperial Throne for his coronation. This painting was entirely different from his earlier portrait of Napoleon as First Consul; it concentrated almost entirely on the lavish imperial costume that Napoleon had chosen to wear, and the symbols of power he held. The scepter of Charles V, the sword of Charlemagne the rich fabrics, furs and capes, crown of gold leaves, golden chains and emblems were all presented in extremely precise detail; the Emperor's face and hands were almost lost in the majestic costume.\nAt the Salon, his paintings\u2014Self-Portrait, portraits of the Rivi\u00e8re family, and Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne\u2014received a very chilly reception. David delivered a severe judgement, and the critics were hostile. Chaussard (Le Pausanias Fran\u00e7ais, 1806) praised \"the fineness of Ingres's brushwork and the finish\", but condemned Ingres's style as gothic and asked: How, with so much talent, a line so flawless, an attention to detail so thorough, has M. Ingres succeeded in painting a bad picture? The answer is that he wanted to do something singular, something extraordinary ... M. Ingres's intention is nothing less than to make art regress by four centuries, to carry us back to its infancy, to revive the manner of Jean de Bruges.\n\n\n== Rome and the French Academy (1806\u20131814) ==\n\nNewly arrived in Rome, Ingres read with mounting indignation the relentlessly negative press clippings sent to him from Paris by his friends. In letters to his prospective father-in-law, he expressed his outrage at the critics: \"So the Salon is the scene of my disgrace; ... The scoundrels, they waited until I was away to assassinate my reputation ... I have never been so unhappy....I knew I had many enemies; I never was agreeable with them and never will be. My greatest wish would be to fly to the Salon and to confound them with my works, which don't in any way resemble theirs;  and the more I advance, the less their work will resemble mine.\" He vowed never again to exhibit at the Salon, and his refusal to return to Paris led to the breaking up of his engagement. Julie Forestier, when asked years later why she had never married, responded, \"When one has had the honor of being engaged to M. Ingres, one does not marry.\"On 23 November 1806, he wrote to Jean Forestier, the father of his former fianc\u00e9e, \"Yes, art will need to be reformed, and I intend to be that revolutionary.\"  Characteristically, he found a studio on the grounds of the Villa Medici away from the other resident artists, and painted furiously.  Many drawings of monuments in Rome from this time are attributed to Ingres, but it appears from more recent scholarship that they were actually the work of his collaborators, particularly his friend the landscape artist Fran\u00e7ois-Marius Granet. As required of every winner of the Prix, he sent works at regular intervals to Paris so his progress could be judged. Traditionally fellows sent paintings of male Greek or Roman heroes, but for his first samples Ingres sent Baigneuse \u00e0 mi-corps (1807), a painting of the back of a young woman bathing, based on an engraving of an antique vase, and  La Grande Bagneuse (1808), a larger painting of the back of a nude bather, and the first Ingres model to wear a turban, a detail he borrowed from the Fornarina by his favourite painter, Raphael. To satisfy the Academy in Paris, he also dispatched  Oedipus and the Sphinx to show his mastery of the male nude. The verdict of the academicians in Paris was that the figures were not sufficiently idealized. In later years Ingres painted several variants of these compositions; another nude begun in 1807, the Venus Anadyomene, remained in an unfinished state for decades, to be completed forty years later and finally exhibited in 1855.\n\nDuring his time in Rome he also painted numerous portraits: Madame Duvaucey (1807), Fran\u00e7ois-Marius Granet (1807), Joseph-Antoine Moltedo (1810), Madame Panckoucke (1811), and Charles-Joseph-Laurent Cordier (1811). In 1812 he painted one of his few portraits of an older woman, Comtesse de Tournon, mother of the prefect of Rome. In 1810 Ingres's pension at the Villa Medici ended, but he decided to stay in Rome and seek patronage from the French occupation government.\nIn 1811 Ingres completed his final student exercise, the immense Jupiter and Thetis, a scene from the Iliad of Homer: the goddess of the Sea, Thetis, pleads with Zeus to act in favor of her son Achilles. The face of the water nymph Salmacis he had drawn years earlier reappeared as Thetis.  Ingres wrote with enthusiasm that he had been planning to paint this subject since 1806, and he intended to \"deploy all of the luxury of art in its beauty\".  However, once again, the critics were hostile, finding fault with the exaggerated proportions of the figures and the painting's flat, airless quality.Although facing uncertain prospects, in 1813 Ingres married a young woman, Madeleine Chapelle, recommended to him by her friends in Rome. After a courtship carried out through correspondence, he proposed without having met her, and she accepted. Their marriage was happy; Madame Ingres's faith was unwavering. He continued to suffer disparaging reviews, as Don Pedro of Toledo Kissing Henry IV's Sword, Raphael and the Fornarina (Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University), several portraits, and the Interior of the Sistine Chapel met with generally hostile critical response at the Paris Salon of 1814.\n\n\n== Rome after the Academy and Florence (1814\u20131824) ==\n\nAfter he left the Academy, a few important commissions came to him. The French governor of Rome, General Miollis, a wealthy patron of the arts, asked him to decorate rooms of the Monte Cavallo Palace, a former papal residence, for an expected visit of Napoleon. Ingres painted a large-scale Romulus' Victory Over Acron (1811) for the salon of the Empress and The Dream of Ossian (1813), based on a book of poems that Napoleon admired, for the ceiling of the Emperor's bedroom. General Miollis also commissioned Ingres to paint Virgil reading the Aeneid (1812) for his own residence, the villa Aldobrandini. The painting showed the moment when Virgil predicted the death of Marcellus, the son of Livia, causing Livia to faint. The interior was precisely depicted, following the archeological finds at Pompeii. As usual, Ingres made several versions of the same scene: a three-figure fragment cut from an abandoned version is in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels, and in 1832 he made a drawing in vertical format as a model for a reproductive engraving by Pradier. The General Miollis version was repurchased by Ingres in the 1830s, reworked by assistants under Ingres's direction, and never finished; The Dream of Ossian was likewise repurchased, modified, but left unfinished.He traveled to Naples in the spring of 1814 to paint Queen Caroline Murat. Joachim Murat, the King of Naples, had earlier purchased the Dormeuse de Naples, a sleeping nude (the original is lost, but several drawings exist, and Ingres later revisited the subject in L'Odalisque \u00e0 l'esclave). Murat also commissioned two historical paintings, Raphael et la Fornarina and Paolo et Francesca, and what later became one of Ingres's most famous works, La Grande Odalisque, to accompany Dormeuse de Naples. Ingres never received payment, due to the collapse of the Murat regime and execution of Joachim Murat in 1815. With the fall of Napoleon's dynasty, he found himself essentially stranded in Rome without patronage.\n\nHe continued to produce masterful portraits,  in pencil and oils, of almost photographic precision; but with the departure of the French administration, the painting commissions were rare. During this low point of his career, Ingres augmented his income by drawing pencil portraits of the many wealthy tourists, in particular the English, passing through postwar Rome. For an artist who aspired to a reputation as a history painter, this seemed menial work, and to the visitors who knocked on his door asking, \"Is this where the man who draws the little portraits lives?\", he would answer with irritation, \"No, the man who lives here is a painter!\" The portrait drawings he produced in such profusion during this period rank today among his most admired works. He is estimated to have made some five hundred portrait drawings, including portraits of his famous friends. His friends included many musicians including Paganini, and he regularly played the violin with others who shared his enthusiasm for Mozart, Haydn, Gluck, and Beethoven.He also produced a series of small paintings in what was known as the Troubador style, idealized portrayals of events in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In 1815 he painted Aretino and Charles V's Ambassador as well as Aretino and Tintoretto, an anecdotal painting whose subject, a painter brandishing a pistol at his critic, may have been especially satisfying to the embattled Ingres. Other paintings in the same style included Henry IV Playing with His Children (1817) and the Death of Leonardo.\n\nIn 1816 Ingres produced his only etching, a portrait of the French ambassador to Rome, Monsignor Gabriel Cortois de Pressigny. The only other prints he is known to have executed are two lithographs: The Four Magistrates of Besan\u00e7on, made as an illustration for Baron Taylor's Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l'ancienne France, and a copy of La Grande Odalisque, both in 1825.In 1817 the Count of Blacas, who was ambassador of France to the Holy See, provided Ingres with his first official commission since 1814, for a painting of Christ Giving the Keys to Peter. Completed in 1820, this imposing work was well received in Rome but to the artist's chagrin the ecclesiastical authorities there would not permit it to be sent to Paris for exhibition.A commission came in 1816 or 1817 from the descendants of the Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alva, for a painting of the Duke receiving papal honours for his repression of the Protestant Reformation. Ingres loathed the subject\u2014he regarded the Duke as one of history's brutes\u2014and struggled to satisfy both the commission and his conscience. After revisions which eventually reduced the Duke to a tiny figure in the background, Ingres left the work unfinished. He entered in his diary, \"J'etais forc\u00e9 par la necessit\u00e9 de peindre un pareil tableau; Dieu a voulu qu'il reste en ebauche.\" (\"I was forced by need to paint such a painting; God wanted it to remain a sketch.\")\nHe continued to send works to the Salon in Paris, hoping to make his breakthrough there.  In 1819 he sent his reclining nude, La Grande Odalisque, as well as a history painting, Philip V and the Marshal of Berwick, and Roger Freeing Angelica, based on an episode in the 16th-century epic poem Orlando Furioso by Ariosto but his work was once again condemned by critics as gothic and unnatural. The critic K\u00e9raty complained that the Grande Odalisque's back was three vertebrae too long. The critic Charles Landon wrote: \"After a moment of attention, one sees that in this figure there are no bones, no muscles, no blood, no life, no relief, no anything which constitutes imitation....it is evident that the artist deliberately erred, that he wanted to do it badly, that he believed in bringing back to life the pure and primitive manner of the painters of Antiquity;  but he took for his model a few fragments from earlier periods and a degenerate execution, and completely lost his way.\"In 1820 Ingres and his wife moved to Florence at the urging of the Florentine sculptor Lorenzo Bartolini, an old friend from his years in Paris. He still had to depend upon his portraits and drawings for income, but his luck began to change. His history painting Roger Freeing Angelica was purchased for the private collection of Louis XVIII, and was hung in the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg in Paris, which was newly devoted to the work of living artists. This was the first work of Ingres to enter a museum.\n\nIn 1821 he finished a painting commissioned by a childhood friend, Monsieur de Pastoret, The Entry into Paris of the Dauphin, the Future Charles V; de Pastoret also ordered a portrait of himself and a religious work (Virgin with the Blue Veil). In August 1820, with the help of de Pastoret, he received a commission for a major religious painting for the Cathedral of Montauban. The theme was the re-establishment of the bond between the church and the state. Ingres's painting, The Vow of Louis XIII (1824), inspired by Raphael, was purely in the Renaissance style, and depicted King Louis XIII vowing to dedicate his reign to the Virgin Mary. This was perfectly in tune with the doctrine of the new government of the Restoration. He spent four years bringing the large canvas to completion, and he took it to the Paris Salon in October 1824, where it became the key that finally opened the door of the Paris art establishment and to his career as an official painter.\n\n\n== Return to Paris and retreat to Rome (1824\u20131834) ==\n\nThe Vow of Louis XIII  in the Salon of 1824 finally brought Ingres critical success. Although Stendhal complained about \"the sort of material beauty which excludes the idea of divinity\", most critics praised the work. The journalist and future Prime Minister and French President Adolphe Thiers celebrated the breakthrough of a new style: \"Nothing is better than variety like this, the essential character of the new style.\" In January 1825 he was awarded the Cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur by Charles X, and in June 1825 he was elected a member of Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts. Lithographs of La Grande Odalisque published in 1826 in two competing versions by Delpech and Sudr\u00e9 found eager buyers; Ingres received 24,000 francs  for the reproduction rights \u2013 twenty times the amount he had been paid for the original painting six years earlier. The 1824 Salon also brought forward a counter-current to the neoclassicism of Ingres: Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix exhibited Les Massacres de Scio, in a romantic style sharply contrasting to that of Ingres.The success of Ingres's painting led in 1826 to a major new commission, The Apotheosis of Homer, a giant canvas which celebrated all the great artists of history, intended to decorate the ceiling of one of the halls of the Museum Charles X at the Louvre. Ingres was unable to finish the work in time for the 1827 Salon, but displayed the painting in grisaille. The 1827 Salon became a confrontation between the neoclassicism of Ingres's Apotheosis and a new manifesto of romanticism by Delacroix, The Death of Sardanapalus. Ingres joined the battle with enthusiasm; he called Delacroix \"the apostle of ugliness\" and told friends that he recognized \"the talent, the honorable character and distinguished spirit\" of Delacroix, but that \"he has tendencies which I believe are dangerous and which I must push back.\"\n\nDespite the considerable patronage he enjoyed under the Bourbon government, Ingres welcomed the July Revolution of 1830. That the outcome of the Revolution was not a republic but a constitutional monarchy was satisfactory to the essentially conservative and pacifistic artist, who in a letter to a friend in August 1830 criticized agitators who \"still want to soil and disturb the order and happiness of a freedom so gloriously, so divinely won.\" Ingres's career was little affected, and he continued to receive official commissions and honors under the July Monarchy.\nIngres exhibited in the Salon of 1833, where his portrait of Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Bertin (1832) was a particular success. The public found its realism spellbinding, although some of the critics declared its naturalism vulgar and its colouring drab. In 1834 he finished a large religious painting, The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian, which depicted the first saint to be martyred in Gaul. The painting was commissioned in 1824 by the Ministry of the Interior for the Cathedral of Autun, and the iconography in the picture was specified by the bishop. Ingres conceived the painting as the summation of all of his work and skill, and worked on it for ten years before displaying it at the 1834 Salon. He was surprised, shocked and angered by the response; the painting was attacked by both the neoclassicists and by the romantics. Ingres was accused of historical inaccuracy, for the colours, and for the feminine appearance of the Saint, who looked like a beautiful statue. In anger, Ingres announced that he would no longer accept public commissions, and that he would no longer participate in the Salon.  He later did participate in some semi-public expositions and a retrospective of his work at the 1855 Paris International Exposition, but never again took part in the Salon or submitted his work for public judgement. Instead, at the end of 1834 he returned to Rome to become the Director of the Academy of France.\n\n\n== Director of the French Academy in Rome (1834\u20131841) ==\n\nIngres remained in Rome for six years. He devoted much of his attention to the training of the painting students, as he was later to do at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He re-organized the Academy, increased the size of the library, added many molds of classical statues to the Academy collection, and assisted the students in getting public commissions in both Rome and Paris. He traveled to Orvieto (1835), Sienna (1835), and to Ravenna and Urbino to study the paleochristian mosaics, medieval murals and Renaissance art. He devoted considerable attention to music, one of the subjects of the academy; he welcomed Franz Liszt and Fanny Mendelssohn. He formed a long friendship with Liszt. The composer Charles Gounod, who was a pensioner at the time at the Academy, described Ingres's appreciation of modern music, including Weber and Berlioz, and his adoration for Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart and Gluck. He joined the music students and his friend Niccol\u00f2 Paganini in playing Beethoven's violin works. Gounod wrote that Ingres \"had the tenderness of an infant and the indignation of an apostle.\" When Stendhal visited the Academy and disparaged Beethoven, Ingres turned to the doorman, indicated Stendahl, and told him, \"If this gentleman ever calls again, I am not here.\"His rancor against the Paris art establishment for his failure at the 1834 Salon did not abate. In 1836 he refused a major commission from the French Minister of the Interior, Adolphe Thiers, to decorate the interior of the Church of the Madeleine in Paris, because the commission had been offered first to a rival, Paul Delaroche, who refused it. He did complete a small number of works which he sent to patrons in Paris. One was L'Odalisque et l'esclave, (1839), a portrait of a blonde odalisque, or member of a harem, who reclines languorously while a turbaned musician plays. This fitted into the popular genre of orientalism; his rival Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix had created a painting on a similar theme, Les Femmes d'Alger, for the 1834 Salon. The setting was inspired by Persian miniatures and was full of exotic detail, but the woman's long reclining form was pure Ingres. The critic Th\u00e9ophile Gautier wrote of Ingres's work: \"It is impossible to better paint the mystery, the silence and the suffocating atmosphere of the seraglio.\" In 1842 he painted a second version, nearly identical to the first but with a landscape background (painted by his student Paul Flandrin).\n\nThe second painting he sent, in 1840, was The Illness of Antiochus (1840; also known as Aniochus and Stratonice) a history painting on a theme of love and sacrifice, a theme once painted by David in 1800, when Ingres was in his studio. It was commissioned by the Duc d'Orleans, the son of King Louis Philippe I), and had very elaborate architectural background designed by one of the Academy students, Victor Baltard, the future architect of the Paris market Les Halles. The central figure was an ethereal woman in white, whose contemplative pose with her hand on her chin recurs in some of Ingres's female portraits.His painting of Aniochius and Stratonice, despite its small size, just one meter, was a major success for Ingres. In August it was shown in the private apartment of the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans in the Pavilion Marsan of the Palais des Tuileries. The King greeted him personally at Versailles and gave him a tour of the Palace. He was offered a commission to paint a portrait of the Duke, the heir to the throne, and another from the Duc de Lunyes to create two huge murals for the Ch\u00e2teau de Dampierre. In April 1841 he returned definitively to Paris.\n\n\n== Last years (1841\u20131867) ==\n\nOne of the first works executed after his return to Paris was a portrait of the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans. After the heir to the throne was killed in a carriage accident a few months after the painting was completed in 1842, Ingres received commissions to make additional copies. He also received a commission to design seventeen stained glass windows for the chapel on the place where the accident occurred, and a commission for eight additional stained-glass designs for Orl\u00e9ans chapel in Dreux. He became a professor at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He took his students frequently to the Louvre to the see the classical and Renaissance art, instructing them to look straight ahead and to avoid the works of Rubens, which he believed deviated too far from the true values of art.The Revolution of 1848, which overthrew Louis Philippe and created the French Second Republic, had little effect on his work or his ideas. He declared that the revolutionaries were \"cannibals who called themselves French\", but during the Revolution completed his Venus Anadyomene, which he had started as an academic study in 1808. It represented Venus, rising from the sea which had given birth to her, surrounded by cherubs.  He welcomed the patronage of the new government of Louis-Napoleon, who in 1852 became Emperor Napoleon III.   \n\nIn 1843 Ingres began the decorations of the great hall in the Ch\u00e2teau de Dampierre with two large murals, the Golden Age and the Iron Age, illustrating the origins of art.  He made more than five hundred preparatory drawings, and worked on the enormous project for six years. In an attempt to imitate the effect of Renaissance frescos, he chose to paint the murals in oil on plaster, which created technical difficulties. Work on the Iron Age never progressed beyond the architectural background painted by an assistant. Meanwhile, the growing crowd of nudes in the Golden Age discomfited Ingres's patron, the Duc de Luynes, and Ingres suspended work on the mural in 1847. Ingres was devastated by the loss of his wife, who died on 27 July 1849, and he was finally unable to complete the work. In July 1851, he announced a gift of his artwork to his native city of Montauban, and in October he resigned as professor at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts.However, in 1852, Ingres, then seventy-one years of age, married forty-three-year-old Delphine Ramel, a relative of his friend Marcotte d'Argenteuil. Ingres was rejuvenated, and in the decade that followed he completed several significant works, including the portrait of Princesse Albert de Broglie, n\u00e9e Jos\u00e9phine-El\u00e9onore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de B\u00e9arn. In 1853 he began the Apotheosis of Napoleon I, for the ceiling of a hall in the H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris. (It was destroyed in May 1871 when the Paris Commune set fire to the building.) With the help of assistants, in 1854 he completed another history painting, Joan of Arc at the Coronation of Charles VII. A retrospective of his works was featured at the Paris Universal Exposition of 1855, and in the same year Napoleon III named him a Grand Officer of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. In 1862 he was awarded the title of Senator, and made a member of the Imperial Council on Public Instruction. Three of his works were shown in the London International Exhibition, and his reputation as a major French painter was confirmed once more.\n\nHe continued to rework and refine his classic themes. In 1856 Ingres completed The Source (The Spring), a painting begun in 1820 and closely related to his Venus Anadyom\u00e9ne. He painted two versions of Louis XIV and Moli\u00e8re (1857 and 1860), and produced variant copies of several of his earlier compositions. These included religious works in which the figure of the Virgin from The Vow of Louis XIII was reprised: The Virgin of the Adoption of 1858 (painted for Mademoiselle Roland-Gosselin) was followed by The Virgin Crowned (painted for Madame la Baronne de Larinthie) and The Virgin with Child. In 1859 he produced new versions of The Virgin of the Host, and in 1862 he completed Christ and the Doctors, a work commissioned many years before by Queen Marie Amalie for the chapel of Bizy. He painted small replicas of Paolo and Francesca and Oedipus and the Sphinx. In 1862 he completed a small oil-on-paper version of The Golden Age. The last of his important portrait paintings date from this period: Marie-Clothilde-In\u00e9s de Foucauld, Madame Moitessier, Seated (1856), Self-Portrait at the Age of Seventy-eight and Madame J.-A.-D. Ingres, n\u00e9e Delphine Ramel, both completed in 1859. At the request of the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, he made his own-self portrait in 1858. The only colour in the painting is the red of his rosette of the Legion of Honour.Near the end of his life, he made one of his best-known masterpieces, The Turkish Bath. It reprised a figure and theme he had been painting since 1828, with his Petite Baigneuse. Originally completed in a square format in 1852 and sold to Prince Napoleon in 1859, it was returned to the artist soon afterward\u2014according to a legend, Princess Clothilde was shocked by the abundant nudity. After reworking the painting as a tondo, Ingres signed and dated it in 1862, although he made additional revisions in 1863. The painting was eventually purchased by a Turkish diplomat, Khalid Bey, who owned a large collection of nudes and erotic art, including several paintings by Courbet. The painting continued to cause a scandal long after Ingres was dead. It was initially offered to the Louvre in 1907, but was rejected, before being given to the Louvre in 1911.Ingres died of pneumonia on 14 January 1867, at the age of eighty-six, in his apartment on the Quai Voltaire in Paris. He is interred in the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris with a tomb sculpted by his student Jean-Marie Bonnassieux. The contents of his studio, including a number of major paintings, over 4000 drawings, and his violin, were bequeathed by the artist to the city museum of Montauban, now known as the Mus\u00e9e Ingres.\n\n\n== Style ==\n\nIngres's style was formed early in life and changed comparatively little. His earliest drawings, such as the Portrait of a Man (or Portrait of an unknown, 3 July 1797, now in the Louvre) already show a suavity of outline and an extraordinary control of the parallel hatchings which model the forms. From the first, his paintings are characterized by a firmness of outline reflecting his often-quoted conviction that \"drawing is the probity of art\". He believed colour to be no more than an accessory to drawing, explaining: \"Drawing is not just reproducing contours, it is not just the line; drawing is also the expression, the inner form, the composition, the modelling. See what is left after that. Drawing is seven eighths of what makes up painting.\"The art historian Jean Clay said Ingres \"proceeded always from certitude to certitude, with the result that even his freest sketches reveal the same kind of execution as that found in the final works.\" In depicting the human body he disregarded rules of anatomy\u2014which he termed a \"dreadful science that I cannot think of without disgust\"\u2014in his quest for a sinuous arabesque. Abhorring the visible brushstroke, Ingres made no recourse to the shifting effects of colour and light on which the Romantic school depended; he preferred local colours only faintly modelled in light by half tones. \"Ce que l'on sait,\" he would repeat, \"il faut le savoir l'\u00e9p\u00e9e \u00e0 la main.\" (\"Whatever you know, you must know it with sword in hand.\") Ingres thus left himself without the means of producing the necessary unity of effect when dealing with crowded compositions, such as the Apotheosis of Homer and the Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian. Among Ingres's historical and mythological paintings, the most satisfactory are usually those depicting one or two figures, such as Oedipus, The Half-Length Bather, Odalisque, and The Spring, subjects only animated by the consciousness of perfect physical well-being.In Roger Freeing Angelica, the female nude seems merely juxtaposed with the meticulously rendered but inert figure of Roger flying to the rescue on his hippogriff, for Ingres was rarely successful in the depiction of movement and drama. According to Sanford Schwartz, the \"historical, mythological, and religious pictures bespeak huge amounts of energy and industry, but, conveying little palpable sense of inner tension, are costume dramas ... The faces in the history pictures are essentially those of models waiting for the session to be over. When an emotion is to be expressed, it comes across stridently, or woodenly.\"Ingres was averse to theories, and his allegiance to classicism\u2014with its emphasis on the ideal, the generalized, and the regular\u2014was tempered by his love of the particular. He believed that \"the secret of beauty has to be found through truth. The ancients did not create, they did not make; they recognized.\" In many of Ingres's works there is a collision between the idealized and the particular that creates what Robert Rosenblum termed an \"oil-and-water sensation\". This contradiction is vivid in Cherubini and the Muse of Lyric Poetry (1842), for example, in which the realistically painted 81-year-old composer is attended by an idealized muse in classical drapery.Ingres's choice of subjects reflected his literary tastes, which were severely limited: he read and reread Homer, Virgil, Plutarch, Dante, histories, and the lives of the artists. Throughout his life he revisited a small number of favourite themes, and painted multiple versions of many of his major compositions. He did not share his age's enthusiasm for battle scenes, and generally preferred to depict \"moments of revelation or intimate decision manifested by meeting or confrontation, but never by violence.\" His numerous odalisque paintings were influenced to a great extent by the writings of Mary Wortley Montagu, the wife of the ambassador to Turkey whose diaries and letters, when published, fascinated European society.Although capable of painting quickly, he often laboured for years over a painting. Ingres's pupil Amaury-Duval wrote of him: \"With this facility of execution, one has trouble explaining why Ingres' oeuvre is not still larger, but he scraped out [his work] frequently, never being satisfied ... and perhaps this facility itself made him rework whatever dissatisfied him, certain that he had the power to repair the fault, and quickly, too.\" Ingres's Venus Anadyomene was begun in 1807 but not completed until 1848, after a long hiatus resulting from his indecision about the position of the arms. The Source (1856) had a similar history. It was begun in the 1820s as a sketch of \"such simplicity that one would suppose she had been painted in a single stroke\" according to Amaury-Duval, who believed that Ingres' reworking of the painting in 1855 was a loss.\n\n\n=== Portraits ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nWhile Ingres believed that history painting was the highest form of art, his modern reputation rests largely upon the exceptional quality of his portraits. By the time of his retrospective at the Exposition Universelle in 1855, an emerging consensus viewed his portrait paintings as his masterpieces. Their consistently high quality belies Ingres's often-stated complaint that the demands of portraiture robbed him of time he could have spent painting historical subjects. Baudelaire called him \"the sole man in France who truly makes portraits. The portraits of M. Bertin, M. Mol\u00e9 and Mme d'Haussonville are true portraits, that is, the ideal reconstruction of individuals....A good portrait seems to me always as a biography dramatized.\" His most famous portrait is that of Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Bertin, the chief editor of the Journal des Debats, which was widely admired when it was exhibited at the 1833 Salon. Ingres had originally planned to paint Bertin standing, but many hours of effort ended in a creative impasse before he decided on a seated pose. \u00c9douard Manet described the resulting portrait as \"The Buddha of the Bourgeoisie\". The portrait quickly became a symbol of the rising economic and political power of Bertin's social class.For his female portraits, he often posed the subject after a classical statue; the famous portrait of the Comtesse de'Haussonville may have been modeled after a Roman statue called \"Pudicity\" (\"modesty\") in the Vatican collection. Another trick that Ingres used was to paint the fabrics and details in the portraits with extreme precision and accuracy, but to idealize the face. The eye of the viewer would perceive the fabrics as realistic and would assume the face was equally true. His portraits of women range from the warmly sensuous Madame de Senonnes (1814) to the realistic Mademoiselle Jeanne Gonin (1821), the Junoesque Marie-Clothilde-In\u00e9s de Foucauld, Madame Moitessier (portrayed standing and seated, 1851 and 1856), and the chilly Jos\u00e9phine-El\u00e9onore-Marie-Pauline de Galard de Brassac de B\u00e9arn, Princesse de Broglie (1853).\n\n\n=== Drawings ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nDrawing was the foundation of Ingres's art. In the Ecole des Beaux-Arts he excelled at figure drawing, winning the top prizes.  During his years in Rome and Florence, he made hundreds of drawings of family, friends, and visitors, many of them of very high portrait quality. He never began a painting without first resolving the drawing, usually with a long series of drawing in which he refined the composition. In the case of his large history paintings, each figure in the painting was the subject of numerous sketches and studies as he tried different poses. He demanded that his students at the Academy and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts perfect their drawing before anything else; he declared that a \"thing well drawn is always a thing well painted\".\n\nHis portrait drawings, of which about 450 are extant, are today among his most admired works. While a disproportionate number of them date from his difficult early years in Italy, he continued to produce portrait drawings of his friends until the end of his life. Agnes Mongan has written of the portrait drawings:Before his departure in the fall of 1806 from Paris for Rome, the familiar characteristics of his drawing style were well established, the delicate yet firm contour, the definite yet discreet distortions of form, the almost uncanny capacity to seize a likeness in the precise yet lively delineation of features.The preferred materials were also already established: the sharply pointed graphite pencil on a smooth white paper. So familiar to us are both the materials and the manner that we forget how extraordinary they must have seemed at the time ... Ingres' manner of drawing was as new as the century. It was immediately recognized as expert and admirable. If his paintings were sternly criticized as \"Gothic,\" no comparable criticism was leveled at his drawings.\nHis student Raymond Balze described Ingres's working routine in executing his portrait drawings, each of which required four hours, as \"an hour and a half in the morning, then two-and-a-half hours in the afternoon, he very rarely retouched it the next day. He often told me that he got the essence of the portrait while lunching with the model who, off guard, became more natural.\" The resulting drawings, according to John Canaday, revealed the sitters' personalities by means so subtle\u2014and so free of cruelty\u2014that Ingres could \"expose the vanities of a fop, a silly woman, or a windbag, in drawings that delighted them.\"Ingres drew his portrait drawings on wove paper, which provided a smooth surface very different from the ribbed surface of laid paper (which is, nevertheless, sometimes referred to today as \"Ingres paper\"). The early drawings are characterized by very taut contours drawn with sharply pointed graphite, while later drawings show freer lines and more emphatic modeling, drawn with a softer, blunter graphite.Drawings made in preparation for paintings, such as the many studies for The Martyrdom of St. Symphorian and The Golden Age, are more varied in size and treatment than are the portrait drawings. It was his usual practice to make many drawings of nude models, in search of the most eloquent gesture, before making another series of drawings for the draperies. In his early years he sometimes had his model pose behind a translucent veil that suppressed details and emphasized the arabesque. He often used female models when testing poses for male figures, as he did in drawings for Jesus Among the Doctors. Nude studies exist even for some of his commissioned portraits, but these were drawn using hired models.Ingres drew a number of landscape views while in Rome, but he painted only one pure landscape, the small tondo Raphael's Casino (although two other small landscape tondos are sometimes attributed to him).\n\n\n=== Colour ===\nFor Ingres, colour played an entirely secondary role in art. He wrote, \"Colour adds ornament to a painting; but it is nothing but the handmaiden, because all it does is to render more agreeable the true perfections of the art. Rubens and Van Dyck can be pleasing at first sight, but they are deceptive; they are from the poor school of colourists, the school of deception. Never use bright colours, they are anti-historic. It is better to fall into gray than to into bright colours.\" The Institute in Paris complained in 1838 that the students of Ingres in Rome \"had a deplorable lack of knowledge of the truth and power of colour, and a knowledge of the different effects of light. A dull and opaque effect is found in all their canvases. They seem to have only been lit by twilight.\" The poet and critic Baudelaire observed: \"the students of M. Ingres have very uselessly avoided any semblance of colour;  they believe or pretend to believe that they are not needed in painting.\"Ingres's own paintings vary considerably in their use of colour, and critics were apt to fault them as too grey or, contrarily, too jarring. Baudelaire\u2014who said \"M. Ingres adores colour like a fashionable milliner\"\u2014wrote of the portraits of Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Bertin and Madame d'Haussonville: \"Open your eyes,  nation of simpletons, and tell us if you ever saw such dazzling, eye-catching painting, or even a greater elaboration of colour\". Ingres's paintings are often characterized by strong local colours, such as the \"acid blues and bottle greens\" Kenneth Clark professed to \"perversely enjoy\" in La Grande Odalisque. In other works, especially in his less formal portraits such as the Mademoiselle Jeanne-Suzanne-Catherine Gonin (1821), colour is restrained.\n\n\n== Ingres and Delacroix ==\nIngres and Delacroix became, in the mid-19th century, the most prominent representatives of the two competing schools of art in France, neoclassicism and romanticism. Neo-classicism was based in large part on the philosophy of Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717\u20131768), who wrote that art should embody \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\". Many painters followed this course, including Francois Gerard, Antoine-Jean Gros, Anne-Louis Girodet, and Jacques-Louis David, the teacher of Ingres. A competing school, romanticism, emerged first in Germany, and moved quickly to France. It rejected the idea of the imitation of classical styles, which it described as \"gothic\" and \"primitive\". The Romanticists in French painting were led by Theodore Gericault and especially Delacroix. The rivalry first emerged at the Paris Salon of 1824, where Ingres exhibited The Vow of Louis XIII, inspired by Raphael, while Delacroix showed The Massacre at Chios, depicting a tragic event in the Greek War of Independence. Ingres's painting was calm, static and carefully constructed, while the work of Delacroix was turbulent, full of motion, colour, and emotion.The dispute between the two painters and schools reappeared at the 1827 Salon, where Ingres presented L'Apotheose d'Homer, an example of classical balance and harmony, while Delacroix showed The Death of Sardanapalus, another glittering and tumultuous scene of violence. The duel between the two painters, each considered the best of his school, continued over the years. Paris artists and intellectuals were passionately divided by the conflict, although modern art historians tend to regard Ingres and other Neoclassicists as embodying the Romantic spirit of their time.At the 1855 Universal Exposition, both Delacroix and Ingres were well represented. The supporters of Delacroix and the romantics heaped abuse on the work of Ingres. The Brothers Goncourt described \"the miserly talent\" of Ingres: \"Faced with history, M. Ingres calls vainly to his assistance a certain wisdom, decency, convenience, correction and a reasonable dose of the spiritual elevation that a graduate of a college demands. He scatters persons around the center of the action ... tosses here and there an arm, a leg, a head perfectly drawn, and thinks that his job is done...\"Baudelaire also, previously sympathetic toward Ingres, shifted toward Delacroix. \"M. Ingres can be considered a man gifted with high qualities, an eloquent evoker of beauty, but deprived of the energetic temperament which creates the fatality of genius.\"Delacroix himself was merciless toward Ingres. Describing the exhibition of works by Ingres at the 1855 Exposition, he called it \"ridiculous ... presented, as one knows, in a rather pompous fashion ... It is the complete expression of an incomplete intelligence; effort and pretention are everywhere; nowhere is there found a spark of the natural.\"According to Ingres' student Paul Chenavard, later in their careers, Ingres and Delacroix accidentally met on the steps of the French Institute; Ingres put his hand out, and the two shook amicably.\n\n\n== Pupils ==\nIngres was a conscientious teacher and was greatly admired by his students. The best known of them is Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau, who studied with him from 1830, as a precocious eleven-year-old, until Ingres closed his studio in 1834 to return to Rome. Ingres considered Chass\u00e9riau his truest disciple\u2014even predicting, according to an early biographer, that he would be \"the Napoleon of painting\". By the time Chass\u00e9riau visited Ingres in Rome in 1840, however, the younger artist's growing allegiance to the romantic style of Delacroix was apparent, leading Ingres to disown his favourite student, of whom he subsequently spoke rarely and censoriously. No other artist who studied under Ingres succeeded in establishing a strong identity; among the most notable of them were Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin, Henri Lehmann, and Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Amaury-Duval.\n\n\n== Influence on Modern Art ==\nIngres's influence on later generations of artists was considerable. One of his heirs was Degas, who studied under Louis Lamothe, a minor disciple of Ingres. In the 20th century, his influence was even stronger. Picasso and Matisse were among those who acknowledged a debt to Ingres; Matisse described him as the first painter \"to use pure colours, outlining them without distorting them.\" The composition of paintings, bringing the figures to the foreground and eliminating the traditional depth and perspective of 19th-century paintings, and flattening the figures presenting them \"like the figures in a deck of cards\", were new and startling effects, which were criticized in the 19th century but welcomed by the avant-garde in the 20th century.\n\nAn important retrospective of works by Ingres was held at the Salon d'automne in Paris in 1905, which was visited by Picasso, Matisse, and many other artists. The original and striking composition of \"The Turkish Bath\", shown for the first time in public, had a visible influence on the composition and poses of the figures in Picasso's Les Demoiselles d'Avignon in 1907. The exhibit also included many of his studies for the unfinished mural l'Age d'or, including a striking drawing of women gracefully dancing in a circle. Matisse produced his own version on this composition in his painting La Danse in 1909.  The particular pose and colouring of Ingres's Portrait of Monsieur Bertin also made a reappearance in Picasso's Portrait of Gertrude Stein (1906).Barnett Newman credited Ingres as a progenitor of abstract expressionism, explaining: \"That guy was an abstract painter ... He looked at the canvas more often than at the model. Kline, de Kooning\u2014none of us would have existed without him.\"\nPierre Barousse, the curator of the Mus\u00e9e Ingres, wrote: ...One realizes in how many ways a variety of artists claim him as their master, from the most plainly conventional of the nineteenth century such as Cabanel or Bouguereau, to the most revolutionary of our century from Matisse to Picasso. A classicist? Above all, he was moved by the impulse to penetrate the secret of natural beauty and to reinterpret it through its own means; an attitude fundamentally different to that of David ... there results a truly personal and unique art admired as much by the Cubists for its plastic autonomy, as by the Surrealists for its visionary qualities.\n\n\n== Violon d'Ingres ==\nIngres's well-known passion for playing the violin gave rise to a common expression in the French language, \"violon d'Ingres\", meaning a second skill beyond the one by which a person is mainly known.\nIngres was an amateur violin player from his youth, and played for a time as second violinist for the orchestra of Toulouse. When he was Director of the French Academy in Rome, he played frequently with the music students and guest artists. Charles Gounod, who was a student under Ingres at the Academy, merely noted that \"he was not a professional, even less a virtuoso\". Along with the student musicians, he performed Beethoven string quartets with Niccol\u00f2 Paganini. In an 1839 letter, Franz Liszt described his playing as \"charming\", and planned to play through all the Mozart and Beethoven violin sonatas with Ingres. Liszt also dedicated his transcriptions of the 5th and 6th symphonies of Beethoven to Ingres on their original publication in 1840.The American avant-garde artist Man Ray used this expression as the title of a famous photograph portraying Alice Prin (aka Kiki de Montparnasse) in the pose of the Valpin\u00e7on Bather.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nArikha, Avigdor (1986).

          "People, seriously, this place is incredibly awesome! We were probably the oldest kids there (we're both 33. On the outside.) but holy hell did we have fun. It's like Space Disneyland for children of all ages. There's life sized models of the Ariane V rocket, the lunar landing",
          "A very well spent day browsing through all the different exhibitions and outdoor activities. Well worth the money and great for families and groups alike. We got the chance to go into the planetarium to watch a short film about stars and planets which included a little quiz.",
          "Cite de l'espace is fun and educational at the same time. With all the exhibitions and activities you can spend the whole day there.",
          "We spent a great day out at this interactive space museum. We arrived at 12:30 which allowed us to get to the IMAX Apollo 11 documentary and the Planetarium interactive sessions as well as wander the garden of displays. The translation devices from the local French to English",
          "Well worth a visit to this museum, the exhibits were great, informative and very interactive with loads of activities throughout. Lots of different areas of space and science displayed with life size rockets and the Mir space station to walk around. Also planetarium and films",
          "We visited the Cit\u00e9 de L\u2019Espace this week and had an amazing afternoon. We arrived at noon and in hindsight should have arrived much earlier to take in everything this place has to offer. Educational for young and old, very fun for very young kids (especially space themed play",
          "An Outdoor & Indoor NASA space exhibition which are interesting and good information on exploration of the universe. Enjoyed the IMax theatre showing how Apollo 11 first Man steps on the moon. Many activities are available eg Antenna field, Stellarium, Astronauts Square,",
          "This large theme park has lots of stuff to see. Umfortunately, it is looking a bit sad and tired and is badly in need of a refreshing. It was far from busy during our visit. Not hard to see why. While the concept is still relevant, the way the material is presented is just too",
          "Cite de l'Espace will blow you away. The Mir space station was totally amazing. The whole place is fabulous. It's actually very interesting to see a history of space exploration, from a non-US perspective.",
          "It was a bit of a big detour to get there but we were not disappointed. We arrived just after noon and we had to rush to see everything during the last 'nocturne' of the year. Just just missed out on the astronomy viewing but it was no biggy. Seeing the Ariane 5 rocket",
          "I had been wanting to visit this centre for some time and took the opportunity when a friend and son came to visit. Positives: - easy to get to - available parking Negatives: - dated and tired looking attractions and displays - not kept upto date - need to make things more",
          "This is a very interactive museum, with lots of buttons to press and videos to watch which I think is better for children. I've always been interested in space travel and the best part of the museum is outside where you want actually walk through old satellites. Overall I was a",
          "This is a place that seems to have been neglected for some Times. Alltogether it feels old, worn, and tired. For visitors who don't speak very good french there is not much to do since very little is or can be translated into, for example English, especially when it comes to the",
          "Do you really know what the Ariane is? Aren't you curious to see how big it is and what the satellites look like... and the material that looks like tin foil on the first glance. I found all this quite mind boggling. Also the nearly 5000 satellites orbiting the earth making it",
          "100% recommend a day to the centre. A very hands on experience for all the family. The exhibition centre is indoors with lots of learning opportunities. Outdoors has a number of places to view. It is not a cheap day and you need to plan to be there all day.",
          "The place is more of an open museum than an amusement park. With guided tours and visits into real retrieved portions of space stations and pods. But it was amazing to see all of this. However, this is not a great place to visit for people who aren't really space or aviation",
          "An okay museum but somehow we expected a more. Maybe more spaceship to see and visit,? Soyuz was really cool. Some activities are really geared towards younger kids. Overall okay but not spectacular, fine if you are in the area but not worth the detour. Expensive for what it is.",
          "This center is actually a space museum. It offers a good mix of indoor and outdoor activities. Young children can enjoy some interactive some activities dedicated to them. This is really a must-have when coming to Toulouse.",
          "Spent a rainy day here recently, much of the attraction is indoors and luckily the rain eased up so that we could enjoy the outside parts also. We felt it was expensive to get in, so we arrived early and had the full day there to get the full value. We were quite simply",
          "I guess you get all excited when you get there because it sounds like it has lots of potential and lots to offer but you quickly realize that outside, there's not *that* much to see.... There's what appears to be a real-size model of an Ariane rocket (probably made out of wood).",
          "Spent an entire day here checking out all the displays outside (before it got too hot) and then took part in many of the interactive space activities. Went to the Imax theater, but not the planetarium. Really enjoyed the ground floor with its exhibits honoring the 50th",
          "Our friends who live in Blagnac recommended a visit here and we are glad they did. We spent a very pleasant time here and found the exhibits, planetarium and I-max theatre very interesting. We had lunch in the restaurant which was very good and overall we enjoyed our visit very",
          "We read the comments before goint on the trip, so we knew most of the activities were for smaller children, and quite a lot in French. So with that, we enjoyed our visit. First headed to the IMAX och Planetarium. Great according to our teenager+ kids (except for the pure French",
          "The museum is ok. You can learn all about the moon and other planets, as well as the astronauts. There was not something special there. You get to see lots of different thing that are mostly for children. AND most of the activities are in French. We really enjoyed the IMAX and",
          "A nice park with detailed description of lunar landings and other relative space stuff. Great for kids to learn about rocket and space technology.",
          "Good little venue to fill a few hours some great interactive this you the kids to learn, get there early if you want to fit in the imax and planetarium on the same day, we arrived at 12:30 am could only fit in the planetarium which takes about 50 minutes. So the imax takes 45",
          "It was somewhere to take our granddaughter on a rainy day, she loved it (age 10). We were able to enter an actual spaceship & experience the size of the living space & see how the astronauts coped with their day to day living. Lots of activities to keep the children occupied",
          "We were a party of 4 adults so did not use the children's activities which were numerous.So I'm sure children would be happy here as well. The range of activities and things to see was brilliant. I particularly enjoyed going into the Mir space station and the planetarium was",
          "As with most of the tourist attractions in Toulouse they are clearly aimed at French people- which is totally fine of course. It\u2019s just that when the entry fee is \u00a325 each it\u2019s a bit disappointing to not understand much of it. Must improve my French!!!",
          "Huge establishment in Toulouse. Fantastic set up for kids. Mostly all in French though some English information available. The Planetarium show was worth the line up. Interpreting headsets available on entry. Heavy security search to get in which is good.",
          "If you're around Toulouse, this is a must if you travel with your kids. If you're all adults, you may want to skip it probably as you may already know most of it already. But, again, kids will love it for sure, it's amazing for them!!! Take into account that all of the",
          "Definitely some cool exhibits. My wife and son are totally into space and it was absolutely worth it for them. My daughter and I aren't quite as interested but still found it worthwhile though I wouldn't go out of the way for it. Not everything was in English but there was",
          "We spent almost five hours. We used public transportation. Very easy to reach this place only one thing bust stop name that gave google map it changed(Tip 1: We used Ligne 1). You have to get off from the bus before Aerodrome stop. Walk through the bus direction. Pass the",
          "All speaks about Space and human adventure to investigate it. Very interesting and funny for children !!",
          "It is basically a permanent exhibition of space vehicles and items related to the space travel. There is one theatre showing a film about international space station. The shows and some of the exhibits have time schedule. So one need to plan your trip accordingly. Also most of",
          "Very good park with a lot of animations. You must plan to stay half a day to visit all the site. Films are also beautiful and spectacular !",
          "You could be forgiven for thinking that this is just a theme park, or a children\u2019s attraction \u2013 well, it is both of those things; but its a whole lot more besides, and is an absolute \u2018must-see\u2019 for anyone with any interest at all in space and/or space exploration. It\u2019s a geek",
          "Cit\u00e9 de l'Space is a theme park for children and adults located in the surroundings of Toulouse. Here you can learn about the history of the cobquers of space, see some machines and reproductions related with space (MIR, SOYUZ, etc.), go to a class about the space conditions of",
          "Having had the good fortune to have been to the amazing Technik transport museum in Speyer, I had high expectations for our visit to Cite de l'espace, but was left feeling underwhelmed. As soon as we arrived we were hit with the very high price for our family of 4 (I think it",
          "This site is a combination of real objects (pieces of the MIR station, a Soyuz capsule, etc.) with IMAX movies, planetarium sessions and then, a large museum full of exhibits. It's interesting for all ages, and certainly requires a few hours (if possible a full day) to complete",
          "This is an amazing place and you need to allow a full day here as there is so much to see and do. All the displays have English descriptions and the shows have head sets for English or Italian. Great for children and teenagers or any fans of technology/space. This is all set",
          "We loved our visit to the Toulouse Space Museum today but it\u2019s ready for a warming-up and a refresh. Yes, Mir was important but it\u2019s now many years ago. The observatory was very nice too but is it open at night for astronomers to use that beautiful reflector?",
          "We had a great afternoon exploring this wonderful theme park with lots of interactive sessions and learning opportunities for young and young at heart. Would recommend starting with either the planetarium or Imax show. There are several shows and timings are aligned to see both",
          "It is a nice place! Adults can enjoy it but i think its more of a family with children kind of place",
          "We travelled by public transport from hotel, tram to Palais de Justice, then Metro line B to Ramonville, then bus 37 direct to the road outside museum. Amazing public transport system in Toulouse, as it cost 1.70 Euro each way. It puts our London transport system to shame! (",
          "Great for spending a wet afternoon indoors. The planetarium and the IMAX are both worth waiting in the queues for. Wondering around the spaces is quite informative and they had a live band playing too which added to the experience. Quite pleasant way to spend an afternoon in",
          "Loved it but so glad I bought tickets online and brought a packed lunch. (You don\u2019t need to print tickets out or wait for them to come in the post as a previous reviewer has suggested - all you need is a smartphone) The queue to buy tickets was horrendous..... we bypassed it.",
          "Visited the attraction yesterday to kill time before an afternoon flight from Toulouse airport. Didn\u2019t seem possible to buy tickets online as it suggested it required the tickets to be mailed. Quite a big queue at 10:30 but we entered after about 30 minutes in the queue. The",

          "A single visit to this place is not enough if you want to enjoy with your kids. The price for the family for a 2-day is comparatively ok. Both the outdoor exhibits and the indoor exhibits are very nice - MIR Station, Teradome, La base des enfants, Playground etc The Planetarium",
          "This place is amazing. You can feel like an authentic astronaut. It is so interesting. I recommend it.",
          "As titled, this a very expensive place to visit and eat once inside. A lot of reading to do, a good percentage of the interactive exhibits failed to work and a lot of talking in French with no ability to listen in English because the hand sets also failed to work. Not the best",
          "We were a bit unsure at first whether to add this to our trip or not because we felt it may be more for children. But we were pleased to decided to go anyway. We would recommend that you plan to visit this for a whole day. We had to take the train back to our next destination so",

          "For kids? Not only, that's false. Really interesting and impressive exposition, different types of interactive, science and space labs. If you are curious and like to absorb information, that would be a paradise for you. The kids are amazed too so full family trip is even",
          "Beautiful place for both adults and children. So much to see, to learn and to experience. We loved the film in 3d which we could watch in English. We also liked the quiz game even though we would have prefered to have the English version of the questions.",
          "It had been more than 15 years since I went to the Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019Espace for the last time. I had mixed memories from my last visit, and I have to admit I was very pleasantly surprised. Our 2 boys (5 and 9) loved it. We spent an entire day there, and it was not enough... The kids",
          "Day well spent at the Cite de l'espace. Definitely accommodate a whole day for this, as it's very big and there's a lot of interactive spaces. Languages include French, English and Spanish. There are also live shows, which are only in french, but are still fun to watch.",

          "Great to see , we were lucky with the weather Lots of hands on for the littlest to try and keep us busy for the day Probably needs 2 days to check everything out? Second day is 5 euros extra? Playground seemed out of action on the day we were there Would love to go back",
          "It is an amazing open-air museum, with several items related to space. It is worth to spend an entire day there to see everything, or two if you bring children. The only negative problem is that some areas only have information in French, with no English translation.",

          "This is the best museum of space for the young and old alike . The awesome displays of the historymaking space stations , rockets , and the space suits and space journeys will enthrall you . The space station Mir and the other display are mind blowing . The French Space agency's",

          "Good mix of science not just for children but also for grown ups. Experience the IMAX to feel space living like you are, interactive physics science used in space technology is very interesting.",
          "Great fun for inquisitive families. Spent most of the day exploring all the exhibits. Imax and Planetarium both great fun. We ate at the main restaurant at a busy time and the staff, service and food were great. Would recommend as a day trip",

          "Wow, awesome space museum! With a lot of hands on and walk thru exhibits. A great learning vehicle for \"kids\" of all ages! We got there at opening time with only 1.5 hours for our visit. Bad choice! They had problems getting any of movies or IMAX features to work so we sat on",
          "It's a mix between a space theme park and a museum. With Ariane 5, soyouz and other satellites in a park. Inside there's some attractions like moonwalking which allow one to experience moon's gravity. A lot of expositions and attempts to interactive entertainments.",
          "Perhaps I've been spoiled by the Smithsonian's Air and Space museum (free and amazing), but I found this experience expensive and challenging to plan. Most of the exhibits worth doing and seeing are only done once or twice a day, and they often overlap with another activity.",
          "We went here for the day with all the family ages range from 55 down to 7 and there was something for everyone. We went on a really hot day so did not spend as much time outside as we would have liked but there was plenty to do inside. There is a lot to see we ran out of time to",
          "We thought this was good value. Extremely well presented with great 3D video. Great for kids as well. Get there reasonably early as we ran out of time. Could spend hours there.",
          "We have been here lots of times from when it first opened and there is always something new to see as it is forever being expanded. The planetarium show is a must. A sky full of stars as well as somewhere nice and cool with comfy seats after a day walking around and seeing all",
          "Cite de l'espace was a nice afternoon out. As someone originally from Orlando, I ironically cannot compare it to Kennedy Space Center, as I've never been. However, in comparison, I've been told the latter is better by those who have been to both. Nonetheless, this place is good",
          "More interesting than I thought it would be. Plenty to do, and see. The IMAX presentation was particularly good. Walking through the MIR space station was eye opening. Other exhibits include Arianne 5 and Soyus capsule. Only niggle was only the main restaurant open with set",
          "We spend one afternoon at the cit\u00e9 and would easily have spend more time without getting bored. The expo is packed with small and bigger activities that learn you the science related to space travel in a fun and informative way. It is also well suited to visit with children",
          "I remember visiting science museums and seeing one pocket of them devoted to space. This place is all about space. The place has enough activities for more than one day. We only had time for one day, but if you can go for two (the second day is much cheaper than the first).",
          "Definitely visit the space museum if you're in Toulouse, very easy to access on the bus, 20 mins from the main station, there's lots to see and it needs a day, the imax is great, but remember to keep your ticket with you as you need to show it for entry to imax the Mir space",
          "I'm not one to write reviews but felt I had to write one here after seeing all the people giving this place 1 star. Anyone who didn't enjoy themselves at Cit\u00e9 de l'espace need their heads examined. I am 32 years old, I went with my girlfriend who's 24 and my parents who are",
          "I went there for gala diner after the space exhibition. It has very interesting things like a real size maquette of Ariane, real size maquette of Mir space station which I went inside it and see all the equipment in it. I recommend visiting this museum especially for people who",
          "This is not a place I expected to be visiting while on a short break to Toulouse. This place was amazing for both children and adults. We visited on a bank holiday Sunday, leaving the city centre by underground a couple of stops then catching a bus for the short journey. I dont",
          "What an exciting trip! This amazing place offered a wild range of knowledge about everything related to space in 3 different languages (French,English and Spanish.) Not only educational but fun, Cite de l'Espace is suitable for all ages and a great way to teach children all",
          "Everything was included(IMAX and some other short film) in the ticket price. Nice place to visit with children",
          "This place offers everything you would expect in terms of information and interactive displays. Great fun for the kinds too!",
          "The attraction outside are really interesting. Inside, too much screen and few real hardware. Worth to go, but be ready to pay 25\u20ac / people Come at least at 1 pm, closes at 6 pm, a bit to early.",
          "There is a lot to keep you entertained, from satellites, conservation and of course space travel. walk on the moon, try out your stamina on the zero-gravity seat. Walk through the MIR space station. There are so many videos and interactive displays it is simply perfect for all",
          "I went to see an Imax film and loved all the space things , a very informative creative place to emerse in space",
          "I went there in november and it is a nice place to visit when it is raining. Most of the expositions are inside and are very well explained. I recommend it for kids too, there are many activities/games for them !",
          "I was there with my kids on Jan. 1st, knowing that most of all other attractions in Toulouse would be closed. Very good that the Cite de l'Espace was open. It was very cold outside, so we mainly enjoyed the indoor exhibitions, the Planetarium and the IMAX theatre (great that",

          "We prepared this trip for our kids as surprise and it worked. It was much more than we expected. They are offering all the experiments and informations about spaceship and outer space life. You won't regret ever your visit if you do with with your kids. It takes whole day to",
          "Information overload so you will need to spend at least 4 hours here. There is LOTS to see and read. Films are great, as well as static exhibits with lots for children and adults alike to do. Restaurant food was good and ok value.",

          "3 of us had a great day here. The tube then bus was easy and added to the excitement for our 5 yr old. Very impressive space stuff on display, especially the rocket and the Mir space station. Inside section also very good, 3 floors of hands-on activities and info. Bit of a queue",
          "This is a \"must\" day out for the family. Educationally brilliant by allowing all young at heart to experience the life of an astronaut and the likely future as we continue to find out more about the solar system and beyond. The real pleasures of this park are the interactive",
          "Not the largest park you will find but a great place for a day fun with kids all ages. Planetarium is aging and a bit boring but the IMAX movie is very nice and they have a large selection of activities to spend a full day there.",
          "Not that much choice inside the Cite de l'espace ... so you should be patient if you plan to eat in any of the park restaurants. Despite the wait the guys welcome in us was friendly and funny and the waitress was also very friendly despite the fact that it was 2:30PM of a",
          "It depends what you are looking for but this place is more for the children and teenagers and not so much for the couples. The best thing in it are the movies about the space which are made in a good quality and quite exciting.",
          "We stopped by here for a simple lunch before going-on the visit at le cite d'espace. Despite its tourist price menu, the food was quite ok considering it is a theme park restaurant. My baked Camembert cheese was yummy. Comfortable seat, nothing to complain.",

          "We read all the reviews and went hesitantly to see what we thought Some people have complained there is not enough in English which is. It true. I didn't see anything that didn't have a good English translation with it. It's a very intelligently designed, interactive way to",
          "We were disappointed by our visit, which costs a whopping 21 euros per person. It could be really interesting for both adults and children but the whole experience has been reduced to a very childish level. If you do decide to visit, the number 37 bus from town stops right",
          "We were looking for somewhere to spend a few hours after checking out of our gite and taking an early evening flight from Toulouse airport. The kids, now 13 and 11, had really enjoyed Kennedy Space Centre a couple of years ago and we realised we knew little of the European Space",
          "Cite de l'Espace is located about 15 minutes drive from Toulouse center. We went there on a tuesday in September. Parking is free and very close. There were no lines at all for buying tickets. For space lovers it is an interactive museum. Translations are provided for non french",
          "Took my 17 year old son here whilst the wife went shopping in Toulouse. We we're both quite disappointed. Ideal for school trips (for 10 year olds) but really...this is not a 'Space City'. Too many videos to watch, too many fake models, and not much more. Even the ''Rocket",
          "Not designed for anyone who does not speak French, but interesting nevertheless. Easy to get to from metro/bus. Lots of activities but timetable not well planned and we missed some events. Lunch was either a proper dinner or snack, but the baguettes had almost all sold out by",
          "You couldn't do this park justice without spending most of a day there, so when they have a hotel deal with free re-entry the following day it would be worth considering. Easy to buy your ticket on-line and then pick up your ticket at one of the machines in reception. Avoids",
          "We arrived at about 10.30am and stayed until closing time. Fascinating to see the Mir Space Station and various rockets up close. Not too big. Easy to wonder round and there are various seats and shade and a cafe. Indoor exhibition very good and interactive in parts. English",
          "This is a place for both space enthusiasts and kids, but be sure to have at least one full day if you want to explore it all. Pay a closer look at the program, since certain exhibitions are only open from certain hours. The price for the IMAX and Planetarium and all other",

          "Loads of rockets spaced around the park to see. Descriptions in both French and English. Inside the main centre is 3 floors of interactive displays. A little way out of the city centre but really good transport connnections with bus stop right outside. Well worth a visit",
          "Everything about space travel is here. History of how it started, rockets, fuels, what they eat, wear and some good hands on interactive displays. There was even a prototype of the Mir station and you get to try moon walking.",
          "This is an amazing and a place to learn about space for both kids and adults. But have many activities for kids",
          "Bring your kids there. It's an amazing place to understand how space industry works. A lot of fun for kids especially and things are well maintained. Only set back is the lack of information at each points.",
          "while the daily menu looked great, we opted for a hamburger and a salad with chevre. the burger arrived luke warm and the french fries were terrible! worst I've ever had. The salad was good but at 15 euro a bit over-priced. not that hard to make nor costly. the service was",
          "My wife and me went to this Space City in Toulouse a couple of days ago as part of a trip we were making in Toulouse. No information was given to us regarding lunch timetables as we bought our tickets at 11:00 am, only the times of the attractions and movies shown. We took the",

          "I visited Cit\u00e9 de l'Espace with my 3 year old daughter and it was very enjoyable for her, even though the main public would be of older children. The exhibitions are amazing and the information provided very interesting. We also had lunch at the cafeteria and it was very good",
          "Child at heart here, loved all-things space as a kid and this place took me right back to that headspace. The planetarium is incredible, the exhibitions solid (especially learning while you quiz-off against mates) and the moon walk was incredibly novel. \u20ac22 Euros and no extra",
          "Recommended in Toulouse ! Have a good 3 hours there, including watching imax movie on mars expedition. Go inside Mir, I loved it",

          "This park is a little out of date and could do with some updating. What is there is great to look at, climb into, wander through, float in and be thrust into(almost) weightlessness. The exhibitions within the main building are good and comprehensive. There is a fair amount of",
          "We visited this museum with our young children and everyone loved it! The kids liked pretending to be astronauts on the moon. We ended up spending a few hours there and never did see it all. The restaurant on site is also excellent so there's no need to cut your visit short",

          "We spent the day here and our kids (8 and 10) loved it! There were a lot of interactive displays, far more English than I expected, and so very much to see and do. With just the IMAX and planetarium shows alone you could spend 4 hours. The kids favourite was easily the Moon",
          "My wife and I found this place a bit dull but our 7 year old science and space mad son rated it very highly. All of the exhibitions within the park can be done within half a day. Informative but not much fun. If you have nothing better to do on a rainy day then you could",
          "We prebooked to avoid queuing but found that it got busier in the afternoon anyway. There is so much to see and do and it's very well organised. You can quite easily spend the whole day there and it's great for adults as well as children. If you are staying in Toulouse then the",

          "Reading the reviews I have expected more. It was allmost borring for my teenage boys. There was not enough earphones to hear the translation during the 3D movie. Interactive things are very simple. There are some interesting things about meteorology. It is probably interesting",
          "It is a theme park focused on space and the conquest of space.It is a one life experience. You can feel yourself out of time as you visit all the attractions. I recommend a hall day visit to enjoy all of it. Begin with the IMAX Theater and the Planetarium than go and enter the",

          "Essentially an indoor and outdoor science museum but we were impressed with the range of activities on offer and was a good laugh even for 3 girls in our 20s. We loved the iMax and the outdoor bits were great for catching some sun inbetween the science. Recommend",
          "The Cite de l espace is definitely a must to be seen museum among the numerous ones that offers Toulouse. Wether you are a tech fan or an history lover, the Cite de l espace is a comprehensive museum of what was the city's contribution to the space venture with companies or labs",

          "I was very impressed, very cool stuff to see there. Been there as a kid in 2000 but I would revisit anytime. :)",
          "At the first sight it seems to be small, something for no more than one hour. But if you left your kids playing with all the things and you try to explain briefly only half of the things, you will be not able to finish in one entire day. Deserves a specific travel just for it.",
          "An excellent collection of both French and European space agency history and spacecraft. With full scaled mock-ups of the Ariane 5 rocket, Mir space station, and Soyuz module you have an opportunity to see the size of these projects and read the histories and technical data. Add",

          "The entrance fee includes all the activities on site, which I think is quite a good price. It includes the IMAX and Planetarium. The displays are well presented with lots of great activities both for kids and adults to try out. You can easily spend the entire day there... We",
          "Good day out with the kids - there is a lot of read and learn, interactive games etc.. The 3D cinema was mind blowing but perhaps lost on kids under the age of 4years old. if the weather is dry there is a great play area outside. Lunch at the restaurant was ok nothing to rave",
          "All my local friends laughed at me and my husband for visiting this but it was good fun (if you like space). Only issue is that quite a bit of stuff is in French only, but enough was in english to get by. Definitely go to the IMAX show - it's included in the admission price and",
          "An exciting outing for the whole family; make sure to set aside several hours to explore all that there is to offer (and to get value from the entrance tickets). The iMax is very impressive for young (8 plus) and old. We spent the rest of our time with our children looking at",
          "What the place is about is really interesting: it is a place for curious people to discover by multimedia means the exploration of space and all things space related. However the entry fee is really high. Around 20 euros per person. You can definetely understand why : there is a",
          "Absolutely recommended. Since I was a kid I was always passionate about space and stars, and visiting the City of Space was nothing short of magical. Everything is translated in French, English and Spanish except for a bunch of video-documentaries but they're not necessary to",

          "The reason I have not given it a 4 stars is because of the entry fee of 24 euros . It is a good day out with the kids but ensure you have enough time to spend there given the entry fees. I would suggest more explanations in English as a number of our fellow travellers were",
          "Good place to visit with children. It is quite interesting but people taking care of the explanations only did it in french in most cases. 3D imax (Hubble film) strongly recommended. Park is clean and the restaurant is correct. You can enter food and drinks into the park if you",
          "Good day out, especially for children. Lots of interactive stuff/screens in main building and various space vehicles/objects outside. If you don't speak French you can get English & Spanish (may be others) translation headsets for Planetarium and Imax, though note that only",

          "The place is nice, the exposition is well organized and there are a lot of things to see/do. On the other end, the place totally lacks of showmanship and is way too focus on France (like all the french exhibits ). Considering the 24 euros per adult admission fee, i would say",
          "This tribute to the French contribution to international space exploration makes for a great day out. For those with an adventurous heart and wish to go where no man has gone before this museum tells the story form the first rockets to life aboard the International space",

          "We visited the Cite de l'Espace on July, and it was a wrong option. More than the City of the Space, it is a museum about the space, poor in absolutely every way. The really interesting things are all of them related to the NASA, but not for the ESA. You can find several",

          "On arriving here we thought it was quite small but it is actually not possible to see and do everything in one day. Arrive early as there is a queue for tickets or book them on-line before you go. The park was open only from 10 to 18:00 and there is quite a lot to do in that",

          "This was on our list of places to visit this year but at about \u20ac100 for our family of 5 it was a bit rich. We then noticed it was open until 23.00hrs over the summer hols and is HALF PRICE after 7pm \u263a. We went and really enjoyed it. Make sure you get the headphones for the IMAX.",
          "Cite de l'espace has it all to be a top attraction. However, the queueing procedure made people behave badly. Getting in front of eachother was common practice. The service at the restaurant at the Imax theater was poor. The food was getting cold, the guys behind the counter",
          "The mockups of the Mir space station and the Soyuz capsule are good fun. I certainly had no idea how tiny the Soyuz was. Everything else is a bit mundane, so the whole experience, as a package, is, to my mind, well overpriced.",
          "We visited here with 3 girls 6,3,2 and while we looked at the static displays (Soyuz/Mir/ powers of ten, the smallies were ho-hum. But once we got to the Ariane 5 rocket and the interactive build a spaceship/ be a spaceman/press buttons the 3 of them lit up and spent ages",
          "I visited here with my nephew and his friend aged 12 & 11. The exhibits in the main entrance area are all interactive and presented in 3 languages which is good as none of us speak French. Unfortunately some of the other exhibits are only in French which did detract from our",
          "I took my 5yr old son to Space City for a day trip & he absolutely loved it, there are lots of things for little people to touch & explore, I normally spend the day saying 'don't touch, don't touch', however I was pleasantly suprised at Space City as everything is so",
          "This is a great place if you or your child have a keen interest in space - if you are only vaguely interested you might be better off dropping the space enthusiast's off and going shopping in Toulousse. There is loads of reading information & interactive activities but none",
          "I went with my 16 year old son who is interested in all things scientific and we both loved our visit here. The air condiitoned Imax cinema with two presentations - one on near miss collisions with earth and the other on the far galaxy was a good thing to do when the",
          "Going on previous reviews we decided to eat there. Bad idea. Main restaurant closed. Snack bar closed. Other eating place in the planetarium, had tables laid for kids school party, only sold cold drinks (\u20ac3 each) and an almond muffin. English translation machines are old but",
          "Extraordinaire place! There are so many things to do there, enough to entertain you for a full day. Many interactive things, very well presented, for adults and for kids, you don't even need to have astronomy as a hobby to get captivated. It is also well suited for non French",
          "Not a bad place to visit, but I went as a business group so we had the place to ourselves. The stellarium was ok but the focus of the projection was not very sharp. Some interesting displays and rocket parts to seee and touch. The full size Ariane5 is impressive, I didn't get",
          "We went in February. Weather was cold but clear sky. Easy to find carpark (for those who drive). The place is separated by indoor and outdoor. We went mostly outdoor where the spaceship is. There is also a children playground nearby which is really good for the children.",
          "This is a must see if you have children who are into science - or maybe adults also . We visited with our two grandchildren 13 and 6 and they both had a thoroughly fun and yet educational time .The Imax and the planetarium are just amazing and the Mir space station , the russian",
          "Well what can I say? This was about the best day outing that I have had in a long time. I say \"Day\" because it was just that. It took us 7 hours to go around and we still did not see all. What we did see though is definitely worth every cent of the admission fee. Will definitely",
          "Cite de l'Espace is an excelent place to visit in Toulouse. Despite of being not so easy to get by public transportation is nice. Mir, Souz, planetarium and IMAX are the best attraction to visit. 4 or 5 hours is enough to see all if you are alone, otherwise maybe a little bit",
          "We were travelling home via Toulouse and had stayed at Campanile Hotel opposite Cite de l'Espace before but didn't visit. Arrived 14.30 and was informed they closed at 17.00, but the receptionist told us the most important places to visit and in which order, she was spot on and",
          "With a planetarium and an IMAX included you can easily spend several hours here. Many exhibits are interactive, some multilingual. I was not aware of how strong Frances aerospace industry was so that was interesting. Make sure to see what interpretive talks are also going on.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to l'Espace. There is so much for the kids and adults to do. The Planetarium is truly an amazing experience. We did simulating moon walking and learnt so much about the solar system.",
          "Great day out at Cite De L'Espace! We went along with our 5 year old son and 21 month old daughter and had a thoroughly enjoyable day. The ticket price wasn't cheap but you certainly got good value as an attraction - the site is huge and we didn't get to cover it all in the",
          "I had read some bad reviews about this destination and was worried about other travelers saying there was not a lot of English translation. But they couldn't have been more wrong. Not only did I have an audio guide, all of the descriptions inside the museum were in Englis. This",
          "We visited when we had a few hours to kill in Toulouse. Plenty of parking and no queue for tickets. Helpful 'animateur' at entrance helped us plan which attractions to go to. But the antiquated audio headphone system (about to be replaced - but meanwhile visitors would be better",
          "We decided to go to Cite de l'Espace first thing in the morning to have in time for the rest of the Toulouse in the afternoon/evening! That turned out to be a wishful thinking as usual ! Parked up easily at 10am and joine the long line for the tickets (expensive) and that took",
          "It's a great place for kids to be, with interactive displays and lots to do and learn for them. Plan your time there so that you can make the most of show times and minimize walking around (it can get very tiring).",
          "Very interesting with lots of exhibits and interactive things for kids. All captions are in French with smaller versions in English and German. The day we were there there were no headphones for English available (although there weren't many people there and hardly anyone was",
          "I suggest that you go in the morning and don't make plans for the rest of the day. We arrived around 1 pm on a very hot June day. Getting in was no problem since there were no queues and the staff were very helpful. The main building is air-conditioned and so it was comfortable",
          "A lot of interesting and interacting activities...from moon jumping to visiting the MIR station. Definetly to be visited once in Toulouse.",
          "recommended destination for traveling with the kids. very good educational vacation for the kids, and adults also.",
          "I was only there for an evening function, but would have liked to have had part of a day there to see all the exhibits",
          "Interesting for all the family, with interactive games, although some are now dated. Only problem is that there is long wait for the most popular games and exhibits and the children got bored. Good cafe and outdoor playground. Not cheap!",
          "Even for those not particularly interested in aeroplanes this is a really nice visit. You do need to book in advance and provide information regarding your dob and place of birth",
          "Good family day out. Plenty to do for teenagers up, probably a bit much for younger children (ours aged 2 and 4). The imax movie was good and it engaged the younger ones.",
          "This place is an excellent spot for those who are interested in the stars and galaxies and those with children. A note of caution, it is mostly in French - although you can get an electronic translator for the Imax show on the hubble space telescope. It cost us 56 euro for two",
          "Absolutely a must for families visiting Toulouse. Your kids will enjoy a lot of attractions about space. Very interesting the visit to the Soviet space station. You can also experience what you'd feel by walking on the moon!",
          "It was an amazing experience being strapped to this machine that helped mimic how I would have walked on Mars! The place a definitely worth visiting. Apart from the 3D movie and the Awesome planetarium. It houses several space crafts including the the Russian Mir. I also like",
          "I found it an average day out. The planeterium show was good. I think you would be lost if you don't understand any french.",
          "It's a great afternoon for families that don't necessarily want the crowds, noise and general excesses that come with a typical theme park visit. There aren't really any rides, just loads of interactive displays and a couple of simple but neat zero-gravity simulators. We live",
          "The park is located just off the A61, southeast of the Toulouse city centre with ample free parking on site. Entrance fee is about 20 euros but you'll need all day to explore all the activities so value for money. Lots of interactive displays and life size models. Things to see",
          "Put simply, there's just not enough to look at. Way too many interactive displays and not enough hardware. Not recommended.",
          "Lots to keep anyone interested. We spent 5 hours there and I'm not even that interested in space travel! Lots of interactive stuff. I recorded my own weather broadcast!",
          "This was a good place to take two 12 year old boys they really did love it. It does need a full day to explore everything especially if you want to see the shows. After reading bad reviews regarding the catering we opted to take a picnic. There is a good undercover picnic",
          "A magnificent place to understand the ljourney of space. Many interactive displays and amazing pieces. The most interesting hing is that it captures all ages and truly displays that space is a world thing not just to the Americans and Russians. Congrats to ll you must go there",
          "This was a good experience, but better if you had kids and wanted to give them a life sized experience. The headsets that they use in the shows are a bit hit and miss and mine didn't work at all. Despite that I still enjoyed the spectacular.",
          "Entry is very expensive though there's an interesting variety of exhibits. When we visited (a Saturday afternoon), the cafeteria had a very poor choice of pre-packaged food available. Disappointing and a bit lacklustre when compared to the NASA equivalent at the Kennedy Space",
          "The Cite de l'Espace is located a bit outside Toulouse. It is recommendable to reach the Metro-station \"Jolimont\" by the same Metro because from there the bus \"Ligne 37\" leads to the city directly. The city is a theme park based on space, the entrance is about 20 \u20ac and the",
          "A Nice park with several activities for kids up to 12. Good 3D movie, expositions and interactive toys. Cozzy playground with tematic toys. Restaurant with reasonable prices. If you don't speak French it will hard to translater to the kids.",
          "The Imax cinema with a film about the Hubble telescope was interesting and informative. So was the planetarium's exposition on the eight planets of the solar system - and the things to see in the night-sky today. There were short queues for both of these shows, but the park was",
          "I read many Tripadvisor comments about how \"bad\" is this. I could not disagree more. It was amazing. Not only for my son, who loved every second of it; my wife and I liked it very much too. We went to Toulouse because a travel guide said there were many amazing things. The",
          "I was surprised that this museum space caught the attention of 15 yo girls as well as 9 yo boys - even the parents were captivated. Plan to spend the better part of a day here.",
          "This site had a Mir space station which you could walk through. I saw the Hubble IMAX show which was excellent. There was also another show which I did not have time to see. Lots of exhibits and I thoroughly enjoyed the trip.",
          "Great museum for space lovers. Well-laid out. Full-size replicas of satllites, space station etc. Real moon rock. Interactive displays. But you must read French or all of the signs will be useless to you! Lots of things for kids to do.",
          "The 22 euro entry price might seem expensive, but there is a lot to see and do here, so set aside a full day or you won't see it all. The mock-up of the Mir space station alone is worth the entry price, but there are lots of interactive exhibits to interest all ages. Children",
          "Great IMAX theatre with 3D films. Real MIR space station training module, full size models of Ariane rocket and satellites.",
          "Most other visitors were school parties, but the children were well behaved. The attraction does have information in English, although it is limited, but it is enough to get an understanding. All the films are in French, but you can wear headsets to listen in English (this was",
          "Brilliant place for the kids and grown-ups- so much to do, so little time! Take a picnic and get there early to make the most of it. Check out the ticket pricing structure online first - we went twice in the space of 2 weeks and should've bought a 2 day pass probably. We had no",
          "This is a great place to visit for children and adults. I went with my husband just as a way to pass the time but ended up staying there all day! There is so much packed into what appears to be a small site. The IMAX cinema and planetarium are a must during the visit. I think it",
          "Good place for knowing more about planets in this worlds :) nice..nice..nice...",
          "Our boys like most kids between 4-10 love everything space, and their eyes nearly blew out when they say the mock up of the ariane rocket. The exhibits were good, but given we don't speak french we were given headphones and a player to help. The players were fairly usless in",
          "This place is one of the greatest museums I have been to in Toulouse, it is a large campus with many things outside. I have three kids under 5 and you can see the entire place in 4 hours if you don't try to look and understand everything. There is plenty of English translation",
          "Great for the family, very interactive and informative. Loads to do and the Imax is spectacular and so are the other shows. Only issue I found was the English language things (not sure what to call them, they hang around your neck and translate everything into English for",
          "It did not work without a guided tour. The exhibits look interesting but did not stir the mind of a 9 year old!",
          "Well worth the visit. A full size mock up for the mir space station makes it worth while. Struggled a bit with the language barrier. Not enough of the interactive stuff was in English",
          "If you are interested in things to do with space exploration or earth observation, then this is for you.",
          "We visited out of season so had the run of the place. Unfortunately the IMAX was hired out for a conference on the day we visited. A 2 Euro reduction was given. The internal exhibits were many and various. There are very interesting and informative videos and interactive",
          "We visited the place as a family (2 adults and 3 children). It is rather on the expensive side (80 EUR or so). Initially we felt dissapoointed with the place as it felt it was not offering anything speical until we went to the Planetarium. It is THE Place to visit. I won't write",
          "A good day out with fun and interesting activities. Appealing to both adult and child. If you are interested in space Cite Espace is worth the visit.",
          "This is the second time we've visited, the first being 4 years ago and we were just as impressed then, even when the kids were quite young. There is so much to see and do, and their audioguide for English speakers is superb. It's a must see.",
          "The Cite de l'Espace or 'Space City' was the reason I visited Toulose in July. I had read many reports on Toulouse but they just consisted of descriptions of sites such as museums,churches and historical monuments. I am a radio ham and spoke to a Cosmonaut' or 'Spationout' as",
          "We spent five hours at this space museum in 2006. Many interactive exhibits, with a lot of information to comprehend. One set of exhibits was closed, but it is easily worth the admission price. Get the tour on tape if you can. If you have small kids, make sure to visit the",
          "A really good museum - we spent around 5 hours there looking around everying. The ticket includes a 3/4 hour show in the planetarium and a visit to terra@sphere (a 20 minute wizz through the history of the earth from the big bang), with lots of other exhibits - a full size"

        "wiki": "The Museum of Islamic Art (Arabic: \u0645\u062a\u062d\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u200e, mat\u1e25af al-fann al-isl\u0101m\u012b, MIA) is a museum on one end of the seven-kilometer-long (4.3 mi) Corniche in Doha, Qatar. As per the architect I. M. Pei's specifications, the museum is built on an island off an artificial projecting peninsula near the traditional dhow harbor. A purpose-built park surrounds the edifice on the eastern and southern facades while two bridges connect the southern front facade of the property with the main peninsula that holds the park. The western and northern facades are marked by the harbor showcasing the Qatari seafaring past.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe museum hosts the restaurant IDAM led by the head chef Alain Ducasse. The restaurant is inspired by French Mediterranean cuisine. IDAM also offers master classes in cooking artisanal bread and raw foods. The museum has a park, workshops for schools and the general public,, and a library that provides information about Islamic Arts in both English and Arabic. The library also has nine study rooms.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe museum is influenced by ancient Islamic architecture yet has a uniquely modern design involving geometric patterns. It is the first of its kind to feature over 14 centuries of Islamic art in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf.\nOccupying an area of 45,000 m2 (480,000 sq ft), the museum is on an artificial peninsula overlooking the south end of Doha Bay. Construction of the building was done by a Turkish company, Baytur Construction, in 2006. The interior gallery spaces were designed by a team of Wilmotte Associates. The museum was opened on November 22, 2008 by the then-emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad. It opened to the general public on December 8, 2008.At 91 years of age, the museum's architect, I. M. Pei had to be coaxed out of retirement to undertake this enterprise. He traveled throughout the Muslim world on a six-month quest to learn about Muslim architecture and history and read Muslim texts to draw inspiration for his design. According to Pei, the light fountain in 9th century Ibn Tulun Mosque of Cairo was the inspiration.\n\nDeclining all proposed sites for the museum, he suggested a stand-alone island for the structure to avoid encroachments by other buildings in the future. It was built off an artificial peninsula, approximately 60 m (200 ft) off the Doha Corniche and surrounded by a somewhat crescent-shaped 290,000 m2 (3,100,000 sq ft) park. Pei requested that the museum spaces be designed by his collaborator on the Louvre project, Wilmotte & Associates, who then assembled a design team including Plowden & Smith (conservation consultants), Isometrix Lighting + Design (lighting consultants), and SG Conseil (AV Consultants) under Turner Projacs. Along with this design team, Leslie E. Robertson Associates was the structural engineer for the project.\nThe main building consists of the five floors, the main dome, and the central tower. It is connected with the education ward via a large central court. Pei utilized creamy limestone for the outer facades to emphasize the various shades during the different times of the day. The five floors are covered by a glass facade to the north, and it provides a panoramic view of the Persian Gulf. The interior of the building is decorated by several Islamic arts, and the large metallic chandelier hung over the main staircase of the lobby. Many elements found in Ibn Tulun Mosque are represented in the building as an abstract form. This enables the agreement with values and principles of the postmodern architecture historical trend which synchronize the modernity and the historical Islamic architectural identity.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe Museum of Islamic Art represents Islamic art from three continents over 1,400 years. Its collection includes metal work, ceramics, jewelry, wood work, textiles, and glass obtained from three continents and dating from the 7th to the 19th century.\nThe museum houses a collection of work gathered since the late 1980s including manuscripts, textiles and ceramics. It is one of the world\u2019s most complete collections of Islamic artifacts, with items originating in Spain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, India, and Central Asia.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "wiki": "Katara is a cultural village in Doha, Qatar. It is located on the eastern coast between West Bay and the Pearl.\nIt was soft-opened in October 2010 during the Doha Tribeca Film Festival (DTFF), an event that it has hosted ever since.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\n\"Katara\" was the historical name used for Qatar prior to the 18th century. Geographer Claudius Ptolemaeus referred to the Qatar Peninsula under the name 'Catara' in 150 AD and in the middle of the second century AD, in the Historical Atlas of Islam.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\nMany Qatari organisations have their offices in Katara. These include the Qatari Society for Engineers, Qatar Fine Arts Society, Visual Art Centre, Qatar Photographic Society, Childhood Cultural Centre, Theatre Society and Qatar Music Academy. The QMA manages the QMA Gallery, a public art venue in the village. The buildings and facilities at Katara were deliberately  arranged in order to reflect the country's cultural and architectural heritage.\n\n\n== Development projects ==\nDoha Bay crossing (also known as Sharq Crossing) is a causeway between 600 m and 1,300 m which will link Hamad International Airport with the district of Katara. It is set for completion by 2021.A 38,000 m2 (3.8 ha) project dubbed \"Katara Plaza\" was launched in April 2015. It will feature a number of retail outlets.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nKatara has an open amphitheater, an opera house, a multi-purpose cinema, a multi-purpose conference hall, a beach, and a souq. A museum showcasing the country's maritime heritage was opened in November 2015. It is also site of AlBahie Auction House.\n\n\n== Cultural organizations ==\n\n\n== Events ==\n\n\n=== Fath Al Kheir journey ===\n\nFath Al Kheir journey is a voyage organized by Katara management to promote Qatar's maritime heritage. The first voyage took place in the Persian Gulf from 22 November to 18 December, 2013. A second voyage was launched on 6 October, 2015. The ship was manned by 40 Qataris in traditional attire and sailed around the Arabian Sea, with the key destinations being Oman and India. The Indian ambassador to Qatar hailed it as a milestone in the countries' bilateral relations\n\n\n=== Katara Art Forum ===\nA two-day discussion forum for the arts was inaugurated in Katara in 2014. An annual event, the forum features international and local researchers who deliver speeches on topics such as the history of Arab art and Arab art groups.\n\n\n=== Aida ===\nIn October 2012, an event featuring Giuseppe Verdi's classic opera Aida was hosted in Katara's amphitheatre. It was the first opera to be held in Qatar. The Qatar Philharmonic Orchestra were featured in the opera, alongside at least 80 singers and 35 actors.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nCurrently, the underground Katara Metro Station is under construction, having been launched during Phase 1. Once completed, it will be part of Doha Metro's Red Line North.\n\n\n== Management ==\nDr. Khalid Bin Ibrahim Al-Sulaiti is the General Manager of Katara Cultural village.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website of Katara Qatar - Valley of Culture\nOfficial Blog of Katara Qatar - Valley of Culture",

Annual celebrations of national holidays such as Qatar National Day and National Sports Day are centered on the Doha Corniche. It is a popular tourist and leisure attraction within Qatar.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Corniche used to be an empty stretch of walkway in which the only visible edifice was a Sheraton Hotel, but development has increased in the 21st century with dozens of skyscrapers being built towards the north of the Corniche. The area's development is part of the economic boom the country has been experiencing and part of an effort to promote tourism, which was facilitated by the 2006 Asian Games.Many of Doha's most iconic landmarks are found along the Corniche, beginning from around the Museum of Islamic Art and ending at the Sheraton Park near the distinctive pyramid-shaped Sheraton Doha Resort & Convention Hotel.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe Corniche encircles Doha Bay, running for a length of seven kilometers. There are three main areas of the Corniche: the Corniche Park and Promenade, Corniche Street, and the Government zone.The Corniche Promenade and Park are very popular destinations for walkers, runners, skaters, joggers and others engaging in leisure and social activities.Corniche Street is a paramount route which connects Doha's emerging West Bay business district with the south of the city and Doha International Airport. It was formed following extensive dredging work carried out during the late 1970s and early 1980s which reshaped Doha's coastline.As for the Government zone, which commands a view of the bay, administrative buildings such as the Amiri Diwan are found here.\n\n\n== Nearby landmarks ==\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Note: visited during the day. Was perhaps expecting something abit bigger and grander, and perhaps if it was on the entrance to MIA park, then it would be more impressive, but its basically on the entrance to a run down harbour. Thankfully MIA park was a 10 minute walk away,",
          "Placed in the Corniche, the street near the beach and near the islamic art museum this monument looks unique and different but overall is not something so special. Just give a try since you have organised to visit the rest of the area.",
          "It is smaller than expected and does not stand out on Al Corniche. Can see it as one walk along the Al Corniche promenade.",
          "A beautiful attraction at night when it is a lot more impressive than during the day. The shell and pearl are a reminder of Qatar's glorious pearl trading days.",
          "Not very special but if you are near, just go there. The red traffic light for the pedastrians crossing the street to get to the pearl takes more than 10 minutes before or turns green. View is very nice there.",
          "The peral is a symbol of Qatar, no doubt. But the monument at Al Corniche St. is not beautiful, nor artistic. It's just shabby.",
          "This a monument to the old profession of pearl diving. Makes for a nice photo stop with the fountain in front and the city skyline behind.",
          "Frankly.. just a monument of a pearl. A bit worn out, not as pretty as it would appear from pictures, the bay behind looks nice but I think that's all. Perhaps in the evening with the lights on it presents better.",
          "I went there to see this monument, only because I collect banknotes and it is depicted in the 50 riyal note",
          "Not sure of the story behind this monument, but it\u2019s kinda cool. I stopped for about 10-15 minutes to walk around and take some pictures. If you have extra time, I\u2019d stop by.",
          "Husband and I wanted to see this so we stopped and weren't expecting it to be so big! There's also a beautiful view of the city behind it!",
          "The Pearl Monument was beautiful. The monument is situated to gave us a glimpse of the past and is surrounded by the backdrop of the beautiful landscape and vision of the future. The fountain was not working however, which took away from the grandeur of the monument. I will",
          "An interesting landmark that is the monument to Check out as you take a stroll down the Pearl. Across from many souqs so boredom won\u2019t happen",
          "The Pearl Monument, representing the historical pearl trade and pearl diving of the Doha Bay. This is located at Corniche street.",
          "Truly beautiful! Out in the middle of a desert area, where the heat is unbearable it is a very welcoming site!",
          "The Pearl Monument is a nice landmark for an evening stroll. You can walk into Show Harbour and enjoy the beautiful skyline. A basic restroom is located in the harbour.",
          "This cute monument catches the eye immediately when you reach the Corniche Road. Loved to click pics with the same",
          "The Pearl Monument may not be a place for a special visit, but if your strolling along Doha's fantastic Corniche down towards it's splendid Museum of Islamic Arts and the bustling Dow Harbour, then the Pearl is a must to stop at and admire it's splendour. It represents Qatar's",
          "This is an symbol of what represents Qatar's past primary industry. This changed with the introduction of artificial pearls and has now been replaced by oil and liquid gas as the corner stone of Qatar's revenue.",
          "I'm really surprised by the reviews being so high/positive. I really see nothing all that special about this. Sure it's probably not going to be in any other city but is it worth visiting no. If you just happen to be walking by then sure. But so many other things/places to see",
          "In 1994 my father told me a nice story about this pearl, he use to talk about how can something survive its worst times to be more shiny in the glory times I didn\u2019t understand till now I remember the worst days that the pearl been through and still it\u2019s like every time it dies",
          "nice place to take a photo as it the image of Doha, in front of the cornice but avoid weekend, will be crowded",
          "The Pearl Monument remains one of the highlights in the heart of Doha. Always worth a stop and a definite photo moment.",
          "Symbolic of the regions historical ties to pearls, it would help to have a bit of history set out on a board close by perhaps. Other than a photo or two, not much else to see at the spot.",
          "I am so delighted to have a photo taken at this Pearl Monument in Doha after my first one way back in the days where it was just built in around over 20 years ago. Today, this monument becomes a staple photographs of every passersby and especially the tourists alike. You",
          "This is the Monument at the start of the Corniche. So nothing more than that. You can just click some pictures and move on to Corniche for walk. But it is beautiful.",
          "It's a monument, nothing more. If I was not nearby, and passing it anyway, I would have thought it was a waste of time. So honestly, don't plan a trip there if not going for something else close by.",
          "We loved visiting this monument to the country's history! We went at night when all the colored lights of the city were on, and the cool breezes from the water flowed.",
          "Pearls and pearl diving are what laid the foundations of Qatar and a monument on the Souq Waqif coast is only appropriate. A giant oyster with a pearl in it stands on the promenade and makes for a good photo opportunity.",
          "It is just a pearl monument by the corniche, not sure what the hype is all about, located close to the souk waqif",
          "It faces a busy road, and doesn't really do much, but it's close to the area where you get the boats to the city and the Islamic Art Museum, so take a look if you're nearby.",
          "Just near the Doha cruise, the pearl monument is a site always filled with tourist. It is beautiful piece of art display just besides the sea line wherein the dow are parked for the Dow ride . From there, you can consider a dow ride which is a ride in a huge boat @ 15- 20 riyas",
          "Nice for a photo with the city in the background. Right beside Banana Island Port and across from the Souq",
          "It is a funny monument, but nothing special. Worth the visit just because you will be at the corniche area, wich has a very nice view.",
          "Saw this at night, and the pictures came out great. It\u2019s unique and only takes a few minutes to see.",
          "Not worth a special journey but you are bound to see the giant oyster and pearly as you travel along the corniche area.",
          "It was built there to remind the people of Qatar their humble beginnings. The main income of the country comes from pearl diving before oil was discovered.",
          "A lovely moment reminding visitors of Qatar\u2019s pearl history. It is right by the Corniche, so it makes for a great photo opportunity after a walk along the sea shore.",
          "This is a water fountain set next to a busy road along the waterfront. The waterfront is lined with traditional wooden boats with a backdrop of the city skyline. The photo opportunity from here is amazing.",
          "This sculpture is a fitting reminder of the history of the region. It is on the Corniche so an appropriate placement for a fountain. Not the most elegant of artistic renderings but no doubt the subject of countless photos.",
          "To be honest its nothing special , i passed this monument on my way to the museum , which is beautiful. Worth a visit and entrance is free.",
          "Quite interesting this monument. Think it\u2019s there as they still dive for pearls around The Persian Gulf. There are many jewellers in the area selling pearls. We walked passed it many times when visiting Doha.",
          "Qatar was known for being a pearling center. The fountain is on the waterfront not far from the Museum of Islamic art.",
          "Large scale sculpture of a seashell containing a pearl is an artistic reminder of Doha\u2019s former identity and prosperity as a pearl fishers harbour,",
          "Not much to do here other than taking a picture and stroll around where the traditional boats are. I would suggest taking the boat and go to the island.",
          "The monument is nice. There are multiple other things to see around it, so I suggest visiting it together with Corniche, market and Islamic museum. The view from the pearl over the waterfront to the new centre buildings is fabulous.",
          "A simple monument between the souq area of Doha and the ocean signifying the significance of Doha's pearling history. Much photographed, day and night. Easily found near the pedestrian underpass of the Corniche road. You'll probably pass it many times.",
          "I would hardly call the Pearl a monument but it is a good point of reference along the Corniche at the junction with the way leading to the museum of Islamic art. An attractive structure particularly at night when the huge globe representing the pearl nestling in its own",
          "For the locals, it seems to be a landmark but I am not sure if it is. What I know for sure it is a spot where visitors like to take a photo or two. It is preferable to come here late afternoon or in the evening to avoid the heat and see it with lights on. It represents an",
          "Situate on the Corniche, the great walk between The Islamic Art Museum and the New City District, this monument is a nice place to take pictures, day or night (when is beautifully luminated). What better symbol for Doha than THE PEARL? Hidden in the dark of the oister meat is",
          "Great place to visit when in Qatar... it has a lot of restaurants but most of them are a little pet overpriced so mind what you order...",
          "The pearl momument is not the very important thing. The beautiful pearl marina is the place to visit and walk it. Donotmiss it.",
          "it\u2019s an old monument but no longer a great place to visit in the city..few hundred meters you get a magnificent view of the city",
          "This monument on the Corniche near the city end is huge and beautiful.... cant miss and a great peace of art. Dont be mistaken as this is a monument and not the Pearl which is little man made island on West Bay",
          "Not much to say the picture says it all, not something to seek out, but a bit different from the usual street monuments.",
          "One of the many sights along the corniche. Ideal for a photo in line with the city sky line. Best at dusk.",
          "nice place to spend the evening with nice view, if you are going for a photoshoot its very good place.",
          "We saw the pearl in the morning but its really glow comes out during the night with the background of all the building's lit up and the the water works on.",
          "It is a must see in Doha. It's based near the Souq Waqif at the start of the Corniche. It's another don't miss in Doha.",
          "When in Doha you just have to seek out the Pearl monument......just watch the traffic as it's in the middle of a roundabout. :)",
          "On the way to Banana Island which is by the water we stopped off to view the Pearl Monument. It was lovely and great for picture taking.",
          "We came across this monument quite by accident! However, we were struck by its size, simplicity and beauty.",
          "Nicely made and very beautiful. you may stop by while walking on Doha Corniche or just walk to it while in Museum of Islamic Art (10 min away). I don't think there is any thing to do with it other than taking a photo",
          "The Pearl Monument is prominently located on Doha\u2019s Corniche - I used to walk past it regularly when I lived and worked here some years ago. The monument commemorates the Pearling Industry going back a few decades now. I walked past it after several years this afternoon albeit",
          "A sculpture of an oversized pearl in an even bigger oyster shell. If you walk along this end of the Corniche it will make a good photo opportunity given the pearl diving history of Qatar. I wouldn't trek out from the skyscraper city to see it though",
          "Knowing the history of pearl diving, this monument is very appropriate. It's not within the city but if you join a tour to the north, you will pass this monument.",
          "My husband and I were surprised to see this during one of our strolls in the corniche. It looks real at first glance! Great for a photo op souvenir!",
          "This is a large monument of an oyster carrying a pearl. For those who don't know, Qatar was once a pearl diving kingdom and Doha was not the center. There is another fort far away from Qatar which is abandoned now that used to be the heart of Qatar.",
          "Beautifully executed eye candy but nothing at which to marvel. It's easy to drive by the monument, slow down, take a photo and keep going unless you want to take a selfie - then you have to suffer the heat!",
          "I made the mistake of going there during the day, superhot to see just a sculpture. Better to go in the evening you can walk around the harbour and see the boats that take you around the bay or walk to the Souq Waqif. The sculpture itself has nothing special.",
          "I love this as a bod to Qatar\u2019s history and cultural past, and it\u2019s a lovely landmark situated by the water. Worth a photo opportunity.",
          "It's a sculpture, a representation of an oyster with a pearl in it. Obviously pearls are important in Qatar's heritage, hence it is only right to have a monument to the trade, but I am not sure why it needs reviewing.",
          "Like it and have had my picture take there on multiple occasions. One thing that is nice about it is that you can see it and walk along the Corniche which is a great walk in the evening after the worst heat of the day.",
          "This is a great part of town to get your photo taken. You will see the nice pearl and the towers in the background.",
          "It is a monument of an oyster and a pearl, which means that in old Qatar the pearl hunting was the oldest profession. it doesn't worth to stop there and spend time, you can only pass by a car and watch.",
          "Not much to say really- a large pearl inside a clam shell on the street. Don't make a special trip to see it. Nothing that exciting!",
          "This \"monument\" looks much better in pictures than IRL. Only worth visiting if you are already on Al Corniche walking to/from the Museum of Islamic Arts. Otherwise entirely skippable.",
          "\ud83d\udc4d I like it ... got for taking photoes... in winter time nice for walking \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d ... hope every body go there",
          "If you take the stroll along the Corniche you will stumble upon this next the harbour of traditional dhows. Nothing special but makes a nice photo with city line as a back drop as you can see above. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",
          "this is lovely at night when it is lit up, the area where this is located right between the national art museum and the suke at the start of the corniche. if you walk to the end of the main carpark ou can get a fantastic view of down town doha and get some nice pictures.",
          "Nice monument to take a picture, but that's all. It is near the Souk, in La Corniche, so you can go on foot.",
          "The place was under renovation. It is a concrete structure of a oyster with a pearl inside. Only a photo spot.",
          "When driving on the way to or from the airport along almost opposite the souk you will see the Pearl Monument on the Doha corniche in Qatar. Pearls used to be Qatar\u2019s main industry prior changing to what is now natural gas and oil making Qatar such a rich place.",
          "Is this going to change your opinion of Doha? No, but I'm glad I've seen it, it's huge, you can't miss is, very much a nod to Doha's past",
          "There is nothing special about it. I don't see what the fuss is. I am surprised that it is even listed here.",
          "Nice monument to take a picture of as you are walking beside the Corniche. The night views of Doha from here are breathtaking.",
          "It is worth taking a walk along the beach front and exploring all the sights, including the Pearl Monument.",
          "Such a big clam never mind the pearl. If you want to get a selfie with it simply park at either the museum of Islamic art and walk to it or you could park along the corniece nearby. You can also see the local fishing vessels in the area.",
          "A nice opportunity for photo, takes about ten minutes. NIce monument, located at Al-Corniche. Worth to see.",
          "Passed on my way to the market. Nice place however you can spend about 10 minutes and go. Nothing attractive around.",
          "Stopped by here for a photo opportunity. Highly reccomend for a nice photo souvenir of Doha. Try to go during cooler months.",
          "we passed by this Monument but did not find it attractive even for a stop photo. we just visited this for few SECONDS.",
          "See \"The Pearl-Qatar\". Conveniently located across from the main Souq along the Corniche. Commenorates the early pearl fishing industry of Qatar.",
          "Nothing to rave about, if you don't see it you haven't missed out Would have rather spent more time on the beach. If you happen to pass it take a snap but I wouldn't go looking for it.",
          "Its just a fountain/water feature, I don't feel its special at all. looks exactly the same as in the picture, its not all that big either. What is of interest though a short walk in one direction as you pass all the boats which are interesting in their own right, is a nice view",
          "Very accessible, the place was clean, the area is wide and it's close to the major tourist spots. Must have your pic taken here.",
          "This monument is located on the Corniche and across (a very busy road) from the Souq Waqif. If you are in the area it makes for a good photo opportunity.",
          "Interesting monument, but on a busy intersection, so the setting is not ideal for relaxing and enjoying being at the monument. Beautiful though. It was quiet when I visited, but there is not much room if there was a crowd. I'd recommend visiting early before car and people",
          "Good place to take photos with dhow boats and the Doha skyline in the background. Also an important link to the history of Doha.",
          "This pearl is located by the road. Can drop by for a photograph. It is right off the main road and traffic was high.",
          "This is an development that has won awards and certainly gained the attention of the world during its construction. Excellent location to get to the diplomatic district if you choose to stay outside of it; I have many colleagues in business who reside at the Pearl. A bit",
          "Well worth a visit whilst on the Corniche.It just depicts how the Qatari's lived in the early years of the 19tth to 20th century fishing for Pearls before Oil was struck in the gulf waters.",
          "This monument is a water fountain and is visited by hundreds of people taking photos. It celebrates the pearl industry of Doha and is certainly worth a quick visit.",
          "Lots of people pause here for photos. Nice monument in glorious location. Friday is packed and buzzing around here with workers day off. Rest of week pleasant stroll.",
          "We were not quite sure why this was here but discovered it when we exited from the underground car park. We had taken the route through the carpark to cross the busy roads from the Souk. Certainly good for a photo opportunity.",
          "A large pearl in its oyster shell. Seen from a taxi many times. A landmark in the city and a reference to the history of pearl diving in these parts.",
          "What is it? Why is it there? This just seems to be a water feature on the Corniche. The backdrop of the skyline is the only thing that sets it off.",
          "Certainly not something you should go out of your way to see, but if you're passing along the Corniche, you can stop for a picture.",
          "It's a stucture placed near the corniche. It's a pearl with water flowing around it. You can see it even while passing by.",
          "Nice monument near the entrance of Banana Island in Al Corniche road. It reflects the olden time of Qatar's history before oil discovery, where Qataris used to go for diving to look for pearl as the main source of life. Many people stop for photographs, and I'm one of them.",
          "Nice little monument along the Corniche in Doha. Great for pictures, but always lots of folks around and to be honest it seemed a bit trashy. But interesting monument to the pearl diving heritage of Doha",
          "Again one of those places that my driver took me to see, but nothin special really. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it.",
          "pretty enough - good for a photo but only if you're in the area not really an attraction that you have to visit",
          "This is a nice little statue/fountain when the water is running. It sits at one end of the Corniche, with the Museum of Islamic Art at the other. In the evenings it is a pleasant little stroll- lots of lights and music from the dhows lined up along the corniche.",
          "This little monument has a small fountain in it and is very close to the Islamic Museum of Art and Souq Waqif. If you are nearby, take a time to see it and make a time to take very nice pictures of you and Doha.",
          "I wouldn't really call this an attraction and nothing to go out of your way for! If you happen to be in the area and like large pearl monuments, go check it out... otherwise it's not worth going out of your way for!",
          "It's not a must when in Doha. Another architectural and funny element of Doha's park and Al Corniche Street surroundings. Doha skyline is much more impressive and worth spending time on.",
          "It's def worth a stop if you are walking the Corniche. A good reminder that Doha was all about pearls before it was all about oil.",
          "I have never heard of this monument before so I got quite a surprise when I saw it. It's very unusual but also very eye catching and attractive. Worth a look see!",
          "Nice and attractive monument of shell with white pearl. I gave 4 just for the poor choice of the location were the monument is placed. My opinion is that this monument should be at the artificial Pearl Island.",
          "Just a photo stop try to fit in when you go to the Dhow harbour as they are near each other. Be careful under foot as they are building around there",
          "During the day it didn't look much & at night it was light up. It was easy to find and have a look at as you can walk along the footpath to it. Lots of people stopped to take their photo in front of it. A bit more history at the site would be a good idea.",
          "At the exit of the Islamic Museum and nearby, there is a pearl monument that represents Doha. It is a fountain that has a shell and pearl located next to the sea with boats docked. To make a souvenir photo is fine.",
          "real pearl) nice pictures from that place..If you will go to Corniche you*ll see it. It is crowded place at night so go there in the morning.",
          "This is nice to walk past and possibly take a photo , which would not be easy with so much around it. It is howerver a record of the pearl fisshing that went on in Doha but I am surprised it was not in the pearl shopping complex.",
          "This looks much better in a photo than close up. I guess it's supposed to be iconic but it's located in a place that's busy with traffic and surrounds make it all look a bit tacky. Would be better sited elsewhere to give it more gravitas.",
          "The Corniche is a great place to enjoy spectacular views of the Doha skyline and if Doha Bay. Ther3 ar3 s3veral 8nteresting sculptures and fountains etc scatter3d in the gardens that make this a very pleasant 0lace to walk when the heat of summer has passed. This 3normous pearl",
          "This is one of must vist place in doha if your in the city, This is place on the cornish, You can enjoy the cool breze of sea during witer and relax here.",
          "I really have no idea why it is there but it is huge. Coming from australia where we like \u201cBig things\u201d this impressed me and took some amazing photos. It\u2019s right near the MIA.",
          "It is located close to Souq Waqif and is an Iconic Monument of Doha Corniche. In the evening it is crowded especially on Friday,",
          "Not worth going specifically but if you're walking the Corniche, you'll stumble upon the fountain. Just come from the Souq Waqif market unto the general direction of the water and you will not miss it."

        "wiki": "The National Museum of Qatar is a national museum in Doha, Qatar. The museum opened to the public on 28 March 2019. The building, which was constructed in place of the original Qatar National Museum, was designed by architect Jean Nouvel who got his inspiration from the desert rose crystal, which can be found in Qatar. The museum site includes Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al-Thani's Palace, which is the heart of the Qatari national identity.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe new National Museum of Qatar (NMoQ) features an innovative design by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel that is inspired by the desert rose and grows around the original twentieth century palace of Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani. The historic palace was restored by Berlin-based architecture and engineering firm ZRS Architekten Ingenieure. This important monument to Qatar's past is now preserved as the heart of the new NMoQ. The relation between the new building and the old building is part of creating the bridge between the past and the present advocated by Sheikha Al Mayassa as a way to \"define ourselves instead of forever being defined by others [\u2026]\" and of \"celebrating our identity\". The 430,000 square foot (40,000 m\u00b2) museum is made up of interlocking discs that create cavities to protect visitors from the desert heat. Located on a 1.5 million ft\u00b2 site at the south end of Doha's Corniche, the NMoQ building rises from the sea and is connected to the shore by two pedestrian bridges and a road bridge.\nOriginally, the museum was scheduled to open in 2016, but its opening was pushed back to 28 March 2019. Time Magazine named it one of the World's Greatest Places to Visit in 2019, citing the integration of \"immersive video screens and dioramas\" into Jean Nouvel's architectural design.\n\nThe museum welcomed more than 450,000 visitors in less than a year of its opening. The  museum attracts people as it depicts Qatar\u2019s history not through paintings and sculptures but with 21st-century lights, sounds and visuals.\n\n\n== Contractor ==\nThe main building was contracted to Hyundai E&C in 2011. The project involved the construction of the new National Museum next to the existing Qatar National Museum, which is located across from the Corniche. The museum is designed according to the Bedouin tradition of Qatar. It includes a building in the shape of a desert rose and a 1.2 million ft\u00b2 landscaped park. The project also includes a 115,000 m\u00b2 park with an artificial lagoon and parking spaces for 400 vehicles, a 220-seat auditorium, a research centre, laboratories, a dedicated food forum, two restaurants, a caf\u00e9, and two museum shops, one for children.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nA tour of the museum takes visitors through a loop of galleries that address three major, interrelated themes. The galleries are loosely arranged in chronological order, beginning with exhibitions on the natural history of the desert and the Persian Gulf, artefacts from Bedouin culture, historical exhibitions on the tribal wars, the establishment of the Qatari state, and finally the discovery of oil to the present. The displays and installations that explore these themes present audiovisual displays with carefully selected treasures from the museum's collections. These collections currently consist of approximately 8,000 objects and include archaeological artefacts, architectural elements, heritage household and travelling objects, textiles and costumes, jewellery, decorative arts, books, and historical documents.The museum's mission is to celebrate the culture, heritage, and future of Qatar and its people, embodying the pride and traditions of Qataris while offering international visitors a dialogue about rapid change and modernization.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Souq Waqif (Arabic: \u0633\u0648\u0642 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0641 S\u016bq W\u0101qif, \"the standing market\") is a marketplace (souq) in Doha, in the state of Qatar. The souq is noted for selling traditional garments, spices, handicrafts, and souvenirs. It is also home to dozens of restaurants and Shisha lounges. Although it dates back at least a hundred years, it was renovated in 2006 to conserve its traditional Qatari architectural style. It is often perceived to be the only lasting area in Doha that retains an authentic feel notably in reference to its commerce, architecture and culture. The area is very popular with locals and expats alike (especially on weekends) as it offers multiple dining options in the same location.\n\n\n== Location ==\nIt is located in the district of Al Souq which is situated in the center of Doha. As it was a market used for trading activities, the area used to be located immediately adjoining the shore to allow for boats to access it. Although still facing the water, the direct link to the water front for boats is now divided by a major road and the recently completed park.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe souq was founded at least a century ago in proximity of the dry river bed known as Wadi Musheireb. It was a gathering place where Bedouins and locals would trade a variety of goods, primarily livestock goods. However with the boom in prosperity in the 1990s, the Souq fell in decline and in 2003, most of it was destroyed in a fire. This event initiated a restoration program by the government in 2006, with the purpose of preserving its architectural and historical identity. The first phase of restoration was funded by the Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifah al Thani and his wife Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. Buildings constructed after the 1950s were demolished whereas older structures were refurbished. The restoration was completed in 2008. Traditional heating methods are employed by utilizing wood and bamboo imported from various areas of Asia.\n\n\n== Architecture and heritage ==\n\nSeveral streets that appear as mazes with no defined geometric pattern are characteristic of  these Middle-Eastern markets (souq). The Souq offers several small shops lined along these paths with a dazzling array of Middle Eastern merchandise from spices and seasonal delicacies to perfumes, jewellery, clothing and handicrafts. Traditional music, art and cultural shows add to the ambience of this historic place.\nLow-rise buildings, generally only single-storied are a peculiar characteristic of Qatari Architecture. This is in keeping with regional planning principles and then available local materials such as bamboo, mud (soil) and palm fond (leaves of the date palm tree). All buildings in this market are rough plastered and small openings face the streets (generally faced a courtyard in former residential buildings). Wind towers were used in residential buildings and one such property exists at one end of the market.\nPost renovations in the last decade, 2 underground parking lots for over 3000 cars have been added. In addition to the main square that faces the park and waterfront, a new square has been added around the center of the whole development. Water features to allow for climate control seem to be planned at the new square also.\n\n\n== Tourism and attractions ==\n\nThe souq is considered one of the best location for tourists within Doha. Thousands of people from across the region frequent it to purchase traditional goods. It hosts several art galleries, events and local concerts.\nA yearly spring festival around April hosts many theatricals, acrobatics and musical performances. An event featuring WWE wrestlers, called Souq Waqif Storm, attracted the most spectators. There was discussion over the possibility of a repeat festival.\n\n\n== Pet area ==\n\nThere are pet stalls in Souq Waqif which sell a variety of domestic pets, including dogs, cats, rabbits, turtles and birds. The sub-par living conditions of the pets has been the subject of advocacy campaigns in recent years, with proponents arguing that the animals suffer from a lack of proper healthcare and exposure to adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, some customers allege that stall owners falsify vaccination records. There is also a separate area in the souq reserved for falcon handling. The Bird souq, as it's called, sells not only falcons but also the needed accessories such as landing pads and GPS guidance systems for the birds. Within the vicinity is also a Falcon Hospital.\n\n\n== Al Rayyan Theatre ==\nA 980-seat indoor theatre known as Al Rayyan Theatre is located in the souq.\n\n\n== Souq Waqif Art Centre ==\n\nThe Souq Waqif Art Centre is located close to the Fish Market. The Centre combines a selection of small and artistic shops with a number of exhibition rooms laid out around a long narrow courtyard. Outside the rooms lie sculptures and chests inlaid with turtle shell.\nExhibitions have included The Islamic Arts exhibition, with displays of ancient calligraphy, some dating back centuries, and displays of carpets and photography.\nThe Souq Waqif was used as a filming location for a number of films screened at the Doha Tribeca Film Festival 2009, including the action film 'Dohard' directed by Dean Alexandrou and Masato Riesser, and produced by Waheed Khan, and 'The Haggler' directed and produced by the DTFF.\n\n\n== Souq Waqif boutique hotels ==\nA collection of 9 uniquely stylized hotels form part of the market. These properties are spread across the main development and offer varied features from traditional to fairly modern. The properties are unique in their offering and highlight local aesthetics and character. A series of old houses have also been combined to showcase life in courtyard houses in Qatar. Some of the properties offer unique sea facing views with the unobstructed skyline of Doha across the harbour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe official Website of Souq Waqif Art Center",

        "wiki": "The Museum of Islamic Art (Arabic: \u0645\u062a\u062d\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u064a\u200e, mat\u1e25af al-fann al-isl\u0101m\u012b, MIA) is a museum on one end of the seven-kilometer-long (4.3 mi) Corniche in Doha, Qatar. As per the architect I. M. Pei's specifications, the museum is built on an island off an artificial projecting peninsula near the traditional dhow harbor. A purpose-built park surrounds the edifice on the eastern and southern facades while two bridges connect the southern front facade of the property with the main peninsula that holds the park. The western and northern facades are marked by the harbor showcasing the Qatari seafaring past.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\nThe museum hosts the restaurant IDAM led by the head chef Alain Ducasse. The restaurant is inspired by French Mediterranean cuisine. IDAM also offers master classes in cooking artisanal bread and raw foods. The museum has a park, workshops for schools and the general public,, and a library that provides information about Islamic Arts in both English and Arabic. The library also has nine study rooms.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe museum is influenced by ancient Islamic architecture yet has a uniquely modern design involving geometric patterns. It is the first of its kind to feature over 14 centuries of Islamic art in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf.\nOccupying an area of 45,000 m2 (480,000 sq ft), the museum is on an artificial peninsula overlooking the south end of Doha Bay. Construction of the building was done by a Turkish company, Baytur Construction, in 2006. The interior gallery spaces were designed by a team of Wilmotte Associates. The museum was opened on November 22, 2008 by the then-emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad. It opened to the general public on December 8, 2008.At 91 years of age, the museum's architect, I. M. Pei had to be coaxed out of retirement to undertake this enterprise. He traveled throughout the Muslim world on a six-month quest to learn about Muslim architecture and history and read Muslim texts to draw inspiration for his design. According to Pei, the light fountain in 9th century Ibn Tulun Mosque of Cairo was the inspiration.\n\nDeclining all proposed sites for the museum, he suggested a stand-alone island for the structure to avoid encroachments by other buildings in the future. It was built off an artificial peninsula, approximately 60 m (200 ft) off the Doha Corniche and surrounded by a somewhat crescent-shaped 290,000 m2 (3,100,000 sq ft) park. Pei requested that the museum spaces be designed by his collaborator on the Louvre project, Wilmotte & Associates, who then assembled a design team including Plowden & Smith (conservation consultants), Isometrix Lighting + Design (lighting consultants), and SG Conseil (AV Consultants) under Turner Projacs. Along with this design team, Leslie E. Robertson Associates was the structural engineer for the project.\nThe main building consists of the five floors, the main dome, and the central tower. It is connected with the education ward via a large central court. Pei utilized creamy limestone for the outer facades to emphasize the various shades during the different times of the day. The five floors are covered by a glass facade to the north, and it provides a panoramic view of the Persian Gulf. The interior of the building is decorated by several Islamic arts, and the large metallic chandelier hung over the main staircase of the lobby. Many elements found in Ibn Tulun Mosque are represented in the building as an abstract form. This enables the agreement with values and principles of the postmodern architecture historical trend which synchronize the modernity and the historical Islamic architectural identity.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nThe Museum of Islamic Art represents Islamic art from three continents over 1,400 years. Its collection includes metal work, ceramics, jewelry, wood work, textiles, and glass obtained from three continents and dating from the 7th to the 19th century.\nThe museum houses a collection of work gathered since the late 1980s including manuscripts, textiles and ceramics. It is one of the world\u2019s most complete collections of Islamic artifacts, with items originating in Spain, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, India, and Central Asia.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes ==",

Established in 2010, it is considered to be among the most important cultural attractions in the country.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMathaf opened in December 2010 in a temporary building in the Qatar Foundation's Education City in Doha, transformed by the French architect Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bodin. Mathaf (\u0645\u062a\u062d\u0641 in Arabic) translates to \"museum\". The initial collection was gathered by Sheikh Hassan bin Mohammed Al Thani, and QMA provided the conditions of conservation as a public institution chaired by Sheikha Al-Mayassa Al Thani. Moroccan curator Abdellah Karroum is the director of Mathaf since 2013.\n\n\n== Collection ==\n\nThe 5,500-square-meter (59,000-square-foot) museum, located in a former school building in Doha\u2019s Education City, has a collection of more than 9,000 artworks, as communicated in 2014, that offers a rare comprehensive overview of modern Arab art, representing the major trends spanning from the 1840s to the present. The collection was donated by Sheikh Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani to Qatar Foundation, and was later acquired by Qatar Museums Authority. It is thought to be one of the largest collections of Arab-produced paintings and sculptures in the world. Qatar Museums Authority chairwoman, Sheikha Al-Mayassa Al Thani, stated upon the opening of Mathaf in 2010 that, \"[...] we are making Qatar the place to see, explore and discuss the creations of Arab artists of the modern era and of our own time.\"\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nMathaf permanent collection exhibition occupies seven galleries in the upper floor, while the atrium and five galleries are dedicated to temporary exhibitions.  The museum looks at major modern and contemporary movements represented in the collection. Mathaf opened on 30 December 2010 with an exhibition called Sajjil, which means \"act of recording\" in Arabic, and featured a cross-section of Arab art over the previous 100 years. Simultaneously, the museum hosted Interventions (an exhibition of new commissions by five pivotal modernist Arab artists (Dia Azzawi, Farid Belkahia, Ahmed Nawar, Ibrahim el-Salahi and Hassan Sharif) and Told/Untold/Retold, an ambitious exhibition of new commissions by twenty-three contemporary Arab artists.Mathaf's following exhibition, Cai Guo-Qiang: Saraab, ran from 5 December 2011 to 26 May 2012. The first solo show to be organized by the museum, Cai Guo-Qiang: Saraab showcased more than fifty works, including seventeen newly commissioned artworks, by the renowned contemporary artist Cai Guo-Qiang. Saraab (\"mirage\") re-imagined historical relations between China and the Persian Gulf region and reaffirmed Mathaf's commitment to presenting a unique Arab perspective on modern and contemporary art. The exhibition opened with Cai Guo-Qiang's largest ever daytime explosion event, Black Ceremony.Tea with Nefertiti: the Making of the Artwork by the Artist, the Museum and the Public was held from November 2012 to March 2013. Through revisiting the contested histories of how Egyptian collections have been amassed by numerous museums from the 19th century onwards, this exhibition brings together antiquities, modernist works, archives and 26 international contemporary artists and artist collectives.Other exhibitions organized by Mathaf include:\n\n\"Forever Now: Five Anecdotes from the Permanent Collection\", which features new readings based on the works of five artists from Mathaf\u2019s permanent collection.\n\"Selections from the Collection\", conceived by the curatorial team of Mathaf.\n\"Khatt And After\", which includes work from the permanent Collection of Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art.\n\"Adel Abdessemed: L'age d'or\", curated by Pier Luigi Tazzi, November 2013 to January 2014.\n\"Magdi Mostafa: Sound Element\", Project Space, Mathaf, 2013.\n\"Mathaf Permanent Collection: Paintings, sculptures and projects garden\", December 2013 to February 2014.\n\"Mona Hatoum: Turbulence\", 2014.\n\"Manal AlDowayan: Crash\", 2014, curated by Laura Barlow.\n\"Etel Adnan In All Her Dimensions\", 2014, curated by Hans Ulrich Obrist.\n\"The Closest I've Ever Come to a Scientific Experiment\", by Ghadah Alkandari, curated by Ala Younis, 2014.\n\"Shirin Neshat: Afterwards\", curated by Abdellah Karroum, November 2014 to February 2015.\n\"Wael Shawky: Crusades and Other Stories\", 2015, curated by Abdellah Karroum.\nDia Azzawi: A Retrospective (from 1963 until tomorrow), curated by Catherine David, 2016.\nRaqs Media Collection, curated by Laura Barlow, 2019.\n\n\n== Education initiatives ==\nMathaf offers supervised tours of the premises to visitors in addition to organizing educational activities and offering art classes.

          "We had a very enjoyable visit, viewing some interesting modern art in a very quiet location (there were no more than a dozen other visitors there on a Thursday early afternoon). The location is a bit out of the way but if you take the metro to Education City metro station there",

          "I spent an expensive taxi ride trying to find the place as the driver had no clue plus it's right in the middle of a hot and dusty building site that seems to stretch for miles. Once I got there, I realised that there was no way I would ever get a taxi back and it would be too",

          "Relatively small, and somewhat remote, but certainly worthwhile. There was no temporary exhibition unfortunately when we were there, otherwise we could gave seen something more. Very quiet; I think we were the only visitors when we arrived on Saturday afternoon around 14:00hrs.",
          "I love this museum! It is far away from the center, but you can take a shuttle bus from the MIA on the hour every hour and back. This museum has a large collection of modern arabic art and organizes rotating exhibitions on a specific theme. There is a small cafeteria and museum",
          "The museum is amazing, but the constructions around it, made so difficult to get in. Take care about traffic jams in the neighborhood.",

          "This was far from city center, and hard to find,but we were interested to see what modern art they have on display. It had some history and a small permanent collection. It wasn't what we expected because Qatar is known as a big buyer in the contemporary art market. The",
          "Mathraf isnt easy to get to, but I'm so glad that I made the effort. The permanent exhibition is fascinating and the works quite varied. There are often solo exhibitions featuring artists in the permanent collection. Mathraf's gift store is also full of interesting pieces that",
          "This out of the way art museum is worth a visit despite being a little hard. It has a small permanent collection as well as a timeline of the history of Qatar. The exhibition was very interesting and gave a different light to Turkey and the time of the Crusades.",
          "This is the biggest contemporary art collectino of the Arab countries. It is a superb museum with a fantastic library - see the walls made of books...and a small but well stocked museum shop",
          "Limited collection of art, which is really hard to access given the out of way location of the museum....Tossup whether it is worth a visit or not...",
          "Mathaf Museum of Modern Art is a gorgeous museum showcasing spectacular sculpture, paintings and installations. I was most taken by their sculpture collection especially the pieces in the forecourt. It's a wee bit far and hard to find but a worthwhile trip. Also has a nice cafe",
          "The pink bus between MIA and Mathaf is so convenient and free. Mathaf holds different exhibitions and all of them have been worthwhile. Its a must see.",
          "Please if someone who stays long time in Doha did't visit this museum yet. Go and do it! Specially art lovers- exhibitions are really interesting and not common that we get use to see, special touch of Arabic Modern Art. Visited last time exhibition - kind of video art of",
          "This place may be hard to find, but it's worth it. Truly world class standard, and much more than I'd expected. Do yourself a favour and take the free bus on offer from the MIA, as it looks like the area around will be under construction for some time and roads in and out will",
          "Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art is located inside Education City- Qatar Foundation. Its close to Sidra School inside Education City.",
          "They have some beautiful exhibitions with really interesting pieces, however, not very well advertised and in a very strange location on the way out of Doha",
          "... and there it is! A must see, if you like modern arts and paintings in the arab world. A quiet place in Qatar Foundation district, you should enjoy! Do not miss the shop with sometimes \"funny\" trendy souvenirs :-)",
          "We finally went today to the Mathaf to see Wael Shawky: Crusades and Other Stories. The exhibition was really nice and we loved the work of this wonderful artist! However, getting there was a disaster. It was my first visit and there was many constructions happening inside of",

          "They've really done a good here. The installations are generally very interesting and varied. The other mathaf building near museum of Islamic art can be awesome, depending on who the resident is.",
          "Its all happening there in the middle of the chaos and construction of Education City, you will find a true oasis of Art not to be missed! It is impressive and inspirational with a variety of pieces sure to please everyone. Look closely for the Khalil Gibran pencil drawing",
          "I took the free bus from the Museum of Islamic Art to the Mathaf. This was very convenient. The museum houses some very interesting art, however, building work is still ongoing and the exhibits are not well laid out yet. When completed, I think it will be a very nice attraction.",
          "A great place to remind you that Qatar does NOT have any history. Everything imported. A good place to meet up for a coffee though! Great looking building inside out. That's it though, sadly.",
          "Pretty cool museum but very small. It's modern art so prepare yourself for confusion and booji-ness. Don't expect much, but some pieces may surprise you.",
          "I love this museum for their fresh style, ever changing installations, and community outreach to all ages of the public. A great place to indulge your impulse for art. The traffic pattern is challenging due to construction but worth figuring out for a visit.",
          "The sterility of this museum was a bit lost on me, but maybe it's to highlight the art. I very much enjoyed my tour, but I was a bit offput by the multitude of security guards. We had a tour guide that asked us how certain pieces made us feel...I enjoyed hearing the stories but",
          "I visited on March 1, 2015. Permanent collection has some very interesting powerful works. I was most interested in the pieces from the 1950s and 60's. I enjoyed the visit.",
          "This museum is right out of the city and has a permanent exhibition of Arabic art from the last 100 years or so. Slightly odd location in the middle of lots of building work, very quiet inside. Interesting exhibits and they give out a little booklet with pictures of all the art",
          "Beautiful architecture, very well presented. A great Arab museum, with lots of history. Luckily not many people around, so it was pleasant and quiet.",
          "I am a regular visitor at Mathaf always on the lookout for their new exhibitions on the ground floor. The management and curators do an excellent job of bringing unique pieces of art that resonate with the region's complex history, people and cultures. As others have mentioned,",
          "Not very interesting . Shame as it's a lovely new building .Had coffee afterwards and service very poor , young lad very slow and didn't seem well trained .Really not much to see overall .",
          "It took me longer to find it than to visit it. Construction all around and no directional signage. This is probably why few people in Doha seem to know it. Signage inside also poor. Reasonable collection of artwork but plenty of empty space. It would be interesting to visit it",
          "I like very easy to reach there and only one matter some time we can't get more information.Lot of old art and encient things are kept in museum and we can get more knowlede about previous life style",
          "Modern art is still grwoing in the middle east , i see this museme as a starting point, it encourages others to followe. Saying so,the management needs to publise it more as its not yet known as an attraction of Doha.",
          "Contemporary art exhibitions, inspiring art by Arab women from around the globe (a needed an noble pursuit) , artist involvement in each exhibition, great place to bring college students for some much-needed inspiration.",
          "Mathaf is an interesting building in the middle of the building site that once will be Education city. Almost impossible to find, no wonder that few visitors are to be seen, even if there is a free shuttle bus from the MIA. Good for those with a special interest for modern art.",
          "I combined a visit to the Museum of Islsmic Art (MIA) with a visit to MUTHAF. The building and grounds are lovely. I am not really a great fan of all modern art (paintings) so I did not go expecting to be wowed it was worth the visit. I stayed for just over an hour and",

          "Difficult to find, in the middle of a building site, no signs - all this makes for a tricky adventure - so... until this is all sorted, I recommend that one should only go when there is an exhibition. The actual building is incredible and most certainly a first among equals at",

          "The cafe is simple and does sandwiches, pasta and hot drinks etc. It is useful if you happen to be at the museam but wouldn't make a trip out specially. My site office is next door so is useful for a lunchtime fix.",

          "We enjoyed our visit to Mathaf. It's a little hidden away in Education City, and takes a while to find, especially with the lack of signage. However once in the museum, you realise that much thought has been put into the displays, and the background information given for each",

        "wiki": "Msheireb Downtown Doha is a planned city in Doha, Qatar being constructed in place of the current district of Mushayrib. Initial construction began in January 2010. Located in the downtown area of Qatar's capital city, it is set to occupy 310,000 sq m with the total cost of construction amounting to approximately $5.5 billion. It was launched in six phases by Msheireb Properties, a subsidiary of Qatar Foundation.The project is a flagship project for Msheireb Properties, and aims to preserve the historical downtown area of Doha.\n\n\n== Project overview ==\nMsheireb means \u2018a place to drink water\u2019 in Arabic. It is a QR20 billion (US$5.5 billion, \u20ac4.18 billion) project, covering an area of 31 hectares (77 acres) (310,000 square metres) offering a maximum floor space quantum of 764,176 square metres.\n\n\n== Construction phases ==\nThe city has six construction phases: Phase 1A, Phase 1B, Phase 1C, Phase 2, Phase 3 and Phase 4.Phase 1A's contract was awarded to a consortium consisting of Hyundai Engineering & Construction and Hamad Bin Khalid Contracting Company.Phase 1B began in December 2011, and Carillion and Qatar Building Company were selected as the main contractors. In January 2018, Carillion's UK business went into liquidation blaming its collapse on problem contracts including the Msheireb Downtown Doha project, where the company claimed it was owed \u00a3200m - former CEO Richard Howson said he felt like \"a bailiff\" in chasing the debt. However, this claim was quickly disputed by Msheireb Properties, who said it had continued to pay Carillion but Carillion did not pass funds on to its supply chain, leaving over 40 subcontractors unpaid, resulting in Msheireb incurring additional costs to pay Carillion\u2019s suppliers and engaging a new contractor to complete the project. The Qataris were prepared to testify to the UK Parliamentary committees investigating Carillion's collapse, provided written evidence to them, and were considering a \u00a3200m claim against Carillion. In June 2018, Carillion (Qatar) LLC went into liquidation.The project was expected to take two years, but the customer was said to have changed architect three times and issued 40,000 new drawings. The project is now due to finish in December 2018.Brookfield Multiplex and Medgulf were contracted for Phase 1C in November 2012.Phase 2 began in December 2012, with Arabtec Construction being awarded the contract. In May 2013, Obayashi Corporation and Hamad Bin Khalid Contracting Company were awarded the contract for Phase 3.\n\n\n== Location ==\nMsheireb Downtown Doha is located at Mohamed Bin Jassim District \u2013 central Doha, bordered by:\nAl Rayyan Road to the North;\nJassim Bin Mohamed Street to the East;\nMsheireb Street to the South; and\nAl Diwan Street (part of Ring Road A) to the West.The Msheireb project site is immediately adjacent to the Amiri Diwan, Qatar\u2019s seat of government and Ruler\u2019s palace. The site is also adjacent to the redeveloped Souk Waqif, a successful mixed-use scheme based on a traditional Qatari souk and the historical Al Koot Fort.\n\n\n== Master plan ==\n\nThe master plan comprises six distinct phases. The first phase, referred to as the \u2018Diwan Amiri Quarter\u2019, currently under construction, features a combination of three major government buildings including the National Archive, along with heritage sites, a museum and an Eid Prayer Ground.\nSubsequent phases include a 5-star Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Park Hyatt Doha & MGallery along with 1 additional hotel, commercial office space, a multitude of residential types and a wide variety of retail shops and restaurants. There is also a significant community and arts focus, featuring a cultural forum, school, nurseries and mosques.\n\n\n=== Quarters ===\n\n\n==== Diwan Amiri Quarter ====\nAnchored at the northeast corner of the project, the Diwan Amiri Quarter is adjacent to both the Amiri Diwan and the Al Koot Fort.\n\n\n==== Heritage Quarter ====\n\nThe Heritage Quarter is a historic area which contains traditional courtyard houses and the recently-restored Msheireb Eid Prayer Ground, dating to the first decade of 20th century, alongside a newly constructed mosque. The newly-renovated Msheireb Eid Prayer Ground, found opposite of Al Koot Fort and in close proximity to Souq Waqif, was inaugurated in October 2014. It occupies 3,200 square meters and can hold up to 3,600 worshippers.This quarter hosts the Heritage Houses, which include the Bin Jelmood House, the Company House, the Mohammed bin Jassim House and the Radwani House. The Heritage Houses have been refurbished and re-purposed as individual museums that collectively constitute the Msheireb Museums, a project that was formally opened to the public in October 2015.\n\n\n==== Retail Quarter ====\nThe largest of all five quarters, the Retail Quarter will feature the Galleria an enclosed shopping mall, with several international flagship stores, cinema, supermarket, children's edutainment zone and numerous dining outlets.\n\n\n==== Mixed-Use & Residential Quarter ====\nMixed-Use Quarter will have a combination of commercial, retail and residential properties that overlap the Retail Quarter.\n\n\n==== Business Gateway ====\nSpread over 193,000 square metres, the Business Gateway will offer business amenities, supported by a mix of banking, personal and civic services.\n\n\n== Construction updates ==\n\n\n=== Phase 1A ===\nConsists of Diwan Ameri Quarter (Diwan Annex, Amiri Guard and National Archive), Heritage buildings, mosque, amenities & Infrastructure (District Cooling Plant, Substations and Service Corridors).

        "wiki": "Barzan Towers (Arabic: \u0628\u0631\u062c \u0628\u0631\u0632\u0627\u0646\u200e \"High Place\"), also known as the Umm Salal Mohammed Fort Towers, are watchtowers that were built in the late 19th century and renovated in 1910 by Sheikh Mohammed bin Jassim Al Thani. They are located at the southern side of the defensive system established at the end of the 19th century and start of the 20th century to protect the 'rawdat', a valley where precious rainwater is collected when it flows down from higher ground. In Arabic \"barzan\" means \"high place\".The buildings were restored in 2003. The towers measure 16 metres (52.49 ft) high. The fort links to two other fortified buildings towards the west and another tower towards the north. Barzan Towers may have been built near the sea to keep an observant eye on pearl divers,   as a look-out for approaching ships, and as an observatory for keeping track of the moon. The Barzan Towers have been rebuilt with features such as air-conditioners.Originally built with coral rock and limestone cementing the structures featured traditional Qatari design and building methods including \"marazim\" wooden to drain rainwater during storms away from the building walls, a \"majilis\" room between the towers to receive guests, and four-layer roofs with \"danchal\" wood pole construction, 'basgijl,' woven bamboo strips, mangrove mesh and a layer of compressed mud.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Barzan Towers were built in the late 19th century and were renovated by Sheikh Mohammed bin Jassim Al Thani in the early 20th century to serve as watchtowers against the incoming Ottoman soldiers. Although his father had defeated the Ottomans several years before in the Battle of Al Wajbah, Mohammed remained weary of renewed military tensions. They were also used by the native Qataris to scrutinize the new moon during the holy month of Ramadan, since keeping track of the moon was essential. The towers were restored in 2003 by the Qatari authorities.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Barzan Towers are situated on a low hill called Jebel Lusail in the town of Umm Salal Mohammed, in the municipality of Umm Salal that is about 10 km from the coast and 15 km north of Doha, the capital city of Qatar. On one side of the towers, huge, modern houses stand, while on the other, makeshift shacks exist. The former fortified house, or sometimes referred to as castle, of Sheikh Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani is located beside the towers. A unique oasis full of green trees, animals and palm trees can also be found behind the towers.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe Barzan Towers have walls which are one meter thick, especially in the base, and are further reinforced and toughened by buttresses. One tower has walls in the form of cones and massive and enormous staircases in the other. These walls were built by first merging and blending overlapping raw pieces of coral stones with limestone and cementing the two with a mud mortar after, which is somehow, similar to the construction of the walls of the Zubarah Fort. The walls were then covered with a gypsum-based plaster once dry. The Barzan Towers have a roof that was built with four layers. The first layer is composed of a series of \"danchal\" wood poles, which were sometimes painted with bitumen for protection. The \"danchal\" poles were then covered by a layer of \"basgijl\", a layer of woven bamboo strips. A carefully constructed net of mangrove branches was added, followed by a layer of compressed mud to protect the towers from the sun during the hot summers. The towers were also built with some external features such as a room for receiving guests, called \"majilis\", which was built as an L-shaped pavilion with windows for ventilation, and a mosque which has a prayer room that was also used as a school for teaching the Quran to children, called \"madrassa\". Traditional \"marazims\" protect the walls' surfaces and were built as wooden channels that stretch out from the roof to drain rainwater just in case heavy, but rare and uncommon, thunderstorms and other types of storms strike the desert. The \"marazims\" were built on top of the \"majilis\" and the mosque.\n\n\n== Schedule ==\nThe Barzan Towers are open to visitors for 24 hours. On the other hand, several surrounding landmarks, such as the house of Sheikh Jassim bin Muhammed Al Thani, the Umm Salal Fortresses and other additional towers of the forts, are closed for visitors since they are private property.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\nClick on the thumbnail to enlarge.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nLusail\nAl Koot Fort\nZubarah Fort\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nVideo of Barzan Towers site\nQatar Museums Authority\nQatar Tourism Authority\nQatar Visitor",

        "wiki": "Doha (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u062d\u0629\u200e, ad-Daw\u1e25a or ad-D\u014d\u1e25a, pronounced [ad\u02c8daw\u0127a]) is the capital and most populous city of the State of Qatar. It has a population of 956,460 (2015). The city is located on the coast of the Persian Gulf in the east of the country. It is Qatar's fastest growing city, with over 80% of the nation's population living in Doha or its surrounding suburbs, and it is also the economic centre of the country.\nDoha was founded in the 1820s as an offshoot of Al Bidda. It was officially declared as the country's capital in 1971, when Qatar gained independence from being a British Protectorate. As the commercial capital of Qatar and one of the emergent financial centres in the Middle East, Doha is considered a beta-level global city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network. Doha accommodates Education City, an area devoted to research and education.\nThe city was host to the first ministerial-level meeting of the Doha Development Round of World Trade Organization negotiations. It was also selected as host city of a number of sporting events, including the 2006 Asian Games, the 2011 Pan Arab Games and most of the games at the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. In December 2011, the World Petroleum Council held the 20th World Petroleum Conference in Doha. Additionally, the city hosted the 2012 UNFCCC Climate Negotiations and is set to host many of the venues for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nThe city has also hosted the 140th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly in April 2019.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, the name \"Doha\" originated from the Arabic term dohat, meaning \"roundness\"\u2014a reference to the rounded bays surrounding the area's coastline.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Establishment of Al Bidda ===\nThe city of Doha was formed seceding from another local settlement known as Al Bidda. The earliest documented mention of Al Bidda was made in 1681, by the Carmelite Convent, in an account which chronicles several settlements in Qatar. In the record, the ruler and a fort in the confines of Al Bidda are alluded to. Carsten Niebuhr, a German explorer who visited the Arabian Peninsula, created one of the first maps to depict the settlement in 1765 in which he labelled it as 'Guttur'.David Seaton, a British political resident in Muscat, wrote the first English record of Al Bidda in 1801. He refers to the town as 'Bedih' and describes the geography and defensive structures in the area. He stated that the town had recently been settled by the Sudan tribe (singular Al-Suwaidi), whom he considered to be pirates. Seaton attempted to bombard the town with his warship, but returned to Muscat upon finding that the waters were too shallow to position his warship within striking distance.In 1820, British surveyor R. H. Colebrook, who visited Al Bidda, remarked on the recent depopulation of the town. He wrote:\nGuttur \u2013 Or Ul Budee [Al\u2010Bidda], once a considerable town, is protected by two square Ghurries [forts] near the sea shore; but containing no fresh water they are incapable of defence except against sudden incursions of Bedouins, another Ghurry is situated two miles inland and has fresh water with it. This could contain two hundred men. There are remaining at Ul Budee about 250 men, but the original inhabitants, who may be expected to return from Bahrein, will augment them to 900 or 1,000 men, and if the Doasir tribe, who frequent the place as divers, again settle in it, from 600 to 800 men.\nThe same year, an agreement known as the General Maritime Treaty was signed between the East India Company and the sheikhs of several Persian Gulf settlements (some of which were later known as the Trucial Coast). It acknowledged British authority in the Persian Gulf and sought to end piracy and the slave trade. Bahrain became a party to the treaty, and it was assumed that Qatar, perceived as a dependency of Bahrain by the British, was also a party to it. Qatar, however, was not asked to fly the prescribed Trucial flag. As punishment for alleged piracy committed by the inhabitants of Al Bidda and breach of treaty, an East India Company vessel bombarded the town in 1821. They razed the town, forcing between 300 and 400 natives to flee and temporarily take shelter on the islands between the Qatar and the Trucial Coast.\n\n\n=== Formation of Doha ===\nDoha was founded in the vicinity of Al Bidda sometime during the 1820s. In January 1823, political resident John MacLeod visited Al Bidda to meet with the ruler and initial founder of Doha, Buhur bin Jubrun, who was also the chief of the Al-Buainain tribe. MacLeod noted that Al Bidda was the only substantial trading port in the peninsula during this time. Following the founding of Doha, written records often conflated Al Bidda and Doha due to the extremely close proximity of the two settlements. Later that year, Lt. Guy and Lt. Brucks mapped and wrote a description of the two settlements. Despite being mapped as two separate entities, they were referred to under the collective name of Al Bidda in the written description.\n\nIn 1828, Mohammed bin Khamis, a prominent member of the Al-Buainain tribe and successor of Buhur bin Jubrun as chief of Al Bidda, was embroiled in controversy. He had murdered a native of Bahrain, prompting the Al Khalifa sheikh to imprison him. In response, the Al-Buainain tribe revolted, provoking the Al Khalifa to destroy the tribe's fort and evict them to Fuwayrit and Ar Ru'ays. This incident allowed the Al Khalifa additional jurisdiction over the town. With essentially no effective ruler, Al Bidda and Doha became a sanctuary for pirates and outlaws.\n\nIn November 1839, an outlaw from Abu Dhabi named Ghuleta took refuge in Al Bidda, evoking a harsh response from the British. A. H. Nott, a British naval commander, demanded that Salemin bin Nasir Al-Suwaidi, chief of the Sudan tribe (Suwaidi) in Al Bidda, take Ghuleta into custody and warned him of consequences in the case of non-compliance. Al-Suwaidi obliged the British request in February 1840 and also arrested the pirate Jasim bin Jabir and his associates. Despite the compliance, the British demanded a fine of 300 German krones in compensation for the damages incurred by pirates off the coast of Al Bidda; namely for the piracies committed by bin Jabir. In February 1841, British naval squadrons arrived in Al Bidda and ordered Al-Suwaidi to meet the British demand, threatening consequences if he declined. Al-Suwaidi ultimately declined on the basis that he was uninvolved in bin Jabir's actions. On 26 February, the British fired on Al Bidda, striking a fort and several houses. Al-Suwaidi then paid the fine in full following threats of further action by the British.Isa bin Tarif, a powerful tribal chief from the Al Bin Ali tribe, moved to Doha in May 1843. He subsequently evicted the ruling Sudan tribe and installed the Al-Maadeed and Al-Kuwari tribes in positions of power. Bin Tarif had been loyal to the Al Khalifa, however, shortly after the swearing in of a new ruler in Bahrain, bin Tarif grew increasingly suspicious of the ruling Al Khalifa and switched his allegiance to the deposed ruler of Bahrain, Abdullah bin Khalifa, whom he had previously assisted in deposing of. Bin Tarif died in the Battle of Fuwayrit against the ruling family of Bahrain in 1847.\n\n\n=== Arrival of Al Thani ===\nThe Al Thani migrated to Doha from Fuwayrit shortly after Bin Tarif's death in 1847 under the leadership of Mohammed bin Thani. In the proceeding years, the Al Thani assumed control of the town. At various times, they swapped allegiances between the two prevailing powers in the area: the Al Khalifa and the Saudis.\n\nIn 1867, many ships and troops were sent from Bahrain to assault the towns Al Wakrah and Doha over a series of disputes. Abu Dhabi joined on Bahrain's behalf due to the conception that Al Wakrah served as a refuge for fugitives from Oman. Later that year, the combined forces sacked the two Qatari towns with around 2,700 men in what would come to be known as the Qatari\u2013Bahraini War. A British record later stated \"that the towns of Doha and Wakrah were, at the end of 1867 temporarily blotted out of existence, the houses being dismantled and the inhabitants deported\".The joint Bahraini-Abu Dhabi incursion and subsequent Qatari counterattack prompted the British political agent, Colonel Lewis Pelly, to impose a settlement in 1868. Pelly's mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the peace treaty that resulted were milestones in Qatar's history. It implicitly recognized Qatar as a distinct entity independent from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani as an important representative of the peninsula's tribes.\n\nIn December 1871, the Ottomans established a presence in the country with 100 of their troops occupying the Musallam fort in Doha. This was accepted by Mohammad bin Thani's son, Jassim Al Thani, who wished to protect Doha from Saudi incursions. The Ottoman commander, Major \u00d6mer Bey, compiled a report on Al Bidda in January 1872, stating that it was an \"administrative centre\" with around 1,000 houses and 4,000 inhabitants.Disagreement over tribute and interference in internal affairs arose, eventually leading to the Battle of Al Wajbah in March 1893. Al Bidda fort served as the final point of retreat for Ottoman troops. While they were garrisoned in the fort, their corvette fired indiscriminately at the townspeople, killing a number of civilians. The Ottomans eventually surrendered after Jassim Al Thani's troops cut off the town's water supply. An Ottoman report compiled the same year reported that Al Bidda and Doha had a combined population of 6,000 inhabitants, jointly referring to both towns by the name of 'Katar'. Doha was classified as the eastern section of Katar. The Ottomans held a passive role in Qatar's politics from the 1890s onward until fully relinquishing control during the beginning of the first World War.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\n\nPearling had come to play a pivotal commercial role in Doha by the 20th century. The population increased to around 12,000 inhabitants in the first half of the 20th century due to the flourishing pearl trade. A British political resident noted that should the supply of pearls drop, Qatar would 'practically cease to exist'. In 1907, the city accommodated 350 pearling boats with a combined crew size of 6,300 men. By this time, the average prices of pearls had more than doubled since 1877. The pearl market collapsed that year, forcing Jassim Al Thani to sell the country's pearl harvest at half its value. The aftermath of the collapse resulted in the establishment of the country's first custom house in Doha.\n\n\n==== Lorimer report (1908) ====\nBritish administrator and historian J. G. Lorimer authored an extensive handbook for British agents in the Persian Gulf entitled Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf in 1908. In it, he gives a comprehensive account of Doha at the time:\n\nGenerally so styled at the present day, but Bedouins sometimes call it Dohat-al-Qatar; and it seems to have been formerly better known as Bida' (Anglice \"Bidder\"): it is the chief town of Qatar and is situated on the eastern side of that peninsula, about 63 miles south of its extremity at Ras Rakan and 45 miles north of Khor-al Odaid Harbour. Dohah stands on the south side of a deep bay at the south-western corner of a natural harbour which is about 3 miles in extent and is protected on the north-east and south-east sides by natural reefs. The entrance, less than a mile wide, is from the east between the points of the reefs; it is shallow and somewhat difficult, and vessels of more than 15 feet draught cannot pass. The soundings within the basin vary from 3 to 5 fathoms and are regular: the bottom is white mud or clay.\nTown site and quarters, \u2014 The south-eastern point of the bay is quite low but the land on the western side is stony desert 40 or 50 feet above the level of the sea. The town is built up the slope of some rising ground between these two extremes and consists of 9 Fanqs or quarters, which are given below in their order from the east to the west and north: the total frontage of the place upon the sea is nearly 2 miles.\n\nLorimer goes on to list and describe the districts of Doha, which at the time included the still-existing districts of Al Mirqab, As Salatah, Al Bidda and Rumeilah. Remarking on Doha's appearance, he states:\n\nThe general appearance of Dohah is unattractive; the lanes are narrow and irregular the houses dingy and small. There are no date palms or other trees, and the only garden is a small one near the fort, kept up by the Turkish garrison.\n\nAs for Doha's population, Lorimer asserts that \"the inhabitants of Dohah are estimated to amount, inclusive of the Turkish military garrison of 350 men, to about 12,000 souls\". He qualified this statement with a tabulated overview of the various tribes and ethnic groups living in the town.\n\n\n==== British protectorate (1916\u20131971) ====\nIn April 1913, the Ottomans agreed to a British request that they withdraw all their troops from Qatar. Ottoman presence in the peninsula ceased, when in August 1915, the Ottoman fort in Al Bidda was evacuated shortly after the start of World War I. One year later, Qatar agreed to be a British protectorate with Doha as its official capital.\n\nBuildings at the time were simple dwellings of one or two rooms, built from mud, stone and coral. Oil concessions in the 1920s and 1930s, and subsequent oil drilling in 1939, heralded the beginning of slow economic and social progress in the country. However, revenues were somewhat diminished due to the devaluation of pearl trade in the Persian Gulf brought on by introduction of the cultured pearl and the Great Depression. The collapse of the pearl trade caused a significant population drop throughout the entire country. It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the country saw significant monetary returns from oil drilling.\n\nQatar was not long in exploiting the new-found wealth from oil concessions, and slum areas were quickly razed to be replaced by more modern buildings. The first formal boys' school was established in Doha in 1952, followed three years later by the establishment of a girls' school. Historically, Doha had been a commercial port of local significance. However, the shallow water of the bay prevented bigger ships from entering the port until the 1970s, when its deep-water port was completed. Further changes followed with extensive land reclamation, which led to the development of the crescent-shaped bay. From the 1950s to 1970s, the population of Doha grew from around 14,000 inhabitants to over 83,000, with foreign immigrants constituting about two-thirds of the overall population.\n\n\n=== Post-independence ===\n\nQatar officially declared its independence in 1971, with Doha as its capital city. In 1973, the University of Qatar was opened by emiri decree, and in 1975 the Qatar National Museum opened in what was originally the ruler's palace. During the 1970s, all old neighborhoods in Doha were razed and the inhabitants moved to new suburban developments, such as Al Rayyan, Madinat Khalifa and Al Gharafa. The metropolitan area's population grew from 89,000 in the 1970s to over 434,000 in 1997. Additionally, land policies resulted in the total land area increasing to over 7,100 hectares (about 17,000 acres) by 1995, an increase from 130 hectares in the middle of the 20th century.In 1983, a hotel and conference center was developed at the north end of the Corniche. The 15-storey Sheraton hotel structure in this center would serve as the tallest structure in Doha until the 1990s. In 1993, the Qatar Open became the first major sports event to be hosted in the city. Two years later, Qatar stepped in to host the FIFA World Youth Championship, with all the matches being played in Doha-based stadiums.\n\nThe Al Jazeera Arabic news channel began broadcasting from Doha in 1996. In the late 1990s, the government planned the construction of Education City, a 2,500 hectare Doha-based complex mainly for educational institutes. Since the start of the 21st century, Doha attained significant media attention due to the hosting of several global events and the inauguration of a number of architectural mega-projects. One of the largest projects launched by the government was The Pearl-Qatar, an artificial island off the coast of West Bay, which launched its first district in 2004. In 2006, Doha was selected to host the Asian Games, leading to the development of a 250-hectare sporting complex known as Aspire Zone. During this time, new cultural attractions were constructed in the city, with older ones being restored. In 2006, the government launched a restoration program to preserve Souq Waqif's architectural and historical identity. Parts constructed after the 1950s were demolished whereas older structures were refurbished. The restoration was completed in 2008. Katara Cultural Village was opened in the city in 2010 and has hosted the Doha Tribeca Film Festival since then.The main outcome of the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2013 was the Trade Facilitation Agreement.  The agreement aims to make it easier and cheaper to import and export by improving customs procedures and making rules more transparent.  Reducing global trade costs by 1% would increase world-wide income more than USD 40 billion, 65% of which would go to developing countries.  The gains from the Trade Facilitation Agreement are expected to be distributed among all countries and regions, with developing landlocked countries benefitting the most.The Trade Facilitation Agreement will enter into force upon its ratification by 2/3 of WTO Members. The EU ratified the agreement in October 2015.In Bali, WTO members also agreed on a series of Doha agriculture and development issues.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nDoha is located on the central-east portion of Qatar, bordered by the Persian Gulf on its coast. Its elevation is 10 m (33 ft). Doha is highly urbanized. Land reclamation off the coast has added 400 hectares of land and 30 km of coastline. Half of the 22 km\u00b2 of surface area which Hamad International Airport was constructed on was reclaimed land. The geology of Doha is primarily composed of weathered unconformity on the top of the Eocene period Dammam Formation, forming dolomitic limestone.\n\nThe Pearl is an artificial island in Doha with a surface area of nearly 400 ha (1,000 acres) The total project has been estimated to cost $15 billion upon completion. Other islands off Doha's coast include Palm Tree Island, Shrao's Island, Al Safliya Island, and Alia Island.In a 2010 survey of Doha's coastal waters conducted by the Qatar Statistics Authority, it was found that its maximum depth was 7.5 meters (25 ft) and minimum depth was 2 meters (6 ft 7 in). Furthermore, the waters had an average pH of 7.83, a salinity of 49.0 psu, an average temperature of 22.7 \u00b0C and 5.5 mg/L of dissolved oxygen.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nDoha has a hot desert climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification BWh) with long, extremely hot summers and short, warm winters. The average high temperatures between May and September surpass 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F) and often approach 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F). Humidity is usually the lowest in May and June. Dewpoints can surpass 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) in the summer.  Throughout the summer, the city averages almost no precipitation, and less than 20 mm (0.79 in) during other months. Rainfall is scarce, at a total of 75 mm (2.95 in) per year, falling on isolated days mostly between October to March. The winter's days are relativity warm while the sun is up and cool during the night. The temperature rarely drops below 7 \u00b0C (45 \u00b0F).\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nA significant portion of Qatar's population resides within the confines of Doha and its metropolitan area. The district with the highest population density is the central area of Al Najada, which also accommodates the highest total population in the country. The population density across the greater Doha region ranges from 20,000 people per km\u00b2 to 25 people per km\u00b2. Doha witnessed explosive growth rates in population in the first decade of the 21st century, absorbing the majority of the thousands of people then immigrating to Qatar every month. Doha's population currently stands at around one million, with the population of the city more than doubling from 2000 to 2010.\n\n\n=== Ethnicity and languages ===\nThe population of Doha is overwhelmingly composed of expatriates, with Qatari nationals forming a minority. The largest portion of expatriates in Qatar are from South-East and South Asian countries, mainly India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Philippines, and Bangladesh with large numbers of expatriates also coming from the Levant Arab countries, North Africa, and East Asia. Doha is also home to many expatriates from Europe, North America, South Africa and Australia.\n\nArabic is the official language of Qatar. English is commonly used as a second language, and a rising lingua franca, especially in commerce. As there is a large expatriate population in Doha, languages such as Malayalam, Tamil, Bengali, Tagalog, Spanish, Sinhala, French, Urdu and Hindi are widely spoken.\nIn 2004, the Foreign Ownership of Real Estate Law was passed, permitting non-Qatari citizens to buy land in designated areas of Doha, including the West Bay Lagoon, the Qatar Pearl, and the new Lusail City. Prior to this, expatriates were prohibited from owning land in Qatar. Ownership by foreigners in Qatar entitles them to a renewable residency permit, which allows them to live and work in Qatar.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe majority of residents in Doha are Muslim. Catholics account for over 90% of the 150,000 Christian population in Doha. Following decrees by the Emir for the allocation of land to churches, the first Catholic church, Our Lady of the Rosary, was opened in Doha in March 2008. The church structure is discreet and Christian symbols are not displayed on the outside of the building. Several other churches exist in Doha, including the [1] St.Isaac and St. George Greek Orthodox Church of Qatar the Syro-Malabar Church, Malankara Orthodox Church, Mar Thoma Church (affiliated with the Anglicans, but not part of the Communion), CSI Church, Syro-Malankara Church and a Pentecostal church. A majority of mosques are either Muwahhid or Sunni-oriented.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\n\n=== Districts ===\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Doha was divided into 9 main districts. In the 2010 census, there were more than 60 districts recorded in Doha Municipality. Some of the districts of Doha include:\n\nShortly after Qatar gained independence, many of the districts of old Doha including Al Najada, Al Asmakh and Old Al Hitmi faced gradual decline and as a result much of their historical architecture has been demolished. Instead, the government shifted their focus toward the Doha Bay area, which housed districts such as Al Dafna and West Bay.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nDoha is the economic centre of Qatar. The city is the headquarters of numerous domestic and international organizations, including the country's largest oil and gas companies, Qatar Petroleum, Qatargas and RasGas. Doha's economy is built primarily on the revenue the country has made from its oil and natural gas industries. Doha was included in Fortune's 15 best new cities for business in 2011.Beginning in the late 20th century, the government launched numerous initiatives to diversify the country's economy in order to decrease its dependence on oil and gas resources. Doha International Airport was constructed in a bid to solidify the city's diversification into the tourism industry. This was replaced by Hamad International Airport in 2014. The new airport is almost twice the size of the former and features two of the longest runways in the world. Thirty-nine new hotels were under construction in the city in 2011.\n\nAs a result of Doha's rapid population boom and increased housing demands, real estate prices rose significantly through 2014. Real estate prices experienced a further spike after Qatar won the rights to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Al Asmakh, a Qatari real estate firm, released a report in 2014 which revealed substantial increases in real estate prices following a peak in 2008. Prices increased 5 to 10% in the first quarter of 2014 from the end of 2013. A 2015 study conducted by Numbeo, a crowd-sourced database, named Doha as the 10th most expensive city to live in globally. This rate of growth led to the development of planned communities in and around the city. Although the fall in oil prices since 2014 and a diplomatic crisis with Qatar's neighbors slowed growth in the city's population, government spending was increased to maintain the growth in real estate in metropolitan Doha.Expatriate workers remitted $60bn between 2006 and 2012, with 54 percent of the workers' remittances of $60bn routed to Asian countries, followed by Arab nations that accounted for nearly half that volume (28 percent). India was the top destination of the remittances, followed by the Philippines, while the US, Egypt and the neighbouring UAE followed. Remittances in 2014 totaled $11.2 billion, amounting to 5.3% of Qatar's GDP.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMost traditional architecture in the Old Doha districts have been demolished to make space for new buildings. As a result, a number of schemes have been taken to preserve the city's cultural and architectural heritage, such as the Qatar Museums Authority's 'Al Turath al Hai' ('living heritage') initiative. Katara Cultural Village is a small village in Doha launched by sheikh Tamim Al Thani to preserve the cultural identity of the country.\n\nIn 2011, more than 50 towers were under construction in Doha, the largest of which was the Doha Convention Center Tower. Constructions were suspended in 2012 following concerns that the tower would impede flight traffic.In 2014, Abdullah Al Attiyah, a senior government official, announced that Qatar would be spending $65bn on new infrastructure projects in upcoming years in preparation for the 2022 World Cup as well as progressing towards its objectives set out in the Qatar National Vision 2030.\n\n\n=== Atmosphere ===\nDue to excessive heat from the sun during the summer, some Doha-based building companies have implemented various forms of cooling technology to alleviate the extremely torrid climatic conditions. This can include creating optical phenomena such as shadows, as well as more expensive techniques like ventilation, coolants, refrigerants, cryogenics, and dehumidifiers. Discussions regarding temperature control have also been features of various scheduled events involving large crowds. There are other initiatives that attempt to counter the heat by altering working hours, weather alteration methods such as cloud seeding, and using whiter and brighter construction materials to increase the albedo effects. Nonetheless, despite these measures, Doha and other areas of Qatar could become uninhabitable for humans due to climate change by the 2070s.\n\n\n=== Planned communities ===\nOne of the largest projects underway in Qatar is Lusail City, a planned community north of Doha which is estimated to be completed by 2020 at a cost of approximately $45bn. It is designed to accommodate 450,000 people. Al Waab City, another planned community under development, is estimated to cost QR15 bn. In addition to housing 8,000 individuals, it will also have shopping malls, educational, and medical facilities.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nSince 2004, Doha has been undergoing a huge expansion to its transportation network, including the addition of new highways, the opening of a new airport in 2014, and the currently ongoing construction of an 85 km metro system. This has all been as a result of Doha's massive growth in a short period of time, which has resulted in congestion on its roads. The first phase of the metro system is expected to be operational by 2019.\n\n\n=== Roads ===\n\nIn 2015, the Public Works Authority declared their plan to construct a free-flowing road directly linking Al-Wakrah and Mesaieed to Doha in order to decrease traffic congestion in the city. It is set for completion by 2018.Commutes between Doha and the municipality of Al Khor are currently facilitated by Al Shamal Road and Al Khor Coastal Road, with the latter road running through Al Daayen and the former running through Umm Salal.Doha is linked to the country's western settlements, namely Dukhan, through Dukhan Highway. The Public Works Authority carried out the Dukhan Highway Central Project in 2017 to enhance the road network.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nDoha Metro will consist of four lines: the Red Line, the Gold Line, the Blue Line and the Green Line. The Blue Line is expected to be completed in the second phase. Msheireb Station will be the point of intersection for all of the metro lines.\n\nThe Red Line (also known as Coast Line) will extend through Doha, running from Al Wakrah to Al Khor. It is separated into two divisions: Red Line North and Red Line South. The former will run from Mushayrib Station to Al Khor City, over a length of 55.7 km. Doha Metro's Green Line will connect Doha to Education City and is also known as the Education Line. Starting in Old Airport, the Gold Line (also known as Historic Line) will end in Al Rayyan and cover a distance of 30.6 km. Lastly, the Blue Line, or City Line, will only cover the city of Doha, and is planned to be circular with a length of 17.5 km.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nDoha is served by Hamad International Airport which is Qatar's principal international gateway. The airport opened in 2014, replacing Doha International Airport.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nDoha is the educational center of the country and contains the highest preponderance of schools and colleges. In 1952, the first formal boys' school was opened in Doha. This was proceeded by the opening of the first formal girls' school three years later. The first university in the state, Qatar University, was opened in 1973. It provided separate faculties for men and women.Education City, a 14 km2 education complex launched by non-profit organization Qatar Foundation, began construction in 2000. It houses eight universities, the country's top high school, and offices for Al Jazeera's children television channel. It is geographically located in Al Rayyan municipality's Al Luqta, Al Gharrafa, Gharrafat Al Rayyan and Al Shagub districts, but falls under the umbrella of Metropolitan Doha.In 2009, the government launched the World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE), a global forum that brings together education stakeholders, opinion leaders and decision makers from all over the world to discuss educational issues. The first edition was held in Doha in November 2009.Some of the universities in Doha include:\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\n\n=== Football ===\n\nFootball is the most popular sport in Doha. There are six Doha-based sports clubs with football teams currently competing in the Qatar Stars League, the country's top football league. They are Al Ahli, Al Arabi, Al Sadd, Al-Duhail and Qatar SC. Al Sadd, Al Arabi and Qatar SC are the three most successful teams in the league's history.Numerous football tournaments have been hosted in Doha. The most prestigious tournaments include the 1988 and 2011 editions of the AFC Asian Cup and the 1995 FIFA World Youth Championship.In December 2010, Qatar won the rights to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Three of the nine newly announced stadiums will be constructed in Doha, including Sports City Stadium, Doha Port Stadium, and Qatar University Stadium. Additionally, the Khalifa International Stadium is set to undergo an expansion.Considering the country's rapid development for 2022 World Cup, FIFA awarded the hosting rights of 2019 FIFA Club World Cup and 2020 FIFA Club World Cup also to Qatar.\n\n\n=== Basketball ===\nDoha was the host of the official 2005 FIBA Asia Championship, where Qatar's national basketball team finished 3rd, its best performance to date, and subsequently qualified for the Basketball World Cup.The majority of the teams that make up the official Qatari Basketball League are based in Doha.\n\n\n=== Volleyball ===\nDoha four times was the host of the official FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship and three times host FIVB Volleyball Women's Club World Championship. Doha one time Host Asian Volleyball Championship.\n\n\n=== Other sports ===\n\nIn 2001, Qatar became the first country in the Middle East to hold a women's tennis tournament with the inauguration of its Qatar Ladies Open tournament. Doha also hosts International Tennis Federation (ITF) ladies tournaments. Since 2008, the Sony Ericsson Championships (equivalent to the ATP's season-ending Championships) has taken place in Doha, in the Khalifa International Tennis Complex, and features record prize money of $4.45 million, including a check of $1,485,000 for the winner, which represents the largest single guaranteed payout in women's tennis.Doha hosted the 15th Asian Games, held in December 2006, spending a total of $2.8 billion for its preparation. The city also hosted the 3rd West Asian Games in December 2005. Doha was expected to host the 2011 Asian Indoor Games; but the Qatar Olympic Committee cancelled the event.\n\nThe city submitted a bid for the 2016 Olympics. On June 4, 2008, the city was eliminated from the shortlist for the 2016 Olympic Games. On August 26, 2011 it was confirmed that Doha would bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics. Doha however failed to become a Candidate City for the 2020 Games.The MotoGP motorcycling grand prix of Doha is held annually at Losail International Circuit, located just outside the city boundaries. The city is also the location of the Grand Prix of Qatar for the F1 Powerboat World Championship, annually hosting a round in Doha Bay.

        "wiki": "Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani Museum is a privately owned museum located in the municipality of Al-Shahaniya in Qatar. Encompassing an area of 530,000 m\u00b2, the three-building museum was opened in 1998 by Sheikh Faisal bin Qassim Al Thani.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe museum is located in Al Samriya, a locality of Al-Shahaniya that is approximately 20 km westward of the capital Doha. It is accessible through Dukhan Road.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1998, Sheikh Faisal bin Qassim Al Thani opened the museum to the public. The museum, consisting of three buildings, was built over a historic fort in Al Samriya. Sheikh Faisal has stated that his intent was to preserve and promote the cultural heritage of Qatar by housing traditional artifacts and artworks within the museum.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThere are 15 halls in the museum which accommodate a total of over 15,000 artifacts. All of the artifacts in the museum were collected by Sheikh Faisal over a span of 50 years. The artifacts are grouped into four main categories: Islamic art, vehicles, coins and currency, and traditional Qatari artifacts. Objects of each category are housed in separate rooms with distinct themes.\n\n\n=== Islamic art ===\nThere are eight designated halls displaying Islamic artworks. Included in this category is a hall for Islamic textiles, a hall for Islamic manuscripts, a hall for Islamic paintings and a hall showcasing verses of the Qur'an.\n\n\n=== Vehicles ===\n\nSeveral types of vehicles from varying periods are displayed in a number of halls. Automobiles dating from 1885 onward are displayed, as well as former automobiles used by government officials. Furthermore, a number of different motorcycles and bicycles are showcased.\n\n\n=== Coins and currency ===\nThe coins and currency halls put on display ancient currencies, silver and gold coins used during and before the emergence of Islam in the Middle East, and contemporary currencies of several countries.\n\n\n=== Qatari heritage ===\nTraditional Qatari artifacts in the museum vary widely in theme, ranging from pearling equipment, dhows, and Bedouin handicraft.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCollecting practices of the Al-Thani Family\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMohammed Hassan Al-Kuwari, Maryam Khulaifi, Jamila Abdulla Ahmed & Sawsan Al-Haddad (2013). \"\u062f\u0644\u064a\u0640\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0633\u0633\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0642\u0627\u0641\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0637\u0631 (Directory of Cultural Institutions in Qatar)\" (PDF) (in Arabic).

          "I am not a new guest for this museum, as a resident i have been to this museum many times with my families and guests, so i felt this museum as my second home. I recommended this for everyone who visiting Qatar. Unfortunately i had a bad experience this week from the beginning",
          "It is well worth the drive out to visit the museum . The building itself is striking and it houses the most extraordinary collections . It has recently been reorganised and is now very easy to walk around and view the displays many of which are now in glass cases . The vintage",
          "its having a huge collection of different things. it requires atleast 4 hours to enjoy it. only missing thing is that lot of things have no description on it.",
          "nice museum. amazing collections. my suggestion is to open on Fridays also.its useful to us because we have off only on Fridays. and we are staying far from the museum. so not possible to go on other days.",
          "Difficult to find but worth the drive if you like exploring the dessert. Huge. You need at least 3 hours to walk through the entire collection. I'd recommend dividing your visit over two days or making a quick walk through one day and coming back to explore a particular area of",
          "Quite a remote area to visit. Charges for entry and for every camera - they charge QAR50. Area was controlled at entry but no one to explain arabic statements written under items on display. Security staff had to argue with visitors who could not produce receipt of payment for",
          "An eclectic collection of artefacts reflecting both Arabic and international history. Exhibits include fossils, furniture, Arabic costumes, ornate swords and weaponry, cars, boats, paintings, and reconstructions of Qatari households. There is even a whole house from Syria that",
          "One of the greatest ever museum which i visited so far and stunning collection from different countries and religions, nations and regions. A bit far from city but worth to visit.",
          "This is one amazing museum and every person in the country should visit it at least once. They have a wide range of artifacts, cars, etc on display that showcase the culture and life of Qatar spanned over several decades.",
          "We had a great time at this museum. The old cars and trucks were truly the best parts as we know limited amount of Qatar's history. This is a country with very little activities as a tourist. The old Ford, Packard, DeSoto, Lincoln and Cadillac vehicles were really fun to",
          "It's about 50 Km far from Doha and Google Maps doesn't help you to go with the smoothest way - basically it suggests to go off-road. More than a museum in some points it seems a big bazaar. But there is a collection of stuff (cars, boats, carpets and various objects) very",
          "Have been there before, new set up more space and more visitor freindly. Amazing collection of various items from diffrent places in Asia. Don't expect the story of Qatar. New set-up means that entry fee is now being charged 15 QAR / Person and only cash accepted, if you want to",
          "Great collection of everyday things as well as cars and arts - huge collection in a great spot. Only thing that bothered was high fee to take pix.",
          "So apparently \"no museum in the World will allow you take carry a bottle of water with you\". Strange, as I was sure I was in both the V&A and The British Museum only 3 weeks ago in London and a definitely recall carrying a bottle of water. Doubly annoying as the AC wasn't",
          "Just about 20 kms from Doha, at the \"Grand Qatari Fort\" in the Al Samriya Farm area - nearly at the desert, you will find \"Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassin Al Thani Museum\". His Highness is a member of the Qatari Royal Family and since his childhood started collecting whatever",
          "Weird and wacky collection, but totally worth the drive into the desert to check it out!! Sheikh Faisal collected anything and everything, a hoarder par excellence. Go check out what he managed to get his hands on!",
          "Approximately one hour drive to reach from Doha. And 2 to 3 hours you\u2019ll need to discover the collection, shark\u2019s teeth and marine turtles and Fossilised dinosaur eggs, next to a 120 million year-old head and neck of a dinosaur. Oldtimer cars, dhows, planes, clothing,swords,",
          "A history lesson told through some beautiful relics. This is a place one can spend as much or as little time as desired.",
          "First off the positives because the only negative is in my title. This museum is choc a bloc of treasures. It has extensive square footage and comes off feeling somewhere between a museum and antiques shop (although nothing is for sale mind you) It's hard to describe this",
          "Finding the exact location was quite a challenge, even with the Google Maps, but just like a gem, once you find it, you'll be amazed. As you enter, there is a 15 QR entrance fee and a photography fee of 50 QR. ( don't fret though because it is worth it given the vast collections",
          "This is a fascinating place to view Arabic life of all levels. Situated about 45 mins drive outside Doha in the desert, it has something for all. Life in tents, toys, guns, cars, artifacts from many eras, Purpose built like an old fort and home it is very large almost",

          "This is something you don't see everyday, definitively worth to visit. Very impressive car collection",
          "huge collections of artifacts, paintings, religious things. Separate place exclusively dedicated for automobiles, mainly car.",
          "It's pretty cool museum with lots of antiques cars. It's nice, but I think for me, once it's enough. It's nice to see the history of Qatar though.",
          "This is one of the most amazing place in Qatar and not to miss . From the ancient Dinosaur eggs and skeleton , islamic and middle eastern cultural art pieces, books, calligraphy ,vintage cars , etc etc... An amazing collection for a private museum.. ,",
          "My friends and I - all long-time residents in Doha - headed over to this museum as a means to beat the heat and entertain ourselves over the weekend. For that, our purposes were served. In terms of this place being a museum, I think there's a LOT of work that needs to be done",
          "Following semi-wrong directions of a non updated web site, we finally arrived at the museum. The entrance reminded me a military camp, rather than a place of art. The building though is pretty new and huge. The collection is really amazing but the guided tour is no longer there",
          "You have to book online before you visit . It is a fascinating collection in a lovely building . There is just so much to see including wooden boats and vintage cars .Well worth visiting .",
          "Directions on the website need some updating, but we finally found the museum. There are some very interesting artifacts there, but next time we would get a tour guide to assist with the arabic and translations.",
          "I've seen a lot of museums in my life, not one compares to this museum! It is amazing. It has everything, cars, from the first car that ever entered Qatar, to the water bottles used, religion. An actual house from Syria, that was dismanteled in Syria and rebuilt in this museum.",
          "A very big collection of artifacts including armory and vintage cars. Need about 3-4 hours to complete the museum. Great place not to be missed while in Qatar.",
          "The reservation is required due to the availability of the tour guide. The biggest Museum in Qatar with 1000s items are being showcased. Great collection of classic cars and other means of transportation of olden age and many more. There are some separate rooms dedicated to",
          "A bit far, almost 40 km from Doha to the West. The location shared in TripAdvisor is wrong, so I wasted additional hour by contacting the museum and get the right location. Very big museum, free admission, many old cars, ships, guns, ancient stones, pictures and many others.",
          "Using Google map app, u will not find the way to it. It takes about 20 min from Doha Aljdeedah . The staff told us that u have to pick a ticket from the internet and it is free. They were welcoming. There is ALOT to see in there. Cars, old places, how they were living,",
          "If you want to be entertained by antiques from around the middle east, this is the place to be. It really is worth a trip",

          "Incredible place in vicinity of Doha. One of \"must see\" places in Qatar. Sheikh collect everything, from pictures, doors, weapons, incredible vehicle collection with amasing and rare ones.And many, many more. You can spend hours and hours in wery well organized and maintained",
          "If you are visiting Qatar for any reason, make sure to stop by this private collector museum. It is unique to say the least, unusual and alive. It is not presented like National Museums where everything is behind glass. Although I recommend not touching the stuff, it is right",
          "To the west of Doha, about 30 minutes out is Sheikh Faisal Museum. This eccentric, eclectic museum reflects the personality of its owner. Don\u2019t expect any logic, rhyme or reason to the collection, you won\u2019t find it, but that is what makes this place such an absolute gem of a",
          "A huge variety of exhibits and very friendly staff. I recommend visiting the website first and booking your visit in advance as if I hadn't I would not have been allowed in (a very special visitor was having a private tour - the King of Swaziland). The staff were keen to show",
          "Been there in s social invite from Shikh Faisal himself Great and huge selection Lots to see and read and explore Can spend 3-5 hours easily The guy know what he is collecting and has Got very unique pieces from all over the world",
          "The website doesn't mention you need an appointment to visit, but when we arrived, we were told this 4 times before we got inside the museum. We were given all these pieces of paper about the rules and regulations regarding making appointments, but what use is it once you've",
          "A few kilometers from the city centre of Doha, one can discover a fantastic Museum assembling various collections on the Arabic Culture but also some other such as cars. It is huge and very well sorted. Take the time to discover so many beautiful faces of The Middle Eastern",
          "This is more of a collection of stuff rather than a curated museum. There are lots of random, not particularly interesting things to see. For example, you can see Sheikh Faisal's used razor blade or television set. But there are also some REALLY cool things to see. The",
          "This museum holds every collection you could imagine -- clothing, paintings, weapons, cars, trucks, boats, airplanes, furniture of every sort, life sized animals, amazing doors, and even full sized houses and various religious buildings! The rooms and even the walls compliment",
          "With family over for the Christmas holiday, we choose to visit the museum. Getting there is a mission by itself as it isn't well sign posted but one you arrive it is well worth the journey Admittance is free and there are staff around to help if you require - larger groups can",
          "Free, but by appointment only. My children 22 and 12 loved it. It is a true treasure trove, eclectic and amusing. A great way to experience a unique collection. If you are expecting a traditional museum this is not for you, go for a rare opportunity to see things like antique",
          "Being here for more than 8 years, I can tell visitors or even families never been there it is worse to visit. We had an really nice tour guide (unluckily forgot his name), but kept the group really excited and was telling a lot of little nice stories around some exhibits. Really",
          "I have lived in Doha for 3 years and only recently visited the museum with some family who are visiting us. We had a very pleaseant experience and was surprised by the size of the museum and the variety of items on display, especially the religious section where we saw a",

          "Sheikh Faisal has amassed a collection of a mishmash of stuff. You're required to spend the first hour on a tour of the museum, then you can wander around as you want. Most of the collection seem pretty mixed up with minimal organization. The car collection is impressive,",
          "This is located between Doha and Shahaniya, in fact close to very close to Shahaniya after UCC camp. While coming from Shahaniya and crossing the UCC camp in the service road, kindly take right. Nice location and recommended to visit.",

          "Interesting collection of stuff, but the guide knew little about it, and she kept losing control of the group. I think it could be very interesting under better circumstances. Note that it is now required to go on a tour--individual wandering through the museum is no longer",
          "This is free to enter and has something for everyone. There is so much that that there is an extension being built to house more of the ever growing collection. Worth a visit more times than you can imagine.",
          "This museum can be visited for free.. the sheikhs collection was impressive and I must say the biggest collection in a museum I've been. Its a bit far from the city itself was all worth the travelling going there. Should not be miss once here in Doha.",
          "I don't know much about Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al-Thani, but I know he's part of the royal family. I just felt like this was over-indulgance, especially when I got to the section with the vehicles, aircraft and boats. I know the Qatar people are the richest per capita, but",

          "You have never seen a museum like this! Imagine a very wealthy man who collected almost anything needed someplace to put it. That is the Sheikh Faisal Museum. Weapons, furniture, antique Q'urans, an entire Syrian home, art, and the most eclectic car collection I have ever",
          "I just loves the 110 cars on display, apart from the many more items Sheikh Faisal had collected over the years. Fossil finds, archived records including old telegrams, carved doors and a very impressive collection of ancient weaponry and armour. The only downside ... too",
          "In my opinion, this hidden museum is one of the big treasures of Islamic Art and Qatar Heritage. Is located at the outskirts of Doha, and has more than 15.000 pieces, so if you love art, maybe you will need more than one visit. You can find many collections with incalculable",
          "This is one of the amazing hidden gems of Qatar. This museum has a long list of collections. It will take a couple of days to truly view and admire all the things in this museum. Much of the collection deals with historic cultural artifacts from the near east. There are things",

          "I have visited many museums during my life. Compared to this, the sheikh Faisal museum takes the first place. Amazing set of objects you get to see. At one hand, you feel as if you're intruding in sombody's personal collection; and at the sale time you feel very humbled by the",
          "This museum is a true collector's museum. It is owned by a sheikh who built it to house his collection of art, classic cars, antique weapons, modern art, etc. that he collected during his travels around the world. Very fascinating. Don't miss it while in Doha!",
          "I've been to this museum 3 times and everytime I go it's gotten better . It's way out of town in the middle of the desert but that just adds to its allure, in my opinion. There's also a great stable run by a Welsh lady next door and you can rent horses by the hour or sign up for",

          "You have to go see this museum while you are in Doha. There is a huge collection of so many different historical objects, there is something for everyone. It may seem a bit random, but that adds to the charm. I visited the museum with a group from my MBA program and we had the",
          "I'm not sure it can really be called a museum. It's a collection of stuff crammed into a series of huge rooms, more like a warehouse. But it's fun and there are some interesting things in the collection.",

          "Honestly? The Museum is incredible with everything in it, but after a while it is slightly overwhelming. And random... Loved the old cars, the religious artifacts (all kinds) and the ancient books / scrolls. To view these books from the 9th Century was awe inspiring.",
          "You will find here a personal collection from Sheik Faisal who is very kind to open this place to everybody for free. All pieces are unique and valuables. If you are planning to visit the museum please make a booking in advance. Is far away from Doha city (50 min driving) so",
          "this museum while not in a house, is displayed as if it was home; pictures are not always neat, carpets are everywhere, order is not, but my oh my the collection is FANTASTIC. And we were lucky enough to be guided for a hour by Nabil who is responsible for the pr of the museum",

          "I admit the museum is worth the long (40 km) driving distance from centre of Doha. Also, you need to call and reserve before heading there in order to have a tour guide. Unless you would like to check it out solo, then you can just pop out during their opening time (9am - 6pm).",
          "A little bit difficult to find the first time but well worth the effort. Inside there are swords, cars boats, guns, art, woodwork, guns, doors, paintings, books, guns, fire engines, model cars, guns. Did I mention guns enough? Also... check out the occupants of the enormous cage",
          "We thought it would be great to spend a lazy afternoon exploring the extensive private collection so we ended up at the Sheikh FBQ Museum. In the first hall the exhibits of the ancient arms and ammunition was quite fascination. Fairly labelled and displayed. The Syrian",

          "With classic cars, armoury, displays of traditional Qatar life, this Museum is well worth a visit. A must see if you are in Qatar",
          "After a lifetime of collecting by Sheikh Faisal the result is so extensive and varied, surely there is something here for everyone. This is part of his personal collection. There are articles from all over the world, many of them antiques and probably irreplaceable. If you\u2019re",
          "Though Sheikh Faisal Bin Qassim Al Thani Museum is interesting in an eclectic sort of way, it's not what I would consider an actual museum...by Western standards. There are some placards indicating what items are with generic dates, but most items - including entire walls of",
          "Difficult to get to but really worth the trip. So many classic cars and family artefacts. Would love if all the photos were labelled as such an impreesive look at family life for the Al Thani's. Could really do with a coffee or water station as it's HUGE and in the heat can be a",
          "I tried to visit this museum today but discovered conflicting information. First it is not located where the marker is placed on the map. It is at least an Hours drive out of Dohar. I was quoted 300 QR there and back. Their website gives details about visiting which appear to",
          "I have been to Sheikh Faisal's museum a couple of times. Everytime I walk there I imagine all of this is collected by a little curious boy who comes home every might with his pocket's full of stones because every stone is different and beautiful. What you see in the museum",

          "If you have an additional time in Doha, you must visit this museum. But dont be dissappointed, it is not related only with Qatari or regional culture. It has big various collections inside. Many things are involved. You may be interested with regional handcrafts but maybe not be",
          "No one would even think after visiting this museum that all of its content is the outcome of individual person bt a great Qatari art and heritage lover. A must stop even if you are in Doha for 48 hrs.",
          "When you think \"museum\"... you think sterile, quiet, curated. This is not that kind of place. This is a place of wonder and exploration. It is the physical manifestation of a travel and his passion for collecting objects from all ages and areas. Where else can you go and see",
          "Sheikh Faisal has collected pretty much everything you could imagine and spread it all through very large and cavernous buildings just west of Doha. And the whole thing is free which is amazing. We were even told that, later this year, a couple more galleries will open up. We",
          "Worth the 45-60min drive from Doha city center. A great experience, and wonderful to be shared with interested travelers of the world.",
          "It was truly not what I expected to find. The museum has a great private collection, the tour guide was well informed and it was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. I loved that he had dedicated an area for the different religions, something that you rarely find in Qatar.",
          "Couldn't do it all in one trip, will have to go back! Definitely one for those who don't like their museums like lifeless shopping malls. More like a home crossed with a Souq. You have to go on a pre-arranged tour but call as there may be room if you haven't booked. Not well",
          "A museum that was indicated as opened especially during the Eid season was closed. However, a week later we had a chance. Be aware: it takes time to see the whole! = a collection of everything Mr Faisal found of his interest during his travels: very valuable pieces from all over",
          "What doesn't he collect??! The range of items is just incredible and unbelievable. there is so much to look at. I'm not really a museum person but this was such a random and interesting assortment of stuff that I would definitely recommend a visit",

          "Quirky and interesting- the museum is a little amateurish in some respects. It is obviously a personal collection of a wide variety of artefacts but nevertheless well worth a couple of hours mooching around. I'd love to visit again.",

          "Building is great but the collection is limited and most of the items belongs to other countries.. May be Qatar does not have much of the history.. I don't know..",
          "This museum is definitely worth a visit. It is full of some of the most amazing things of all shapes and sizes. It is easy to see that this museum started and still is a personal collection of Sheikh Faisal. I have never seen so many varied exhibits in one museum from cars,",
          "Spent a pleasant afternoon wondering through this museum, some excellent exhibits on display free entry too boot! a bit difficult to find initially mainly due to lack of signage. if traveling from Doha to Dukhan on the Dukhan Express Rd, take the turnoff for the Camel Race",
          "Although it is quite a long way out of Doha (why do they do that??) and confusing with new roadworks going on, it is well worth the visit. There are literally thousands of artefacts in the museum, and it seems to go on and on, from one room to another. One whole basement room",
          "Due the vast amount of roadworks we had a few problems finding this museum but it was well worth the effort. The staff were very helpful and it was explained to us that the museum are carrying out a training program at present to ensure that all new staff members are up to speed",

          "Went to the museum as part of a guided tour, so didn't really spend much time there. However, will definitely be returning next time visitors are in town. It has a very strange collection of items, which are somewhat haphazardly arranged/organised... however, the sheer variety",
          "Having been a regular traveller to Doha over the last 5 years, I did ask myself why I had never ventured into this place before. Even prior to entering within, the place struck me as eccentric since it was located not within the centre of town - you could drive up to the front",

          "It is quite a bit out of town and you will need to keep the taxi with you waiting. But worth it for a visit. Oddball collection of stuff and some not worthy of being there but on the other hand a bit of an amusing collection. The vintage and classic car collection is worth the",

          "I've lived in Doha for about 18 months and had never ventured out to the museum when it was open until this past weekend. It's been on my bucket list and I finally got a chance to go. It's a good 40 minutes from Doha by car up the Dukhan Highway to the Al Shahaniya exit (camel",

          "Absolutely stunning collection. You turn a corner thinking that is the end and it goes on again. It is huge, fascinating & gives such a great insight into life in Qatar, The Middle East, Turkey & parts of Asia. Well worth seeking it out. No fee for entrance and is mostly air",
          "By all accounts Sheikh Faisal is a true gentleman and it is fascinating to see his lifetime's collection; it is like a window into someone's mind. The best bits for me are his cars and the old 'camel chair' - not sure what it is called but it is a covered chair that sits between",
          "This place is wonderful, seems like a big treasure hunt with thousand of objects exhibited in their big rooms and saloons, from clothes, furniture, doors, guns, pistols, old photos of the royal family, costumes, ceramics, jewelery, paintings, the fantastic collection of cars and",

        "wiki": "The Pearl-Qatar (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0624\u0644\u0624\u0629 \u0642\u0637\u0631\u200e) in Doha, Qatar, is an artificial island spanning nearly four square kilometers. It is the first land in Qatar to be available for freehold ownership by foreign nationals. As of 2018, there are 27,000 residents.\nOnce fully completed, The Pearl will create over 32 kilometers of new coastline, for use as a residential estate with an expected 18,831 dwellings and 45,000 residents by 2018. Developed by United Development Company and planned by architecture and design firm Callison, the island is located 350 meters offshore of Doha's West Bay Lagoon area.\nIn 2004, when the project was first revealed, the initial cost of constructing the island stood at $2.5 billion. It is now believed the project will cost $15 billion upon completion.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"The Pearl\" was chosen because the island is being built on one of Qatar's previous major pearl diving sites. Qatar was one of the major pearl traders of Asia before the Japanese introduced cheaper more affordable pearls just before Qatar's oil boom. The Pearl-Qatar helps to represent Qatar's rich past in the pearl industry. Now completed, The Pearl is said to resemble a string of pearls.\n\n\n== Districts ==\nThe Pearl is divided into 12 districts (also referred to as precincts), each of which has a distinct architectural style. The districts are:\n\n\n== Residential development ==\nResidential development on the island is intended to incorporate various national and international themes, including aspects of Arabic, Mediterranean, and European culture.

The largest of the islands will feature a range of luxury villas, apartments, three five-star hotels and over two million square meters of international retail, restaurants, cafes, and entertainment facilities. Eight other private islands will be for sale to private owners with the opportunity to build upon them whatever they wish.\nThe Central Authority Directorate (TCAD), which provides services like property registration and residency permits, opened on 3 December 2011.\n\n\n=== Restaurants ===\nThe Pearl-Qatar is home to a wide selection of dining outlets covering the full range of cuisines from South American to French/Lebanese through to casual options such as Alison Nelson's Coffee Bar.

        "wiki": "Abu Nakhla (Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0646\u062e\u0644\u0629\u200e, romanized: Ab\u016b Nakhlah) is a district in Qatar, located in the municipality of Al-Shahaniya. Previously a village of some importance stood here, but by the 21st century was largely depopulated. It was recorded as a stand-alone district in zone no. 81 with Al Mukaynis in the 2004 census, but both districts lost their census designations to Mebaireek. In 2014, Abu Nakhla was moved from Al Rayyan Municipality to the newly-created Al-Shahaniya Municipality.\nThe district is host to Qatar's only water park. A hospital managed by the Hamad Medical Corporation is based here to meet the health needs for workers of the nearby Doha Industrial Area.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\"Abu\" is the Arabic word for father, and serves to denote a geographical feature. The second word, \"nakhla\", is the local term for a palm tree, and was chosen in reference to a lone palm tree found in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nSituated about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) away from the capital Doha, the district straddles the border of Al Rayyan Municipality and Al-Shahaniya Municipality.\n\n\n=== Abu Nakhla Pond ===\nSince 1985, sewage effluent from Doha has been dumped in a depression (rawda) in Abu Nakhla. Combined with gradual and continuous rainfall during the rainy season, the depression has morphed into a 2 to 3 km pond. Locals have long complained about negative environmental and health effects resulting from the pond, including increased pest populations, foul odors and seepage into aquifers. There is also a strong perception that the sewage water is untreated, and could pose a health hazard. From 2014 to 2015, a study was carried out on the area to investigate potential environmental hazards posed by the pond.The study revealed that, in regards to lithology, the rocks of the pond comprised two members of the Eocene-period Dammam Formation: the Simsima/Umm Bab Member and the Midra Shale Member. The former member is known for its shallow aquifer, as well as for its weak structure and frequent crevices and fissures, which make it susceptible to contamination by sewage leakage from the pond. Of the water quality, the pond was found to contain low amounts of bacterial contaminants due to Qatar's use of sophisticated filtration techniques. Concentrations of heavy metals were also found to be within acceptable ranges.Various species of wildlife currently reside in and around the pond, including frogs, fish, and at least 260 bird species. Approximately 150 greater flamingos have been recorded in the area. Plant life is also abundant here; approximately 10% of Qatar's documented plant species are represented here.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\nQatar's first water park was opened in Abu Nakhla in October 2010. Cypriot company Aqua Masters was responsible for the park's planning and development while Kuwaiti Al Jazeera Entertainment Enterprises Company oversees its operation. Spread out over a 50,000 m\u00b2 area, the park can accommodate up to 3,000 visitors at a time. A 300,000 m\u00b2 tourist resort is under development next to the park.\n\n\n== Agriculture ==\nAs part of the Ministry of Municipality and Environment's Al Azab program to help improve the healthcare for livestock, it was announced in 2019 that a modern veterinary clinic is planned for the district.\n\n\n== Water reservoir ==\nAbu Nakhla is one of five sites for the government-sponsored project to develop reservoirs in the country. Once completed, the reservoirs are expected to be the largest in the world in their category, with a total length of 650 km and constructed at a cost of QR 14.5 billion. In June 2018, the first phase of the project was completed.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "The aquapark is quite a long way out of town, so it's not usually very busy. They have tables and chairs dotted around the whole park. The park isn't huge so its not very difficult to find your way around. The slides seem quite dated and they don't necessarily run the way",

          "Opens only in summer. It opens at the time when the outdoor temperature is 50 deg C average. It is closed when the outdoor temperature is 25 deg C (winter). It is quite unbelievable what the operator is thinking. Village mentality. Entrance is high and it is over crowded. Hard",
          "If its summer in Doha ! then Aqua Park is the best cooling place for family and friends ( there is a special day for ladies only ). Babies and kids pools are available, resturants , toilets and volleyball area as well sometimes if your lucky a DJ and a dance floor is available",

          "It has all the needs of a theme park and that too a water theme park. Since it is the only water theme park in Qatar, it satisfies most.",
          "Went here with my family after hearing so much. Was a big disappointment for the exorbitant price. The kiddie pool was so cold and it's not even winter yet (October). The life guards there said yea it's always been like that. So my kid couldn't enjoy as he was freezing. Not him",
          "The location is understandable that it is bit far from the city. The place is not as big as the one that I had visited in UAE. The rides pretty much ok. Good place to visit after a very long week. Cons; Bit pricey and generally very strict on bring food from outside. The",

          "It used to be a nice destination for kids and families but they are not renovating, the park isn't clean, the restaurants they have are low quality, and the fitting rooms are always crowded and very old..The attractions themselves are nice but there's no variety. My favorite one",

          "You can make evening visit in hot Doha summer. After entrance fee you need to pay again for higher three slides. Sure it worth to its price.",
          "For a water park this is average. There are many pools and in terms of thrills the slides are good if you have the energy to walk up all the steps. It is good for a day out especially if you have children. It can get very crowded and the life guards do not seem to have much",

          "My daughter was desperate to for a day at the water park and seeing as it was her 9th birthday she wanted to go, not for her party, but just with her parents and grandparents. We left the compound on C'ring and simply headed straight out Salwa Road and was there in about 30",
          "If you where in other auqaparks, you will probably be dissapointed. It is small. Not bad, but, really not much to do. We spent there half day with kids, kept going to the same one slide because there was nothing else. The territory is small too. It is ok to visit, but dont",

      "name": "Villaggio Mall",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Villaggio Mall is a shopping mall located in the Aspire Zone in the west end of Doha, the capital city of Qatar. It is located on Al Waab street between the Hyatt Plaza and Sports City and has over 200 stores, including many famous brands in the U.S., U.K., Italian and German markets.Inside, the interiors are Italianate-themed both as an Italian hill town, but also with a 150-meter long indoor canal with gondolas.The Mall was partially re-opened on September 20, 2012, after meeting strict safety standards following the May fire that resulted in 19 lost lives.  Portions of the mall remain closed as a result however, the food court, ice rink, movie theater, Carrefour hypermarket, and many stores are open for business with more opening as they are able to restock their shelves.\n\n\n== Gondolania Theme Park ==\nThe mall contains the Gondolania Theme Park, an indoor theme park which includes the Gondolania Ice Rink, one of two ice hockey rinks in Qatar, which is the home of the Qatar Ice Hockey League and the regional Desert Cup tournament. It is the only Olympic-size rink in Qatar. Also included are a ten pin bowling center and a roller coaster.\n\n\n== 2012 fire ==\nOn 28 May 2012 at around 11 A.M. a major fire broke out in the Villaggio Mall, triggering an alarm described by an eyewitness as being \"a very benign fire alarm, almost like a door bell\". At first many were not worried as there had been a recent false alarm.As the fire engulfed the Gympanzee nursery, the entrances to the nursery became blocked by smoke, trapping 13 children and four staff inside. Firefighters from the Qatari Civil Defense force were forced to break a hole in the roof of the mall to attempt a rescue. Along with the 17 trapped in the nursery, two firefighters were killed. The victims included children from Spain, New Zealand, France, Japan, South Africa and The Philippines; along with three Filipino teachers and one teacher from South Africa.There were also 17 injured persons as a result of smoke inhalation, most of them members of the Qatari Civil Defense force. A total of 19 people lost their lives - 13 being children; three of them triplets from New Zealand. The investigation committee revealed that an electrical fault at the Nike store as the cause of the deadly fire. It also found that all parties concerned had lacked adherence in varying degrees to related laws, systems and safety measures.The father of the killed triplets later said proper post-mortems weren't carried out on his children, despite the presence of \"highly flammable paint and illegal flammable mouldings\" at the mall. He blamed a closed emergency exit at the mall's daycare centre for the children's deaths.It is still unclear whether or not Gympanzee was operating without a license from the Supreme Educational Council, as they had recently relinquished licensing duties to the Ministry of Social Affairs. An official at the ministry claimed that no license had ever been issued by their offices.\n\n\n=== Response and trials ===\nShortly following the fire, Qatar's Attorney General, Dr. Ali al-Marri, issued the arrest of five people in connection with the incident, as well as the detention of both the manager and assistant manager of Villaggio, Tzoulios Tzoulio and Rami Itani, respectively. The assistant director of mall security, Mohammed Abdul Rahman, was also detained in connection with the case.In June 2013, a lower court found five defendants guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and sentenced each to six years in jail (the maximum allowable sentence). Rami Itani and Mohammed Rahman were both acquitted. Husband and wife co-owners of Gympanzee, Sheikh Ali bin Jassim al-Thani and Iman Al-Kuwari were among those convicted, along with Tzoulios Tzoulio and Abdulaziz bin Mohammed al-Rabban. The last guilty verdict fell to Mansour Nasir Fazza al-Shahwani, the Ministry of Business and Trade employee that issued Gympanzee its permits, Mr. al-Shahwani was sentenced to five years in jail.Co-owner of Gympanzee, Sheikh Ali bin Jassim al-Thani, is Qatar's ambassador to Belgium and is part of the powerful al-Thani family, his wife, Iman al-Kuwari, is the daughter of the then-Minister of Culture, Art, and Heritage, Hamad Bin Abdulaziz Al-Kawari.\nAbdulaziz bin Mohammed al-Rabban is a private-businessman who owns the Qatari Company for Real Estate and Commercial Projects (Villaggio). During his closing arguments, which are reported to have lasted approximately five hours, Mr. Rabban's defense attorney claimed that his client didn't own any shares in the mall and was not a partner in the company that owned the mall. Despite these claims, Mr. Rabban remained listed on the mall's website under \u201ckey people\u201d as Villagio's chairman. Mr. Rabban's defense attorney's tactics were heavily criticized by one of the parents of the victims that attended the hearing: \u201cIt is quite frustrating how the defense lawyer continues to make a mockery out of court, joking around inappropriately and wasting time. Additionally, what\u2019s absurd is for him to the pin the blame on the Nike store employee,\u201d Raghda Kabbani \u2013 who lost her three-year-old daughter Hana in the fire.\u201d\n\n\n=== Appeal process and acquittal ===\nDuring the appeal process, all those convicted remained free and able to travel; this was most clearly evident in the case of Sheikh al-Thani who remained in Brussels as a diplomat despite being convicted of manslaughter nearly two years prior. Furthermore, all defendants were absent from the final appeal hearing. During the hearing, Judge Abdalrahman al-Sharafi declared that he would be excluding all testimonies given by the victim's family as evidence, claiming that one cannot be a witness and a plaintiff in the same case.Judge al-Sharafi further agreed with the owners of Gympanzee in their claim that it was not technically nursery, but an \u201centertainment centre\u201d. This decision fell inline with the civil employee that decided to license it as such. After establishing that Gympanzee was an entertainment centre rather than a nursery, the co-owners were fare less criminally-accountable under Qatari law.On the 26th of October, 2015 Qatar's Appeals court overturned all five convictions and dropped all charges. The decision was met with shock and disappointment by the families of the blaze victims. During the judge's five-hour reading of the verdict some victim's family members reportedly stormed out of the court in anger.\nWhile Mr. Rabban was also cleared of his involuntary manslaughter charge, the court found that his company was guilty of the same crime and, as such; Villaggio and its insurance company would have to pay a fine of only $5,500, and compensation to the victim's families.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nVillaggio Mall\nList of shops & restaurants at Villaggio Mall",

        "wiki": "Villaggio Mall is a shopping mall located in the Aspire Zone in the west end of Doha, the capital city of Qatar. It is located on Al Waab street between the Hyatt Plaza and Sports City and has over 200 stores, including many famous brands in the U.S., U.K., Italian and German markets.Inside, the interiors are Italianate-themed both as an Italian hill town, but also with a 150-meter long indoor canal with gondolas.The Mall was partially re-opened on September 20, 2012, after meeting strict safety standards following the May fire that resulted in 19 lost lives.  Portions of the mall remain closed as a result however, the food court, ice rink, movie theater, Carrefour hypermarket, and many stores are open for business with more opening as they are able to restock their shelves.\n\n\n== Gondolania Theme Park ==\nThe mall contains the Gondolania Theme Park, an indoor theme park which includes the Gondolania Ice Rink, one of two ice hockey rinks in Qatar, which is the home of the Qatar Ice Hockey League and the regional Desert Cup tournament. It is the only Olympic-size rink in Qatar. Also included are a ten pin bowling center and a roller coaster.\n\n\n== 2012 fire ==\nOn 28 May 2012 at around 11 A.M. a major fire broke out in the Villaggio Mall, triggering an alarm described by an eyewitness as being \"a very benign fire alarm, almost like a door bell\". At first many were not worried as there had been a recent false alarm.As the fire engulfed the Gympanzee nursery, the entrances to the nursery became blocked by smoke, trapping 13 children and four staff inside. Firefighters from the Qatari Civil Defense force were forced to break a hole in the roof of the mall to attempt a rescue. Along with the 17 trapped in the nursery, two firefighters were killed. The victims included children from Spain, New Zealand, France, Japan, South Africa and The Philippines; along with three Filipino teachers and one teacher from South Africa.There were also 17 injured persons as a result of smoke inhalation, most of them members of the Qatari Civil Defense force. A total of 19 people lost their lives - 13 being children; three of them triplets from New Zealand. The investigation committee revealed that an electrical fault at the Nike store as the cause of the deadly fire. It also found that all parties concerned had lacked adherence in varying degrees to related laws, systems and safety measures.The father of the killed triplets later said proper post-mortems weren't carried out on his children, despite the presence of \"highly flammable paint and illegal flammable mouldings\" at the mall. He blamed a closed emergency exit at the mall's daycare centre for the children's deaths.It is still unclear whether or not Gympanzee was operating without a license from the Supreme Educational Council, as they had recently relinquished licensing duties to the Ministry of Social Affairs. An official at the ministry claimed that no license had ever been issued by their offices.\n\n\n=== Response and trials ===\nShortly following the fire, Qatar's Attorney General, Dr. Ali al-Marri, issued the arrest of five people in connection with the incident, as well as the detention of both the manager and assistant manager of Villaggio, Tzoulios Tzoulio and Rami Itani, respectively. The assistant director of mall security, Mohammed Abdul Rahman, was also detained in connection with the case.In June 2013, a lower court found five defendants guilty of involuntary manslaughter, and sentenced each to six years in jail (the maximum allowable sentence). Rami Itani and Mohammed Rahman were both acquitted. Husband and wife co-owners of Gympanzee, Sheikh Ali bin Jassim al-Thani and Iman Al-Kuwari were among those convicted, along with Tzoulios Tzoulio and Abdulaziz bin Mohammed al-Rabban. The last guilty verdict fell to Mansour Nasir Fazza al-Shahwani, the Ministry of Business and Trade employee that issued Gympanzee its permits, Mr. al-Shahwani was sentenced to five years in jail.Co-owner of Gympanzee, Sheikh Ali bin Jassim al-Thani, is Qatar's ambassador to Belgium and is part of the powerful al-Thani family, his wife, Iman al-Kuwari, is the daughter of the then-Minister of Culture, Art, and Heritage, Hamad Bin Abdulaziz Al-Kawari.\nAbdulaziz bin Mohammed al-Rabban is a private-businessman who owns the Qatari Company for Real Estate and Commercial Projects (Villaggio). During his closing arguments, which are reported to have lasted approximately five hours, Mr. Rabban's defense attorney claimed that his client didn't own any shares in the mall and was not a partner in the company that owned the mall. Despite these claims, Mr. Rabban remained listed on the mall's website under \u201ckey people\u201d as Villagio's chairman. Mr. Rabban's defense attorney's tactics were heavily criticized by one of the parents of the victims that attended the hearing: \u201cIt is quite frustrating how the defense lawyer continues to make a mockery out of court, joking around inappropriately and wasting time. Additionally, what\u2019s absurd is for him to the pin the blame on the Nike store employee,\u201d Raghda Kabbani \u2013 who lost her three-year-old daughter Hana in the fire.\u201d\n\n\n=== Appeal process and acquittal ===\nDuring the appeal process, all those convicted remained free and able to travel; this was most clearly evident in the case of Sheikh al-Thani who remained in Brussels as a diplomat despite being convicted of manslaughter nearly two years prior. Furthermore, all defendants were absent from the final appeal hearing. During the hearing, Judge Abdalrahman al-Sharafi declared that he would be excluding all testimonies given by the victim's family as evidence, claiming that one cannot be a witness and a plaintiff in the same case.Judge al-Sharafi further agreed with the owners of Gympanzee in their claim that it was not technically nursery, but an \u201centertainment centre\u201d. This decision fell inline with the civil employee that decided to license it as such. After establishing that Gympanzee was an entertainment centre rather than a nursery, the co-owners were fare less criminally-accountable under Qatari law.On the 26th of October, 2015 Qatar's Appeals court overturned all five convictions and dropped all charges. The decision was met with shock and disappointment by the families of the blaze victims. During the judge's five-hour reading of the verdict some victim's family members reportedly stormed out of the court in anger.\nWhile Mr. Rabban was also cleared of his involuntary manslaughter charge, the court found that his company was guilty of the same crime and, as such; Villaggio and its insurance company would have to pay a fine of only $5,500, and compensation to the victim's families.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nVillaggio Mall\nList of shops & restaurants at Villaggio Mall",

        "wiki": "Souq Waqif (Arabic: \u0633\u0648\u0642 \u0648\u0627\u0642\u0641 S\u016bq W\u0101qif, \"the standing market\") is a marketplace (souq) in Doha, in the state of Qatar. The souq is noted for selling traditional garments, spices, handicrafts, and souvenirs. It is also home to dozens of restaurants and Shisha lounges. Although it dates back at least a hundred years, it was renovated in 2006 to conserve its traditional Qatari architectural style. It is often perceived to be the only lasting area in Doha that retains an authentic feel notably in reference to its commerce, architecture and culture. The area is very popular with locals and expats alike (especially on weekends) as it offers multiple dining options in the same location.\n\n\n== Location ==\nIt is located in the district of Al Souq which is situated in the center of Doha. As it was a market used for trading activities, the area used to be located immediately adjoining the shore to allow for boats to access it. Although still facing the water, the direct link to the water front for boats is now divided by a major road and the recently completed park.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe souq was founded at least a century ago in proximity of the dry river bed known as Wadi Musheireb. It was a gathering place where Bedouins and locals would trade a variety of goods, primarily livestock goods. However with the boom in prosperity in the 1990s, the Souq fell in decline and in 2003, most of it was destroyed in a fire. This event initiated a restoration program by the government in 2006, with the purpose of preserving its architectural and historical identity. The first phase of restoration was funded by the Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifah al Thani and his wife Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. Buildings constructed after the 1950s were demolished whereas older structures were refurbished. The restoration was completed in 2008. Traditional heating methods are employed by utilizing wood and bamboo imported from various areas of Asia.\n\n\n== Architecture and heritage ==\n\nSeveral streets that appear as mazes with no defined geometric pattern are characteristic of  these Middle-Eastern markets (souq). The Souq offers several small shops lined along these paths with a dazzling array of Middle Eastern merchandise from spices and seasonal delicacies to perfumes, jewellery, clothing and handicrafts. Traditional music, art and cultural shows add to the ambience of this historic place.\nLow-rise buildings, generally only single-storied are a peculiar characteristic of Qatari Architecture. This is in keeping with regional planning principles and then available local materials such as bamboo, mud (soil) and palm fond (leaves of the date palm tree). All buildings in this market are rough plastered and small openings face the streets (generally faced a courtyard in former residential buildings). Wind towers were used in residential buildings and one such property exists at one end of the market.\nPost renovations in the last decade, 2 underground parking lots for over 3000 cars have been added. In addition to the main square that faces the park and waterfront, a new square has been added around the center of the whole development. Water features to allow for climate control seem to be planned at the new square also.\n\n\n== Tourism and attractions ==\n\nThe souq is considered one of the best location for tourists within Doha. Thousands of people from across the region frequent it to purchase traditional goods. It hosts several art galleries, events and local concerts.\nA yearly spring festival around April hosts many theatricals, acrobatics and musical performances. An event featuring WWE wrestlers, called Souq Waqif Storm, attracted the most spectators. There was discussion over the possibility of a repeat festival.\n\n\n== Pet area ==\n\nThere are pet stalls in Souq Waqif which sell a variety of domestic pets, including dogs, cats, rabbits, turtles and birds. The sub-par living conditions of the pets has been the subject of advocacy campaigns in recent years, with proponents arguing that the animals suffer from a lack of proper healthcare and exposure to adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, some customers allege that stall owners falsify vaccination records. There is also a separate area in the souq reserved for falcon handling. The Bird souq, as it's called, sells not only falcons but also the needed accessories such as landing pads and GPS guidance systems for the birds. Within the vicinity is also a Falcon Hospital.\n\n\n== Al Rayyan Theatre ==\nA 980-seat indoor theatre known as Al Rayyan Theatre is located in the souq.\n\n\n== Souq Waqif Art Centre ==\n\nThe Souq Waqif Art Centre is located close to the Fish Market. The Centre combines a selection of small and artistic shops with a number of exhibition rooms laid out around a long narrow courtyard. Outside the rooms lie sculptures and chests inlaid with turtle shell.\nExhibitions have included The Islamic Arts exhibition, with displays of ancient calligraphy, some dating back centuries, and displays of carpets and photography.\nThe Souq Waqif was used as a filming location for a number of films screened at the Doha Tribeca Film Festival 2009, including the action film 'Dohard' directed by Dean Alexandrou and Masato Riesser, and produced by Waheed Khan, and 'The Haggler' directed and produced by the DTFF.\n\n\n== Souq Waqif boutique hotels ==\nA collection of 9 uniquely stylized hotels form part of the market. These properties are spread across the main development and offer varied features from traditional to fairly modern. The properties are unique in their offering and highlight local aesthetics and character. A series of old houses have also been combined to showcase life in courtyard houses in Qatar. Some of the properties offer unique sea facing views with the unobstructed skyline of Doha across the harbour.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe official Website of Souq Waqif Art Center",

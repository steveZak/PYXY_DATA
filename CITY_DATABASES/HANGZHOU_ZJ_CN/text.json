        "wiki": "West Lake (Chinese: \u897f\u6e56; pinyin: X\u012b H\u00fa; Wu: Si-wu) is a freshwater lake in Hangzhou, China. It is divided into five sections by three causeways. There are numerous temples, pagodas, gardens, and artificial islands within the lake.\n\nWest Lake has influenced poets and painters throughout Chinese history for its natural beauty and historic relics, and it has also been among the most important sources of inspiration for Chinese garden designers. It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011, described as having \"influenced garden design in the rest of China as well as Japan and Korea over the centuries\" and reflecting \"an idealized fusion between humans and nature\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest recorded name for West Lake was the \"Wu Forest River\" (W\u01d4l\u00edn Shu\u01d0). The Book of Han's \"Geography Column\" says, \"Qiantang, affiliated to the western governor general. Wu Forest Mountain (W\u01d4l\u00ednsh\u0101n) is the origin of the Wu Forest River. Running east into the sea, it covers 830 li\" (roughly, 350 km or 220 mi). Other former names include the \"Qian River\", \"Qiantang Lake\", \"Mingsheng Lake\", \"Jinniu Lake\", \"Shihan Lake\", \"Shang Lake\", \"Lianyan Lake\", \"Fangsheng Pond\", \"Xizi Lake\", \"Gaoshi Lake\", \"Xiling Lake\", \"Meiren Lake\", \"Xianzhe Lake\", and \"Mingyue Lake\". But only two names were widely accepted in history and recorded in historical documents. One is \"Qiantang Lake\", due to the fact that Hangzhou was called \"Qiantang\" in ancient times. The other name is \"West Lake\", due to the lake being west of the city. The name \"West Lake\" first appeared in two poems of Bai Juyi, \"Bestowed on guests as returning from West Lake in the evening and looking back to Gushan Temple\" (\u897f\u6e56\u665a\u6b78\u56de\u671b\u5b64\u5c71\u5bfa\u8d08\u8af8\u5ba2) and \"On the returning boat to Hangzhou\" (\u676d\u5dde\u56de\u822b). Since the Northern Song dynasty, most poems and articles of scholars used the name \"West Lake\", while the name \"Qiantang Lake\" was gradually deprecated. \"The request of dredging West Lake\" written by Su Shi was the first time that \"West Lake\" appeared in an official document.\n\n\n=== Qin dynasty ===\nOver 2,000 years ago, West Lake was still a part of the Qiantang River. Due to soil sedimentation, the feet of Wu Mountain and Baoshi Mountains, the surrounding mountains on the northern and southern sides of the lake, gradually stretched to form shoal heads. Later, these sand spits slowly merged into a bank, to which a lagoon emerged to the west; this was the old West Lake of the Qin and Han dynasties. \"West Lake Dream Searching\" (\u897f\u6e56\u5922\u5c0b), written by Zhang Dai, relates the story that Qin Shi Huang visited the area and moored his boat to a stone later developed into the Big Stone Buddhist Temple. The stone was located on Baoshi Mountain, north of the West Lake, and can still be seen.\n\n\n=== Sui dynasty ===\nThe short-lived Sui dynasty is noted for the great engineering works which it accomplished during its brief existence. After AD 610, the Jiangnan Canal was opened and connected to the North Canal. Thus, five major rivers of China (the Hai, Yellow, Huai, Yangtze, and Qiantang) were all connected: this facilitated transportation to and from Hangzhou and thus boosted the regional economy. Tourism in Hangzhou also started to boom.\n\n\n=== Tang dynasty ===\nIn the Tang dynasty, West Lake had an area of roughly 10.8 square kilometers. The western and southern parts of the lake all extended to the foot of West Hill. The northeastern part stretched to Wulin Gate area. Pilgrims could take the boat to the hill-foot and walk up to the hill to worship. Due to the ongoing aggradation of the lake, together with the virtual lack of any hydraulic projects, in those days, the lake would flood after heavy rains and dry up during long droughts.\n\nIn September 781, Li Mi (\u674e\u6ccc) was appointed the governor of Hangzhou. In order to supply fresh water, he creatively induced the water into the city. He ordered six wells dug in populous areas like Qiantang Gate and Yongjin Gate, and set up a \"shadow conduit\" (underground clay and bamboo pipes) to introduce lake water into the city. The six wells have long vanished today. The only existing relic from that time is the Xiangguo Well, located west of Jinting Bridge on Jiefang Road. The other five wells were Xi Well (to the west of Xiangguo Well), Fang Well (or Four-eyed Well), Jinniu Well (northwest of Xi Well), Baigui Well (west of Longxiang Bridge), and Xiaofang Well (or Six-eyed Well, inside Qiantang Gate, now Xiaoche Bridge area).\nIn the middle of the Zhenyuan era (785-804) in the Tang dynasty, poet and government official Bai Juyi was appointed the governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished and famous poet, his deeds at Hangzhou made him a great governor. He realized that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the beauty of West Lake, visiting the lake almost every day. He ordered the construction of a causeway to allow crossing part of the lake on foot, instead of requiring the services of a boat. A causeway, the Baisha Causeway, is now commonly referred to as Bai Causeway (\u767d\u5824) in Bai Juyi's honour, but the original Bai Causeway no longer exists.\n\n\n=== Five Dynasties ===\nThe most prominent eras in Hangzhou's development history, the Wuyue Kingdom (907\u2013960) and Southern Song dynasty, had great impacts on West Lake. The comprehensive development and fundamental layout of West Lake occurred in these two Dynasties. During Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the Wuyue Kingdom made Hangzhou its capital. It facilitated the transportation to coastal regions, and promoted trading with foreign countries like Japan and Korea. In the meantime, successive rulers in the Wuyue Kingdom paid great tribute to Buddhism, and built a number of temples, pagodas, shrines and grottos around the lake area. They expanded Lingyin Temple, founded Zhaoqing Temple, Jingci Temple, Li'an Temple, Liutong Temple and Taoguang Temple, and built Baochu Pagoda, Liuhe Pagoda, Leifeng Pagoda and White Pagoda. The area was thus acclaimed as \"Buddhist Country\". Lingyin Temple, Tianzhu Temple and the tide of Qiantang were the most famous scenic spots at that time. Due to the geological characteristics, earth deposited speedly in West Lake and dredging became a routine maintenance. Thus in AD 927, the king of Wuyue, Qian Liu, installed a lake-dredging army of 1,000 to mow grasses and deepen springs, and preserved the water body of the lake.\n\n\n=== Song dynasty (The Northern Song and The Southern Song) ===\nOver one hundred years later, at the beginning of the Song dynasty's Yuanyou era (1086\u20131094), another great poet, Su Shi (also known as Su Dongpo), came to Hangzhou to serve as its governor. At that time, the farmers suffered greatly drought again, due to overgrowth of the weeds at the bottom of the lake clogging the irrigation ducts. He ordered dredging of the lake and piled up all the mud into another causeway, in the style of Bai Causeway, but much wider and nearly three times as long: he also planted willow trees along its banks. This causeway was later named after him as the \"Su Causeway\". There are six bridges along the 2.6 km (1.6 mi) Su Causeway (\u8607\u5824), and they are called separately Yingbo (\u6620\u6ce2), Suolan (\u9501\u6f9c), Wangshan (\u671b\u5c71), Yadi (\u538b\u5824), Dongpu (\u4e1c\u6d66), and Kuahong (\u8de8\u8679) Bridge, which all symbolize the characteristics of the bridge itself and also expose the structural beauty and its colorful connotation. \"Dawn on the Su Causeway in Spring \u8607\u5824\u6625\u66c9\" is one of the attractions.\nWu Zimu described the extravagance in his \"Mengliang lu\" (Dreaming Over a Bowl of Millet) (\u5922\u7cb1\u9304), \"The life in Lin'an is luxurious in all seasons, full of delight and appreciation with no idle days. In the west there is a lovely lake with arresting scenes, and in the east the river tides are spectacular. Both are miracles.\" Besides pilgrims, the tourists in Hangzhou included envoys of foreign countries, businessmen, monks and scholar candidates of the imperial examination. The beauty of West Lake started to gain wide reputation. In those days, boating on the lake was a popular entertainment. According to records, there were hundreds of boats in the West Lake. All were delicately built, with exquisite carving and decorations, and glided gracefully on the water. Poet Lin Sheng vividly described the ostentation in his poem \"On a hotel wall in Lin'an\". In addition, poet Yang Wanli also acclaimed the engaging scenery of West Lake in the poem \"Coming out of Jingci Temple at dawn to see Lin Zifang off\", which greatly show how thriving this metropolis was at that time and how yearning it was for people at that time. The renowned painter Muqi Fachang came here and refounded the abandoned monastery Liutong Temple in 1215.\n\n\n=== Yuan dynasty ===\nIn the Yuan dynasty, West Lake was still socially thriving, with a population full of exuberance for singing and dancing. Volume 23 of the Book of Yuan says, in the 2nd year of the Zhida era (1309), \"in Hangzhou, Jiang-Zhe area, during half a year there were more than 1,200 foreign visitors. Foreigners Sangwu and Baoheding brought lions, panthers, crows and falcons. They stayed for 27 days. People and animals ate meat of more than 1,300 jin.\" Increasing number of businessmen and travelers from countries of Turkestan and western Europe came to visit Hangzhou. The most famous among them was Venetian explorer Marco Polo, who complimented Hangzhou in his travel notes as \"the most splendid heavenly city in the world\". In the late Yuan dynasty, there were \"Qiantang Ten Scenic Spots\", in addition to the \"West Lake Ten Scenic Spots\" of the Southern Song dynasty; the existence of which expanded the scope of tourism. During the Zhiyuan era of the reign of Kublai Khan, the lake was dredged, and renamed \"pond of freeing captive animals\" (\u653e\u751f\u6c60). Some of the lake area was gradually enriched and became cultivated zones. In the late Yuan dynasty, West Lake lacked governmental attention, and plutocrats and noblemen enclosed water zones, so that the lake deteriorated into a desolate state with most of its area silting up and turning into swampland.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty ===\n\nIn the later Yuan Dynasty and beginning of the Ming Dynasty, people attributed the collapse of the Southern Song Dynasty to the West Lake, because the upper class and emperors indulge themselves into the melody and wine with the sceneries of the lake. Therefore, people and the govern's didn't want to make it clean and thriving in case that this kind of thing happened again. But later in the Ming dynasty, Hangzhou began to restore its prosperity in the Xuande and Zhengtong eras (1426\u20131449). Then, the local government kept a close watch on West Lake. In the 16th year of the Hongzhi era (one source suggests it was the 3rd year of the Zhengde era) the then governor Yang Mengying (\u694a\u5b5f\u745b), with the support of special envoy Ju Liang (\u8eca\u7cb1), obtained approval to dredge the lake, despite much resistance from local magnates. This project was funded by the Engineering Department. The West Lake Visit Guide (\u897f\u6e56\u6e38\u89bd\u5fd7) recorded, \"The work commenced in February... It took 152 days, and 6,700,000 men at a cost of 23,607 silver taels, and the removal of 3,481 acres of illegal fields... Thus, West Lake was restored to its image in the Tang and Song dynasties.\" The dredging project extended the water surface from west of Su Causeway to Hongchun Bridge and Mao Jia Bu. The excavated silt was used to broaden Su Causeway, and also used to build a long causeway in western Inside Lake, called \"Yanggong Causeway\" (\u694a\u516c\u5824).\nBoth in the Ming and Qing dynasties, West Lake was dredged several times. The silt dug up was heaped to form two islands in the lake, \"Huxin Island\" and \"Xiao Ying Zhou\".\nIn 1607, the governor of Qiantang County, Nie Xintang (\u8076\u5fc3\u6e6f), constructed a circular causeway from south to west outside the Fangsheng Pond of the island \"Xiao Ying Zhou\", which resulted in a unique view of \"Island in Lake, Lake in Island\". In 1611, Yang Wanli subsequently built the outer bank, and the whole plot was realized by 1620. Outside the pond were erect three small stony pagodas, called \"Three Ponds (or Pools) Mirroring the Moon\" (\u4e09\u6f6d\u5370\u6708; s\u0101n t\u00e1n y\u00ecn yu\u00e8), which often give also their name to the Xiao Ying island.\n\n\n=== Qing Dynasty ===\n\nThe Kangxi and Qianlong emperors of the Qing dynasty toured South China and stopping by Hangzhou many times; which helped to expedite the revamping and rehabilitation of West Lake. The Kangxi Emperor visited Hangzhou five times, and wrote the names of \"Ten Scenic Spots of West Lake\" selected in the Southern Song dynasty. The local governor then inscribed the emperor's handwriting onto stelae and built pavilions over them. Thereafter those scenes such as \"Two Peaks Piercing the Clouds\" and \"Moon over the Peaceful Lake in Autumn\" acquired fixed locations for appreciation. During the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, \"Eighteen Scenic Sites of West Lake\" had developed into a new nomenclature together with enriched tourism resources. The Qianlong Emperor visited Hangzhou six times, composing poems as well as erecting stelae for the \"Ten Scenic Spots\". He also wrote names for \"Eight Scenic Spots of Dragon Well\", bringing renown to the mountainous scenery of remote the Dragon Well region (Longjing). In the Qianlong era, two Hangzhou natives, brothers Qu Hao and Qu Han, co-authored a book called \"A Glance at Lakes and Hills\", recording as many as 1,016 tourist spots around West Lake. This is the earliest known travel guide in Hangzhou.\nDuring the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, West Lake still preserved a water area of 7.54 square kilometers, but more than 20 acres (81,000 m2) were shoals. Due to extensive dredging projects, the lake area spread beyond the west of now Xishan Road to the neighborhood of Hongchun Bridge, Maojia Bu, Turtle Pond, and Chishan Bu. In the fifth year of the Yongzheng era, the governor of Zhejiang and Right Vice Director of the Court of Censors, Li Wei, spent 42,742 silver taels to dredge the lake. He built stone weirs in Jinsha Harbor, Chishan Bu, Jingjia Hill and Maojia Bu in order to store water and to flush out the lake silt. In 1800, Yan Jian (\u984f\u6aa2), the governor of Zhejiang, beseeched the imperial court to support a hydraulic project in West Lake. The project was supervised by the governor of Zhejiang, Ruan Yuan, who had the excavated silt piled into a mound, which was then named \"Ruan Gong Dun\" (\u962e\u516c\u58a9; 'Lord Ruan's Pier'). By then, the modern configuration of West Lake was determined. In 1864, the West Lake Dredging Bureau was founded, and a Qiantang native, Ding Bin, was appointed as director.\n\n\n=== Republican era to the end of the 20th century ===\nFrom the end of the Qing dynasty to the Republican era, the Shanghai\u2013Hangzhou\u2013Ningbo and the Zhejiang\u2013Jiangxi railways as well as the Hangzhou\u2013Shanghai, Hangzhou\u2013Nanjing, and Hangzhou\u2013Ningbo highways were built. This facilitation of transportation encouraged the development of Hangzhou's tourism industry. Besides traditional pilgrims, more and more travelers came from domestic cities like Shanghai and Nanjing as well as from Europe, the United States and Japan. \"The special memorial edition of Hangzhou government 10th anniversary\" says, from 1930\u20131936, the recorded tourists to Hangzhou were counted to 32,845.\n\nHangzhou's tourism resources became more abundant in the Republican era, as scenic spots and cultural relics were steadily added around West Lake. The government converted the imperial garden of the imperial palace remaining from the Qing dynasty into a park, on Solitary Hill. In 1927, the park was renamed \"Zhongshan Park\" or \"Sun Yat-sen Park\". On the left side of the park, the Zhejiang Martyrs' Memorial was built, honoring those deceased when the Zhejiang army captured Jinling. In addition, tombs for Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin were constructed near Xiling Bridge. In 1917, the Dabei Pavilion in Lingyin Temple was erected, and the Yue Wang Temple and Yue Fei's tomb were renovated several times. From 1923 to 1931, the Huanglong Dong was built. From 1923 to 1924, the deserted Qian King Temple was renovated and converted to a garden. In 1933, the leaning Baochu Pagoda was revamped.\nThe construction of parks in Hangzhou started with Lakeside Park in the Republican era. In 1912, the military government of Zhejiang demolished the city walls from Qiantang Gate to Yongjin Gate as well as the fortress of banners, and built Hubing Rd along the lakeside. Hurdles were put up 20 meters from the lake and flowers and trees were planted. The area was called \"Lakeside Park\", covering around one Chinese mile and was divided into five parks, first to fifth. In the spring of 1930, the city government paved a land of around 21 mu with mud dredged out of the lake from north of Changsheng Rd to Qiantang Gate, and founded Sixth Park. From 1928-1933, Zhejiang's provincial government erected \"Chen Yingshi Statue\", \"North Expedition Martyr Memorial Tower\" and \"Martyrs of 88 Division in Songhu Campaign Memorial Stela\" at the piers of Third Park, Second Park and Fifth Park, respectively.\nDue to continuous digging by stealth on its base, Leifeng Pagoda, after lasting nearly a thousand years, collapsed all of a sudden on September 25, 1924. It was shocking news in media. Lu Xun purposely wrote \"Comment on the Collapse of Leifeng Pagoda\" and \"Second Comment on the Collapse of Leifeng Pagoda\", making a remark on this incident. The fall of Leifeng Pagoda also put an end to one of \"Ten Scenes of West Lake\", \"Leifeng Pagoda in the Sunset\" (\u96f7\u5cf0\u5915\u7167).\nFrom June 6 to October 20, 1929, the government of Zhejiang hosted the first \"West Lake Expo\", and total participants numbered over 20 million. The location of West Lake Expo was set at areas around the lakeside, such as Broken Bridge, Solitary Hill, Yue-Wang Temple, and North Hill. The primary purpose of the expo was to promote national products and encourage enterprises. Besides over 1,000 delegate groups from nationwide, involved included delegates from America, Japan, Britain, Indonesia and other countries. It was the largest and longest pageant in Hangzhou during the Republican era.\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Hangzhou was among the first places opened to tourism. The city government preserved the mountain area around the lake and planted a large number of trees. Meanwhile, West Lake was extensively dredged. Within West Lake scenery zone, a new botanical garden and flower garden was opened. Fish Viewing at the Flower Pond (\u82b1\u6e2f\u89c0\u9b5a) park, and Orioles Singing in the Willows (\u67f3\u6d6a\u805e\u9daf) park were constructed. Fish Viewing at the Jade Springs and Yongjin Park were rebuilt. Lingyin Temple, Jingci Temple, Yue-Wang Temple, Three Ponds Mirroring the Moon (\u4e09\u6f6d\u5370\u6708), Lake-heart Pavilion and other spots were renovated. In addition, West Huanhu Rd (Xishan Rd), Longjin Rd and Jiuxi Rd were newly built. In 1959, West Lake of Hangzhou received over 1,400 foreign tourists, over 2,300 tourists from Hong Kong and Macao and over five million domestic visitors.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution Liutong Temple and another temple were destroyed.After the Cultural Revolution, the number of tourists to West Lake increased again. In 1978, it received 53,000 tourists from overseas and Hong Kong and Macao combined, in addition to about six million domestic travelers.\nIn May 1983, the state council named Hangzhou \"Famed Historical and Cultural City\" and \"National Key Scenic Tourism City\". In September 1984, the executive office of state council instructed that Hangzhou evolve to the tourism center of Southeast China and a first-class international scenic tourism city. Thereafter Hangzhou government refurbished Lingyin Temple, Tianzhu Temple, Jingci Temple, Yue-Wang Temple, Dacheng Hall, stela pavilions of \"Ten Scenes\" and other relics. Resorts such as Galloping Tiger Spring were expanded. Curved Yard and Lotus Pool in Summer (\u66f2\u9662\u98a8\u8377) park was founded. New spot \"Exploring Plum Blossoms at Ling Peak\" (\u9748\u5cf0\u63a2\u6885) was opened. Archaizing carnivals were held in Huanglong Dong and Ruangong Dun. There were also night gardens and music night markets for amusement.\nIn 1949, West Lake silted up, with average depth of merely 0.55 meters and capacity only 4 million cubic meters. Marshy weeds blanketed the lake bed so that large boat could only make their ways through specific channels. In 1950, the government listed West Lake dredging as a national investment project. Hangzhou launched the West Lake Dredging Project in 1951 to excavate the silt thoroughly. By 1954, all the work had been mechanized. The project concluded in 1959. As a result, the achieved average depth was 1.808 meters with nadir of 2.6 meters. The capacity elevated to 10,271,900 cubic meters. The silt was used to fill 18 ponds or lacunae in surrounding areas including Zhaoqing Temple and Qingbo Park. However, because of the erosion and sediment on lake bed afterward, the depth of the water lessened to 1.47 meters. The government thus invested two million yuan in 1976 to dredge the lake again. By 1980, the depth increased to 1.5 meters. Besides dredging work, the city government substantially fortified the lake shore, resulting in a bank of total length of 29,800 meters. That was the largest bank enhancement project in the history of West Lake. Along with the project, more than 10 piers for mooring the boats were renovated or newly built in Lakeside Park, Zhongshan Park, Yue Fei's tomb and both sides of Su Causeway.\nThe West Lake Diversion Project was inaugurated on 1 February 1985. The project built a pump at Zhakou section of Qiantang River, and drew 300,000 cubic meters of water daily, equivalent to one thirty-third of total capacity of the lake. As a consequence, the lake's water body transparency was increased by 5 to 7 cm. Other the other hand, The lake-wide sewage interception project was launched in 1978, and was finished in 1981. It was divided into three branches, southern, western and northern, buried sewage tunnels of over 17 kilometers, and was equipped with 10 pumping stations.\n\nIn 1984, five organizations including Hangzhou Daily newspaper sponsored voting for the \"New Ten Scenes in West Lake\". The elected new scenes are Cloud-Sustained Path in a Bamboo Grove (\u96f2\u68f2\u7af9\u5f91), Misty Trees by Nine Streams (\u4e5d\u6eaa\u7159\u6a39), Dreams at Galloping Tiger Spring (\u864e\u8dd1\u5922\u6cc9), Yellow Dragon Cave Dressed in Green (\u9ec3\u9f8d\u5410\u7fe0), Sweet Osmanthus Rain at Manjuelong Village (\u6eff\u96b4\u6842\u96e8), Clouds Scurrying over Jade Emperor Hill (\u7389\u7687\u98db\u96f2), Inquiring about Tea at Dragon Well (\u9f8d\u4e95\u554f\u8336), Precious Stone Hill Floating in Rosy Clouds (\u5bf6\u77f3\u6d41\u971e), Heavenly Wind over Wushan Hill (\u5433\u5c71\u5929\u98a8), and Ruan's Mound Encircled by Greenness (\u962e\u58a9\u74b0\u78a7). While embracing both exquisite natural beauty and abundant cultural deposits, West Lake of Hangzhou was among the first \"National Key Scenic Tourist Resorts\" in 1982, and elected one of \"Ten Chinese Scenic Sites\" in 1985.\nAfter 71 years, the West Lake Expo was launched in Xi Hu in 2000. The new exhibition was held from October 20 to November 10, attracting 1,400,000 tourists domestic and overseas. The tourism industry brought in 1.12 billion RMB. The Expo greatly enhanced the reputation of West Lake domestically and internationally. Thereafter the West Lake Expo was made a conventional annual celebration.\nImages of the West Lake have appeared various times on Chinese currency. The picture of \"Three Ponds Mirroring the Moon\" was printed on the backs of both the foreign exchange certificate one yuan bill issued by the government in 1979 and the fifth version of RMB one yuan bill issued in 2004.\n\n\n=== Literary works ===\nOver the centuries, the beauty and culture of West Lake has attracted numerous literati, who left behind works of literature and poetry to describe the lake. For example, Dream in West Lake and The Enchiridion of Lake and Mountain recorded a lot about West Lake and ancient Hangzhou historic anecdotes. Poets such as Bai Juyi, Su Shi, Xu Zhimo and Hu Shih also wrote countless poems about West Lake. The Chinese legend Legend of the White Snake is also set in West Lake in Hangzhou and has been adapted into films and television series over the years.\n\n\n=== West Lake Southern Side Renovation Project ===\nEntering the 21st century, West Lake witnessed several environmental renovation projects. First of them was \"West Lake Southern Side Renovation Project\". From February to October 2002, Hangzhou government incorporated four large parks on the southern side of the lake, and these four parks have been free to public 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. On October 25, 2002, on the old site of the Leifeng Pagoda which collapsed 78 years ago, a new pagoda with height of 71.7 meters was erected.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAbout the formation of West Lake, there are few records in ancient documents. The \"West Lake Sight-Seeing Record\" (\u897f\u6e56\u6e38\u89bd\u5fd7) says, \"West Lake is surrounded by mountains on three sides. Streams wander down the hills into the pond. There're hundreds of springs underneath. Accumulated water forms the lake.\" (\u897f\u6e56\u4e09\u9762\u74b0\u5c71\uff0c\u6eaa\u8c37\u7e37\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e0b\u6709\u6df5\u6cc9\u767e\u9053\uff0c\u6f74\u800c\u70ba\u6e56\u3002) Modern scholars studied topography, geology, sediment and hydrodynamics, and generally held that West Lake was a lagoon formed gradually from a gulf. In 1920, scientist Zhu Kezhen published \"The Cause of Formation of West Lake in Hangzhou\" (\u676d\u5dde\u897f\u6e56\u751f\u6210\u7684\u539f\u56e0) after examining the topography around the lake. He claimed, \"West Lake originally was a little bay on left side of Qiantang River. Later the earth in the river sedimented and slowly corked the mouth of the bay, hence a lagoon formed.\" Zhu postulated, based on the calculation of the rate of sedimentation, that West Lake was formed about 12,000 years ago, when the lake would have been significantly larger than now; and, that the lake's water area had gradually shrunk, due to its being filled by sediments carried down from the creeks in the hills which surround it on three sides. West Lake would no longer exist today without all the dredging work done in the historical period. In 1924, geologist Zhang Hongzhao (\u7ae0\u9d3b\u91d7) published \"One Explanation of the Formation of West Lake\". While supporting Zhu's arguments, he supplemented that the formation of West Lake started with tidal force building the lake bank. Later, the alterations of the beach helped to maintain the water level. These were two prerequisites to the formation of the lake.\n\n\n== Hydrological characteristics ==\nThe outline of the lake body of the west lake is almost oval, the bottom of the lake is relatively flat. The catchment area of the west lake is 21.22 square kilometers, with annual runoff of 14 million cubic meters and storage of nearly 14 million cubic meters. The west lake draws water from the Qiantang River, about 120 million cubic meters per year. The natural surface water sources of the lake are Jinsha stream(\u91d1\u6c99\u6da7), long hong stream(\u9f99\u6cd3\u6da7), Qishan stream (huiyin stream)(\u8d64\u5c71\u6da7\uff08\u6167\u56e0\u6da7\uff09) and changqiao stream(\u957f\u6865\u6eaa).\nThe storage capacity is about 14.294 million cubic meters. The average depth of the lake is 2.27 meters, with the deepest being about 5 meters and the shallowest being less than 1 meter. The average annual precipitation on the lake is 5.629 million cubic meters. The scour coefficient of the water system is 1.49. When the gate of the reservoir is closed in a dry season, the flow rate is equal to 0. Even in the flood period, the general flow rate is only below 0.05 m/s.\nThe water level of the lake is maintained at the yellow sea level of 7.15 meters, \u00b10.05 meters. The highest water level of 7.70 meters and the lowest water level of 6.92 meters, with a difference of 50 centimeters.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\n\nAround the west lake, there are 184 families 739 genera 1369 species of seed plants, including 28 species of gymnosperms in 19 genera and 7 families, 1273 species of angiosperms in 675 genera and 150 families, 68 species of ferns in 45 genera and 27 families. Currently, there are 21 species of rare plants are listed in the first-grade state protection, including Zhejiang nan, wild soybean and short spike bamboo, and 63 species are listed the second-grade state protection.Peach Blossom: On the lake banks and Su and Bai Causeways a large number of willows and peach trees are planted. It is said one willow is accompanied by one peach tree. Other horticultural plants include magnolia, cherry, Confederate rose, etc. The blooming season of peach tree in Hangzhou usually ranges from end of February to middle of April.\nLotus: Some sites in Hangzhou were named after lotus, such as lotus pond (\u8377\u82b1\u6c60\u982d) and lotus lane (\u8377\u82b1\u5858\u5f04). There is traditional food called \"lotus cake\". The fossil of lotus seeds was unearthed at Kuahuqiao site in Xiaoshan, which indicates at least before the Tang dynasty there was cultivated lotus. Yang Wanli of the Song dynasty wrote poem, \"Lotus leaves grow to the sky with endless green, lotus blossoms bathed in the sunlight appear especially red. (\u63a5\u5929\u84ee\u8449\u7121\u7aae\u78a7\uff0c\u6620\u65e5\u8377\u82b1\u522b\u6837\u7d05), which brought high reputation to the lotus in West Lake. Nowadays, there are 14 lotus cultivation areas in the lake, totally 130 Chinese acres. Most are in \"North Inside Lake\" and \"Yue Lake\". According to statistics, West Lake lotus starts to bloom in early June, and reaches peak blossom time in late June. It can last till late August or early September.\nOsmanthus: As the city flower, osmanthus is one of representative plants of Hangzhou. Poet Bai Juyi wrote \"search osmanthus around the temple on hill in the middle of Autumn\", indicating osmanthus had been cultivated as early as in the Tang dynasty. Osmanthus trees have been massively planted in parks around the lake, and the best-known locations to appreciate are \"Sweet Osmanthus Rain at Manjuelong Village\", one of \"New Ten Scenes of West Lake\", and Hangzhou Botanical Garden. Osmanthus can be divided into four major species, Thunbergii group (\u91d1\u6842), Latifolius Group (\u9280\u6842), Aurantiacus Group (\u4e39\u6842) and Fragrans Division (\u56db\u5b63\u6842). Among them, the Thunbergii and Latifolius are the best. Every year around mid-autumn, the sweet-scented osmanthus blossoming is a highlight of tourism in Hangzhou. In addition to its elegant looks, osmanthus is also edible. Thunbergii and Latifolius boast intensive sweet scent, and are natural ingredients for seasoning. Pickled osmanthus blossoms mixed with white sugar became a traditional food of Hangzhou, \"Sweet Osmanthus\" (\u7cd6\u6842\u82b1). West Lake Osmanthus blooming period commences from early September, lasting till early November.\nPlum blossom: Lin Bu (\u6797\u900b), a famous recluse in the Song dynasty, lived on Solitary Hill. His poem Little Plum Blossom of Hill Garden (\u5c71\u5712\u5c0f\u6885) became the best known poem praising the flower and enriched the cultural contributions of the plum blossoms of West Lake. The opening line of the poem says, \"When everything has faded they alone shine forth, encroaching on the charms of smaller gardens\" (\u773e\u82b3\u6416\u843d\u7368\u6684\u598d\uff0c\u5360\u65b7\u98a8\u60c5\u5411\u5c0f\u5712). Ling Peak, Solitary Hill and West Creek have long been the three finest spots of plum blossom cherishing in Hangzhou. The flowering season is typically around the Spring Festival, from late January to middle February.\nTulip: The \"Prince Bay Park\" (\u592a\u5b50\u6e7e\u516c\u56ed) of Hangzhou imported almost all species of tulips from Netherlands in 1992, and held annual tulips exhibition ever since. It has become a new scenic spot on the lake bank. The normal tulips blossom season spans from middle of March to end of April.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\n\nMallards, halcyons and koi carp are among the most frequently spotted animals in the lake. Squirrels loiter among the trees on the bank.\n\n\n== Influences ==\n\nWest Lake is said to be the incarnation of Xi Shi, one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Since ancient times, West Lake was associated with a large number of romantic poets, profound philosophers, national heroes and heroines. West Lake was also the retreat for many Chinese writers of the past. The Northern Song Dynasty poet Lin Bu, shunning the life of being an official, lived in seclusion by West Lake for twenty years, and dedicated himself to the cultivation of peach and plum blossoms. The great Ming dynasty essayist Zhang Dai, wrote a number of essays about West Lake in Reminiscence and Dream of Tao'an (\u9676\u5eb5\u5922\u61b6), and a whole book: Search for West Lake in Dreams (\u897f\u6e56\u5922\u5c0b). West Lake has had a profound impact on Far Eastern landscape designs, and its features have often been imitated by other palaces and gardens, such as Kunming Lake at the Summer Palace in Beijing, the central ponds of the Kyu Shiba Rikyu Garden and Koishikawa K\u014drakuen Garden in Tokyo, Japan, among others.\nDue to its prominent historical and cultural status, West Lake was selected as a National Key Scenic Resort in 1982, one of Ten Scenic Resorts in 1985 and a national 5A tourist resort in 2006.\nAlong with its cultural importance, West Lake historically was also of value for local commercial fishermen. According to statistics from 1977, the lake had an annual fish yield of 1300 kg/hectare, quite a bit more than for some larger lakes (that is, East Lake of Wuhan had a yield of only 450 kg/ha).\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\nOther attractions include:\n\nYue Fei Temple, the tomb and memorial hall to Yue Fei.\nLingyin Temple, a Buddhist monastery and surrounding hills.\nLong Jing tea farms (\u9f99\u4e95\u8336\u56ed), an area renowned for the quality of Tea.\nJingci Temple\nGalloping Tiger Spring (\u864e\u8dd1\u68a6\u6cc9), a spring famous for its mineral water\nTomb of Su Xiao Xiao (\u82cf\u5c0f\u5c0f\u5893)\nThe West Lake Museum (located on the lake shore) is dedicated to the cultural heritage of the West Lake.\n\n\n== Ten Scenes of West Lake ==\nTraditionally, there are ten best-known scenic spots on the West Lake, each remembered by a four-character epithet. Collectively, they are known as the \"Ten Scenes of West Lake\" (10 Scenic Spots in West Lake \u897f\u6e56\u5341\u666f). Each is marked by a stele with an epithet written in the calligraphy of the Qianlong Emperor. They are:\n\nDawn on the Su Causeway in Spring (\u8607\u5824\u6625\u66c9)\nCurved Yard and Lotus Pool in Summer (\u66f2\u9662\u98a8\u8377)\nMoon over the Peaceful Lake in Autumn (\u5e73\u6e56\u79cb\u6708)\nRemnant Snow on the Bridge in Winter (\u65b7\u6a4b\u6b98\u96ea)\nLeifeng Pagoda in the Sunset (\u96f7\u5cf0\u5915\u7167)\nTwo Peaks Piercing the Clouds (\u96d9\u5cf0\u63d2\u96f2)\nOrioles Singing in the Willows (\u67f3\u6d6a\u805e\u9daf)\nFish Viewing at the Flower Pond (\u82b1\u6e2f\u89c0\u9b5a)\nThree Ponds Mirroring the Moon (\u4e09\u6f6d\u5370\u6708)\nEvening Bell Ringing at the Nanping Hill (\u5357\u5c4f\u665a\u9418)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nSlender West Lake\nWest Lake (Huizhou)\n\n\n== External links ==\nHangzhou Government website\nTRAVELZHEJIANG\nTen Classic Scenes of West Lake in History\nOfficial Travel Guide of West Lake \u2013 Hangzhou Tourism Commission\nHangzhou West Lake: Too many places, too little time",

          "While Xi Hu lives up to it's fame, it's way too crowded 365x24x7. To enjoy the serenity I hiked to the other side of the lake where there's way less tourists. I'd give it 5 if not for the atrocious traffic. If you're going on weekends then good luck getting a cab going home in",
          "The scenery at west lake is amazing. Its hard to imagine its just next to the city. There is lots of tourist and locals exercising and trying to take the perfect photos here",
          "December is cold but not snowing when we were there. Beautiful scneary all around. The trick is to dodge the 10k other people who are also there with you. Winter better than Spring/Summer. Weekdays better than weekend. We took the electric golf cart tour around the",

          "I visited this place because I remembered during 80\u2019s there was a famous Chinese TV drama called A legend of White Snake, which took place in this area. Hmm.., beautiful and good for walking and also it is close by City center of Hangzhou, just around 180km drive from Shanghai",
          "West Lake is a highlight of Hangzhou, visited by locals and tourists alike. I went on a misty, cool December morning, and spent about an hour walking the paths, mostly on the side of the larger lake. I can imagine that the trails and the lake are much busier in the summer",
          "There are better lakes around the world. I don\u2019t see what the hype was about this place. To begin, the lake isn\u2019t even clean. It may be large and tourists could ride some of their boats to transfer from one point to another. But i guess Vietnam\u2019s Halong Bay (even though it",
          "The lake is truly beautiful with many interesting sights to stop and look at as you walk. There is a buggy type bus that would take you around the lake if mobility or energy are an issue. Well worth a visit. The trees and planting are well maintained. It is busy at all times",
          "If you have time, you can walk around the lake during winter, when the weather is nice and cool. If you are in rush, the local police suggested to us to buy a day ticket from the shop nearby which include all places of interest at a great price.",

          "This is not just a Hangzhou treasure, it\u2019s a National Treasure! Be aware that on weekends it gets very crowded and there\u2019s not a lot of \u201ccrowd control,\u201d but if you head to a less visited section of Xi Hu you\u2019ll still be able to experience the fabulous sights but won\u2019t be",
          "West Lake is situated in an extensive park outside Hangzhou city. The lake and surroundings were quite picturesque. We were on a tour which included a boat ride around the lake. No real surprises but the scenery was quite nice, with hilltop pagodas dotting the landscape, and",
          "The west lake is a real amazement. the lake was crystal clear and there were catfishes in the lake. the trees with yellow leaves made it a really good spot to take photos. They offer minivan services. The trip is free so why not spend half a day taking photos and exercising?",

          "If I were to review all the sights and things to do around the lake (temples, bridges, boat rides, pedestrian walks, gardens, etc.) this review would be a 5 star. However, as for the lake itself, it is quite average and in some respects not very nice at all. Case in point:",
          "The lake is located near the subway. Very convenient to get from the station, the journey takes 20 minutes. The lake is simply unreal beautiful. Very calm, there are animals. See all need a day time. I advise you to visit",

          "The lake and surrounding parklands are wonderful to stroll around and enjoy. We didn\u2019t make it onto the water to see the central islands but walking round and visiting each temple or pagoda as we went took ages anyway.",
          "Guess this is the highlight of Hangzhou. Spend a full day at West Lake...took the ferry...should try it.",
          "We took a boat cruise on the lake and although the skyline looked nice in the mist. There was nothing too extraordinary about this lake. The gardens and trees surrounding the lake were more interesting than the lake itself. Overall, it is not somewhere I would visit unless on",
          "With our friends we took a boat and enjoy the views of the lake, then we went to the show was for the G20 summit . We really enjoyed the show which run for 45 minutes. It is a MUST see as all happen on the lake, the dancers dance on water with light effects . It worth every RMB",

          "Loved the willows lining part of the lake and view of the trees lining the two causeways from afar. Went on a Sunday, and it was quite packed with people, and also couples taking their wedding photograph shots there. The lake cruise allows one to view the vastness of the lake",
          "I have visited Hangzhou twice and will never go again. I consider that the streets and the lakes will always be tainted with the blood from all the poor dogs beaten or drowned to death..Shame on the city and the reaponsible people.",

          "What a beautiful culturally rich landscape - the lake surrounded by mist shrouded mountains at least on the day I visited was calming and peaceful. Try and go a little off season as I understand it can get reaally busy during Chinese holidays. Worth getting a boat and enjoying",
          "It was misty and overcast when I travelled there, but the lake is beautiful. There are lots of people exercising and doing all sorts of other activities. One can walk around the lake, but it is about ten or eleven kilometres, so it is a bit of a hike. It would be a better bike",

          "Do not miss out on The West Lake, to walk the park and take a boat ride was just lovely. There is a lot of people but there is easily space to be alone and just enjoy the beauty of the area. The boat ride was so fun and enjoyable this is actually a man made lake which is massive",
          "Hangzhou was not far from our house, so we decided to visit Xihu, Hangzhou. We walked along the way in Xihu. It was beautiful: trees, flowers, walls, sculptures made of stones, and the lake itself were combined together into a masterpiece. After walking, we took a small boat",
          "A very beautiful lake located on the west part of a busy city, Hangzhou. If i were a resident of hangzhou, this will definitely be my jogging ground. As a tourist, i find the people of hangzhou a blessed with having such a scenic and beatiful spot right in the city area.",

          "We did a one hour boat tour on the lake. Our bus tour group walked about a km through thousands of people to get on a boat with Chinese tour guides with loud speaker systems rattling our heads. The lake area is picturesque, but the noise and crowds take a great deal away from",
          "The lake is the best part of Hangzhou. But it is not just the lake since there are \"many lakes\" depending on the part. You can ride a boat, walk in the shoreline and around the park (with lots of outdoor activities). If you can, please go as early as possible in order to avoid",
          "A visit to the lake was included in our tour - was a pretty area but we didn't think it anything special. Took a boat ride around, which was pleasant. We only spent a short time, which was good as much better attractions to spend time at - though if you are into gardens, you",
          "If your hotel is a walking distance to the west lake, you should go there before 8 am to enjoy the heavenly scenery to the fullest. After 8 am or so, it\u2019s very crowded and noisy already. Near to the west lake, there\u2019s General Yue Fei memorial place. Yue Fei is very loyal and",
          "the boat ride is beautiful and I highly recommend. try to get on a boat where you can sit outside or inside the cabin. there is so much to see on the shorelines and you will have a great view from either inside or outside of the boat. I also recommend walking around the park.",

          "This HUGE lake was one of the first locations I've ever gone to in China. To this day, I think it still is my favorite nature-related place in this ginormous country. I'm sure that I was only able to cover 1/3 of the lake, but I'd totally recommend spending a good 3-4 hours",
          "I rented a small boat and have local people handled the boat, the handler introduced all the sights we passed through, it was a wonderful boat ride and great experience there.",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Lingyin Temple (simplified Chinese: \u7075\u9690\u5bfa; traditional Chinese: \u9748\u96b1\u5bfa; pinyin: L\u00edngy\u01d0n S\u00ec) is a Buddhist temple of the Chan sect located north-west of Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. The temple's name is commonly literally translated as Temple of the Soul's Retreat. It is one of the largest and wealthiest Buddhist temples in China, and contains numerous pagodas and Buddhist grottoes.\nThe monastery is the largest of several temples in the Wulin Mountains (\u6b66\u6797\u5c71; W\u01d4l\u00ednsh\u0101n), which also features many grottos and religious rock carvings, the most famous of which is the Feilai Feng (\u98de\u6765\u5cf0; literally: \"the peak that flew hither\").\n\n\n== History ==\n\nAccording to tradition, the monastery was founded in 328 AD during the Eastern Jin dynasty (265\u2013420) by an Indian monk, named Huili in Chinese. From its inception, Lingyin was a famous monastery in the Jiangnan region. At its peak under the Wuyue Kingdom (907\u2013978), the temple boasted nine multi-story buildings, 18 pavilions, 72 halls, more than 1300 dormitory rooms, inhabited by more than 3000 monks. Many of the rich Buddhist carvings in the Feilai Feng grottos and surrounding mountains also date from this era.\nDuring the later Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279), the monastery was regarded as one of the ten most important temples of the Chan sect in the Jiangnan region. However, its prominence has not saved the temple from marauders. It has been rebuilt no less than sixteen times since then. The current buildings are modern restorations of late Qing (1644\u20131911) buildings. \nDuring the Cultural Revolution, the temple and grounds suffered some damage at the hands of Red Guards. However, they escaped large scale destruction partly because of the protection of Premier Zhou Enlai.\nToday the temple is thriving as a destination for both pilgrims and tourists. It is regarded as one of the wealthiest monasteries in China, and regular pilgrims have included former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\n== Surrounds ==\n\nThe Wuling Mountains area is a major centre of Chan Buddhism in south-eastern China. A number of smaller temples are also located in the area. Today, Lingyin and the surrounding areas are marketed as the Lingyin-Feilai Feng Scenic Area, with ticketed admission. Visitors enter from a screen wall marked with a four character inscription \"the Western Heaven is within reach\" (\u54ab\u5c3a\u897f\u5929; zh\u00edch\u01d0 X\u012bti\u0101n; 'Western Heaven is between 0.8 and one foot away'). Proceeding down the road from the entrance, the visitor first sees Feilai Feng on the left, then Lingyin Hill on the right. The entire scenic area is dotted with historic buildings and artwork, including pagodas, pavilions, bridges, and statues. The largest stone pagoda is located near the entrance. Called Elder Li's Pagoda (\u7406\u516c\u5854), it houses the ashes of Huili. \nThe area is thickly wooded, with some trees labelled as many centuries old.\n\n\n== Feilai Feng grottoes ==\n\nFeilai Feng, or \"the Peak that Flew Hither\", also commonly translated as \"Flying Peak\" (\u98de\u6765\u5cf0\u77f3\u7a9f), is located in front of the temple proper. The peak is so-named because it is made of limestone, giving it a craggy appearance very different from the surrounding mountains. Legend holds that the peak was originally from India (with some versions suggesting that it is Vulture Peak), but flew to Hangzhou overnight as a demonstration of the omnipotence of Buddhist law. Many rock reliefs dot the surface of the peak. More are located in various caves and grottoes throughout the peak. Within the main cave, dedicated to the bodhisattva Guanyin, there is a crack in the ceiling of the cave that stretches up to the surface, so that a person standing at a certain position can see a sliver of sunlight. This is known as the \"one thread of heaven\" (\u4e00\u7ebf\u5929; Y\u012bxi\u00e0n Ti\u0101n).\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe main axis of Lingyin follows a traditional Song dynasty five-hall Chan sect structure. The main axis stretches up the Lingyin Hill. However, the five-hall axis is a recent recreation. Only the front three halls are a part of the Qing dynasty axis.\n\n\n=== Hall of Four Heavenly Kings ===\n\nThe formal entrance of the temple is the Hall of the Four Heavenly Kings. This hall is a double-eaved building. The front of the building carries a plaque (\u4e91\u6797\u7985\u5bfa; Y\u00fanl\u00edn Ch\u00e1n S\u00ec; 'Chan temple of the Clouds and Forests'), written by the Kangxi Emperor. The principal statue in this hall is that of the Maitreya Buddha in his manifestation as the cloth bag monk, or the Laughing Buddha. At the back, facing up the hill, is the Skanda Buddha, or Weituo as he is known in Chinese. This statue dates from the Southern Song Dynasty. Being 800 years old this is the oldest and most important statue in the temple. Arranged along the left and right are the Four Heavenly Kings. The ceiling is ornately painted and decorated with phoenixes and dragons.The statues of Four Heavenly Kings are imposing. Visitors to the temple are often impressed by the size and majesty of the entrance hall and its statues of the heavenly kings. Indeed, the hall of the Heavenly Kings at the Lingyin Temple is as large or larger than the main hall at many temples, reflecting its status as the centre of Buddhism in south-eastern China.\nThe Hall of the Heavenly Kings is the formal entrance to the temple. However, this entry has been closed in recent years, with visitors funneled instead through side doors, where separate ticket offices are set up for admission to the temple.\n\n\n=== Mahavira Hall ===\nThe second and principal hall is the Mahavira Hall. It is separated from the Hall of the Heavenly Kings by a large courtyard, featuring a raised lawn bordered with trees. To the left of the courtyard stands the Hall of the Five Hundred Arhats. The Grand Hall of the Great Sage is triple eaved and stands 33.6 metres tall. It houses, as is traditional, a statue of Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha. The present statue was carved in 1956 from camphor wood in Tang dynasty style and coated with 60 taels of gold. It is the largest wooden Buddhist statue in China. At the back of the main statue is a statue of Guanyin, backed by a large screen that features the carved images of some 150 Buddhist personalities, including the pilgrims of the Journey to the West, Daoji, and arhats. Arranged along the sides of the hall are images of the 18 principal arhats, and other prominent Buddhists. The interior of the hall reaches about 30 metres, with a gold-painted ceiling featuring bas-relief images of traditional Buddhist symbols.\n\n\n=== Hall of Bhaisajyaguru ===\nFurther uphill and behind the main hall is the Hall of Bhaisajyaguru (\u836f\u5e08\u6bbf; Y\u00e0osh\u012b Di\u00e0n), housing a statue of the Bhaisajyaguru Buddha, commonly called the Medicine Buddha.\n\n\n=== Buddhist Texts Library ===\nUphill from the Hall of the Medicine Buddha is the Buddhist Texts Library. This, and the Huayan Hall behind it, were built from 2000 to 2002 to re-create the five-hall main axis. The Sutra Library does not house a major statue and is not open for worship.\n\n\n=== Huayan Hall ===\nThe fifth and last hall on the main axis is the Avatamsaka Hall, or Huayan Hall (\u534e\u4e25\u6bbf; Hu\u00e1y\u00e1n Di\u00e0n). Also built in 2002, this hall houses statues of the three sages of the Avatamsaka Sutra, known as the Huayan Sutra in Chinese \u2013 Shakyamuni, Manjusri, and Samantabhadra.\n\n\n=== Hall of the Five Hundred Arhats ===\n\nThe Hall of Five Hundred Arhats (\u4e94\u767e\u7f57\u6c49\u5802; W\u01d4b\u01cei Lu\u00f3h\u00e0n T\u00e1ng), also a modern addition, faces onto the western side of the courtyard in front of the main hall. The building has a complex floor plan, shaped like a Buddhist swastika. Along the arms of the swastika are arranged the five hundred arhats as slightly larger-than-life bronze statues. Each statue is seated on a unique ornate seat. At the centre, where the arms  of the swastika join, stands a bronze canopy housing statues of four bodhisattvas representing the four cardinal directions. This is currently the tallest solid bronze structure in the world.\n\n\n== Notable monks ==\nDaoji \u2013 A Buddhist monk who has attained folk hero status.Dachuan Lingyin Puji (1179\u20131253)- compiler of the Wudeng Huiyan (Compendium of Five Lamps)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nZi Yan (2012).

          "You must be prepared for a crush of people. We visited the second week of October and were on a Globus tour consisting of 20 people and a guide. It is one of the oldest Buddhist temples in China. In fact we were able to catch a glimpse of priests in worship. As with all",
          "It is very clean and good temple, the surrounding is very calm and we visit to pray at the temple. We visit at November and the weather is good.",
          "Definitely go left off the path to explore the rock caves with carvings in the walls. Climb up the forested hill too, so beautiful. The temples and their interiors were breathtaking.",

          "We went on a weekday late afternoon and it was still fairly crowded. That didn\u2019t spoil it for us though. We walked around on our own and prayed as the locals do. The worship halls were grand and full of history. Do take a minute to admire the interiors but it is considered",
          "Visited on a Monday and the temple was amazing. 1600 yrs of history, survived the years and wars have left it intact. A must see! Lovely garden walking right up to it. Less crowded on a weekday.",
          "The temple is very well maintained; however, it was against the latest Chinese rule that no parks should charge twice. Once you paid for the initial fee, do not bother to pay a second fee for the temple, and the complimentary/free temple is as good as the one that requires",
          "This is not only a temple, also a nice place to visit for the historical reason. If you want to avoid traffic, go visit in the afternoon. This place gets very crowded early morning for local people.",

          "...you\u2019ll find this huge, impressive complex of temples and statues which actually reminded me more of Japan than China (apart from the massive crowds, ok maybe \u2018hidden\u2019 is the wrong word). Tickets will be needed for each of the main parts and I suggest putting aside at least 5",
          "This temple complex gets a lot less positive press that and many others in the Hangzhou area but there is A lot to see in the temple and there are some very beautiful views across the lake from the upper levels. Spring and fall are the best times of year to visit this temple",
          "A must visit site if you visit Hangzhou. Full of history. Grounds are beautiful. Some of the buildings looked over restored but luckily the inside of the temples were kept largely intact. Recommend going in the morning on a cook clear day in order to take your time exploring",
          "The grottoes along the pathway to the temple are magnificent and a sight to behold. The halls in the temple at each stage hold interesting information about the culture and beliefs of the people. We went in the month of Nov and was also able to view the beautiful autumn colors",

          "The complex has 3 sections. First is a food and shopping mall, then a few hundreds yards on is the start of dozens of ancient Buddhist carvings into the rocky hillside and caves. Keep going and you will see the Temple walls. It's worth paying for the 2nd ticket to see the Temple",
          "Visited this temple today and it\u2019s really beautiful. The park where the temple is located is really big. You can see a lot in here. You pay less than 10 euros and then you can enter the park and the temple. Just a little disappointed that I Didn\u2019t get any discount with my",
          "Really fascinating to visit the temple. Many deities in the different temples which represent different roles in protecting and blessing human kind. We learned that there is a Buddhism college in the temple for higher studies. Around 300 monks reside there. Emperor Qianlong",
          "If you stay near West Lake it is easy to take a tourist bus to the temple (only 2RMB). Beautiful Buddhist sculptures in a rustic landscape, then the large monestary and temple. You do get charged for both the scenic area and a separate charge for the temple. The scenic park",
          "This is probably the largest complex of temples I've seen in awhile. There is so much to see and explore, from the building with 500 statues and the main complex, you will get your money's worth. It was incredible but there can be alot to see. I'd recommend you check through",

          "I wouldn't normally rely on a tour guide for something like this, but this time I did and was glad for it. We used China Private Tour and had a great experience. Just finding the temple is a bit hard, so without some local help you'll be struggling to navigate. BTW, the tour",

          "Absolutely adored my recent visit to China, and Lingyin Temple was such an experience. It is for sure a don\u2019t miss when visiting Hangzhou.",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you are in Hangzhou, even if you are only visiting for a few days. It is quite a distance from the centre of West lake but you can get the number 7 bus from down near the lake or alternatively get a taxi. Don\u2019t make the mistake of biking and walking",
          "It is one of the great temples from early Qing dynasty but go during the week. Don't go during weekends or major holidays because it will ruin your experience. it is not only the crowd size but also their behavior. typical bad behaved crowd. I have seen people talking loud on he",

          "Other than some historical significance of this temple, there is nothing much to offer at this temple. It is over commercialised. The entrance fee is high. It collects an entrance fee just to get into the park that are outside the temple and another entrance fee to get into the",

          "You must visit this temple which is a marvel in the foothills with many caves and statues. The temple itself is one of the most beautiful in China, out of the big cities and very alive by the community of monks who make it up. This is the most important stop in Hangzhou, maybe",

          "This is definitely not too commercial compared with most of other famous temples in China. Avoid holiday season if you can. Hire a guild if you can. The stories worths equally with the views. Try to visit before 10am (those the time the travel agency bus arrives).",
          "This place is very amazing, take at least 2 hours to visit everything. I visited all the temples and the gardens also. You can also find there a vegetarian restaurant, but I've been there twice and didn't have the chance to have lunch there cause there were so many people. Avoid",

          "Lots of great history here, temples, carvings and lots more. Some over 1000 years old, although much of the temples up the hill, you need to climb quite a few steps, are rebuilt and fairly new. This is a living monument, so you are likely to see monks along with the hundreds or",

          "We live in China and have seen our fair share of temples, but this one was truly special. We had no idea how spectacular it was, so we didn't leave a whole day for it. We need to return to see it all, including getting to the top of the mountain. The kids loved the caves and the",

          "The hall on the left after entering has 600 life size Buddhas, all different. Some female whorshippers were also walking along chanting a tranquil and ethereal song. Really amazing to see and little written about. The walk up the peak is also a shady and fun journey we did it",

          "All in all, the Lingyin Temple is a special place that will calm your soul once you enter it. Make sure you spend a few hours here and enjoy in this serene attraction. If you want to get some workouts, Feilai Peak (actually nothing special or to see at the peak) is there and",
          "Definitely worth a visit; make sure to put a couple of hours aside and put your walking/climbing shoes on. Crowds are huge immediately after the entrance and within the main temple itself, but once you start climbing the steps and visiting the surrounding temples it becomes",

          "Found within the Fei Lai Feng area, this temple is huge and very beautiful. We were fortunate enough to be there when the monks were chanting in one of the temple houses, creating a very serene atmosphere. There is also a lovely little vegetarian noodle soup restaurant within",
          "I had a hard time finding a bus that would take me here, but in the end the number 7 bus did the trick. The first thing that you see when you get to the Lingyin temple site (after paying the 45 RMB entrance fee) is the Buddhist grottoes out front. They are spectacularly well",
          "Staying in a guest house nearby wandering around the temple was party of our lazy day off, which we all enjoyed. There is plenty to see and to experience. There are thousands of statues that reminded us of the Terra Cotta warriors- all the same at first but on closer inspection",

          "A temple is a temple is a temple. However, what I found different in this one are the sculptures on rocks of the different deities. I think this is the first time I've seen this in China. I went up the highest point to see the view but too bad for me, it was very foggy and saw",
          "While I am not a Buddhist, I am interested in world history and culture. This place lived up the hype with many elaborate carvings in the stone caves (some defaced during the Cultural Revolution) giving more perspective on the value of such ancient artifacts regardless of one's",
          "I spent two days in Hangzhou. The most impressing was the Longjing Tee Plantation and the Lingyin Temple with the famous laughing Budda carved in the Stone of the hill. The west see was also very impressive, but was crowded. You still get a realistic Impression since allmost all",

          "Beautiful temple complex and worth while to visit. Yes, there are throngs of people but somehow less or more spread than other places. I wish I went there a bit earlier on a more quiet moment of the day although I find it hard to get the time right in China....if you are unlucky",
          "Need to pay to get into grounds, then usually pay for each temple but no charge as we found on Buddha day. We were looking for the cafe and walked straight passed the temple where it was. only by chance on the way down did I find it with 5 mins to go before it closed.Large bowl",
          "China is nothing short of people especially in touristy areas. I was very surprised to find peace and serenity at Lingyin Temple when I visited for the first time. Don't get me wrong, there were plenty of tourist, but it must be the fresh air as you walk up the mountain path,",

To get in there I had to buy 2 tickets - the 1st ticket was RMB45 to \u98de\u6765\u5cf0 area, the 2nd one was RMB30 to entrance to this temple located in \u98de\u6765\u5cf0 area.

          "This temple is old and impressive due to it's size and where it was built. This is one of the tourist places so it's a must see. Apparently the draw of this place has a lot to do with the history, which I know little about. As a place to visit, it's not very impressive without",
          "I went by bus and got lost around 3 times heading to the temple but that was my mistake. You need to pay 45 rmb to get into the temple and still some additional fees to get into the temple itself not only to the scenic area. I spent a few hours there and climbed the mountain - i",

        "wiki": "Xixi National Wetland Park (Chinese: \u897f\u6eaa\u56fd\u5bb6\u6e7f\u5730\u516c\u56ed) is a national wetland park in China, located at the west part of Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, a total of 1,150 hectares (2,800 acres). The park is densely crisscrossed with six main watercourses, among which are scattered various ponds, lakes and swamps.\nXiXi Wetland has a history of more than 4000 years and an abundant cultural heritage.  It's the original site of Chinese South Opera; it has a traditional dragon boat contest; it contains the vivid life of a water village, featuring silkworm feeding and silk production.\n\n\n== History ==\nXixi Wetland Park has a six staged history from Liangzhu Culture to the republic of China.\n\n\n=== Liangzhu Culture ===\nDuring the Liangzhu Culture period, Xixi Wetland has its starting shape. The area and the number of lakes were much greater than now. The area of Laohe Mountain was also included in Xixi Wetland.\n\n\n=== Han and Tang Dynasties ===\nDuring Han and Tang Dynasties, human activities started to appear around Xixi Wetland. People named their village as \"Tang Village\". In Five Dynasty, there were garrisons set around Xixi Wetland.\n\n\n=== Song and Yuan Dynasties ===\nDuring Song and Yuan Dynasties, Xixi Wetland had a huge development. In Southern Song Dynasty, the emperor Gaozong Song adored Xixi Wetland and wanted to set it as the capital place. There was a royal river road for Gaozong Song in Xixi Wetland. Xixi Wetland started to become an important transportation river and a military area.\n\n\n=== Ming and Qing Dynasties ===\nThis is the most flourishing period of Xixi Wetland. The local government started to regulate floods, so the lands in Xixi Wetland became visible. Citizens fed silkworms on lands, and faster fish in the river. The beauty of the land and rivers attracted many literati to write poems and paint. Therefore, the education grew in this period.\n\n\n=== The republic of China ===\nIn 2002, Xixi Wetland was assigned to Hangzhou and to Xihu District. Many villagerss lived here. With the growth of industrialization, factories also moved in, and cause contamination in Xixi Wetland. In August 2003, the protection project of Xixi Wetland started to preserve the wildlife and sights in Xixi Wetland, and it became the first national wetland park in China.\n\n\n== The sights ==\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\nXixi Wetland is honored as \"The Green Lung In the Paradise\". There are 221 species, 182 genera, and 85 families of vascular plants, 7 phytoplankton, and 6 vegetation types. There are 2802 old persimmon trees. The bird resources in the wetland are also extremely rich, with 89 species, 12 orders, 26 families, accounting for nearly 50% of all birds in Hangzhou.\nTypical birds are: little egret, wild geese, common kingfisher, mallard duck and silver pheasant.\nAquatic animals are carp, chub, shrimp, eel and crab.\nSome of the vegetation includes: persimmon, willow, camphor, bamboo, mulberry, plum, peach, elm, nelumbo, maple, poplar and hibiscus.\n\n\n== Cultural Contribution ==\nLiterature\nHong Zhong is a famous judge in the Ming dynasty. He built a large courtyard that consists of messuages, parks, and colleges called \"Hong Zhong Bie Ye\" in the Xixi wetland area. This massive aristocratic residence is one of the primary forms of Grand View Garden in one of the four classic novels of Chinese Literature \"Hong Lou Meng.\" Therefore, Xixi Wetland had provided a cultural background for Chinese literature.\nVillage \nXixi Wetland also has a non-material cultural heritage. It preserves the old villages. \"Xixi Cultivate Cultural village,\" \"Wu Chang Cultural Village,\" \"Xixi Art Village,\" and \"Xixi citizen Village\" are the four villages that reserve the traditional Chinese culture and remind modern people how the culture has been developed from old times.\nFestivals\nThere are five traditional festivals in Xixi Wetland Park. \n1. New Year Wintersweet Festival\nFrom the Song dynasty, wintersweet is one of the famous flowers in Xixi Wetland, and there are hundreds of poems praise the wintersweet in Xixi. In the Qing dynasty, the poet Gong Zi Zhen praised Xixi wintersweet as one of the three best wintersweet in South China. Therefore, from 2003, the government set the New Year Wintersweet Festival every February and invite people to enjoy the wintersweet.\n2. Xixi Hundred Flower Festival\nThis festival has started in the Ming dynasty; the old government set the day as the birthday of all flowers. Now, the festival still preserves, and people built massive sculptures made by flowers to celebrate the flowers' birthday every April.\n3.

        "wiki": "Leifeng Pagoda is a five story tall tower with eight sides, located on Sunset Hill south of the West Lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. Originally constructed in the year AD 975, it collapsed in 1924 but was rebuilt in 2002. Since then, it has become a popular tourist attraction.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Original ===\nThe original pagoda was built in 975 AD, during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, at the order of King Qian Chu (born Qian Hongchu) of Wuyue for his favorite concubine, Consort Huang. The Leifeng Pagoda was an octagonal, five-story structure built of brick and wood with a base built of bricks.\nDuring the Ming dynasty, Japanese pirates attacked Hangzhou. Suspecting the pagoda contained weapons, they burned its wooden elements, leaving only the brick skeleton, which can be seen from Ming paintings of the West Lake.\nLeifeng Pagoda was one of the ten sights of the West Lake because of the Legend of the White Snake.\nLater, due to a superstition that the bricks from the tower could repel illness or prevent miscarriage, many people stole bricks from the tower to grind into powder. On the afternoon of September 25, 1924, the pagoda finally collapsed due to disrepair.\nAs for whether there was a mausoleum below, this was debated for years until radar was used to investigate. On March 11, 2001, the mausoleum was excavated and many artifacts were found, most notably a gold and silver coated hair of the Buddha.\n\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\nIn October 1999, the provincial and municipal governments decided to rebuild Leifeng Pagoda on top of the ruins of the old one. The new pagoda opened on 25 October 2002. It is composed of a 1400 tonne steel structure with 200 tonnes of copper parts. It contains four sightseeing elevators, and modern amenities such as air conditioning, television, and speakers. At the entrance of the pagoda, there are two autonomous escalators to carry visitors to the base of the pagoda.\nThe original base of the pagoda is kept in good condition, as well as the artifacts discovered in the underground chamber.\n\n\n== References ==\n\"The king and the Buddhist pagoda\".

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow).

The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China.

It is located close to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport and Hangzhou Port.Hangzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was set up with approval from the State Council as a state-level high-tech Industrial Development Zone in March 1991. The HHTZ is composed of three parts, with the main regions being the Zhijiang Sci-Tech Industrial Park and Xiasha Sci-Tech Industrial Park. HHTZ has become one of the most influential high-tech innovation and high-tech industry bases in Zhejiang Province. As of 2013, HHTZ hosts more than 1,100 software developers and BPO enterprises. Major companies such as Motorola, Nokia and Siemens have established R&D centers in the zone. In 2011, the GDP of the zone rose by 13.1 percent, amounting to RMB 41.63 billion. This accounted for 5.9 percent of Hangzhou's total GDP. The HHTZ positions itself as the \"Silicon Valley\" of China. The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places. Adjacent to the lake is an area which includes historical pagodas, cultural sites, as well as the natural environment of the lake and hills, including Phoenix Mountain.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world.

The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China.

Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011.

        "wiki": "\u2039See TfM\u203a\nSu Shi (Chinese: \u8607\u8efe / \u82cf\u8f7c\uff1b8 January 1037 \u2013 24 August 1101), courtesy name Zizhan (Chinese: \u5b50\u77bb), art name Dongpo (Chinese: \u6771\u5761), was a Chinese calligrapher, gastronome, painter, pharmacologist, poet, politician, and writer of the Song dynasty. A major personality of the Song era, Su was an important figure in Song Dynasty politics, aligning himself with Sima Guang and others, against the New Policy party led by Wang Anshi.\nSu Shi is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished figures in classical Chinese literature, having produced some of the most well-known poems, lyrics, prose, and essays. Su Shi was famed as an essayist, and his prose writings lucidly contribute to the understanding of topics such as 11th-century Chinese travel literature or detailed information on the contemporary Chinese iron industry. His poetry has a long history of popularity and influence in China, Japan, and other areas in the near vicinity and is well known in the English-speaking parts of the world through the translations by Arthur Waley, among others. In terms of the arts, Su Shi has some claim to being \"the pre-eminent personality of the eleventh century.\" Dongpo pork, a prominent dish in Hangzhou cuisine, is named in his honor.\n\n\n== Life ==\nSu Shi was born in Meishan, near Mount Emei today Sichuan province. His brother Su Zhe and his father Su Xun were both famous literati. His given name, Shi (\u8f7c), refers to the crossbar railing at the front of a chariot; Su Xun felt that the railing was a humble, but indispensable, part of a carriage.\nSu's early education was conducted under a Taoist priest at a local village school. Later his educated mother took over. Su married at the age of 17. Su and his younger brother (Zhe) had a close relationship, and in 1057, when Su was 19, he and his brother both passed the (highest-level) civil service examinations to attain the degree of jinshi, a prerequisite for high government office. His accomplishments at such a young age attracted the attention of Emperor Renzong, and also that of Ouyang Xiu, who became Su's patron thereafter. Ouyang had already been known as an admirer of Su Xun, sanctioning his literary style at court and stating that no other pleased him more. When the 1057 jinshi examinations were given, Ouyang Xiu required\u2014without prior notice\u2014that candidates were to write in the ancient prose style when answering questions on the Confucian classics. The Su brothers gained high honors for what were deemed impeccable answers and achieved celebrity status, especially in the case of Su Shi's exceptional performance in the subsequent 1061 decree examinations.\nBeginning in 1060 and throughout the following twenty years, Su held a variety of government positions throughout China; most notably in Hangzhou, where he was responsible for constructing a pedestrian causeway across the West Lake that still bears his name: sudi (\u82cf\u5824, \u8607\u5824, Su causeway). He had served as a magistrate in Mi Prefecture, which is located in modern-day Zhucheng County of Shandong province. Later, when he was governor of Xuzhou, he wrote a memorial to the throne in 1078 complaining about the troubling economic conditions and potential for armed rebellion in Liguo Industrial Prefecture, where a large part of the Chinese iron industry was located.Su Shi was often at odds with a political faction headed by Wang Anshi. Su Shi once wrote a poem criticizing Wang Anshi's reforms, especially the government monopoly imposed on the salt industry. The dominance of the reformist faction at court allowed the New Policy Group greater ability to have Su Shi exiled for political crimes. The claim was that Su was criticizing the emperor, when in fact Su Shi's poetry was aimed at criticizing Wang's reforms. It should be said that Wang Anshi played no part in this action against Su, for he had retired from public life in 1076 and established a cordial relationship with Su Shi. Su Shi's first remote trip of exile (1080\u20131086) was to Huangzhou, Hubei. This post carried a nominal title, but no stipend, leaving Su in poverty. During this period, he began Buddhist meditation.  With help from a friend, Su built a small residence on a parcel of land in 1081. Su Shi lived at a farm called Dongpo ('Eastern Slope'), from which he took his literary pseudonym. While banished to Hubei province, he grew fond of the area he lived in; many of the poems considered his best were written in this period. His most famous piece of calligraphy, Han Shi Tie, was also written there. In 1086, Su and all other banished statesmen were recalled to the capital due to the ascension of a new government. However, Su was banished a second time (1094\u20131100) to Huizhou (now in Guangdong province) and Hainan island. In 1098 the Dongpo Academy in Hainan was built on the site of the residence that he lived in whilst in exile.\nAlthough political bickering and opposition usually split ministers of court into rivaling groups, there were moments of non-partisanship and cooperation from both sides. For example, although the prominent scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095) was one of Wang Anshi's most trusted associates and political allies, Shen nonetheless befriended Su Shi.  Su Shi was aware that it was Shen Kuo who, as regional inspector of Zhejiang, presented Su Shi's poetry to the court sometime between 1073 and 1075 with concern that it expressed abusive and hateful sentiments against the Song court. It was these poetry pieces that Li Ding and Shu Dan later utilized in order to instigate a law case against Su Shi, although until that point Su Shi did not think much of Shen Kuo's actions in bringing the poetry to light.After a long period of political exile, Su received a pardon in 1100 and was posted to Chengdu. However, he died in Changzhou, Jiangsu province after his period of exile and while he was en route to his new assignment in the year 1101. Su Shi was 64 years old. After his death he gained even greater popularity, as people sought to collect his calligraphy, paintings depicting him, stone inscriptions marking his visit to numerous places, and built shrines in his honor. He was also depicted in artwork made posthumously, such as in Li Song's (1190\u20131225) painting of Su traveling in a boat, known as Su Dongpo at Red Cliff, after Su Song's poem written about a 3rd-century Chinese battle.\n\n\n== Family ==\n\nSu Shi had three wives. His first wife was Wang Fu (\u738b\u5f17, 1039\u20131065), an astute, quiet lady from Sichuan who married him at the age of sixteen. She died 13 years later in 1065, on the second day of the fifth Chinese lunar month (Gregorian calendar June 14), after bearing him a son, Su Mai (\u8607\u9081). Heartbroken, Su wrote a memorial for her (\u300a\u4ea1\u59bb\u738b\u6c0f\u5893\u5fd7\u9298\u300b), stating Fu was not just a virtuous wife but advised him frequently on the integrity of his acquaintances when he was an official.\nTen years after the death of his first wife, Su composed a (ci) poem after dreaming of the deceased Fu in the night at Mi Prefecture.  The poem, To the tune of 'Of Jinling'  (\u6c5f\u57ce\u5b50), remains one of the most famous poems Su wrote.In 1068, two years after Wang Fu's death, Su married Wang Runzhi (\u738b\u958f\u4e4b, 1048\u201393), cousin of his first wife, and 11 years his junior. Wang Runzhi spent the next 15 years accompanying Su through his ups and downs in officialdom and political exile. Su praised Runzhi for being an understanding wife who treated his three sons equally (his eldest, Su Mai\uff08\u82cf\u8fc8\uff0c\u8607\u9081\uff09, was born by Fu). Once, Su was angry with his young son for not understanding his unhappiness during his political exile. Wang chided Su for his silliness, prompting Su to write the domestic poem Young Son (\u300a\u5c0f\u5152\u300b).\nWang Runzhi died in 1093, at forty-six, after bearing Su two sons, Su Dai (\u82cf\u8fe8\uff0c\u8607\u8fe8) and Su Guo (\u82cf\u8fc7\uff0c\u8607\u904e).  Overcame with grief, Su expressed his wish to be buried with her in her memorial (see memorial \u300a\u796d\u4ea1\u59bb\u540c\u5b89\u90e1\u541b\u6587\u300b).  On his second wife's second birthday after her death, Su wrote another ci poem, To the tune of 'Butterflies going after Flowers' (\u300a\u8776\u6200\u82b1\u300b), for her.\nSu's third wife, Wang Zhaoyun (\u738b\u671d\u96f2, 1062\u20131095) was his handmaiden who was a former Qiantang singing artiste.  Wang was only about ten (eleven sui) when she became his personal slave. After she taught, herself to read though she was formerly illiterate. Zhaoyun was probably the most famous of Su's companions. Su's friend Qin Guan wrote a poem, A Gift for Dongpo's concubine Zhaoyun (\u300a\u8d08\u6771\u5761\u59be\u671d\u96f2\u300b), praising her beauty and lovely voice.  Su dedicated a number of his poems to Zhaoyun, like To the Tune of 'Song of the South\u2019\u300a\u5357\u6b4c\u5b50\u300b, Verses for Zhaoyun (\u300a\u671d\u96f2\u8a69\u300b), To the Tune of 'The Beauty Who asks One to Stay'  (\u300a\u6ba2\u4eba\u5b0c\u00b7\u8d08\u671d\u96f2\u300b), To the Tune of 'The Moon at Western Stream' \u300a\u897f\u6c5f\u6708\u300b. Zhaoyun remained a faithful companion to Su after Runzhi's death, but died of illness on 13 August 1095 (\u7d39\u8056\u4e09\u5e74\u4e03\u6708\u4e94\u65e5) at Huizhou.  Zhaoyun bore Su a son, Su Dun (\u8607\u9041) on 15 November 1083, who died in his infancy.  After Zhaoyun's death, Su never married again.\nBeing a government official in a family of officials, Su was often separated from his loved ones depending on his posting. In 1078, he was serving as prefect of Suzhou. His beloved younger brother was able to join him for the mid-autumn festival, which inspired the poem \"Mid-Autumn Moon\" reflecting on the preciousness of time with family. It was written to be sung to the tune of \"Yang Pass.\"\nAs evening clouds withdraw a clear cool air floods in\nthe jade wheel passes silently across the Silver River\nthis life this night has rarely been kind\nwhere will we see this moon next year\n(translation by Red Pine)Su Shi had three adult sons, the eldest son being Su Mai (\u8607\u9081), who would also become a government official by 1084. Su Dai (\u8607\u8fe8) and Su Guo (\u8607\u904e) are his other sons. When Su Shi died in 1101, his younger brother Su Zhe (\u8607\u8f4d) buried him alongside second wife Wang Runzhi according to his wishes.\n\n\n== Work ==\n\n\n=== Poetry ===\n\nAround 2,700 of Su Song's poems have survived, along with 800 written letters. Su Dongpo excelled in the shi, ci and fu forms of poetry, as well as prose, calligraphy and painting. Some of his notable works include the First and Second Chibifu (\u8d64\u58c1\u8ce6 The Red Cliffs, written during his first exile), Nian Nu Jiao: Chibi Huai Gu (\u5ff5\u5974\u5b0c.\u8d64\u58c1\u61f7\u53e4 Remembering Chibi, to the tune of Nian Nu Jiao) and Shui diao ge tou (\u6c34\u8abf\u6b4c\u982d Remembering Su Zhe on the Mid-Autumn Festival, \u4e2d\u79cb\u8282\uff0c\u4e2d\u79cb\u7bc0). The two former poems were inspired by the 3rd century naval battle of the Three Kingdoms era, the Battle of Chibi in the year 208. The bulk of his poems are in the shi style, but his poetic fame rests largely on his 350 ci style poems. Su Shi also founded the haofang school, which cultivated an attitude of heroic abandon. In both his written works and his visual art, he combined spontaneity, objectivity and vivid descriptions of natural phenomena. Su Shi wrote essays as well, many of which are on politics and governance, including his Liuhoulun (\u7559\u4faf\u8ad6). His popular politically charged poetry was often the reason for the wrath of Wang Anshi's supporters towards him, culminating with the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial of 1079. He also wrote poems on Buddhist topics, including a poem later extensively commented on by Eihei D\u014dgen, the founder of the Japanese S\u014dt\u014d school of Zen, in a chapter of his work Sh\u014db\u014dgenz\u014d entitled The Sounds of Valley Streams, the Forms of Mountains.\n\n\n=== Travel record literature ===\n\nSu Shi also wrote of his travel experiences in 'daytrip essays', which belonged in part to the popular Song era literary category of 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue) that employed the use of narrative, diary, and prose styles of writing. Although other works in Chinese travel literature contained a wealth of cultural, geographical, topographical, and technical information, the central purpose of the daytrip essay was to use a setting and event in order to convey a philosophical or moral argument, which often employed persuasive writing. For example, Su Shi's daytrip essay known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain investigates and then judges whether or not ancient texts on 'stone bells' were factually accurate.\n\n\n=== A memorial concerning the iron industry ===\n\nWhile acting as Governor of Xuzhou, Su Shi in 1078 AD wrote a memorial to the imperial court about problems faced in the Liguo Industrial Prefecture which was under his watch and administration. In an interesting and revealing passage about the Chinese iron industry during the latter half of the 11th century, Su Shi wrote about the enormous size of the workforce employed in the iron industry, competing provinces that had rival iron manufacturers seeking favor from the central government, as well as the danger of rising local strongmen who had the capability of raiding the industry and threatening the government with effectively armed rebellion. It also becomes clear in reading the text that prefectural government officials in Su's time often had to negotiate with the central government in order to meet the demands of local conditions.\n\n\n=== Technical issues of hydraulic engineering ===\n\nDuring the ancient Han Dynasty (202 BC \u2013 220 AD) of China, the sluice gate and canal lock of the flash lock had been known. By the 10th century the latter design was improved upon in China with the invention of the canal pound lock, allowing different adjusted levels of water along separated and gated segments of a canal. This innovation allowed for larger transport barges to pass safely without danger of wrecking upon the embankments, and was an innovation praised by those such as Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095). Shen also wrote in his Dream Pool Essays of the year 1088 that, if properly used, sluice gates positioned along irrigation canals were most effective in depositing silt for fertilization. Writing earlier in his Dongpo Zhilin of 1060, Su Shi came to a different conclusion, writing that the Chinese of a few centuries past had perfected this method and noted that it was ineffective in use by his own time.Although Su Shi made no note of it in his writing, the root of this problem was merely the needs of agriculture and transportation conflicting with one another.\n\n\n=== Gastronome ===\n\nSu is called one of the four classical gastronomes. The other three are Ni Zan (1301\u201374), Xu Wei (1521\u201393), and Yuan Mei (1716\u201397). There is a legend, for which there is no evidence, that by accident he invented Dongpo pork, a famous dish in later centuries. Lin Hsiang Ju and Lin Tsuifeng in their scholarly Chinese Gastronomy give a recipe, \"The Fragrance of Pork: Tungpo Pork\", and remark that the \"square of fat is named after Su Dongpo, the poet, for unknown reasons. Perhaps it is just because he would have liked it.\" A story runs that once Su Dongpo decided to make stewed pork. Then an old friend visited him in the middle of the cooking and challenged him to a game of Chinese chess. Su had totally forgotten the stew, which in the meantime had now become extremely thick-cooked, until its very fragrant smell reminded him of it.Su, to explain his vegetarian inclinations, said that he never had been comfortable with killing animals for his dinner table, but had a craving for certain foods, such as clams, so he couldn't desist. When he was imprisoned his views changed. \"Since my imprisonment I have not killed a single thing... having experienced such worry and danger myself, when I felt just like a fowl waiting in the kitchen, I can no longer bear to cause any living creature to suffer immeasurable fright and pain simply to please my palate.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChinese literature\nChinese poetry\nClassical Chinese poetry\nCrow Terrace Poetry Trial\nCulture of the Song Dynasty\nHistory of the Song Dynasty\nShen Kuo\nSong poetry\nTao Yuanming\nSu Shi's destiny quote\nTechnology of the Song Dynasty\nWang Shen\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Translations ==\nWatson, Burton (translator).

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. It is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in East China. IHangzhou comprises 10 districts, 1 county-level city, and 2 counties. The ten urban districts occupy  8,292.31 km2 (3,201.68 sq mi) and have a population of 8,241,000, in which there are six central urban districts and four suburban districts. The central urban districts occupy 706.27 km2 (272.69 sq mi) and have a population of 3,780,000 and the suburban districts occupy 7,586.04 km2 (2,928.99 sq mi) and have a population of 4,461,000.\nIn the early 90s, the urban districts of Hangzhou only comprises Shangcheng, Xiacheng, Gongshu, Jianggan.\nOn December 11, 1996, Bingjiang District was established.\nOn March 12, 2001, the City of Xiaoshan and the City of Yuhang was included into the City of Hangzhou as two districts.\nOn December 13, 2014, and in July 2017, the City of Fuyang and Lin'an were included into the City of Hangzhou as two districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nHangzhou city had a population of 5,162,039 (including Xiaoshan and Yuhang) at the 2010 census, an increase of 4.8% per year since the 2000 census. The most recent estimates of the city's urban area population are between 6,658,000 and 6,820,000.During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 9,018,000 in 2015. The entire province had a population of 8,700,373, and the encompassing urban agglomeration (including Shaoxing) is estimated to have population of 8,450,000.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 13.4 million, although other sources put the figure at over 21 million. The Hangzhou metropolitan area includes the major cities of Shaoxing, Jiaxing and Huzhou.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHangzhou's economy has rapidly developed since its opening up in 1992. It is an industrial city with many diverse sectors such as light industry, agriculture, and textiles. It is considered an important manufacturing base and logistics hub for coastal China. In recent years, Hangzhou has seen substantial development in its financial sector, featuring for the first time in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2018 at rank 89.\nThe 2001 GDP of Hangzhou was RMB 156.8 billion, which ranked second among all of the provincial capitals after Guangzhou. The city has more than tripled its GDP since then, increasing from RMB 156.8 billion in 2001 to RMB 1.3509 trillion in 2018 and GDP per capita increasing from US$3,020 to $21,184.The city has developed many new industries, including medicine, information technology, heavy equipment, automotive components, household electrical appliances, electronics, telecommunication, fine chemicals, chemical fibre and food\nprocessing. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has also strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta+\" classification according to GaWC.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\nHangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone was established and approved as a national development zone by the State Council in 1993. It covers an area of 104.7 km2 (40.4 sq mi).

The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places. Adjacent to the lake is an area which includes historical pagodas, cultural sites, as well as the natural environment of the lake and hills, including Phoenix Mountain.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world. China National Tea Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6\u535a\u7269\u9986) is a national museum with special subjects as tea and its culture.

Yue opera, originated from Shengzhou, Zhejiang Province, is the second-largest opera form in China. Also, there are several big shows themed with the history and culture of Hangzhou like Impression West Lake and the Romance of Song Dynasty.\nHangzhou has historically been an important hub for artists and scholars. In modern times, Hangzhou was home to the China Academy of Art and prominent painters such as Lin Fengmian and Fang Ganmin.\nTea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating Longjing, a notable variety of green tea, the most notable type being Longjing Tea. Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown in Longjing village near West Lake in Hangzhou, hence its name.The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon silk production, umbrellas, and Chinese hand-held folding fans.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of Zhejiang provincial cuisine, which is claimed as one of China's eight fundamental cuisines. The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China. Those planted by the West Lake is the best Longjing tea.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port of Hangzhou is a small river port with a cargo throughput that exceeds 100 million tons annually.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Netherlands, Qatar, Portugal and the United States. Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city. Public universities include Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology, and Hangzhou Normal University etc.  Xiasha, located near the east end of the city,  and Xiaoheshan, located near the west end of the city, are college towns with a cluster of several universities and colleges.\n\nChina Academy of Art (founded in 1928)\nChina Jiliang University\nHangzhou Dianzi University\nHangzhou Normal University (founded in 1908)\nZhejiang Chinese Medical University\nZhejiang Forestry University\nZhejiang Gongshang University (founded in 1911, the earliest business school in China)\nZhejiang University of Science and Technology\nZhejiang International Studies University (also known as Zhejiang Education Institute, founded in 1955)\nZhejiang Sci-Tech University\nZhejiang Shuren University\nZhejiang University (founded in 1897), one of the top universities in China. (Project 985, Project 211, C9 League)\nZhejiang University City College\nZhejiang University of Technology (1953)\nZhejiang University of Media and Communications (1984)Note: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nProvincial key Public high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou No. 4 High School, Hangzhou No. 14 High School, Hangzhou No. 2 High School, Hangzhou Foreign Language School, High School Attached to Zhejiang University, High School attached to Hangzhou Normal university, Hangzhou No. 1 High School and Hangzhou Xuejun High School.\nPrivate high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou Green Town Yuhua School, Hangzhou Chinese International School, Hangzhou International School and Hangzhou Japanese School (\u676d\u5dde\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5b66\u6821) (nihonjin gakk\u014d).\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nHangzhou is twinned with:\n\n\n== Ancient proverbs about Hangzhou ==\nAn ancient proverb about Hangzhou and Suzhou is:\n\n\"Paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below.\" (\u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802\uff0c\u4e0b\u6709\u82cf\u676d)This phrase has a similar meaning to the English phrases \"Heaven on Earth\".  Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

Known as one of the landmarks of  the West Lake, it is located just north of the lake on top of Precious Stone Hill (\u5b9d\u77f3\u5c71, b\u01ceosh\u00edsh\u0101n). Its small base supports seven stories (45 me) and gives it a distinctively slender and elegant appearance.The name Baochu, translated directly, means \"protect Chu\", who, legend has it, refers to Qian Chu, the last king of Wuyue. As the story goes, one of King Chu's ministers had the temple constructed for prayers to be said for his safe return from a trip he had taken to Kaifeng, in central China. He had been summoned there by the Emperor and had been gone many days with no news of his return.It was originally constructed in 963 and stood nine storeys tall. Its most recent reconstruction, in 1933, left it slightly shorter, seven storeys, and it has most recently had its lantern replaced on its top, though its previous one is on display near the pagoda. It is constructed of brick and stone and contains no internal staircase. The tower lies next to a path that runs the length of West Lake's northern mountain range and is accessible by both dirt paths and cement stairs from nearly every side of the mountain.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPrip-M\u00f8ller, Johannes; On the Building History of the Pao Shu T'a; Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, North-China Branch, Vol LXVII (1936), p. 50-8 (Online Volumes of Journal)",

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. It is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in East China. IHangzhou comprises 10 districts, 1 county-level city, and 2 counties. The ten urban districts occupy  8,292.31 km2 (3,201.68 sq mi) and have a population of 8,241,000, in which there are six central urban districts and four suburban districts. The central urban districts occupy 706.27 km2 (272.69 sq mi) and have a population of 3,780,000 and the suburban districts occupy 7,586.04 km2 (2,928.99 sq mi) and have a population of 4,461,000.\nIn the early 90s, the urban districts of Hangzhou only comprises Shangcheng, Xiacheng, Gongshu, Jianggan.\nOn December 11, 1996, Bingjiang District was established.\nOn March 12, 2001, the City of Xiaoshan and the City of Yuhang was included into the City of Hangzhou as two districts.\nOn December 13, 2014, and in July 2017, the City of Fuyang and Lin'an were included into the City of Hangzhou as two districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nHangzhou city had a population of 5,162,039 (including Xiaoshan and Yuhang) at the 2010 census, an increase of 4.8% per year since the 2000 census. The most recent estimates of the city's urban area population are between 6,658,000 and 6,820,000.During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 9,018,000 in 2015. The entire province had a population of 8,700,373, and the encompassing urban agglomeration (including Shaoxing) is estimated to have population of 8,450,000.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 13.4 million, although other sources put the figure at over 21 million. The Hangzhou metropolitan area includes the major cities of Shaoxing, Jiaxing and Huzhou.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHangzhou's economy has rapidly developed since its opening up in 1992. It is an industrial city with many diverse sectors such as light industry, agriculture, and textiles. It is considered an important manufacturing base and logistics hub for coastal China. In recent years, Hangzhou has seen substantial development in its financial sector, featuring for the first time in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2018 at rank 89.\nThe 2001 GDP of Hangzhou was RMB 156.8 billion, which ranked second among all of the provincial capitals after Guangzhou. The city has more than tripled its GDP since then, increasing from RMB 156.8 billion in 2001 to RMB 1.3509 trillion in 2018 and GDP per capita increasing from US$3,020 to $21,184.The city has developed many new industries, including medicine, information technology, heavy equipment, automotive components, household electrical appliances, electronics, telecommunication, fine chemicals, chemical fibre and food\nprocessing. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has also strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta+\" classification according to GaWC.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\nHangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone was established and approved as a national development zone by the State Council in 1993. It covers an area of 104.7 km2 (40.4 sq mi). Encouraged industries include electronic information, biological medicine, machinery and household appliances manufacturing, and food processing.Hangzhou Export Processing Zone was established on April 27, 2000 upon approval of the State Council. It was one of the first zones and the only one in Zhejiang Province to be approved by the government. Its total planned area is 2.92 km2 (1.13 sq mi). It is located close to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport and Hangzhou Port.Hangzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was set up with approval from the State Council as a state-level high-tech Industrial Development Zone in March 1991. The HHTZ is composed of three parts, with the main regions being the Zhijiang Sci-Tech Industrial Park and Xiasha Sci-Tech Industrial Park. HHTZ has become one of the most influential high-tech innovation and high-tech industry bases in Zhejiang Province. As of 2013, HHTZ hosts more than 1,100 software developers and BPO enterprises. Major companies such as Motorola, Nokia and Siemens have established R&D centers in the zone. In 2011, the GDP of the zone rose by 13.1 percent, amounting to RMB 41.63 billion. This accounted for 5.9 percent of Hangzhou's total GDP. The HHTZ positions itself as the \"Silicon Valley\" of China. The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places. Adjacent to the lake is an area which includes historical pagodas, cultural sites, as well as the natural environment of the lake and hills, including Phoenix Mountain.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world.

In modern times, Hangzhou was home to the China Academy of Art and prominent painters such as Lin Fengmian and Fang Ganmin.\nTea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating Longjing, a notable variety of green tea, the most notable type being Longjing Tea. Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown in Longjing village near West Lake in Hangzhou, hence its name.The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon silk production, umbrellas, and Chinese hand-held folding fans.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of Zhejiang provincial cuisine, which is claimed as one of China's eight fundamental cuisines. The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China. Those planted by the West Lake is the best Longjing tea.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port of Hangzhou is a small river port with a cargo throughput that exceeds 100 million tons annually.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Netherlands, Qatar, Portugal and the United States. Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city. Public universities include Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology, and Hangzhou Normal University etc.  Xiasha, located near the east end of the city,  and Xiaoheshan, located near the west end of the city, are college towns with a cluster of several universities and colleges.\n\nChina Academy of Art (founded in 1928)\nChina Jiliang University\nHangzhou Dianzi University\nHangzhou Normal University (founded in 1908)\nZhejiang Chinese Medical University\nZhejiang Forestry University\nZhejiang Gongshang University (founded in 1911, the earliest business school in China)\nZhejiang University of Science and Technology\nZhejiang International Studies University (also known as Zhejiang Education Institute, founded in 1955)\nZhejiang Sci-Tech University\nZhejiang Shuren University\nZhejiang University (founded in 1897), one of the top universities in China. (Project 985, Project 211, C9 League)\nZhejiang University City College\nZhejiang University of Technology (1953)\nZhejiang University of Media and Communications (1984)Note: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nProvincial key Public high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou No. 4 High School, Hangzhou No. 14 High School, Hangzhou No. 2 High School, Hangzhou Foreign Language School, High School Attached to Zhejiang University, High School attached to Hangzhou Normal university, Hangzhou No. 1 High School and Hangzhou Xuejun High School.\nPrivate high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou Green Town Yuhua School, Hangzhou Chinese International School, Hangzhou International School and Hangzhou Japanese School (\u676d\u5dde\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5b66\u6821) (nihonjin gakk\u014d).\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nHangzhou is twinned with:\n\n\n== Ancient proverbs about Hangzhou ==\nAn ancient proverb about Hangzhou and Suzhou is:\n\n\"Paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below.\" (\u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802\uff0c\u4e0b\u6709\u82cf\u676d)This phrase has a similar meaning to the English phrases \"Heaven on Earth\".  Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

It is located at the foot of Yuelun Hill, facing the Qiantang River. It was originally constructed in 970 by the Wuyue Kingdom, destroyed in 1121, and reconstructed fully by 1165, during the Southern Song dynasty (1127\u20131279).\n\n\n== History and background ==\nThe pagoda was originally constructed by the ruler of the Wuyue Kingdom, whose capital was Hangzhou. The name Liuhe comes from the six Buddhist ordinances and it is said that the reason for building the pagoda was to calm the tidal bore of the Qiantang River and as a navigational aid. However, the pagoda was completely destroyed during warfare in the year 1121.\nAfter the current pagoda was constructed of wood and brick during the Southern Song dynasty, additional exterior eaves were added during the Ming (1368\u20131644) and Qing Dynasties (1644\u20131911). The pagoda is hexagonal in shape and some 59.89 metres (196.5 ft) in height, it also has the appearance of being a thirteen-story structure, though it only has seven interior stories. There is a spiral staircase leading to the top floor and upon each of the seven ceilings are carved and painted figures including animals, flowers, birds and characters. Each story of the pagoda consists of four elements, the exterior walls, a zigzagged corridor, the interior walls and a small chamber. Viewed from outside, the pagoda appears to be layered-bright on the upper surface and dark underneath. That is a harmonious alternation of light and shade.\nAccording to the British sinologist and historian Joseph Needham, the pagoda also served as a lighthouse along the Qiantang River. Being of considerable size and stature, it actually served as a permanent lighthouse from nearly its beginning, to aid sailors in seeking anchorage for their ships at night (as described in the Hangzhou Fu Zhi).A small \"Pagoda Park\" has recently been opened nearby. Its exhibition features models of ancient Chinese pagodas and illustrates the variety of different designs, as well as history, culture and symbols associated with the pagoda.\n\n\n== See also ==\nChinese architecture\nArchitecture of the Song dynasty\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nSix Harmonies Pagoda\n Geographic data related to Liuhe Pagoda at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "\u2039See TfM\u203a\n\nLu Yu (simplified Chinese: \u9646\u7fbd; traditional Chinese: \u9678\u7fbd; pinyin: L\u00f9 Y\u01d4; 733\u2013804) was a Chinese tea master and writer. He is respected as the Sage of Tea for his contribution to Chinese tea culture. He is best known for his monumental book The Classic of Tea, the first definitive work on cultivating, making and drinking tea.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nLu was born in 733 in Tianmen, Hubei. For six years, Lu Yu stayed in Huomen mountain studying under the guidance of master Zou Fuzi. During this period, Lu Yu often brewed tea for his teacher. He also took care of fellow students' health using his remarkable knowledge in tea and herbs that he learned while at the Longgai Monastery.\nWhenever time permitted between his studies Lu Yu often went to the countryside to gather tea leaves and herbs. In one of those trips Lu Yu stumbled upon a spring underneath a 6-foot round rock and the water from the spring was extremely clear and clean. When Lu Yu brewed tea with this spring water, he found the tea tasted unexpectedly better than usual. From then on, Lu Yu realised the importance of quality water in brewing tea.\nZou Fuzi was moved by Lu Yu's obsession with tea and his skill in brewing good tea. He cleared the rock together with some of his students and dug a well around the fountainhead of that spring. \nIn 1768, just over a thousand years later during the Qing Dynasty (1616\u20131911), Jingling was hit by drought and the whole city was badly in need of water. City folks found water still flowing from this well uncovered by Lu Yu and dug by Zou Fuzi. A Qing official ordered three wells to be dug around the spring and a structure constructed near the wells named \"Lu Yu Hut\" and the \"Literary Spring\".\nIn 752 Lu Yu concluded his studies, bade farewell to his shifu (teacher) Zou Fuzi and returned to Jingling to meet his benefactor Li Qiwu. However, a year earlier Li Qiwu was reinstated and returned to the Tang capital Chang'an. The new Chief Official of Jingling now was Cui Guofu. Cui, a senior official who held a position similar to an Education Minister of today, was demoted to Jingling as a Chief Official for offending a member of the royalty.\n\nCui Guofu was a scholar and poet well known for his magnificent 5 characters per verse short poem. After his demotion to Jingling, Cui Guofu took life fairly easy. Even though Cui was many years older than Lu Yu, both men shared the same interest in tea, literature, and poetry. As such they became good friends soon after they met. During this period, Lu Yu stayed with Cui Guofu and assisted him in his administrative tasks. The two of a kind spent much time traveling, drinking tea, and writing poems, and they co-authored several books on poems.\nThis period with Cui Guofu was the growing phase for Lu Yu as a man of letters; an incubation period for Lu Yu to practise and sharpen what he learned from his shifu Zou Fuzi. Cui Guofu, with his vast experience and skill in literary work, became a coach that provided the necessary guidance to enhance and mature Lu Yu's writing and literary skills. During this time he wrote The Classic of Tea.\nThe original version of The Classic of Tea consisted of 3 books totaling 10 chapters: book 1 consisted of the first 3 chapters; book 2 consisted of chapter 4 only; book 3 consisted of chapters 5 to 10. After the Tang Dynasty all three books were bound into a single volume, and the three volume version was no longer available.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of tea in China\nTea Classics\nLu-Yu Tea Culture Institute\n\n\n== External links ==\nTea History\nLu Yu and Chinese tea culture on China.com\nWorks by Yu Lu at Project Gutenberg",

          "Having studied about Yue Fei in school, as well as reading books about him during my school days, it hit a chord to me when i was there, thus to me, it was rather interesting. If you do not know the history behind him, then it would just be another museum or temple tour.",
          "i heard a lot bout the legend of Yue fei.. his loyalty to the king and how he protect the resident.. and also the song written of his death. that's is the reason i was here to know more.. if you are hinese, yu shall bring your children to know more about this general, his life",
          "I really recommend the tomb of Yue Fei. It is a very well kept temple and tomb complex and certainly worth the 25 RMB entry fee. The tomb itself is very typical of the period and gives you a great insight into the way that the Chinese continue to honour national heroes",
          "My wife and I went and really enjoyed it, but you need to read up on it beforehand. There is very little in English but the area is very nice and definitely worth a visit.",
          "This is the second time my family and I have visited this historic site. Now there is an electronic audio tour [which we didn't use: it didn't fit in with our schedule and to be honest we found the prices and rules for it quite unclear]. We enjoyed the ambience better this time",
          "A good place to start with if you want to introduce a bit of Chinese history to your lids or friends. Colourful characters and a passionate story, delineated in words and pictures, make it a good place to visit with your kids or with your friends from the West. Eateries, hotel"

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. It is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in East China. IHangzhou comprises 10 districts, 1 county-level city, and 2 counties. The ten urban districts occupy  8,292.31 km2 (3,201.68 sq mi) and have a population of 8,241,000, in which there are six central urban districts and four suburban districts. The central urban districts occupy 706.27 km2 (272.69 sq mi) and have a population of 3,780,000 and the suburban districts occupy 7,586.04 km2 (2,928.99 sq mi) and have a population of 4,461,000.\nIn the early 90s, the urban districts of Hangzhou only comprises Shangcheng, Xiacheng, Gongshu, Jianggan.\nOn December 11, 1996, Bingjiang District was established.\nOn March 12, 2001, the City of Xiaoshan and the City of Yuhang was included into the City of Hangzhou as two districts.\nOn December 13, 2014, and in July 2017, the City of Fuyang and Lin'an were included into the City of Hangzhou as two districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nHangzhou city had a population of 5,162,039 (including Xiaoshan and Yuhang) at the 2010 census, an increase of 4.8% per year since the 2000 census. The most recent estimates of the city's urban area population are between 6,658,000 and 6,820,000.During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 9,018,000 in 2015. The entire province had a population of 8,700,373, and the encompassing urban agglomeration (including Shaoxing) is estimated to have population of 8,450,000.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 13.4 million, although other sources put the figure at over 21 million. The Hangzhou metropolitan area includes the major cities of Shaoxing, Jiaxing and Huzhou.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHangzhou's economy has rapidly developed since its opening up in 1992. It is an industrial city with many diverse sectors such as light industry, agriculture, and textiles. It is considered an important manufacturing base and logistics hub for coastal China. In recent years, Hangzhou has seen substantial development in its financial sector, featuring for the first time in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2018 at rank 89.\nThe 2001 GDP of Hangzhou was RMB 156.8 billion, which ranked second among all of the provincial capitals after Guangzhou. The city has more than tripled its GDP since then, increasing from RMB 156.8 billion in 2001 to RMB 1.3509 trillion in 2018 and GDP per capita increasing from US$3,020 to $21,184.The city has developed many new industries, including medicine, information technology, heavy equipment, automotive components, household electrical appliances, electronics, telecommunication, fine chemicals, chemical fibre and food\nprocessing. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has also strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta+\" classification according to GaWC.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\nHangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone was established and approved as a national development zone by the State Council in 1993. It covers an area of 104.7 km2 (40.4 sq mi). Encouraged industries include electronic information, biological medicine, machinery and household appliances manufacturing, and food processing.Hangzhou Export Processing Zone was established on April 27, 2000 upon approval of the State Council. It was one of the first zones and the only one in Zhejiang Province to be approved by the government. Its total planned area is 2.92 km2 (1.13 sq mi). It is located close to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport and Hangzhou Port.Hangzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was set up with approval from the State Council as a state-level high-tech Industrial Development Zone in March 1991. The HHTZ is composed of three parts, with the main regions being the Zhijiang Sci-Tech Industrial Park and Xiasha Sci-Tech Industrial Park. HHTZ has become one of the most influential high-tech innovation and high-tech industry bases in Zhejiang Province. As of 2013, HHTZ hosts more than 1,100 software developers and BPO enterprises. Major companies such as Motorola, Nokia and Siemens have established R&D centers in the zone. In 2011, the GDP of the zone rose by 13.1 percent, amounting to RMB 41.63 billion. This accounted for 5.9 percent of Hangzhou's total GDP. The HHTZ positions itself as the \"Silicon Valley\" of China. The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places. Adjacent to the lake is an area which includes historical pagodas, cultural sites, as well as the natural environment of the lake and hills, including Phoenix Mountain. There are two causeways across the lake.\nOther places of interest\nGrand Canal, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the Canal in Hangzhou was built in 610 AD.

These islands are different in size and shape, and have distinctive scene.\nLongjing tea fields, west of the lake.\nQiantang riveris the largest river in Zhejiang Province, China. Every year during August 15th to August 18th of the lunar month in China, the Qiantang Tide occurs. It is called \u201cthe Biggest Tide in the World\u201dIn March 2013 the Hangzhou Tourism Commission started an online campaign via Facebook, the 'Modern Marco Polo' campaign. Over the next year nearly 26,000 participants applied from around the globe, in the hopes of becoming Hangzhou's first foreign tourism ambassador. In a press conference in Hangzhou on 20 May 2014, Liam Bates was announced as the successful winner and won a $55,000 contract, being the first foreigner ever to be appointed by China's government in such an official role.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Scenic places near West Lake ===\nJingci Temple is located just south of West Lake.\nLingyin Temple (Soul's Retreat) is located about 2 km (1.2 mi) west of West Lake.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world. China National Tea Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6\u535a\u7269\u9986) is a national museum with special subjects as tea and its culture. Zhejiang Provincial Museum (\u6d59\u6c5f\u535a\u7269\u9986) features collection of integrated human studies, exhibition and research with its over 100,000 collected cultural relics.\nThere are lots of theaters in Hangzhou showing performance of opera shows. Yue opera, originated from Shengzhou, Zhejiang Province, is the second-largest opera form in China. Also, there are several big shows themed with the history and culture of Hangzhou like Impression West Lake and the Romance of Song Dynasty.\nHangzhou has historically been an important hub for artists and scholars. In modern times, Hangzhou was home to the China Academy of Art and prominent painters such as Lin Fengmian and Fang Ganmin.\nTea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating Longjing, a notable variety of green tea, the most notable type being Longjing Tea. Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown in Longjing village near West Lake in Hangzhou, hence its name.The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon silk production, umbrellas, and Chinese hand-held folding fans.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of Zhejiang provincial cuisine, which is claimed as one of China's eight fundamental cuisines. The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China. Those planted by the West Lake is the best Longjing tea.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port of Hangzhou is a small river port with a cargo throughput that exceeds 100 million tons annually.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Netherlands, Qatar, Portugal and the United States. Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city. Public universities include Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology, and Hangzhou Normal University etc.  Xiasha, located near the east end of the city,  and Xiaoheshan, located near the west end of the city, are college towns with a cluster of several universities and colleges.\n\nChina Academy of Art (founded in 1928)\nChina Jiliang University\nHangzhou Dianzi University\nHangzhou Normal University (founded in 1908)\nZhejiang Chinese Medical University\nZhejiang Forestry University\nZhejiang Gongshang University (founded in 1911, the earliest business school in China)\nZhejiang University of Science and Technology\nZhejiang International Studies University (also known as Zhejiang Education Institute, founded in 1955)\nZhejiang Sci-Tech University\nZhejiang Shuren University\nZhejiang University (founded in 1897), one of the top universities in China. (Project 985, Project 211, C9 League)\nZhejiang University City College\nZhejiang University of Technology (1953)\nZhejiang University of Media and Communications (1984)Note: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nProvincial key Public high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou No. 4 High School, Hangzhou No. 14 High School, Hangzhou No. 2 High School, Hangzhou Foreign Language School, High School Attached to Zhejiang University, High School attached to Hangzhou Normal university, Hangzhou No. 1 High School and Hangzhou Xuejun High School.\nPrivate high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou Green Town Yuhua School, Hangzhou Chinese International School, Hangzhou International School and Hangzhou Japanese School (\u676d\u5dde\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5b66\u6821) (nihonjin gakk\u014d).\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nHangzhou is twinned with:\n\n\n== Ancient proverbs about Hangzhou ==\nAn ancient proverb about Hangzhou and Suzhou is:\n\n\"Paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below.\" (\u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802\uff0c\u4e0b\u6709\u82cf\u676d)This phrase has a similar meaning to the English phrases \"Heaven on Earth\".  Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world.

The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China.

Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi.

The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city.

Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

        "wiki": "Qiandao Lake (simplified Chinese: \u5343\u5c9b\u6e56; traditional Chinese: \u5343\u5cf6\u6e56; pinyin: Qi\u0101nd\u01ceo H\u00fa; lit.: 'Thousand Island Lake'), a human-made, freshwater lake located in Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, China, was formed after the completion of the Xin'an River hydroelectric station in 1959.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n1,078 large islands dot the lake and a few thousand smaller ones are scattered across it.  Over 90% of the area is forested. The islands in the lake include Bird Island, Snake Island, Monkey Island, Lock Island (featuring supposedly the world's biggest lock), and the Island to Remind You of Your Childhood. The lake covers an area of 573 km2 (221 sq mi) and has a storage capacity of 17.8 km3 (4.3 cu mi). The islands in the lake cover about 86 km2 (33 sq mi).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Xin'an River Dam ===\nThe valley was flooded in 1959 to create the lake for the Xin'an River Dam project. The dam that created the lake is located at 29\u00b029\u203201\u2033N 119\u00b012\u203248\u2033E and is 105 m (344 ft) tall with a crest length of 466.5 m (1,531 ft). Xin'an Dam was the first dam constructed in China with a height greater than 100 m (328 ft) and its power plant has an installed capacity of 845 MW.\n\n\n=== Submerged city of Shi Cheng ===\nSubmerged in the lake, at the foot of Wu Shi Mountain (\u4e94\u72ee\u5c71, \"Five Lion Mountain\"), lies an ancient city known as Shi Cheng (\u72ee\u57ce, \"Lion City\"). It was built during the Eastern Han Dynasty (AD 25\u2013200) and was first set up as a county in AD 208. The city acquired its name from nearby Wu Shi (Five Lion) Mountain, which is now known as Wu Shi Island since it too became partially submerged by the reservoir. At present Shi Cheng remains well-preserved and undisturbed at a depth of 26\u201340 m (85\u2013131 ft). \nBesides the city of Shi Cheng many other historic sites have been confirmed beneath the water.\n\n\n=== Qiandao Lake incident ===\nIn 1994, in an event since named the Qiandao Lake Incident, three hijackers boarded a boat full of tourists and set it on fire, killing all 32 passengers on board. The passengers were mainly tourists from Taiwan.\n\n\n=== Archimedes bridge ===\nIn 1998, a Chinese-Italian consortium began planning the construction of a prototype of a submerged floating tunnel (also known as an Archimedes bridge), and decided in 2005 to build it across Quiandao Lake. The bridge, the first in the world of its kind, is expected to span 100 m (330 ft), as a proof of concept for larger bridges.\n\n\n== Economy ==\nCompanies take advantage of the pristine quality of the water and environment for aquaculture and water branding. Qiandao Lake is used to produce the Nongfu Spring brand of mineral water. Kaluga Queen produces much of the world's caviar through raising sturgeon in pens at the lake.The lake has made Zhejiang a popular area for tourists. As a result, housing development has increased in the area since the late 1990s.\n\n\n== Transport ==\nAn expressway links Hangzhou, Qiandao Lake, and Huangshan in Anhui. Every half an hour buses leave from West Hangzhou bus station to that connect Qiandao Lake.On December 2015, 2018, high speed rail services started to serve the Qiandao Lake Railway Station on the Hangzhou-Huangshan line.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nLucky Buddha Beer\nQiandao Lake Incident\nHangzhou Qiandaohu, a company named after the lake, next to which its headquarters and brewery are located.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"This Is What China's Version of Atlantis Looks Like\".

        "wiki": "The Three Great Pillars of Chinese Catholicism (\u8056\u6559\u4e09\u67f1\u77f3, literally the \"Holy Religion's Three Pillar-Stones\") refer to the three most famous Chinese converts to Christianity, during the 16th and 17th century Jesuit China missions. The three pillars are:\n\nX\u00fa Gu\u0101ngq\u01d0 (Wade\u2013Giles: Hs\u00fc Kuang-ch'i; \u5f90\u5149\u555f, 1562\u20131633) of Shanghai\nL\u01d0 Zh\u012bz\u01ceo (Wade\u2013Giles: Li Chih-tsao; \u674e\u4e4b\u85fb, 1565\u2013November 1, 1630) of Hangzhou\nY\u00e1ng T\u00edngy\u00fan (Wade\u2013Giles: Yang T'ing-y\u00fcn; \u694a\u5ef7\u7b60, 1557\u20131627) of HangzhouTheir combined efforts helped lead Hangzhou and Shanghai to become centres of missionary activity in late Ming China. These men shared an interest in Western science and mathematics, and it is probable that this was what first attracted them to the Jesuits responsible for their conversion.\n\n\n== Origin of name ==\nThis name is derived from a passage in Saint Paul\u2019s letter to the Galatians (2:9):\n\n\u201cAnd when they had known the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship\u2026\"The passage in Chinese is somewhat more obvious:\n\n\u300c\u90a3\u7a31\u70ba\u6559\u6703\u67f1\u77f3\u7684\u96c5\u5404\u3001\u78ef\u6cd5\u3001\u7d04\u7ff0\uff0c\u5c31\u5411\u6211\u548c\u5df4\u62ff\u5df4\u7528\u53f3\u624b\u884c\u76f8\u4ea4\u4e4b\u79ae...\u300dwherein it calls James, Peter and John the \"pillars of the Church\". The inevitable connection was then seen between the \"pillars\" of the early Church and the three men who helped to evangelize Ming China.\n\n\n== Xu Guangqi ==\n\nXu Guangqi was a Chinese scholar-bureaucrat, Catholic convert, agricultural scientist, astronomer, and mathematician. He holds the title of Servant of God, and received his beatification in April 2011. He contributed to the translation of the first parts of Euclid's Elements into Chinese. He also worked on the reform of the Chinese calendar, which constituted the first major collaboration between scientists from Europe and from the Far East, though it was completed after his death.\n\n\n== Yang Tingyun ==\nYang Tingyun was born into a devout Buddhist family. At the age of 35 (1592), after taking the Imperial Examinations he became an Inspector in the imperial ministries. In 1600 he met Matteo Ricci, one of the founding fathers of missionary activity in China, but did not convert or receive Baptism at that time. He worked with Ricci and other Jesuits to publish China's first global atlas, the Zhifang waiji. Later however, in 1611, Yang accompanied a fellow official Li Zhizao back to Hangzhou to arrange for his late father's funeral, and saw that Li had not only thrown out his home's Buddhist statues and imagery, but that he did not send for Buddhist priests to give the man his last rites. Instead, he had brought two Jesuit priests, Lazzaro Cattaneo and Nicolas Trigault, to do the job and a Chinese monk Zh\u014dng M\u00edngr\u00e9n (\u937e\u9cf4\u4ec1) to explain the rite's significance to the gathered friends and relatives. One month later, impressed by Li's newfound piety, he abandoned his concubine and  was himself baptized, receiving the Christian name \"Michael\" (M\u00ed'\u00e9'\u011br \u5f4c\u984d\u723e).Of particular significance is Yang Tingyun's willingness to abandon status symbols such as his family's traditional beliefs and the concubine, for these were some of the main obstacles in the way of the Jesuit mission to China. In the same way that he was impressed by Li Zhizao's conversion (see below), many other Chinese were impressed by his and followed his example, starting with the 30 members of his family and then moving on to his friends, in total convincing over 100 people to accept Christ. His other notable contributions to Christianity in China include his funding of the missionaries in Hangzhou, granting them the use of his estate as their base of operations; using his influence and wealth to offer protection and shelter to Christian refugees during periods of anti-Christian unrest; and also the buying up of land at Tianshui Bridge (\u5929\u6c34\u6a4b) and Dafangjing (\u5927\u65b9\u4e95) to build the first church in Hangzhou and the Jesuit Cemetery.When the church had for the most part been completed, Yang became severely ill. Knowing it was his end, Yang Tingyun requested the sacraments from the priest, and in January 1628, at the age of 71, died. Because he had been seen as a great scholar and man of excellent moral fibre, the people of Hangzhou had him honoured in the Xi\u0101ngxi\u00e1n C\u00ed (\u9115\u8ce2\u7960), a hall for honouring local heroes and ancestors.\n\n\n=== Writings ===\nLight Emitted by Heaven, Ti\u0101n sh\u00ec m\u00edng bi\u00e0n \u300a\u5929\u91cb\u660e\u8fa8\u300b, is a treatise on the union of Confucianist and Christian thought. He writes,A spiritual nature is God's gift to man, and it is the greatest gift of all, ... benevolence, righteousness, social etiquette, and wisdom [the four Confucianist virtues] are all indeed of this nature. These things that God has given us are what we've had all along.

He was known by the courtesy names of W\u01d2c\u00fan (\u6211\u5b58) and Zh\u00e8nzh\u012b (\u632f\u4e4b), as well as by the pseudonym \"The Man of Liangyan\" (\u6dbc\u5eb5\u5c45\u58eb, alternative writings: \u6dbc\u5eb5\u9038\u6c11, \u6dbc\u5eb5\u5b50,  or \u6dbc\u53df). In 1610, while in Beijing, Li became gravely ill and, without any friends or family in Beijing to care for him, was soon on the verge of death. Fortunately, at that point in his life he became acquainted with the Jesuit Matteo Ricci who took him into his care, treated him \"as a family member\", and soon brought him back to health. Ricci also during this time taught him much of Western science, mathematics, and Catholicism. Shortly thereafter Li Zhizao was baptized and given the Christian name \"Leon\" (li\u00e1ng \u826f).After converting, Li Zhizao took an oath saying, \"As long as I live, all that God has given me, I shall put to good use for Him.\"  While still in Beijing, he presented Matteo Ricci with 100 taels of gold for the purpose of building a church there. Later Li would also be responsible for introducing Catholicism to his hometown of Hangzhou. The year after he returned home for his father's funeral, he brought with him two other Jesuit missionaries.  In 1625 he was the first to publish the Chinese text of the Nestorian Stele.\n\n\n=== Writings ===\nLi Zhizao was responsible for translating many works of Western science and mathematics into Chinese.\n\nPlea to Translate Books on Western Calendar Methods, Q\u01d0ng y\u00ec x\u012b y\u00e1ng l\u00ec f\u01ce d\u011bng sh\u016b sh\u016b \u300a\u8acb\u8b6f\u897f\u6d0b\u66c6\u6cd5\u7b49\u66f8\u758f\u300b, was submitted to the Ming dynasty Wanli Emperor, beseeching him to hire missionaries and have them make corrections to the Chinese calendar.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nRoman Catholicism in China\nLi Yingshi - another important convert made by Ricci\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===",

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world.

The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China. Those planted by the West Lake is the best Longjing tea.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port of Hangzhou is a small river port with a cargo throughput that exceeds 100 million tons annually.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Netherlands, Qatar, Portugal and the United States. Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city. Public universities include Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology, and Hangzhou Normal University etc.  Xiasha, located near the east end of the city,  and Xiaoheshan, located near the west end of the city, are college towns with a cluster of several universities and colleges.\n\nChina Academy of Art (founded in 1928)\nChina Jiliang University\nHangzhou Dianzi University\nHangzhou Normal University (founded in 1908)\nZhejiang Chinese Medical University\nZhejiang Forestry University\nZhejiang Gongshang University (founded in 1911, the earliest business school in China)\nZhejiang University of Science and Technology\nZhejiang International Studies University (also known as Zhejiang Education Institute, founded in 1955)\nZhejiang Sci-Tech University\nZhejiang Shuren University\nZhejiang University (founded in 1897), one of the top universities in China.

Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. It is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in East China. IHangzhou comprises 10 districts, 1 county-level city, and 2 counties. The ten urban districts occupy  8,292.31 km2 (3,201.68 sq mi) and have a population of 8,241,000, in which there are six central urban districts and four suburban districts.

The most recent estimates of the city's urban area population are between 6,658,000 and 6,820,000.During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 9,018,000 in 2015. The entire province had a population of 8,700,373, and the encompassing urban agglomeration (including Shaoxing) is estimated to have population of 8,450,000.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 13.4 million, although other sources put the figure at over 21 million. The Hangzhou metropolitan area includes the major cities of Shaoxing, Jiaxing and Huzhou.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHangzhou's economy has rapidly developed since its opening up in 1992. It is an industrial city with many diverse sectors such as light industry, agriculture, and textiles. It is considered an important manufacturing base and logistics hub for coastal China. In recent years, Hangzhou has seen substantial development in its financial sector, featuring for the first time in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2018 at rank 89.\nThe 2001 GDP of Hangzhou was RMB 156.8 billion, which ranked second among all of the provincial capitals after Guangzhou. The city has more than tripled its GDP since then, increasing from RMB 156.8 billion in 2001 to RMB 1.3509 trillion in 2018 and GDP per capita increasing from US$3,020 to $21,184.The city has developed many new industries, including medicine, information technology, heavy equipment, automotive components, household electrical appliances, electronics, telecommunication, fine chemicals, chemical fibre and food\nprocessing. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has also strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta+\" classification according to GaWC.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\nHangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone was established and approved as a national development zone by the State Council in 1993. It covers an area of 104.7 km2 (40.4 sq mi).

It is located close to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport and Hangzhou Port.Hangzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was set up with approval from the State Council as a state-level high-tech Industrial Development Zone in March 1991. The HHTZ is composed of three parts, with the main regions being the Zhijiang Sci-Tech Industrial Park and Xiasha Sci-Tech Industrial Park. HHTZ has become one of the most influential high-tech innovation and high-tech industry bases in Zhejiang Province. As of 2013, HHTZ hosts more than 1,100 software developers and BPO enterprises. Major companies such as Motorola, Nokia and Siemens have established R&D centers in the zone. In 2011, the GDP of the zone rose by 13.1 percent, amounting to RMB 41.63 billion. This accounted for 5.9 percent of Hangzhou's total GDP. The HHTZ positions itself as the \"Silicon Valley\" of China. The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places. Adjacent to the lake is an area which includes historical pagodas, cultural sites, as well as the natural environment of the lake and hills, including Phoenix Mountain.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world.

In modern times, Hangzhou was home to the China Academy of Art and prominent painters such as Lin Fengmian and Fang Ganmin.\nTea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating Longjing, a notable variety of green tea, the most notable type being Longjing Tea. Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown in Longjing village near West Lake in Hangzhou, hence its name.The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon silk production, umbrellas, and Chinese hand-held folding fans.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of Zhejiang provincial cuisine, which is claimed as one of China's eight fundamental cuisines. The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China. Those planted by the West Lake is the best Longjing tea.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port of Hangzhou is a small river port with a cargo throughput that exceeds 100 million tons annually.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Netherlands, Qatar, Portugal and the United States. Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city. Public universities include Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology, and Hangzhou Normal University etc.  Xiasha, located near the east end of the city,  and Xiaoheshan, located near the west end of the city, are college towns with a cluster of several universities and colleges.\n\nChina Academy of Art (founded in 1928)\nChina Jiliang University\nHangzhou Dianzi University\nHangzhou Normal University (founded in 1908)\nZhejiang Chinese Medical University\nZhejiang Forestry University\nZhejiang Gongshang University (founded in 1911, the earliest business school in China)\nZhejiang University of Science and Technology\nZhejiang International Studies University (also known as Zhejiang Education Institute, founded in 1955)\nZhejiang Sci-Tech University\nZhejiang Shuren University\nZhejiang University (founded in 1897), one of the top universities in China. (Project 985, Project 211, C9 League)\nZhejiang University City College\nZhejiang University of Technology (1953)\nZhejiang University of Media and Communications (1984)Note: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nProvincial key Public high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou No. 4 High School, Hangzhou No. 14 High School, Hangzhou No. 2 High School, Hangzhou Foreign Language School, High School Attached to Zhejiang University, High School attached to Hangzhou Normal university, Hangzhou No. 1 High School and Hangzhou Xuejun High School.\nPrivate high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou Green Town Yuhua School, Hangzhou Chinese International School, Hangzhou International School and Hangzhou Japanese School (\u676d\u5dde\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5b66\u6821) (nihonjin gakk\u014d).\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nHangzhou is twinned with:\n\n\n== Ancient proverbs about Hangzhou ==\nAn ancient proverb about Hangzhou and Suzhou is:\n\n\"Paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below.\" (\u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802\uff0c\u4e0b\u6709\u82cf\u676d)This phrase has a similar meaning to the English phrases \"Heaven on Earth\".  Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. It is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in East China. IHangzhou comprises 10 districts, 1 county-level city, and 2 counties. The ten urban districts occupy  8,292.31 km2 (3,201.68 sq mi) and have a population of 8,241,000, in which there are six central urban districts and four suburban districts.

The most recent estimates of the city's urban area population are between 6,658,000 and 6,820,000.During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 9,018,000 in 2015. The entire province had a population of 8,700,373, and the encompassing urban agglomeration (including Shaoxing) is estimated to have population of 8,450,000.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 13.4 million, although other sources put the figure at over 21 million. The Hangzhou metropolitan area includes the major cities of Shaoxing, Jiaxing and Huzhou.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHangzhou's economy has rapidly developed since its opening up in 1992. It is an industrial city with many diverse sectors such as light industry, agriculture, and textiles. It is considered an important manufacturing base and logistics hub for coastal China. In recent years, Hangzhou has seen substantial development in its financial sector, featuring for the first time in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2018 at rank 89.\nThe 2001 GDP of Hangzhou was RMB 156.8 billion, which ranked second among all of the provincial capitals after Guangzhou. The city has more than tripled its GDP since then, increasing from RMB 156.8 billion in 2001 to RMB 1.3509 trillion in 2018 and GDP per capita increasing from US$3,020 to $21,184.The city has developed many new industries, including medicine, information technology, heavy equipment, automotive components, household electrical appliances, electronics, telecommunication, fine chemicals, chemical fibre and food\nprocessing. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has also strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta+\" classification according to GaWC.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\nHangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone was established and approved as a national development zone by the State Council in 1993. It covers an area of 104.7 km2 (40.4 sq mi). Encouraged industries include electronic information, biological medicine, machinery and household appliances manufacturing, and food processing.Hangzhou Export Processing Zone was established on April 27, 2000 upon approval of the State Council. It was one of the first zones and the only one in Zhejiang Province to be approved by the government. Its total planned area is 2.92 km2 (1.13 sq mi). It is located close to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport and Hangzhou Port.Hangzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was set up with approval from the State Council as a state-level high-tech Industrial Development Zone in March 1991. The HHTZ is composed of three parts, with the main regions being the Zhijiang Sci-Tech Industrial Park and Xiasha Sci-Tech Industrial Park. HHTZ has become one of the most influential high-tech innovation and high-tech industry bases in Zhejiang Province. As of 2013, HHTZ hosts more than 1,100 software developers and BPO enterprises. Major companies such as Motorola, Nokia and Siemens have established R&D centers in the zone. In 2011, the GDP of the zone rose by 13.1 percent, amounting to RMB 41.63 billion. This accounted for 5.9 percent of Hangzhou's total GDP. The HHTZ positions itself as the \"Silicon Valley\" of China. The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places. Adjacent to the lake is an area which includes historical pagodas, cultural sites, as well as the natural environment of the lake and hills, including Phoenix Mountain. There are two causeways across the lake.\nOther places of interest\nGrand Canal, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the Canal in Hangzhou was built in 610 AD.

These islands are different in size and shape, and have distinctive scene.\nLongjing tea fields, west of the lake.\nQiantang riveris the largest river in Zhejiang Province, China. Every year during August 15th to August 18th of the lunar month in China, the Qiantang Tide occurs. It is called \u201cthe Biggest Tide in the World\u201dIn March 2013 the Hangzhou Tourism Commission started an online campaign via Facebook, the 'Modern Marco Polo' campaign. Over the next year nearly 26,000 participants applied from around the globe, in the hopes of becoming Hangzhou's first foreign tourism ambassador. In a press conference in Hangzhou on 20 May 2014, Liam Bates was announced as the successful winner and won a $55,000 contract, being the first foreigner ever to be appointed by China's government in such an official role.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Scenic places near West Lake ===\nJingci Temple is located just south of West Lake.\nLingyin Temple (Soul's Retreat) is located about 2 km (1.2 mi) west of West Lake.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world. China National Tea Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6\u535a\u7269\u9986) is a national museum with special subjects as tea and its culture.

Yue opera, originated from Shengzhou, Zhejiang Province, is the second-largest opera form in China. Also, there are several big shows themed with the history and culture of Hangzhou like Impression West Lake and the Romance of Song Dynasty.\nHangzhou has historically been an important hub for artists and scholars. In modern times, Hangzhou was home to the China Academy of Art and prominent painters such as Lin Fengmian and Fang Ganmin.\nTea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating Longjing, a notable variety of green tea, the most notable type being Longjing Tea. Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown in Longjing village near West Lake in Hangzhou, hence its name.The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon silk production, umbrellas, and Chinese hand-held folding fans.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of Zhejiang provincial cuisine, which is claimed as one of China's eight fundamental cuisines. The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China. Those planted by the West Lake is the best Longjing tea.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port of Hangzhou is a small river port with a cargo throughput that exceeds 100 million tons annually.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Netherlands, Qatar, Portugal and the United States. Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city.

Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

        "wiki": "Jinan (Chinese: \u6d4e\u5357; alternately romanized as Tsinan) is the capital of Shandong province in Eastern China. With a population of was 6.8 million as of the 2010 census, it is the second-largest city in Shandong after Qingdao. The area of present-day Jinan has played an important role in the history of the region from the earliest beginnings of civilization and has evolved into a major national administrative, economic, and transportation hub. The city has held sub-provincial administrative status since 1994. Jinan is often called the \"Spring City\" for its famous 72 artesian springs.\n\n\n== Names ==\nAs the letter N can be both syllable-final and syllable-initial in Mandarin Chinese, Hanyu Pinyin recommends that the city's name be spelled \"Ji'nan\" to avoid ambiguity with words pronounced \"Jin'an\" (e.g. \u91d1\u5b89). This practice is however widely ignored.\nThe modern-day name Jinan literally means \"south of the Ji\" and refers to the old Ji River that had flowed to the north of the city until the middle of the 19th century. The Ji River disappeared in 1852 when the Yellow River changed its course northwards and took over its bed. The current pronunciation of the character \"Ji\" with the third tone (\"j\u01d0\") was established in the late 1970s. Prior to this, it was pronounced with the fourth tone (\"j\u00ec\"). Older texts spell the name as \"Tsinan\" (Wade-Giles romanization) or \"Chi-nan\".\nDuring the times of the Zhou dynasty (1045 BC to 256 BC), the city of Lixia (simplified Chinese: \u5386\u4e0b; traditional Chinese: \u6b77\u4e0b; pinyin: L\u00ecxi\u00e0) was the major settlement in the area. The name \"Lixia\" refers to the location of Jinan at the foot of Mount Li, which lies to the south of the city). Today, Lixia is the name of one of the city's districts.\nThe Battle of An, which was fought in the area during the Spring and Autumn period (in 589 BCE) between the states of Qi and Jin, is named for the ancient city of \u0100n (Chinese: \u978d) which stood within the city limits of present-day Jinan. Marco Polo gives a brief description of Jinan under the name \"Chingli\" or \"Chinangli\". 19th and early 20th century texts frequently give the name of the city as \"Tsinan Fu\" where the additional \"Fu\" (Chinese: \u5e9c) comes from the dated Chinese term for a provincial capital (Chinese: \u7701\u5e9c).\nJinan is also referred to by the nickname \"City of Springs\" (Chinese: \u6cc9\u57ce), because of the many artesian springs in the urban city centre and its surroundings.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\nThe area of present-day Jinan has been inhabited for more than 4000 years. The Neolithic Longshan culture was first discovered at Chengziya to the east of Jinan (Zhangqiu District) in 1928. One of the characteristic features of the Longshan culture are the intricate wheel-made pottery pieces it produced. Most renowned is the black \"egg-shell pottery\" with wall thicknesses that can go below 1 millimeter.During the Spring and Autumn period (722\u2013481 BCE) and Warring States period (475\u2013221 BCE), the area of Jinan was split between two states: the state of Lu in the west and the state of Qi in the east. In 685 BCE, the state of Qi started to build the Great Wall of Qi across Changqing county. Portions of the wall still remain today and are accessible as open air museums. Bian Que, according to the legend the earliest Chinese physician and active around 500 BCE, is said to have been a native of present-day Changqing County. Zou Yan (305\u2013240 BCE), a native of Zhangqiu City, developed the concepts of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements. Joseph Needham, a British sinologist, describes Zou as \"The real founder of all Chinese scientific thought.\"During the times of the Han dynasty (206 BCE \u2013 220 CE), Jinan was the capital of the feudatory Kingdom of Jibei (simplified Chinese: \u6d4e\u5317\u56fd; traditional Chinese: \u6fdf\u5317\u570b; pinyin: J\u01d0b\u0115i Gu\u00f3) and evolved into the cultural and economic hub of the region. The Han dynasty tomb where the last king of Jibei, Liu Kuan (\u5218\u5bbd; \u5289\u5bec; Li\u00fa Ku\u0101n), was buried at Shuangru Mountain  was excavated by archaeologists from Shandong University in 1995 and 1996. More than 2000 artifacts such as jade swords, jade masks, and jade pillows have been recovered within the 1,500 square meter excavation site, emphasizing the wealth of the city during the period. Cao Cao (155 \u2013 220 CE) was an official in Jinan before he became the de facto ruler of the Han dynasty. His son, Cao Pi, overthrew the last emperor of the Han and founded the Wei Kingdom (220 \u2013 265 CE) of the Three Kingdoms Period.\nBeginning in the 5th century CE, Buddhism flourished in Jinan. The Langgong Temple (\u6717\u516c\u5bfa; L\u01cengg\u014dng S\u00ec, later renamed Shentong Temple, (\u795e\u901a\u5bfa; Sh\u00e9nt\u014dng S\u00ec, and now in ruins) in the southern county of Licheng was one of the most important temples in northern China at that time. The same period witnessed extensive construction of Buddhist sites in the southern counties of Licheng and Changqing such as the Lingyan Temple and the Thousand-Buddha Cliff. In particular, a large number of cave temples were established in the hills south of Jinan.Jinan remained the cultural center of the region during the Song dynasty (960 \u2013 1279 CE). The Song rulers promoted Jinan to a superior prefecture in 1116 CE. Two of the most important poets of the Southern Song were both born in Jinan: Li Qingzhao (1084\u20131151 CE), the most renown female poet in Chinese history, and Xin Qiji (1140\u20131207 CE), who was also a military leader of the Southern Song dynasty. Both poets witnessed a series of crushing defeats of the Song dynasty at the hands of the Jurchens who gained control over almost half of the Song territories and established the Jin dynasty in northern China. After Jinan came under control of the Jin dynasty, both Li Qingzhao and Xin Qiji had to abandon their homes and reflected this experience in their works.\nDuring the Civil War that followed the proclamation of Kublai Khan as Great Khan in 1260 CE, Jinan was at the center of a rebellion by Yizhou governor Li Tan against Mongol rule in 1262 CE. The rebellion was crushed in a decisive battle that was fought not far from Jinan in late March or early April 1262 CE. After losing 4000 of his troops in the battle, Li Tan retreated to Jinan to make his last stand. After defections of his defenders had made his position untenable, Li Tan tried to commit suicide by drowning himself in Daming Lake. However, he was rescued by the Mongols in order to execute him by trampling him to death with their horses.Despite such violent conflicts, culture in Jinan continued to thrive during the Jin (1115\u20131234) and Yuan (1271\u20131368) dynasties: One of the most renowned artists of the Yuan dynasty, Zhao Mengfu (1254\u20131322) was appointed to the post of governor of Jinan in 1293 and spent three years in the city. Among the extraordinary art works he completed during his stay in Jinan, the best known painting is \"Autumn Colors on the Qiao and Hua Mountains\" (\u300a\u9e4a\u534e\u79cb\u8272\u300b). Geographer Yu Qin (1284\u20131333) also served as an official in Jinan and authored his geography book Qi Cheng there.\n\nWhen Shandong province was established under the Ming dynasty, Jinan became its capital. Jinan was the site of a siege during the Jingnan Campaign where the city was defended by loyalists of the Jianwen Emperor led by Tie Xuan against the rebel Prince of Yan Zhu Di's army.\nIn 1852, the northward shift of the Yellow River into a new bed close to the city triggered the modern expansion of Jinan. The new course of the Yellow River connected the city to the Grand Canal and regional waterways in northern Shandong and southern Hebei.German influence in Jinan grew after the Qing dynasty ceded Qingdao to the German Empire in 1897. A German concession area was established to the west of the historical city center (in the vicinity of the Jinan Railway Station first established by the Germans). The Jiaoji (Qingdao\u2013Jinan) railway was built by the Germans against local resistance. Discontent over the construction of the railway was one of the sources fueling the Boxer Rebellion (1899\u20131901). During the rebellion, foreign priests were evacuated from Jinan and Chinese Christians became a target of violence. The Jiaoji railway was completed in 1904, three years after the Boxer Rebellion had been put down, and opened the city to foreign trade. The importance of Jinan as a transportation hub was cemented with the completion of the north\u2013south Jinpu railway from Tianjin to Pukou in 1912. Jinan became a major trading center for agricultural goods in northern China. Traded commodities included cotton, grain, peanuts, and tobacco. Jinan also developed into a major industrial center, second in importance to Qingdao in the province.\n\n\n=== Republican era ===\nIn 1919, after the First World War, the Japanese took over the German sphere of influence in Shandong, including control of the Jiaoji railway, and established a significant Japanese influence in Jinan. According to estimates by a contemporary Japanese government official, about 2,000 Japanese were living in Jinan in 1931, about half of whom were involved in the opium trade for which the Japanese had a loosely controlled monopoly that was exploited with the participation of Chinese traders.During the Warlord era of the Republic of China, Zhang Zongchang, nicknamed the \"Dogmeat General\", ruled Shandong from Jinan for a period that lasted from April 1925 until May 1928. Zhang was unpopular for his heavy-handed rule and in particular his heavy taxation. Besides heavy taxes, he relied financially on opium to finance his periodic wars. Zhang even planned to use some of the wealth extracted from these sources for building a living shrine and a large bronze statue for himself on the shore of Daming Lake, but these plans were not realized as his rule came to an end.\nIn the spring of 1928, the Kuomintang's Northern Expedition reached Jinan. On May 3, 1928, clashes developed between Japanese troops stationed in Jinan and the Kuomintang troops moving into the city (Jinan Incident). Cai Gongshi, a Kuomintang emissary sent to negotiate and 16 members of his entourage were cruelly executed by the Japanese. Japanese officers placed an order to slice off his nose and ears, and to gouge out his eyes and tongue. Sixteen other members of his negotiation team were also striped naked, recklessly whipped, dragged to the back-lawn, and slaughtered by machine guns on the same day. After the incident, Japanese reinforcements were sent to Shandong and by 11 May, Japanese troops pushed the Chinese troops from the area, inflicted thousands of casualties and killed over 2000 Chinese civilians. The Japanese occupied Jinan for more than six months until they withdrew to their garrison in Tsingtao on the 28th of March 1929. When Chiang lectured a group of Chinese army cadets, he urged them to turn their energies to washing away the shame of Jinan, but to conceal their hatred until the last moment.  The Kuomintang government later decreed that May 3 be designated a \"National Humiliation Memorial Day.\"\nDuring the Nanjing decade of the Republic of China, Han Fuju, a military commander from the warlord era who had aligned himself with the Kuomintang, was rewarded with the military governorship of Shandong, after fighting against the rebel troops of Yen Hsi-shan and his former commander Feng Yu-hsiang in the Central Plains War in 1930. He established his base in Jinan and is credited with curtailing banditry and drug trading, thereby bringing a measure of peace and prosperity to the city. However, from 1935 onwards Han was under heavy pressure from the Japanese consul in Jinan to declare Shandong an \"independent state\" allied with Japan.\nAfter the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese invasion force crossed the Yellow River 60 km (37 mi) north-east of Jinan on December 23, 1937. Han Fuju abandoned Jinan the next day against orders to hold the city to the death. He ordered the offices of the provincial government and the Japanese consulate in Jinan to be burned down and the ensuing power vacuum led to widespread looting in the city. Japanese troops from the 10th Division of the Manchurian Area Army entered Jinan on December 27, 1937. Han Fuju was arrested and executed for disobeying orders from superior commanders and retreating on his own accord by Chiang Kai-Shek's chief of staff, General Hu Zongnan.\n\n\n=== After World War II ===\nJapanese troops controlled Jinan until their defeat in 1945. After this, the Kuomintang regained short-lived control of the city during the period from 1946 to 1948. The provincial government during this time was led by Lieutenant-General Wang Yaowu, who also commanded the KMT army in the region. KMT rule over Jinan ended in September 1948 with the Battle of Jinan in which units of the People's Liberation Army under the command of Chen Yi took the city. The battle for Jinan took a decisive turn in favor of the attackers when KMT Lieutenant-General Wu Huawen  defected to the Communist side with about 8,000 of his troops. The most likely explanation for his defection is that he had been pressured through relatives of his who were held captive by the Communist forces. Lieutenant-General Wu had been in charge of the vital outer ring of defenses that protected the main airfield, the railroad station, and the commercial district. With these critical assets lost, the situation of the city's defenders became untenable. Following the weakening of the city's defenses, the People's Liberation Army breached the city wall and entered Jinan on September 24, 1948.\n\n\n=== Cultural Revolution ===\nIn March 1966, the largest among the drawn-out sequence of earthquakes that made up the Xingtai earthquake damaged about 36,000 houses in Jinan.\n\nOn May 27, 1966, the Cultural Revolution started in Jinan with an article in the local newspaper \"Jinan Evening News\" (\u6d4e\u5357\u665a\u62a5) that denounced vice-governor Yu Xiu as a Bourgeois agent within the government. Starting from early June 1966, the schools in Jinan were closed down by strikes as teachers were \"struggled against\". At the same time, big-character posters started to appear in the city. Red Guards took to the streets of Jinan from late August 1966 onwards, damaging cultural heritage and setting up courts to prosecute perceived enemies of the revolution. In the spring of 1967, the \"May 7th Incident\" took place: When Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, both later reviled as members of the Gang of Four, visited Jinan to support the Cultural Revolution and its local leader Wang Xiao Yu, fighting erupted in the front of the provincial government between two rival factions of the Cultural Revolution, the \"April 22nd Group\" and Wang Xiao Yu's \"April 28th Group\". In the end, more than 10,000 people had been involved in the fighting. On October 11, 1967, the tallest statue of Mao Zedong in Shandong province was erected on the campus of Shandong Normal University. On September 17, 1968, a large assembly of Jinan workers celebrated the arrival of a mango fruit in the \"August 1st\" Meeting Hall. The fruit had been a gift to the workers in Beijing by Mao and was subsequently passed on to the workers in Jinan. In November 1968, Wang Xiao Yu began to agitate against the local army units in Jinan and Shandong Province. By then unrest due to the Cultural Revolution had severely damaged the city's governmental and industrial infrastructure, with about 80 percent of all government institutions shut down. Large public protests were staged on April 4 and 5, 1969, in which approximately 500,000 people protested the occupation of Zhenbao Island by the Soviet Union. On July 29, 1970, the leadership of the Cultural Revolution passed a resolution to make sweeping changes to the city's educational system: The liberal arts departments of Shandong University were moved to Qufu and combined with Qufu Normal College to form a new Shandong University. The biology department was moved to Tai'an and merged into the Shandong Agricultural College. The rest of the sciences were to form the Shandong Science and Technology University. Shandong Normal University was to be moved to Liaocheng. Shandong Medical College and Shandong College of Traditional Chinese Medicine were to be merged and moved to Tai'an. Shandong University was restored in its original form and the \"Shandong Science and Technology University\" was abolished in early 1974. The first reversals of Cultural Revolution policies started in early 1971: On May 23 of that year, the Shandong Provincial Museum was reopened after having been closed for about 5 years (since May 1966). In the next year, the Jinan Committee for the Cultural Revolution officially reverted the name changes of four city districts enacted in 1966. During the 6 years between the name change and its reversal, Lixia District had been known officially as \"Hongwei\", Tianqiao as \"Face the Sun\", Huaiyin as \"East Wind\", and Shizhong as \"Red Flag\". As the Cultural Revolution came to an end, Jinan started to receive visitors from abroad. For example, it was visited by a delegation from the United States Congress between August 8 and 11, 1975. On September 18, 1976, Mao's death was mourned by about 600,000 people at an official service in Jinan's August 1 Square.\n\n\n=== Post 1990s ===\nJinan was the host of the 11th All China Games during October 2009. These games are the selection games for the Chinese Olympic champions. For this occasion, security was heightened and a full volunteer force was out on the streets directing visitor traffic. The city conducted major renovations in its transportation and recreation services in anticipation of the Games' visitors.2019\nAt the beginning of January, the State Council of the People's Republic of China approved the approval of Shandong Province to adjust the administrative division of Laiwu City and Jinan City, cancel Laiwu City, and all jurisdiction of former Laiwu City belongs to Jinan City; establish Laiwu District of Jinan City to replace the former Laicheng District of Laiwu City with the same administrative area; establish Gangcheng District of Jinan City to replace the former Gangcheng District of Laiwu City with the same administrative area.\n\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\n\n=== Geography ===\n\nJinan is located in the north-western part of Shandong province at 36\u00b0 40\u2032 northern latitude and 116\u00b0 57\u2032 east of Greenwich, about 400 kilometres (250 mi) south of the national capital of Beijing. It borders Liaocheng to the southwest, Dezhou to the northwest, Binzhou to the northeast, Zibo to the east, and Tai'an to the south. In the relief of the region, the city occupies a transition zone between the northern foothills of the Taishan Massif to the south of the city and the valley of the Yellow River to the north. Karst aquifers in limestone formations sloping down from the south to the north give rise to many artesian springs in the city center as well as in surrounding areas.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nJinan has a humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen: Cwa), considering a normal isotherm of \u22123 \u00b0C, or a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dwa), considering an isotherm of 0 \u00b0C but favoring the former, with four well-defined seasons. The city is dry and nearly rainless in spring, hot and rainy in summer, crisp in autumn and dry and cold (with little snow) in winter. The average annual temperature is 14.70 \u00b0C (58.5 \u00b0F), and the annual precipitation is around slightly above 670 millimetres (26.4 in), with a strong summer maximum, and high variability from year to year. January is the coldest and driest month, with a mean temperature of \u22120.4 \u00b0C (31.3 \u00b0F) and 5.7 millimetres (0.22 in) of equivalent rainfall. July is the hottest and wettest month, the corresponding numbers are 27.5 \u00b0C (81.5 \u00b0F), and 201.3 mm (7.93 in). With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 48 percent in July to 63 percent in May, the city receives 2,547 hours of bright sunshine annually.\nDue to the mountains to the south of the city, temperature inversions are common, occurring on about 200 days per year. The high precipitation for northern Chinese standards, in tandem with the topography (mountains surrounding the city on three sides), leads to particularly oppressive summer weather and the city being named as a candidate for the fourth \"furnace\", c.e. Three Furnaces.\nExtremes since 1951 have ranged from \u221219.7 \u00b0C (\u22123 \u00b0F) on 17 January 1953 to 42.5 \u00b0C (109 \u00b0F) on 24 July 1955.\n\n\n=== Air quality ===\n\nAccording to the National Environmental Analysis released by Tsinghua University and The Asian Development Bank in January 2013, Jinan is one of ten most air polluted cities in the world. Also according to this report, 7 of 10 most air polluted cities are in China, including Taiyuan, Beijing, Urumqi, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Jinan and Shijiazhuang. As air pollution in China is at an all-time high, several northern cities are among the most polluted cities and has one of the worst air quality in China. Reporting on China's air quality has been accompanied by what seems like a monochromatic slideshow of the country's several cities smothered in thick smog. According to a survey made by \"Global voices China\" in February 2013, Jinan is among China's 10 most polluted cities, and is the only Shandong city to be on this list. Other cities on the blacklist includes major Chinese cities like Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, and 6 other prefectural cities all in Hebei Province. These cities are all situated in traditional geographic subdivision of \"Huabei (North China) Region\".\nA dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres (750 mi), including Jinan and surrounding Shandong area. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in North China region. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\n\nThe sub-provincial city of Jinan has direct jurisdiction over ten districts and 2 counties after the annexation of Laiwu to Jinan in 2019:\n\nThese are further divided into 146 township-level divisions, including 65towns, 27 townships and 54 subdistricts.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nWith the shift of the Yellow River to a new bed right to the north of Jinan (in 1852) and the establishment of a railroad hub, the city became a major market for agricultural products from the productive farming regions to the north.\nFollowing the trade in agricultural goods, the city developed a textile and clothing industry, flour mills, oil presses, as well as factories producing paper, cement, and matches. In the 1950s, large iron and steel works as well as chemical factories were established around Jinan. The large metal works produce pig iron, ingot steel, as well as finished steel. In 2008, steel manufacturing was restructured with the formation of the Shandong Iron and Steel Group.\nIn the 1970s, Sinotruk established its headquarters and factories for the production of trucks and construction vehicles in the city.Jinan has a pool of high-quality labor resources. There are 18 universities and colleges in the city where more than 200,000 students are studying. Among the over 200 research institutes in the city, 10 are national laboratories.\nThe focus on technology-intensive industries has transformed Jinan from a city supported by heavy industry and textiles to a city with more diverse industrial structure. Information Technology, transportation tools, home appliances, and bio-engineered products, among others, have become important components of the area's industry. Jinan's IT-related economic output was ranked to be in the fourth place nationally in 2004.\nIndustrial zones include:\n\nJinan High-tech Industrial Development ZoneFounded in 1991, the Jinan High-tech Industrial Development zone was one of the first of its kind approved by the State Council. The zone is located to the east of the city and covers a total planning area of 83 km2 (32 sq mi) that is divided into a central area covering 33 km2 (13 sq mi), an export processing district of 10 km2 (3.9 sq mi), and an eastern extension area of 40 km2 (15 sq mi).\nSince its foundation, the Jinan High-tech Industrial Development Zone has attracted enterprises as LG, Panasonic, Volvo, and Sanyo. In 2000, it joined the world science and technology association and set up a China-Ukraine High-tech Cooperation Park. The Qilu Software Park became the sister park of Bangalore park of India.\nJinan Export Processing ZoneThe export processing zone is located in the eastern suburbs of Jinan, to the east of the Jinan High-tech Industrial Development Zone and to the north of the Jiwang highway. The distances to the Jiqing Highway and the Jinan Airport are 9 km (5.6 mi) and 18 km (11 mi) respectively.\nLiaocheng Economic Development Zone\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nIn 2005, the estimated population of the entire area under the jurisdiction of Jinan City was 5.69 million, with a total of 2.54 million living in urban areas. By 2009, the total population had grown to about six million. The census in 2010 counted 6.814 million inhabitants out of which about 4.335 million were living in 6 urban districts which made up the built-up area.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 11 million.The population is predominantly Han (98.3 percent), with very small portions of Hui and Manchu Chinese. Jinan has a significant Muslim community centred in the city's Muslim quarter, located to the west of the historical center.\n\n\n== Culture and contemporary life ==\n\n\n=== Dialect ===\nLocal residents in the city proper, as well as in the surrounding areas, have traditionally spoken the Jinan dialect of Mandarin that is not readily understood even by native speakers of standard Mandarin. The younger people of Jinan are more likely to speak standard Mandarin, whereas many older residents retain strong local dialect elements in their speech. Nevertheless, even the younger residents of Jinan tend to retain a strong local accent and mix local vocabulary into the standardized Mandarin vocabulary. Due to the influx of migrant workers during the past decade of China's economic boom, many of the current population that are of working age are not natives of Jinan but have learned to understand the Jinan dialect.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nJinan has its own cuisine, the Jinan style of the Shandong cuisine, one of the Eight Culinary Traditions of China. One of its features is the use of soup in its dishes. Modern cuisines in northern China \u2014Beijing, Tianjin and the northeastern regions including Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning\u2014 are all branches of Shandong cuisine.\n\n\n=== Shopping centers ===\nMost shopping malls in Jinan are in the downtown area centered around Spring City Square and Quancheng Road (\u6cc9\u57ce\u8def; 'spring city road'). Spring City Square was built by the municipal government beside the city moat in the early 21st century; at the center is the statue \"Spring\" which has become a symbol of Jinan. The square borders on the ancient city moat. It has a music fountain, a 46,000 square meter underground shopping center and a memorial hall with statues of famous people from Shandong.\nSpring City Road was rebuilt at the same time that Spring City Square was created. The government's intention was to create a modern business district and yet preserve the traditional Chinese culture. Therefore, newly built shopping malls with traditional Chinese architectural styles and modern western skyscrapers can be found side by side along Spring City Road. Notable retail businesses are Quancheng Bookstore \u2013 the largest bookstore of the city \u2013 and Walmart (near the western end of Spring City Road). Major shopping malls along the road are the Guihe Shopping Center (\u8d35\u548c\u5546\u53a6), the Sofitel Silver Plaza, the Shimao international shopping center, and the Wanda Shopping Mall (\u4e07\u8fbe\u96c6\u56e2). Parc 66 (\u6d4e\u5357\u6052\u9686\u5e7f\u573a) to the south of Spring City Road (opposite of Water Lily Street), opened in August 2011, is Jinan's largest shopping mall with seven levels of retail space and a total gross floor area of 171,000 square meters.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Healthcare system ===\nShandong Provincial Hospital (SPH, \u5c71\u4e1c\u7701\u7acb\u533b\u9662), address: 324 Jingwu Weiqi Road (36\u00b039\u203224.6\u2033N 116\u00b058\u203239.7\u2033E)\nSecond Hospital Attached to Shandong University (\u5c71\u4e1c\u5927\u5b66\u7b2c\u4e8c\u533b\u9662)\nStomatological Hospital Attached to Shandong University (\u5c71\u4e1c\u5927\u5b66\u9644\u5c5e\u53e3\u8154\u533b\u9662)\nCentral Hospital of Jinan City (\u6d4e\u5357\u5e02\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533b\u9662), address: 105 Jiefang Road (36.667\u00b0N 117.0417\u00b0E\ufeff / 36.667; 117.0417)\nQilu Hospital (\u5c71\u4e1c\u5927\u5b66\u9f50\u9c81\u533b\u9662), address: 107 Wenhuaxi Road (36\u00b039\u203225.6\u2033N 117\u00b00\u203241.25\u2033E)\nJinan No. 1 People's Hospital (\u6d4e\u5357\u5e02\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u6c11\u533b\u9662), address: 132 Daminghu Road\nJinan No. 2 People's Hospital (\u6d4e\u5357\u5e02\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4eba\u6c11\u533b\u9662), also known as \"Eye Hospital of Jinan\" (\u6d4e\u5357\u773c\u79d1\u533b\u9662)\nJinan No. 3 People's Hospital (\u6d4e\u5357\u5e02\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u6c11\u533b\u9662)\nJinan No. 4 People's Hospital (\u6d4e\u5357\u5e02\u7b2c\u56db\u4eba\u6c11\u533b\u9662), address: 50 Sh\u012bf\u00e0n Road\nJinan No. 5 People's Hospital (\u6d4e\u5357\u5e02\u7b2c\u4e94\u4eba\u6c11\u533b\u9662), address: 447 J\u012bngsh\u00ed Road\nNo. 456 Hospital of the People's Liberation Army (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u89e3\u653e\u519b\u7b2c\u56db\u4e94\u516d\u533b\u9662, formerly Jinan Airforce Hospital, \u7a7a\u519b\u6d4e\u5357\u533b\u9662)\nPediatric Hospital of Jinan City (\u6d4e\u5357\u5e02\u513f\u7ae5\u533b\u9662)\nJinan Infectious Disease Hospital (\u6d4e\u5357\u5e02\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u533b\u9662), address: 173 J\u012bngsh\u00ed Road (36\u00b038\u203256\u2033N 116\u00b059\u203217\u2033E)\nQianfoshan Hospital (\u5343\u4f5b\u5c71\u533b\u9662), address: 66 Jingshi Road (36\u00b038\u203252.04\u2033N 117\u00b02\u203213.33\u2033E)\nJinan military hospital (\u6d4e\u5357\u519b\u533a\u603b\u533b\u9662)\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Railways ====\n\nJinan is positioned at the intersection of two major railways: The Jinghu Railway that runs from Beijing to Shanghai is the major north\u2013south backbone of the railway system in eastern China. In Jinan, it intersects with the Jiaoji Railway that connects Jinan to the sea port of Qingdao to the east. In addition, the Hanji Railway connects Jinan to the city of Handan (Hebei Province) in the west.\nWithin Shandong province, the Jinghu Railway connects Jinan with the cities of Dezhou, Tai'an, Jining, and Zaozhuang; the Jiaoji Railway provides a link to the cities of Zibo, Qingdao, and Weifang; the Hanji Railway serves the cities of Yancheng and Liaocheng.\nCentral Jinan is served by the Jinan Railway Station and the Jinan East Railway Station (just by Daming Lake).\nThe Beijing\u2013Shanghai High-Speed Railway calls at the new Jinan West Railway Station, which is outside the central metropolitan center and is in suburban western Jinan's Huaiyin District. Since it opened for public service on 30 June 2011, it has become a future hub with west\u2013east running high speed railways to Taiyuan, Shijiazhuang and Qingdao.\n\n\n==== Expressways ====\nMajor expressways include China National Highway 104, China National Highway 220, and China National Highway 309. Because of Jinan's location and role as a road and rail transportation hub, the Jinan Coach Terminus has one of the largest passenger flows nationally. On peak travel days, as many as 92,000 passengers per day have been counted, on off-peak days the number is around 42,000 passengers per day.\n\n\n==== Airport ====\nJinan Yaoqiang International Airport is located about 33 km (21 mi) northeast of the city center and to the north of the town of Yaoqiang from which the name of the airport is derived. The airport is connected to the city center of Jinan by expressways. It has domestic flights to many of the major cities in China as well as to international destinations, in particular Helsinki, Osaka, Seoul, Paris, Bangkok and Singapore.\n\n\n==== Public transportation ====\nJinan's urban public transportation history began in 1938, and the city is now a major bus transportation hub. To ensure that buses have priority, most of the city's urban main roads have a bus lane, and bus rapid transit signal priority measures are gradually being implemented. The Jinan urban area has more than 220 public transportation routes.\nAccording to the properties of bus lines, Jinan's urban bus network can be divided into five categories:\n\nBus rapid transit system: The Jinan BRT has 7 routes, connected by transfer stations. As a result of the BRT's isolated central lanes, signal priority and other measures, bus speeds have been greatly improved, improving public transport. Price:\uffe52.\nConventional buses: Have air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned buses. Air-conditioned lines have a K perfix on their route numbers. Form 2018, most lines are air-conditioned lines (Include lines without K perfix). These lines comprise more than 200 routes covering the whole city. Price:\uffe51 (Air-conditioned is\uffe52).\nPublic trolleybuses: the Jinan trolleybus system, opened in 1977, once had 10 lines, but now has only four. These are Jinan's most important bus routes. Price: \uffe51.\nSuburban and exurban buses \u2013 Operated by air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned vehicles. Most of these buses carries passengers from suburban/exurban area to urban area, while the others provide village-to-village or village-to-county service. Price: Varies from \uffe51 to \uffe512.\nStudent, supermarket and particular business bus lines \u2013 These are for large schools, supermarkets, business transfer students, customers, employees of private businesses. They operate side by side with the other bus systems.Started by construction in 2013, Jinan Metro will open in 2018 and then will be extended to 3 lines toward 2030.\n\n\n== Main tourist attractions ==\n\nJinan is renowned across China for its numerous springs, the lakes fed by the spring water, and the weeping willows that grow along the water edges. The late-Qing author Liu E describes Jinan's cityscape in his novel \"The Travels of Lao Can\" (\u8001\u6b8b\u6e38\u8bb0, written 1903\u201304, published in 1907) as \"Every family has spring water, every household has a willow tree\". Jinan was also the historical center of Buddhist culture for the whole province which is still manifest in the many historic sites that are left behind in its southern counties.\n\n\n=== Springs and lakes ===\nJinan is known as the \"City of Springs\" because of the large number of natural artesian springs. The majority of the springs, many of which have been historically listed under the \"72 Famous Springs\" (\u4e03\u5341\u4e8c\u540d\u6cc9) are concentrated in the downtown district and flow north to converge in Daming Lake. The Baotu Spring Park is the most popular of the springs in the City of Jinan proper. Besides the Baotu Spring, the park contains several other springs that are listed among the \"72 Famous Springs\". \"B\u00e0o t\u016b\" (\u8db5\u7a81) means \"jumping and leaping\" in Chinese. The water in the spring pool can be seen foaming and gushing, looking like a pot of boiling water. The spring was visited by the Qianlong Emperor (1711\u20131799) of the Qing dynasty who declared it \"the best spring under the heaven\" (Chinese: \u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00\u6cc9; pinyin: ti\u0101n xi\u00e0 d\u00ec y\u012b qu\u00e1n). A tablet with the Emperor's handwriting \"Baotu Spring\" has since been erected beside the spring pool.\nNot far away to the northeast of Baotu Spring Park is the Daming Lake, which, together with Baotu Spring and the Thousand-Buddha Mountain is often regarded as the \"Three Greatest Attractions in Jinan\". Other notable parks in the city include the Five Dragon Pool (\u4e94\u9f99\u6f6d) near the Baotu Spring Park, the Black Tiger Spring (\u9ed1\u864e\u6cc9) on the southern city moat, and the Baimai Springs (\u767e\u8109\u6cc9) of Zhangqiu City to the east of Jinan.\n\n\n=== Buddhist sites ===\nHistoric Buddhist sites are particularly common in Licheng County to the south-east of the city center of Jinan. The Four Gates Pagoda, built in 661, is the oldest existing one-story stone tower in China. The pagoda houses four Buddhist statues dating from the 6th century, and the Cypress tree (\u4e5d\u9876\u677e) standing next to the pagoda is more than 1000 years old. Below the hill on which pagoda stands lie the remnants of the Shentong Temple (\u795e\u901a\u5bfa), which was founded in the 4th century but was destroyed in the wars of later dynasties. The funerary stelae of monks from the temple which date from different historic periods display remarkable artistic features. The statues in the nearby Thousand-Buddha Cliff form one of the best collections of Tang dynasty Buddhist statues in the region.\nThe Lingyan Temple in the southern county of Changqing was one of the four most famous temples (\u56db\u5927\u540d\u5239) of the Tang dynasty. The temple was founded during the Jin dynasty and reached its heyday during the Tang and Song dynasties. During the Tang dynasty, the famous monk Xuanzang stayed in the temple and translated Buddhist manuscripts he had brought to China from India. Many emperors in Chinese history visited the temple before they went to Mount Tai (one of China's five sacred mountains, located south of Jinan) for ceremonies. The clay sculptures of Buddhas made in the Song dynasty are considered as \"The Best of China\" by scholar and journalist Liang Qichao. Buddhist architectures within the temple such as pagodas and tomb stelae are among the earliest and best protected in the region.\n\n\n=== Museums and libraries ===\nThe Shandong Provincial Museum located at the foothill of Thousand-Buddha Mountain is the largest museum in the province. It has a large collection of natural as well as historical treasures from the whole province. The museum was established in its present form in 1982 and currently has 8 exhibition halls : \"Treasures of Shandong Province\"; \"Stone Sculptures\"; \"Warship of the Ming dynasty\"; \"Ancient Coins\"; \"Art Treasures\"; \"Fossil Collections\"; \"Dinosaurs\"; and \"Specimens\". The museum has more than 210,000 relics and specimens, making up \u2153 of the collections in museums of whole province. The Shandong Provincial Museum has been ranked No. 7 in terms of collection size among the museums of China.The Shandong Art Museum holds a large collection of fine arts.\nThe Jinan Municipal Museum  is located at the south-western foot of the Thousand-Buddha Mountain, in the north of the city center. Although much smaller than the provincial museum, the municipal museum still houses a collection of more than 20,000 items, most of which were recovered in the city area.\nThe Shandong Provincial Library  in the eastern High-tech Park (address: 2912 Second Ring East Road) is the principal library of the province and is ranked among the Top 10 Chinese libraries. As of 2004, the library had more than 5.18 million documents, many of which date back many centuries and are important sources for research on Chinese history. The library also has a large collection of western journals/books. Originally, the library was built close to Daming Lake in 1909 by the then governor of Shandong. In the late 1990s, a project was undertaken to move the library to the eastern part of the city, and it reopened in 2002 with 35 reading rooms and more than 2000 seats.\n\n\n=== Parks and Nature Reserves ===\nJinan Hundred Miles Yellow River Scenic Area is located in No.166 Luokou Huancheng Road in Tianqiao District. It is designed as an ecological cultural theme park which focuses on ecological tourism, cultural tourism, and healthy tourism. The Yellow River of this section stretches 51.98 kilometers. Jinan Hundred Miles Yellow River Scenic Area was awarded the title \"Fifty Scenes of the Yellow River in China\" on September 12, 2018. The Levee extending along the Yellow River in this scenery area, is praised as \"the Great Wall over water\".Yellow River Forest Park (Jinan) is located on the north bank of the Yellow River. The Yellow River Forest Park sprawls over 1500mu (100 hectares) and has 300,000 trees of various breeds.

          "We visited the West Lake via a cruise in August 2019. This was a lovely and relaxing way to take in the scenery. The boat we were on had a very loud group of locals who were also on tour. They unfortunately made it very difficult to hear the historical and cultural",
          "The West Lake is always a highlight to visit when in Hangzhou. Not only a trip my boat to the small islands, is nice, also the walk around. It can be super crowded on Sundays and holidays, I recommend a very early morning run around the lake or a night walk.",
          "My friend lived in Hangzhou many years, so when I went to visit Hangzhou on business, I asked her which is the best attraction to visit. Without hesitation, she named the West Lake, and recommended the Water and Light show that takes place in the evening. And so it was that I",
          "You can rent a bike all around Xi Hu and return it back at many spots near Xi Hu. It is a really good way to explore all the attractions around Xi Hu by biking expecailly in Spring or Fall",
          "First time to Hangzhou was in a summer, together with two friends. Best time of all! ^&^1st time is to follow the tradition: Su & Bai Causeways. And for Hangzhou-er, it's a must to appreciate the scenery along with seasons: life treasures are flowers in the spring, breeze in the",
          "Beautiful during the day and at night. There\u2019s a light show at night that is totally worth seeing. During the day you can along the lake, take a boat to see the scenery of the \u00a51 bill, visit a pagoda, the broken bridge and eat at the restaurants around that area",
          "We enjoyed our boat ride on the West Lake. We saw the three pagodas. The lake is 6.4 kilometers around. The lake is 3 meters deep.",

          "West Lake is famous for its tranquility and landscape views from every corner. There were multiple lists of \"The Ten Views of West Lake\", you can choose whatever list you like to pursue the views or just enjoy a few of them. We arrived in the morning, and walk along West Lake",
          "Crowded even during winter. Not much of scenery during winter but I guess it must be beautiful during other seasons. Recommend to take the buggy and stop at each scenery attraction. For a round lake trip by buggy without stopping is about an hour.",
          "We were walking around the lake for 2-3 hours, but I could spend a whole day there! It is breathtaking, from the bridges you can look around and see the modern buildings on one hand, and a hill with trees on the other hand. I was visiting in December, so these autumn coloured",
          "Walking distance from our stay.. Lovely view with cold breeze... plenty of picturesque scenery to indulge in..",
          "Stunningly beautiful. I\u2019ve been here before on sunny days, today was a cloudy day, giving an almost watercolour feel. Lovely to visit in any weather ( just avoid Chinese New Year as you will just encounter crowds).",
          "Worth while visit. Make sure you go with a knowledgeable guide that can tell you the history and the stories (the White Snake lady is my favourite). Allow enough time to walk at least half-way round so that you can experience the people and the various bridges and islands.",
          "One can actually complete the entire walk around the lake with a good pair of shoes. It is the best way to appreciate the West Lake.",
          "While in Hangzhou, we spent some very enjoyable time visiting West Lake. The West Lake Park grounds were lovely and the floral landscapes were stunning. The lake shore paths and walks were peaceful, pleasant, and enjoyable. All was very well maintained and spotlessly cleaned up",
          "There is just so much history and tales surrounding the West Lake of Hangzhou. Exploring the entire place would probably take up a whole day or 2 half days as it is just that big. A suggestion as a 'route' would be to follow with the ten sights of west lake that has been",
          "The famous lake where there is a bridge for people fall in love and a bridge for those ending their relationship. It is gorgeous and full of nice sceneries, peaceful place to take a stroll in the early morning. Can easily spend a day to visit all the sites.",

          "We thoroughly enjoyed our boat ride across the West Lake as Fiona shared a detailed history of the lake and surrounding area. If planning to visit Hangzhou this is a definite highlight.",

There are numerous vantage points and it\u2019s quite hard to take a bad photo here. Besides the lake, you can visit the tea plantations and surrounds so it\u2019s easily a multi",
          "crowded during weekend but you can take the tram service which only cost RMB10 per pax per stop which there're total of 4 stops to complete the entire circumference of the lake hence make sure you tell the tram drive where you wanna go before getting over charged",
          "We visited with a tour guide as well as walking some parts ourselves We enjoyed a boat tour with the guide which allowed us to see many more areas without driving There are many places to visit in this area so you can spend between 1-5 days easily. A great venue for those who",
          "This lake is deeply beautiful, and one of the most picturesque sights on our tour of 6 eastern Chinese cities. Take a boat tour and also walk around the park. Aim for sunset if you can!",
          "The lake is a very serene place, a true beauty of nature. Riding the Chinese lake boat was a fun experience for me, my husband & friends. We all admire the nice view & our walk on the lake side was another beautiful experience observing 3 married couples on their wedding attire",
          "Visit the lake on a full moon night, it is very quiet and beautiful. the visit was not long as I was on a working trip",

          "Always the perfect Chinese experience, pure tradition and the most relaxing scenery, some of the best food just around the lake",

          "Absolutely mesmerizing night show on the West Lake. One of the best shows we have ever seen anywhere, ever and so glad we had the opportunity to see this. There are plenty of eateries and fast food restaurants around the West Lake, and the gardens are pretty to stroll around",
          "We visited on a UTO tour. Take public transportation as parking appears limited. This is a must see lake, and I don't say that too often. There is a ton of walking. The lake is a beautifully maintained park. There is lots to see and photograph. There is some food and",
          "During our two week, 6 city tour of China, we had only a week end to come here and that was unfortunate. Although our boat ride from the south to the north side of the lake was nice enough, the lake was SOOO crowded with different sized boats filled with tourists (mostly",
          "first off, this is a man-made lake. you have to know this in order to fully appreciate the significance of xihu. i went there on the 1st of december but the area was still bursting with radiant autumn colors which was so so lovely. fortunately it wasn\u2019t so crowded when i visited",
          "I don't understand the hype about West Lake. We took a boat trip to see Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. The island was nice to see but it wasn't amazing views, it was just ok. We spent a day in Hangzhou so I would say it's not worth the effort to come here and see the place if",
          "Alots of scenery and humans too. Will see lots of locals taichi, singing, dancing enjoying their evening there.",
          "Was told about the fact it is a man made lake and I was shocked. It\u2019s big and looks so real. Walk around the promenade is very relaxing and you can also enjoy a boat ride to a small island at the centre. Best attraction to see in Hangzhou",
          "After visiting the Lingying temple complex i headed to visit the West lake in our pvt taxi its not far from the temple if just 10 minutes far from the temple . The day of our visit the temperature dropped to 7 degree Celsius and it was pretty cold at the lake because one side it",
          "The lake is much bigger than I initally thought. With quite a few different areas offering different things. It was clean and well looked after. Really nice place to have long and relaxing walks. variety of different plants to see and I was suprised at the amount of fish in",
          "Nice place for walking and taking in the sight.I recommend Making this trip when the lotus are blooming and having enough time to explore(3-4hrs).Unfortunately we had less than 2 hrs to explore as we had to take bulleit train from Shanghai which took 2hrs round trip,waiting",
          "The place is huge!!!!!Do be prepared to walk alot, and I mean alot! Plan your walk accordingly as there are islands, pagodas and temples to be explored all around.",
          "One thing most people notice about China is the lack of wildlife, so it is so strange to see birds and squirrels here! Beautiful backdrop and Starbucks on those cold days as well.",
          "There are alot of attractions to visit in West lake such as lingyin temple, leifeng pagoda etc. The lake offer a pictureque view and it make you wonders the beauty of God creation. Stroll along the lake to enjoy the sunset is also a must",
          "It was a refreshing afternoon walk for me and friends at this west lake. The view is inspiring, a rather big lake which one can see further away. There are many people yet there is always a comfortable space for us to walk. Need to be careful though as the electrical buggy which",
          "The whole lake is very big. I suggest to spend one full day to explore the various places around the lake. It is nice and relaxing to walk along the lake especially during cooling autumn period. You can order starbucks coffee or hot bubble tea and enjoy your drink while sitting",
          "Took walk around part of West Lake, to Broken Bridge. There were a lot of Mozzies in the evening, so be prepared with your insect repellent. The evening fountain light show was very nice, but it gets very crowded.",

          "The view of Westlake is indeed breathtaking. But the immense amount of people visiting this place could be disturbing at times. I personally enjoyed the time when the sun is setting, the time when most people are heading home, and the slow breeze that kisses my cheek while",
          "It is a very beautiful place and mostly well kept. Plenty of places to stop off and visit - Guo\u2019s Villa - and eat - has to be the best looking Starbucks in the world. Also the evening Light Show (if it\u2019s on) is very well done and a definite must. As others have noted, it is",
          "We spent the entire day at the lake, starting with packed breakfast from Starbucks & enjoy it just beside the lake. Taking time to take beautiful picture from park to park. You can start from Yue Fei Temple & enter the park next to it, that will link you to the SuDi Causeway.",
          "As part of the trip a deal tour we went on a short lap of the lake. It is about a 15 min stroll around the edge of the lake to the boat, so it is advisable to take some water. It was a nice little cruise with a few picture opportunities around. Most of the tour sat inside the",
          "lovely peaceful lake, beautiful scenery. good area to have a long lunch or visit with family, lovely to walk around",
          "No wonder that Westlake is the inspiration of many Chinese poets. Taking a walk at Bai Causeway, we enjoyed the beautiful scenes. I would recommend to visit this place at both morning and afternoon. Sunset and sunrise will bring you different feeling",
          "Walking around the Westlake is a must and if possible, do grab a bike and do a round too. Lots of places to stop for a rest, Sri and drink in the various views. The morning walks are the best as you see activities such as tai chi, fan dancing, dancing, exercises going on around",
          "As a lot of reviews say, this is a place best visited in the morning and maybe in the evening as well. I set off pretty early to walk around the lake but obviously, since it takes some time to go around, by the end of it I was walking through pretty crowded areas. Personally,",
          "Its a nightmare visiting the West Lake by the Loud Boomboxes, everyone's singings,yellowing, screeming, and PEE on the public park road by boys and adults !!!",
          "It is a relatively peaceful park and lake complex that is quite large. Having said that there is no escape from the crowds of local and overseas visitors and wedding groups and photographers. It is possible to take a small bus ride around the lake - they run on the footpath,",

          "Worth some time but not very impressed. The boat ride was nondescript. The walking about didn\u2019t result in any must take photos. Maybe an hour or two to get enough.",
          "We spent a short time on the lake as part of our TripADeal tour. We also walked in the surrounding park a little. It was nice. Interesting. Nothing much to really see on the lake but I can appreciate it is special for locals. Pleasant experience overall for us.",
          "We went very early to beat the heat. You will see a lot of locals practicing dancing and exercising around the lake. The lake itself is huge. As this is a tourist attraction, there are lots of little boats taking tourists around the lake. Prices are on the higher end.",
          "I would recommend starting the long stroll at night or early morning. Afternoon is a no no. You can also flag down the trams that travel the pedestrian paths.",
          "It\u2019s a large lake. Part of it is very commercial with shopping abound. Other parts are rural with good walking paths (not trails). It\u2019s very scenic.",
          "There can be few lakeside walks finer than West Lake at Hangzhou. Evenly paved for almost its entire length, or you can hopefully onto an electric cart 20Y per quarter segment, 80Y for whole length Lots of sights to see on the way. Some are just 'there', others eg Pagoda,",
          "A boat trip on the lake was part of our tour, very pretty and would have like time to stroll around the outside path too",
          "Not high in natural beauty,but interesting views of the city and Pagoda.A nice way to spend an hour.",
          "Its a Unesco world heritage site so we had to check it out. Beautiful lake with temples, gardens, and scenery. I recommend you take the boat ride to get a better view of the shores and other temples. Food court outside was fantastic.",
          "This lake is very beatifull and serenity plenty. We saw a show named Enduring memories of hangzhou and it was incredible. Dancers, Singers and piano player were floating on the lake and the fantastic lighting/music were directed by Zhang",
          "China is big, it is almost chaotic, and it is exciting. And this area of Hangzhou is just the place to get away from all of this. It is beautiful, and you can get lost on the paths through some classic Chinese vistas. In fact, you feel as if you walked into a Chinese silk",
          "Walked around the whole lake, which, if you stop to do things along the way, can take up a full day. Definitely a must-see when you're in Hangzhou!",
          "This was an optional tour on our TripADeal tour package. Absolutely beautiful. We caught a boat for the 1 hour ride through West Lake, didn't feel crowded at all despite the fact that there were many other boats, all sizes on the lake. Our tour guide gave us some background",

          "We stayed nearby so we walked to entrance of Westlake. But it is a huge park so we took electromobile for certain attraction. Spend 1 day is not enough so we came again on weekend to enjoy the sight of cherry blossom. Spring season is the most beautiful season of Westlake.",
          "We hired a car & was driven around the lake. Started to walk from the Broken Bridge, it was raining & a blanket of mist (or was it haze?) hung in the air. The lake was dotted with tourist boats. Lotus clusters fringed the lake make for Insta-worthy shots! Take a break in the",
          "Even though it was hot and muggy the day we visited, we loved the West Lake. Make time for the incredible gardens, as I could have wandered them for hours. A boat tour is a great way to learn more about the area. If you are looking for western food, there is a KFC in the",
          "West Lake, known in Chinese as X\u012b H\u00fa, is a calm, fresh water lake. Likely due to its beautiful scenery, it is considered a place of romance. It has mountains, three causeways, three islands, and two pagodas. The Hangzhou people are noted for their friendliness and to some extent",
          "Most famous attraction in Hangzhou, it's really nice to have a stroll there and/or to take a boat ride. Recommended!",

          "I recommend going to see a west lake show, its really pretty, very busy with lots of folks, most beautiful at day in my opinion. Lots of bugs, so use bug spray before you come and bring with, lots of food and malls near by. Its a hot tourist spots.",
          "This lake is very near to city center and plenty of local tourist visit this lake during the weekend. Huge park and you have to spend the whole day to explore the entire place. Night time is even more beautiful.",
          "A must stop in Hangzhou, the landscape is just breathtaking. We didn\u2019t have much time so we just took a short walk but it is worth taking at least 2 hours to walk along the lake.",
          "Lovely pagodas. Great view of the Qiantang River. Lovely place to walk about. Stunning as is most everything in China. Yes, it is touristy but large enough to still walk about in peace and enjoy the scenery.",
          "I have visited in July 2019, and walk along West Lake was too hot. I feel I was in a Sauna. I think it is better to stay away from this area during summer. It was really too hot.",
          "Very scenic and historic area. Definitely crowded, but worth dealing with the touristy environment in order to soak in the history. Must note that in the 3+ hours I spent around the lake, I saw no birds and minimal wildlife.",
          "A nice setting around a small lake. Quite relaxing although on a Sunday the volume of people was out of control. Go mid week to reduce the hordes. Pushy, noisy and overly excited locals marvel at the lake and the undeniably rich history. But as lakes go, it was small, dirty",
          "Take a boat ride in the lake and walk around or travel by rickshaw .. evening time is good. the West Lake area in Hangzhou, comprising of the West Lake and the surrounding hills, which have inspired famous poets, scholars and artists since the 9th Century. It is considered one",

          "This is one of the true beauties of China! It's an incredible, beautiful park and for the Chinese centers around a cultural love story of a \"snake lady\" (look it up before you go for an extra layer of interest). There are tons of different walking trails and so many different",

          "We had an amazing day at the Longjing tea village near Hangzhou. We took the high speed train from Shanghai to Hangzhou (about an hour), then a bus (about an hour). The tea village is incredibly beautiful, with the entire village participating in picking, drying, heating tea",

          "To be honest, I had not expected much from this lake before I visited the West Lake because I had never excited to see a lake. The pictures of the lake which I had seen before looked like nothing special. When I arrived at the West Lake, it was early evening, so the lake did not",
          "It is a beautiful park and lake for walking around and boat touring. However, if you are pressed for time I would skip for more time at the temple and tea plantations. If you are taking pictures of all the landmarks on Chinese currency then you can\u2019t miss.",
          "I'm glad to visit Xi Hu (the West Lake) again this year. This place is definitely worth to visit. It is still as beautiful as before. Even though people say Xi Hu is worth to visit all year round because there are different pretty scene in different seasons. I would like to come",
          "This is my second visit to Hangzhou. The last time was during winter. We chose a weekday to visit Hangzhou which is less busy but still there are lots of people due to being real close to the Dragon boat Festival. Due to the choppy waters, unable to take the boat ride out.",
          "Scenery is awesome especially during sunset. Very peaceful and walk along at lake side except for the crowd as always. Recommend to talk local day tour to tour around the lake. Knowing the stories and history about this lake will make your trip more interesting and worthy.",

          "We were there this June. The first day is quite hot (~34 degree celsius), and walking in the sun is not that pleasant, but the second day is cloudy and better. The tour trolley would be helpful especially if you have senior people in the group. The lake and the scenic spots",
          "We spent a few hours here. The West Lake is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Taking a boat cruise on the Lake is the best way to view numerous cultural sites,pagodas and Temples, also the artificial lakes with many willows, their draping foliage, all so utterly mesmerising.",

          "I have visited Hangzhou twice and will never go again. I consider that the streets and the lakes will always be tainted with the blood from all the poor dogs beaten or drowned to death..Shame on the city and the reaponsible people.",
          "How can a modern city encourages dog killing in 2018? It tells a lot on the lack of morality and lack of respect for life in this place.",
          "Peaceful. Tranquil. Beautiful. Entry to the park is free, but pay for the boat ride to get to various sites.",
          "What a beautiful culturally rich landscape - the lake surrounded by mist shrouded mountains at least on the day I visited was calming and peaceful. Try and go a little off season as I understand it can get reaally busy during Chinese holidays. Worth getting a boat and enjoying",
          "It was misty and overcast when I travelled there, but the lake is beautiful. There are lots of people exercising and doing all sorts of other activities. One can walk around the lake, but it is about ten or eleven kilometres, so it is a bit of a hike. It would be a better bike",
          "Enjoyed our half day tour along Xihu. Took the boat and went to the middle of the island. A very touristy thing to do. Lots of tourists.",
          "Do not miss out on The West Lake, to walk the park and take a boat ride was just lovely. There is a lot of people but there is easily space to be alone and just enjoy the beauty of the area. The boat ride was so fun and enjoyable this is actually a man made lake which is massive",
          "Hangzhou was not far from our house, so we decided to visit Xihu, Hangzhou. We walked along the way in Xihu. It was beautiful: trees, flowers, walls, sculptures made of stones, and the lake itself were combined together into a masterpiece. After walking, we took a small boat",
          "A very beautiful lake located on the west part of a busy city, Hangzhou. If i were a resident of hangzhou, this will definitely be my jogging ground. As a tourist, i find the people of hangzhou a blessed with having such a scenic and beatiful spot right in the city area.",

          "Words can not express the beauty of this place, the ancient Chinese history comes to live when you visit Westlake. Even though there are so many tourists, you will still be able to enjoy the peace and quiet moment.",
          "Westlake has been famous for centuries. On my first visit here, I only had 24 Hours - and this was a must see. I was able to visit at night to see the night lights around the lake first night and saw it in the sun light the next morning. We took a one-hour boat ride. Although",
          "Such a beautiful area with lush green gardens, lakes, tea plantations, temples, pagodas, pavilions, causeways and artificial islands. It\u2019s worth a trip to look around and take in the scenery and visit a tea making plantation.",
          "Very good time to spend out on the lake and get told of the history surrounding it.We had a booking via tour group so was very informative from the local English speaking guide.",
          "This lake is a jewel, particularly at sunset. There is a serenity that seems to spread from the lake to the people enjoying the ambiance of the lake. Marco Polo is said to have described Hangzhou as the most beautiful city he had seen; the lake is a good reason.",
          "we were in Hangzhou for 4 nights , so we travel by foot along the lake was nice ( 2 nights is enough) .",
          "It was a Sunday morning ... A rest day sandwiched between 2 long working weeks...and it was really a refreshing experience ... The lake is very huge... There are paid golf carts to take you around ( not sure about the route) ... Boating facilities are available... And there are",
          "We did a one hour boat tour on the lake. Our bus tour group walked about a km through thousands of people to get on a boat with Chinese tour guides with loud speaker systems rattling our heads. The lake area is picturesque, but the noise and crowds take a great deal away from",
          "The lake is the best part of Hangzhou. But it is not just the lake since there are \"many lakes\" depending on the part. You can ride a boat, walk in the shoreline and around the park (with lots of outdoor activities). If you can, please go as early as possible in order to avoid",
          "A visit to the lake was included in our tour - was a pretty area but we didn't think it anything special. Took a boat ride around, which was pleasant. We only spent a short time, which was good as much better attractions to spend time at - though if you are into gardens, you",
          "If your hotel is a walking distance to the west lake, you should go there before 8 am to enjoy the heavenly scenery to the fullest. After 8 am or so, it\u2019s very crowded and noisy already. Near to the west lake, there\u2019s General Yue Fei memorial place. Yue Fei is very loyal and",
          "the boat ride is beautiful and I highly recommend. try to get on a boat where you can sit outside or inside the cabin. there is so much to see on the shorelines and you will have a great view from either inside or outside of the boat. I also recommend walking around the park.",
          "Great way to end the day. I went for a walk around at night so the boats you can hire were tied up. Lovely lit up at night with lots of people taking a stroll. Lots of places to stop and get a drink.",

          "Only stopped here for one day. I was here few years ago and lake west seems different. We took the boat and it cost RMB 55 per person. Stopped one island in the middle of the lake west then went to next port. It\u2019s Saturday and many people without manner. Loudly talking that",

          "A must visit destination when in Hangzhou. The lake is made up of fresh water according to the guide. We took a cruise on the lake which was quite short. We were told emperor Qianlong from the Qing dynasty visited the lake a few hundred years ago. Lots of Willow trees around and",
          "West Lake is beautiful, very nice to walk around after dinner. All of Hangzhou is very nice, I prefer visiting Hangzhou over Shanghai. West Lake is surrounded by lovely parks, walkways, cafes, restaurants, and pubs. During the holidays it can be very busy and crowded, but",

          "If you have time, it is a nice location to visit and take advantage of the outside. When I was there in the fall of 2018 there were not a lot of people which made even more enjoyable.",
          "I walked along the west coast of the lake for 2-3 hours. It's awfully crowded by other tourists but that's no problem. Alot of sculptures and views to see and boat rides (can be expensive as I saw the upper ones range between 100-200 RMB).",
          "West Lake is supposed to be a must-visit attraction in Hangzhou. But if you are not interested in renting a boat, you can essentially take in everything it has to offer in half an hour. Visit it to check it off your Chinese bucket list but go eat at the famous Lou Wai Lou",

          "Do not go here during Golden Week.....it was busy beyond belief, and we were so jam packed on the boat I thought we might capsize. Because of the volume of people, did not enjoy at all. It is a nice spot, and such, but did not really get why it was such a huge attraction",
          "although is a place to visit in Hangzhou just a place of too many people.Just hard to relax and have fun now than it use to be",
          "Don't even consider coming during Golden Week. Its just going to be people, people, people, people, people, people. In fact, even on a normal day, there are too many people for me to rate it a 5 star, but that's China today.",
          "came here with friends as part of an internationalization programme. it was a long car ride though, but I'm glad we made it as it was extremely beautiful and pleasant. would recommend coming here to all!",
          "Very good view of sunset. Boating and other facilities are available. Walking trail around the lake is very nice.",
          "We spent a couple of hours including a boat ride on the lake and found the experience to be very enjoyable. There are a few casual eating places which we took advantage of for a pleasant casual lunch.",
          "This is a day trip. Plenty to see and places to walk. Being a lovely day - the walkways were full of local tourists. No high rise buildings are allowed near the Lake - so you get the feeling you are well out of the city - with hills on three sides. The fourth side has views of",

          "As the first stop in our trip to China, I have to say I am blown away by how beautiful Xi Hu is. However, we thought we would be able to ride a bicycle within the park but was very wrong. There were people everywhere and bikes are not allowed to enter the area. There were people",
          "Lovely boat ride across this impressive lake with great vistas towards the hills and also the city. Very peaceful and serene setting so close to the city centre.",

          "a lovely lake to cruise on, beautiful scenery and a very relaxing cruise, the gardens around the lake are so lovely,",
          "It\u2019s not amazing, it\u2019s a lake with surrounding parkland. There are causeways, boat ferries, paths around the gardens etc. Unfortunately it gets incredibly crowded during peak times, so visit during weekdays daytimes if you can. Historically this was a place of significance, but",
          "This lake is a huge insize but. a very nice place suitable to be relaxing from our usually life for work. The water in the lake with slow win blowing on made our feeling come down included the scenery and landscape. If you have some time in Hangzhou, don't missing to be visit.",

          "What a gorgeous spot! We walked around the Lake, crosses over the bridges and visited the Tea House and Pagoda nearby. We then walked around the Lake and got a boat across to the island and as there were less people there and lots of trees, it was very relaxing and cooler. The",
          "While this lake and its surrounding has its serene beauty, it will always be destroyed by the noisy tourist crowds. Hence, I would advise you to reach here either early in the morning (pack your breakfast) or during noon (pack your lunch and eat at the park). It is a huge lake.",
          "One of China's most historic lakes this Qing dynasty landmark is perfect as a day trip to Hanghzhou from Shanghai. I went as part of guided tour. Make sure you have a quality camera as some this photos are best taken on a tripod. The Pagoda on the hill is magnificent adding that",

          "Perhaps it has to do with the time we visited West Lake. We arrived here early September, when most of the Chinese traveler with kids have already returned home as school has started, but our school in US has not yet started. The timing is perfect. The crowded was not bad at",
          "The Chinese have a saying that the Gods have heaven among the clouds, while human beings have heaven on Earth in Suzhou and Hangzhou. Undoubtedly, this perception, as it relates to Hangzhou, is due to the lovely and tranquil West Lake (\u897f\u6e56). Though some might argue that no",
          "The scenery of the West Lake is supposed to be depicted in many old Chinese paintings. The natural charm of the lake combined with the beautiful gardens that surrounds it makes this place a green oasis in middle of a modern city and offers a trip back to what China use to be.",
          "The lake is very beautiful and full of history. The park is packed with Chinese coming to rest on its banks. There are even honeymooners who come here to do their wedding photos. But do not expect exceptional things either: the new city of Hangzhou has disfigured the entire West",

          "Yes, this lake is quite big, however on weekends and public holidays, if the weather is good enough, every inch is filled by people. Especially it is very beautiful during the sunset with beautiful mountains in the background. However, it is just a lake, there are no too many",

Lin studied the Western higher education system and applied it to the Qiushi Academy. The Ch'iu-shih Academy was renamed to Chekiang College (\u6d59\u6c5f\u5927\u5b78\u5802; \u6d59\u6c5f\u5927\u5b66\u5802; Zh\u00e8ji\u0101ng D\u00e0xu\u00e9t\u00e1ng) in 1902, and to Chekiang Higher Institutes in 1903.\nA second institution that factored into the early history of Zhejiang University was Yuying Xuetang (Yuying School or Yuying College), established in 1902.  This was renamed to Yuying Yishu (Yuying Public School), and then to Yuying Academy. In 1911, Yuying Academy became Zhijiang Xuetang (Zhijiang College) and moved to Qinwang Hill (Chinese: \u79e6\u671b\u5c71), outside of Hangzhou.\n\n\n=== 1912\u20131937 ===\nIn 1912, Zhejiang Medical School was established, later developing into Zhejiang Provincial Medical College and becoming part of Zhejiang University.\nIn 1927, some schools and colleges (e.g. industrial and agricultural colleges/schools) were merged into the Qiushi Academy. Then the name of the enlarged school was changed to \"National Third Sun Zhongshan University\" (or, National Third Sun Yat-sen University), after Sun Yat-sen. On April 1, 1928, it was renamed \"Che Kiang University\" (now Zhejiang University from the pinyin name), and in the same year, \"National\" was added and it became \"National Che Kiang University\" (\u570b\u7acb\u6d59\u6c5f\u5927\u5b78; \u56fd\u7acb\u6d59\u6c5f\u5927\u5b66; Gu\u00f3l\u00ec Zh\u00e8ji\u0101ng D\u00e0xu\u00e9).\n\n\n=== War period, 1937\u20131949 ===\n\nIn the latter half of 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, and due to the invading Imperial Japanese Army, the university evacuated from Hangzhou to Guizhou until 1946, after the war ended.\nReputed as \"Cambridge of the East\" by Joseph Needham (twice visited ZJU in 1944) in China's modern history of higher education, National Che Kiang University's was consistently ranked as among top 3 in the nation during that time.\nDuring this period, the National Che Kiang University was praised as one of the Four most Prominent Universities in the Republic China (\u6c11\u570b\u56db\u5927\u540d\u6821), along with National Central University, National Southwestern Associated University, and National Wuhan University.\n\n\n=== 1952\u20131998 ===\nZhejiang University was split up into a number of single-discipline colleges during the 1952 readjustment of China's Tertiary Education System.

          "Make sure you plan your trip for the various shows, they are the best part about it! Highly trained and professional, really entertaining. The other exhibits were ok, a few of them rather sad of the small chambers, but the worst part is all the young mothers with iPhones pushing",
          "Love it! This is the best water world we've ever been, even better than some of those in a more \"developed\" countries. I was skeptical, since the ticket was rather expensive, but the varieties of water animals available in there and the shows they made really blown us away, and"

        "wiki": "West Lake (Chinese: \u897f\u6e56; pinyin: X\u012b H\u00fa; Wu: Si-wu) is a freshwater lake in Hangzhou, China. It is divided into five sections by three causeways. There are numerous temples, pagodas, gardens, and artificial islands within the lake.\n\nWest Lake has influenced poets and painters throughout Chinese history for its natural beauty and historic relics, and it has also been among the most important sources of inspiration for Chinese garden designers. It was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011, described as having \"influenced garden design in the rest of China as well as Japan and Korea over the centuries\" and reflecting \"an idealized fusion between humans and nature\".\n\n\n== History ==\nThe earliest recorded name for West Lake was the \"Wu Forest River\" (W\u01d4l\u00edn Shu\u01d0). The Book of Han's \"Geography Column\" says, \"Qiantang, affiliated to the western governor general. Wu Forest Mountain (W\u01d4l\u00ednsh\u0101n) is the origin of the Wu Forest River. Running east into the sea, it covers 830 li\" (roughly, 350 km or 220 mi). Other former names include the \"Qian River\", \"Qiantang Lake\", \"Mingsheng Lake\", \"Jinniu Lake\", \"Shihan Lake\", \"Shang Lake\", \"Lianyan Lake\", \"Fangsheng Pond\", \"Xizi Lake\", \"Gaoshi Lake\", \"Xiling Lake\", \"Meiren Lake\", \"Xianzhe Lake\", and \"Mingyue Lake\". But only two names were widely accepted in history and recorded in historical documents. One is \"Qiantang Lake\", due to the fact that Hangzhou was called \"Qiantang\" in ancient times. The other name is \"West Lake\", due to the lake being west of the city. The name \"West Lake\" first appeared in two poems of Bai Juyi, \"Bestowed on guests as returning from West Lake in the evening and looking back to Gushan Temple\" (\u897f\u6e56\u665a\u6b78\u56de\u671b\u5b64\u5c71\u5bfa\u8d08\u8af8\u5ba2) and \"On the returning boat to Hangzhou\" (\u676d\u5dde\u56de\u822b). Since the Northern Song dynasty, most poems and articles of scholars used the name \"West Lake\", while the name \"Qiantang Lake\" was gradually deprecated. \"The request of dredging West Lake\" written by Su Shi was the first time that \"West Lake\" appeared in an official document.\n\n\n=== Qin dynasty ===\nOver 2,000 years ago, West Lake was still a part of the Qiantang River. Due to soil sedimentation, the feet of Wu Mountain and Baoshi Mountains, the surrounding mountains on the northern and southern sides of the lake, gradually stretched to form shoal heads. Later, these sand spits slowly merged into a bank, to which a lagoon emerged to the west; this was the old West Lake of the Qin and Han dynasties. \"West Lake Dream Searching\" (\u897f\u6e56\u5922\u5c0b), written by Zhang Dai, relates the story that Qin Shi Huang visited the area and moored his boat to a stone later developed into the Big Stone Buddhist Temple. The stone was located on Baoshi Mountain, north of the West Lake, and can still be seen.\n\n\n=== Sui dynasty ===\nThe short-lived Sui dynasty is noted for the great engineering works which it accomplished during its brief existence. After AD 610, the Jiangnan Canal was opened and connected to the North Canal. Thus, five major rivers of China (the Hai, Yellow, Huai, Yangtze, and Qiantang) were all connected: this facilitated transportation to and from Hangzhou and thus boosted the regional economy. Tourism in Hangzhou also started to boom.\n\n\n=== Tang dynasty ===\nIn the Tang dynasty, West Lake had an area of roughly 10.8 square kilometers. The western and southern parts of the lake all extended to the foot of West Hill. The northeastern part stretched to Wulin Gate area. Pilgrims could take the boat to the hill-foot and walk up to the hill to worship. Due to the ongoing aggradation of the lake, together with the virtual lack of any hydraulic projects, in those days, the lake would flood after heavy rains and dry up during long droughts.\n\nIn September 781, Li Mi (\u674e\u6ccc) was appointed the governor of Hangzhou. In order to supply fresh water, he creatively induced the water into the city. He ordered six wells dug in populous areas like Qiantang Gate and Yongjin Gate, and set up a \"shadow conduit\" (underground clay and bamboo pipes) to introduce lake water into the city. The six wells have long vanished today. The only existing relic from that time is the Xiangguo Well, located west of Jinting Bridge on Jiefang Road. The other five wells were Xi Well (to the west of Xiangguo Well), Fang Well (or Four-eyed Well), Jinniu Well (northwest of Xi Well), Baigui Well (west of Longxiang Bridge), and Xiaofang Well (or Six-eyed Well, inside Qiantang Gate, now Xiaoche Bridge area).\nIn the middle of the Zhenyuan era (785-804) in the Tang dynasty, poet and government official Bai Juyi was appointed the governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished and famous poet, his deeds at Hangzhou made him a great governor. He realized that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the beauty of West Lake, visiting the lake almost every day. He ordered the construction of a causeway to allow crossing part of the lake on foot, instead of requiring the services of a boat. A causeway, the Baisha Causeway, is now commonly referred to as Bai Causeway (\u767d\u5824) in Bai Juyi's honour, but the original Bai Causeway no longer exists.\n\n\n=== Five Dynasties ===\nThe most prominent eras in Hangzhou's development history, the Wuyue Kingdom (907\u2013960) and Southern Song dynasty, had great impacts on West Lake. The comprehensive development and fundamental layout of West Lake occurred in these two Dynasties. During Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the Wuyue Kingdom made Hangzhou its capital. It facilitated the transportation to coastal regions, and promoted trading with foreign countries like Japan and Korea. In the meantime, successive rulers in the Wuyue Kingdom paid great tribute to Buddhism, and built a number of temples, pagodas, shrines and grottos around the lake area. They expanded Lingyin Temple, founded Zhaoqing Temple, Jingci Temple, Li'an Temple, Liutong Temple and Taoguang Temple, and built Baochu Pagoda, Liuhe Pagoda, Leifeng Pagoda and White Pagoda. The area was thus acclaimed as \"Buddhist Country\". Lingyin Temple, Tianzhu Temple and the tide of Qiantang were the most famous scenic spots at that time. Due to the geological characteristics, earth deposited speedly in West Lake and dredging became a routine maintenance. Thus in AD 927, the king of Wuyue, Qian Liu, installed a lake-dredging army of 1,000 to mow grasses and deepen springs, and preserved the water body of the lake.\n\n\n=== Song dynasty (The Northern Song and The Southern Song) ===\nOver one hundred years later, at the beginning of the Song dynasty's Yuanyou era (1086\u20131094), another great poet, Su Shi (also known as Su Dongpo), came to Hangzhou to serve as its governor. At that time, the farmers suffered greatly drought again, due to overgrowth of the weeds at the bottom of the lake clogging the irrigation ducts. He ordered dredging of the lake and piled up all the mud into another causeway, in the style of Bai Causeway, but much wider and nearly three times as long: he also planted willow trees along its banks. This causeway was later named after him as the \"Su Causeway\". There are six bridges along the 2.6 km (1.6 mi) Su Causeway (\u8607\u5824), and they are called separately Yingbo (\u6620\u6ce2), Suolan (\u9501\u6f9c), Wangshan (\u671b\u5c71), Yadi (\u538b\u5824), Dongpu (\u4e1c\u6d66), and Kuahong (\u8de8\u8679) Bridge, which all symbolize the characteristics of the bridge itself and also expose the structural beauty and its colorful connotation. \"Dawn on the Su Causeway in Spring \u8607\u5824\u6625\u66c9\" is one of the attractions.\nWu Zimu described the extravagance in his \"Mengliang lu\" (Dreaming Over a Bowl of Millet) (\u5922\u7cb1\u9304), \"The life in Lin'an is luxurious in all seasons, full of delight and appreciation with no idle days. In the west there is a lovely lake with arresting scenes, and in the east the river tides are spectacular. Both are miracles.\" Besides pilgrims, the tourists in Hangzhou included envoys of foreign countries, businessmen, monks and scholar candidates of the imperial examination. The beauty of West Lake started to gain wide reputation. In those days, boating on the lake was a popular entertainment. According to records, there were hundreds of boats in the West Lake. All were delicately built, with exquisite carving and decorations, and glided gracefully on the water. Poet Lin Sheng vividly described the ostentation in his poem \"On a hotel wall in Lin'an\". In addition, poet Yang Wanli also acclaimed the engaging scenery of West Lake in the poem \"Coming out of Jingci Temple at dawn to see Lin Zifang off\", which greatly show how thriving this metropolis was at that time and how yearning it was for people at that time. The renowned painter Muqi Fachang came here and refounded the abandoned monastery Liutong Temple in 1215.\n\n\n=== Yuan dynasty ===\nIn the Yuan dynasty, West Lake was still socially thriving, with a population full of exuberance for singing and dancing. Volume 23 of the Book of Yuan says, in the 2nd year of the Zhida era (1309), \"in Hangzhou, Jiang-Zhe area, during half a year there were more than 1,200 foreign visitors. Foreigners Sangwu and Baoheding brought lions, panthers, crows and falcons. They stayed for 27 days. People and animals ate meat of more than 1,300 jin.\" Increasing number of businessmen and travelers from countries of Turkestan and western Europe came to visit Hangzhou. The most famous among them was Venetian explorer Marco Polo, who complimented Hangzhou in his travel notes as \"the most splendid heavenly city in the world\". In the late Yuan dynasty, there were \"Qiantang Ten Scenic Spots\", in addition to the \"West Lake Ten Scenic Spots\" of the Southern Song dynasty; the existence of which expanded the scope of tourism. During the Zhiyuan era of the reign of Kublai Khan, the lake was dredged, and renamed \"pond of freeing captive animals\" (\u653e\u751f\u6c60). Some of the lake area was gradually enriched and became cultivated zones. In the late Yuan dynasty, West Lake lacked governmental attention, and plutocrats and noblemen enclosed water zones, so that the lake deteriorated into a desolate state with most of its area silting up and turning into swampland.\n\n\n=== Ming dynasty ===\n\nIn the later Yuan Dynasty and beginning of the Ming Dynasty, people attributed the collapse of the Southern Song Dynasty to the West Lake, because the upper class and emperors indulge themselves into the melody and wine with the sceneries of the lake. Therefore, people and the govern's didn't want to make it clean and thriving in case that this kind of thing happened again. But later in the Ming dynasty, Hangzhou began to restore its prosperity in the Xuande and Zhengtong eras (1426\u20131449). Then, the local government kept a close watch on West Lake. In the 16th year of the Hongzhi era (one source suggests it was the 3rd year of the Zhengde era) the then governor Yang Mengying (\u694a\u5b5f\u745b), with the support of special envoy Ju Liang (\u8eca\u7cb1), obtained approval to dredge the lake, despite much resistance from local magnates. This project was funded by the Engineering Department. The West Lake Visit Guide (\u897f\u6e56\u6e38\u89bd\u5fd7) recorded, \"The work commenced in February... It took 152 days, and 6,700,000 men at a cost of 23,607 silver taels, and the removal of 3,481 acres of illegal fields... Thus, West Lake was restored to its image in the Tang and Song dynasties.\" The dredging project extended the water surface from west of Su Causeway to Hongchun Bridge and Mao Jia Bu. The excavated silt was used to broaden Su Causeway, and also used to build a long causeway in western Inside Lake, called \"Yanggong Causeway\" (\u694a\u516c\u5824).\nBoth in the Ming and Qing dynasties, West Lake was dredged several times. The silt dug up was heaped to form two islands in the lake, \"Huxin Island\" and \"Xiao Ying Zhou\".\nIn 1607, the governor of Qiantang County, Nie Xintang (\u8076\u5fc3\u6e6f), constructed a circular causeway from south to west outside the Fangsheng Pond of the island \"Xiao Ying Zhou\", which resulted in a unique view of \"Island in Lake, Lake in Island\". In 1611, Yang Wanli subsequently built the outer bank, and the whole plot was realized by 1620. Outside the pond were erect three small stony pagodas, called \"Three Ponds (or Pools) Mirroring the Moon\" (\u4e09\u6f6d\u5370\u6708; s\u0101n t\u00e1n y\u00ecn yu\u00e8), which often give also their name to the Xiao Ying island.\n\n\n=== Qing Dynasty ===\n\nThe Kangxi and Qianlong emperors of the Qing dynasty toured South China and stopping by Hangzhou many times; which helped to expedite the revamping and rehabilitation of West Lake. The Kangxi Emperor visited Hangzhou five times, and wrote the names of \"Ten Scenic Spots of West Lake\" selected in the Southern Song dynasty. The local governor then inscribed the emperor's handwriting onto stelae and built pavilions over them. Thereafter those scenes such as \"Two Peaks Piercing the Clouds\" and \"Moon over the Peaceful Lake in Autumn\" acquired fixed locations for appreciation. During the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, \"Eighteen Scenic Sites of West Lake\" had developed into a new nomenclature together with enriched tourism resources. The Qianlong Emperor visited Hangzhou six times, composing poems as well as erecting stelae for the \"Ten Scenic Spots\". He also wrote names for \"Eight Scenic Spots of Dragon Well\", bringing renown to the mountainous scenery of remote the Dragon Well region (Longjing). In the Qianlong era, two Hangzhou natives, brothers Qu Hao and Qu Han, co-authored a book called \"A Glance at Lakes and Hills\", recording as many as 1,016 tourist spots around West Lake. This is the earliest known travel guide in Hangzhou.\nDuring the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, West Lake still preserved a water area of 7.54 square kilometers, but more than 20 acres (81,000 m2) were shoals. Due to extensive dredging projects, the lake area spread beyond the west of now Xishan Road to the neighborhood of Hongchun Bridge, Maojia Bu, Turtle Pond, and Chishan Bu. In the fifth year of the Yongzheng era, the governor of Zhejiang and Right Vice Director of the Court of Censors, Li Wei, spent 42,742 silver taels to dredge the lake. He built stone weirs in Jinsha Harbor, Chishan Bu, Jingjia Hill and Maojia Bu in order to store water and to flush out the lake silt. In 1800, Yan Jian (\u984f\u6aa2), the governor of Zhejiang, beseeched the imperial court to support a hydraulic project in West Lake. The project was supervised by the governor of Zhejiang, Ruan Yuan, who had the excavated silt piled into a mound, which was then named \"Ruan Gong Dun\" (\u962e\u516c\u58a9; 'Lord Ruan's Pier'). By then, the modern configuration of West Lake was determined. In 1864, the West Lake Dredging Bureau was founded, and a Qiantang native, Ding Bin, was appointed as director.\n\n\n=== Republican era to the end of the 20th century ===\nFrom the end of the Qing dynasty to the Republican era, the Shanghai\u2013Hangzhou\u2013Ningbo and the Zhejiang\u2013Jiangxi railways as well as the Hangzhou\u2013Shanghai, Hangzhou\u2013Nanjing, and Hangzhou\u2013Ningbo highways were built. This facilitation of transportation encouraged the development of Hangzhou's tourism industry. Besides traditional pilgrims, more and more travelers came from domestic cities like Shanghai and Nanjing as well as from Europe, the United States and Japan. \"The special memorial edition of Hangzhou government 10th anniversary\" says, from 1930\u20131936, the recorded tourists to Hangzhou were counted to 32,845.\n\nHangzhou's tourism resources became more abundant in the Republican era, as scenic spots and cultural relics were steadily added around West Lake. The government converted the imperial garden of the imperial palace remaining from the Qing dynasty into a park, on Solitary Hill. In 1927, the park was renamed \"Zhongshan Park\" or \"Sun Yat-sen Park\". On the left side of the park, the Zhejiang Martyrs' Memorial was built, honoring those deceased when the Zhejiang army captured Jinling. In addition, tombs for Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin were constructed near Xiling Bridge. In 1917, the Dabei Pavilion in Lingyin Temple was erected, and the Yue Wang Temple and Yue Fei's tomb were renovated several times. From 1923 to 1931, the Huanglong Dong was built. From 1923 to 1924, the deserted Qian King Temple was renovated and converted to a garden. In 1933, the leaning Baochu Pagoda was revamped.\nThe construction of parks in Hangzhou started with Lakeside Park in the Republican era. In 1912, the military government of Zhejiang demolished the city walls from Qiantang Gate to Yongjin Gate as well as the fortress of banners, and built Hubing Rd along the lakeside. Hurdles were put up 20 meters from the lake and flowers and trees were planted. The area was called \"Lakeside Park\", covering around one Chinese mile and was divided into five parks, first to fifth. In the spring of 1930, the city government paved a land of around 21 mu with mud dredged out of the lake from north of Changsheng Rd to Qiantang Gate, and founded Sixth Park. From 1928-1933, Zhejiang's provincial government erected \"Chen Yingshi Statue\", \"North Expedition Martyr Memorial Tower\" and \"Martyrs of 88 Division in Songhu Campaign Memorial Stela\" at the piers of Third Park, Second Park and Fifth Park, respectively.\nDue to continuous digging by stealth on its base, Leifeng Pagoda, after lasting nearly a thousand years, collapsed all of a sudden on September 25, 1924. It was shocking news in media. Lu Xun purposely wrote \"Comment on the Collapse of Leifeng Pagoda\" and \"Second Comment on the Collapse of Leifeng Pagoda\", making a remark on this incident. The fall of Leifeng Pagoda also put an end to one of \"Ten Scenes of West Lake\", \"Leifeng Pagoda in the Sunset\" (\u96f7\u5cf0\u5915\u7167).\nFrom June 6 to October 20, 1929, the government of Zhejiang hosted the first \"West Lake Expo\", and total participants numbered over 20 million. The location of West Lake Expo was set at areas around the lakeside, such as Broken Bridge, Solitary Hill, Yue-Wang Temple, and North Hill. The primary purpose of the expo was to promote national products and encourage enterprises. Besides over 1,000 delegate groups from nationwide, involved included delegates from America, Japan, Britain, Indonesia and other countries. It was the largest and longest pageant in Hangzhou during the Republican era.\n\nAfter the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Hangzhou was among the first places opened to tourism. The city government preserved the mountain area around the lake and planted a large number of trees. Meanwhile, West Lake was extensively dredged. Within West Lake scenery zone, a new botanical garden and flower garden was opened. Fish Viewing at the Flower Pond (\u82b1\u6e2f\u89c0\u9b5a) park, and Orioles Singing in the Willows (\u67f3\u6d6a\u805e\u9daf) park were constructed. Fish Viewing at the Jade Springs and Yongjin Park were rebuilt. Lingyin Temple, Jingci Temple, Yue-Wang Temple, Three Ponds Mirroring the Moon (\u4e09\u6f6d\u5370\u6708), Lake-heart Pavilion and other spots were renovated. In addition, West Huanhu Rd (Xishan Rd), Longjin Rd and Jiuxi Rd were newly built. In 1959, West Lake of Hangzhou received over 1,400 foreign tourists, over 2,300 tourists from Hong Kong and Macao and over five million domestic visitors.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution Liutong Temple and another temple were destroyed.After the Cultural Revolution, the number of tourists to West Lake increased again. In 1978, it received 53,000 tourists from overseas and Hong Kong and Macao combined, in addition to about six million domestic travelers.\nIn May 1983, the state council named Hangzhou \"Famed Historical and Cultural City\" and \"National Key Scenic Tourism City\". In September 1984, the executive office of state council instructed that Hangzhou evolve to the tourism center of Southeast China and a first-class international scenic tourism city. Thereafter Hangzhou government refurbished Lingyin Temple, Tianzhu Temple, Jingci Temple, Yue-Wang Temple, Dacheng Hall, stela pavilions of \"Ten Scenes\" and other relics. Resorts such as Galloping Tiger Spring were expanded. Curved Yard and Lotus Pool in Summer (\u66f2\u9662\u98a8\u8377) park was founded. New spot \"Exploring Plum Blossoms at Ling Peak\" (\u9748\u5cf0\u63a2\u6885) was opened. Archaizing carnivals were held in Huanglong Dong and Ruangong Dun. There were also night gardens and music night markets for amusement.\nIn 1949, West Lake silted up, with average depth of merely 0.55 meters and capacity only 4 million cubic meters. Marshy weeds blanketed the lake bed so that large boat could only make their ways through specific channels. In 1950, the government listed West Lake dredging as a national investment project. Hangzhou launched the West Lake Dredging Project in 1951 to excavate the silt thoroughly. By 1954, all the work had been mechanized. The project concluded in 1959. As a result, the achieved average depth was 1.808 meters with nadir of 2.6 meters. The capacity elevated to 10,271,900 cubic meters. The silt was used to fill 18 ponds or lacunae in surrounding areas including Zhaoqing Temple and Qingbo Park. However, because of the erosion and sediment on lake bed afterward, the depth of the water lessened to 1.47 meters. The government thus invested two million yuan in 1976 to dredge the lake again. By 1980, the depth increased to 1.5 meters. Besides dredging work, the city government substantially fortified the lake shore, resulting in a bank of total length of 29,800 meters. That was the largest bank enhancement project in the history of West Lake. Along with the project, more than 10 piers for mooring the boats were renovated or newly built in Lakeside Park, Zhongshan Park, Yue Fei's tomb and both sides of Su Causeway.\nThe West Lake Diversion Project was inaugurated on 1 February 1985. The project built a pump at Zhakou section of Qiantang River, and drew 300,000 cubic meters of water daily, equivalent to one thirty-third of total capacity of the lake. As a consequence, the lake's water body transparency was increased by 5 to 7 cm. Other the other hand, The lake-wide sewage interception project was launched in 1978, and was finished in 1981. It was divided into three branches, southern, western and northern, buried sewage tunnels of over 17 kilometers, and was equipped with 10 pumping stations.\n\nIn 1984, five organizations including Hangzhou Daily newspaper sponsored voting for the \"New Ten Scenes in West Lake\". The elected new scenes are Cloud-Sustained Path in a Bamboo Grove (\u96f2\u68f2\u7af9\u5f91), Misty Trees by Nine Streams (\u4e5d\u6eaa\u7159\u6a39), Dreams at Galloping Tiger Spring (\u864e\u8dd1\u5922\u6cc9), Yellow Dragon Cave Dressed in Green (\u9ec3\u9f8d\u5410\u7fe0), Sweet Osmanthus Rain at Manjuelong Village (\u6eff\u96b4\u6842\u96e8), Clouds Scurrying over Jade Emperor Hill (\u7389\u7687\u98db\u96f2), Inquiring about Tea at Dragon Well (\u9f8d\u4e95\u554f\u8336), Precious Stone Hill Floating in Rosy Clouds (\u5bf6\u77f3\u6d41\u971e), Heavenly Wind over Wushan Hill (\u5433\u5c71\u5929\u98a8), and Ruan's Mound Encircled by Greenness (\u962e\u58a9\u74b0\u78a7). While embracing both exquisite natural beauty and abundant cultural deposits, West Lake of Hangzhou was among the first \"National Key Scenic Tourist Resorts\" in 1982, and elected one of \"Ten Chinese Scenic Sites\" in 1985.\nAfter 71 years, the West Lake Expo was launched in Xi Hu in 2000. The new exhibition was held from October 20 to November 10, attracting 1,400,000 tourists domestic and overseas. The tourism industry brought in 1.12 billion RMB. The Expo greatly enhanced the reputation of West Lake domestically and internationally. Thereafter the West Lake Expo was made a conventional annual celebration.\nImages of the West Lake have appeared various times on Chinese currency. The picture of \"Three Ponds Mirroring the Moon\" was printed on the backs of both the foreign exchange certificate one yuan bill issued by the government in 1979 and the fifth version of RMB one yuan bill issued in 2004.\n\n\n=== Literary works ===\nOver the centuries, the beauty and culture of West Lake has attracted numerous literati, who left behind works of literature and poetry to describe the lake. For example, Dream in West Lake and The Enchiridion of Lake and Mountain recorded a lot about West Lake and ancient Hangzhou historic anecdotes. Poets such as Bai Juyi, Su Shi, Xu Zhimo and Hu Shih also wrote countless poems about West Lake. The Chinese legend Legend of the White Snake is also set in West Lake in Hangzhou and has been adapted into films and television series over the years.\n\n\n=== West Lake Southern Side Renovation Project ===\nEntering the 21st century, West Lake witnessed several environmental renovation projects. First of them was \"West Lake Southern Side Renovation Project\". From February to October 2002, Hangzhou government incorporated four large parks on the southern side of the lake, and these four parks have been free to public 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. On October 25, 2002, on the old site of the Leifeng Pagoda which collapsed 78 years ago, a new pagoda with height of 71.7 meters was erected.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nAbout the formation of West Lake, there are few records in ancient documents. The \"West Lake Sight-Seeing Record\" (\u897f\u6e56\u6e38\u89bd\u5fd7) says, \"West Lake is surrounded by mountains on three sides. Streams wander down the hills into the pond. There're hundreds of springs underneath. Accumulated water forms the lake.\" (\u897f\u6e56\u4e09\u9762\u74b0\u5c71\uff0c\u6eaa\u8c37\u7e37\u6ce8\uff0c\u4e0b\u6709\u6df5\u6cc9\u767e\u9053\uff0c\u6f74\u800c\u70ba\u6e56\u3002) Modern scholars studied topography, geology, sediment and hydrodynamics, and generally held that West Lake was a lagoon formed gradually from a gulf. In 1920, scientist Zhu Kezhen published \"The Cause of Formation of West Lake in Hangzhou\" (\u676d\u5dde\u897f\u6e56\u751f\u6210\u7684\u539f\u56e0) after examining the topography around the lake. He claimed, \"West Lake originally was a little bay on left side of Qiantang River. Later the earth in the river sedimented and slowly corked the mouth of the bay, hence a lagoon formed.\" Zhu postulated, based on the calculation of the rate of sedimentation, that West Lake was formed about 12,000 years ago, when the lake would have been significantly larger than now; and, that the lake's water area had gradually shrunk, due to its being filled by sediments carried down from the creeks in the hills which surround it on three sides. West Lake would no longer exist today without all the dredging work done in the historical period. In 1924, geologist Zhang Hongzhao (\u7ae0\u9d3b\u91d7) published \"One Explanation of the Formation of West Lake\". While supporting Zhu's arguments, he supplemented that the formation of West Lake started with tidal force building the lake bank. Later, the alterations of the beach helped to maintain the water level. These were two prerequisites to the formation of the lake.\n\n\n== Hydrological characteristics ==\nThe outline of the lake body of the west lake is almost oval, the bottom of the lake is relatively flat. The catchment area of the west lake is 21.22 square kilometers, with annual runoff of 14 million cubic meters and storage of nearly 14 million cubic meters. The west lake draws water from the Qiantang River, about 120 million cubic meters per year. The natural surface water sources of the lake are Jinsha stream(\u91d1\u6c99\u6da7), long hong stream(\u9f99\u6cd3\u6da7), Qishan stream (huiyin stream)(\u8d64\u5c71\u6da7\uff08\u6167\u56e0\u6da7\uff09) and changqiao stream(\u957f\u6865\u6eaa).\nThe storage capacity is about 14.294 million cubic meters. The average depth of the lake is 2.27 meters, with the deepest being about 5 meters and the shallowest being less than 1 meter. The average annual precipitation on the lake is 5.629 million cubic meters. The scour coefficient of the water system is 1.49. When the gate of the reservoir is closed in a dry season, the flow rate is equal to 0. Even in the flood period, the general flow rate is only below 0.05 m/s.\nThe water level of the lake is maintained at the yellow sea level of 7.15 meters, \u00b10.05 meters. The highest water level of 7.70 meters and the lowest water level of 6.92 meters, with a difference of 50 centimeters.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\n\n\n=== Flora ===\n\nAround the west lake, there are 184 families 739 genera 1369 species of seed plants, including 28 species of gymnosperms in 19 genera and 7 families, 1273 species of angiosperms in 675 genera and 150 families, 68 species of ferns in 45 genera and 27 families. Currently, there are 21 species of rare plants are listed in the first-grade state protection, including Zhejiang nan, wild soybean and short spike bamboo, and 63 species are listed the second-grade state protection.Peach Blossom: On the lake banks and Su and Bai Causeways a large number of willows and peach trees are planted. It is said one willow is accompanied by one peach tree. Other horticultural plants include magnolia, cherry, Confederate rose, etc. The blooming season of peach tree in Hangzhou usually ranges from end of February to middle of April.\nLotus: Some sites in Hangzhou were named after lotus, such as lotus pond (\u8377\u82b1\u6c60\u982d) and lotus lane (\u8377\u82b1\u5858\u5f04). There is traditional food called \"lotus cake\". The fossil of lotus seeds was unearthed at Kuahuqiao site in Xiaoshan, which indicates at least before the Tang dynasty there was cultivated lotus. Yang Wanli of the Song dynasty wrote poem, \"Lotus leaves grow to the sky with endless green, lotus blossoms bathed in the sunlight appear especially red. (\u63a5\u5929\u84ee\u8449\u7121\u7aae\u78a7\uff0c\u6620\u65e5\u8377\u82b1\u522b\u6837\u7d05), which brought high reputation to the lotus in West Lake. Nowadays, there are 14 lotus cultivation areas in the lake, totally 130 Chinese acres. Most are in \"North Inside Lake\" and \"Yue Lake\". According to statistics, West Lake lotus starts to bloom in early June, and reaches peak blossom time in late June. It can last till late August or early September.\nOsmanthus: As the city flower, osmanthus is one of representative plants of Hangzhou. Poet Bai Juyi wrote \"search osmanthus around the temple on hill in the middle of Autumn\", indicating osmanthus had been cultivated as early as in the Tang dynasty. Osmanthus trees have been massively planted in parks around the lake, and the best-known locations to appreciate are \"Sweet Osmanthus Rain at Manjuelong Village\", one of \"New Ten Scenes of West Lake\", and Hangzhou Botanical Garden. Osmanthus can be divided into four major species, Thunbergii group (\u91d1\u6842), Latifolius Group (\u9280\u6842), Aurantiacus Group (\u4e39\u6842) and Fragrans Division (\u56db\u5b63\u6842). Among them, the Thunbergii and Latifolius are the best. Every year around mid-autumn, the sweet-scented osmanthus blossoming is a highlight of tourism in Hangzhou. In addition to its elegant looks, osmanthus is also edible. Thunbergii and Latifolius boast intensive sweet scent, and are natural ingredients for seasoning. Pickled osmanthus blossoms mixed with white sugar became a traditional food of Hangzhou, \"Sweet Osmanthus\" (\u7cd6\u6842\u82b1). West Lake Osmanthus blooming period commences from early September, lasting till early November.\nPlum blossom: Lin Bu (\u6797\u900b), a famous recluse in the Song dynasty, lived on Solitary Hill. His poem Little Plum Blossom of Hill Garden (\u5c71\u5712\u5c0f\u6885) became the best known poem praising the flower and enriched the cultural contributions of the plum blossoms of West Lake. The opening line of the poem says, \"When everything has faded they alone shine forth, encroaching on the charms of smaller gardens\" (\u773e\u82b3\u6416\u843d\u7368\u6684\u598d\uff0c\u5360\u65b7\u98a8\u60c5\u5411\u5c0f\u5712). Ling Peak, Solitary Hill and West Creek have long been the three finest spots of plum blossom cherishing in Hangzhou. The flowering season is typically around the Spring Festival, from late January to middle February.\nTulip: The \"Prince Bay Park\" (\u592a\u5b50\u6e7e\u516c\u56ed) of Hangzhou imported almost all species of tulips from Netherlands in 1992, and held annual tulips exhibition ever since. It has become a new scenic spot on the lake bank. The normal tulips blossom season spans from middle of March to end of April.\n\n\n=== Fauna ===\n\nMallards, halcyons and koi carp are among the most frequently spotted animals in the lake. Squirrels loiter among the trees on the bank.\n\n\n== Influences ==\n\nWest Lake is said to be the incarnation of Xi Shi, one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Since ancient times, West Lake was associated with a large number of romantic poets, profound philosophers, national heroes and heroines. West Lake was also the retreat for many Chinese writers of the past. The Northern Song Dynasty poet Lin Bu, shunning the life of being an official, lived in seclusion by West Lake for twenty years, and dedicated himself to the cultivation of peach and plum blossoms. The great Ming dynasty essayist Zhang Dai, wrote a number of essays about West Lake in Reminiscence and Dream of Tao'an (\u9676\u5eb5\u5922\u61b6), and a whole book: Search for West Lake in Dreams (\u897f\u6e56\u5922\u5c0b). West Lake has had a profound impact on Far Eastern landscape designs, and its features have often been imitated by other palaces and gardens, such as Kunming Lake at the Summer Palace in Beijing, the central ponds of the Kyu Shiba Rikyu Garden and Koishikawa K\u014drakuen Garden in Tokyo, Japan, among others.\nDue to its prominent historical and cultural status, West Lake was selected as a National Key Scenic Resort in 1982, one of Ten Scenic Resorts in 1985 and a national 5A tourist resort in 2006.\nAlong with its cultural importance, West Lake historically was also of value for local commercial fishermen. According to statistics from 1977, the lake had an annual fish yield of 1300 kg/hectare, quite a bit more than for some larger lakes (that is, East Lake of Wuhan had a yield of only 450 kg/ha).\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\nOther attractions include:\n\nYue Fei Temple, the tomb and memorial hall to Yue Fei.\nLingyin Temple, a Buddhist monastery and surrounding hills.\nLong Jing tea farms (\u9f99\u4e95\u8336\u56ed), an area renowned for the quality of Tea.\nJingci Temple\nGalloping Tiger Spring (\u864e\u8dd1\u68a6\u6cc9), a spring famous for its mineral water\nTomb of Su Xiao Xiao (\u82cf\u5c0f\u5c0f\u5893)\nThe West Lake Museum (located on the lake shore) is dedicated to the cultural heritage of the West Lake.\n\n\n== Ten Scenes of West Lake ==\nTraditionally, there are ten best-known scenic spots on the West Lake, each remembered by a four-character epithet. Collectively, they are known as the \"Ten Scenes of West Lake\" (10 Scenic Spots in West Lake \u897f\u6e56\u5341\u666f). Each is marked by a stele with an epithet written in the calligraphy of the Qianlong Emperor. They are:\n\nDawn on the Su Causeway in Spring (\u8607\u5824\u6625\u66c9)\nCurved Yard and Lotus Pool in Summer (\u66f2\u9662\u98a8\u8377)\nMoon over the Peaceful Lake in Autumn (\u5e73\u6e56\u79cb\u6708)\nRemnant Snow on the Bridge in Winter (\u65b7\u6a4b\u6b98\u96ea)\nLeifeng Pagoda in the Sunset (\u96f7\u5cf0\u5915\u7167)\nTwo Peaks Piercing the Clouds (\u96d9\u5cf0\u63d2\u96f2)\nOrioles Singing in the Willows (\u67f3\u6d6a\u805e\u9daf)\nFish Viewing at the Flower Pond (\u82b1\u6e2f\u89c0\u9b5a)\nThree Ponds Mirroring the Moon (\u4e09\u6f6d\u5370\u6708)\nEvening Bell Ringing at the Nanping Hill (\u5357\u5c4f\u665a\u9418)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nSlender West Lake\nWest Lake (Huizhou)\n\n\n== External links ==\nHangzhou Government website\nTRAVELZHEJIANG\nTen Classic Scenes of West Lake in History\nOfficial Travel Guide of West Lake \u2013 Hangzhou Tourism Commission\nHangzhou West Lake: Too many places, too little time",

It is the second prominent Buddhist temple beside West Lake in Hangzhou, China. Together with Lingyin Temple, it is called the jewel of the southern and northern hills. The temple was claimed as a key national Buddhist temple in Han areas by the State Council in 1983.\n\n\n== History ==\nJingci Temple was originally called Huiri Yongming Temple (\u6167\u65e5\u6c38\u660e\u9662). It was first built in 954 by King Qian Chu of the Wuyue kingdom for a famous monk Yongming Yanshou. In the Southern Song dynasty, its name was changed to Jingci Temple, and the \"500 Luohan Hall\" was built. The temple was destroyed and rebuilt several times in the history. The majority of present temple was built in the 1980s. Specially, there is a newly forged copper bell, weighing over 100 Kilograms. On it is carved The Lotus Sutra (\u5999\u6cd5\u83b2\u82b1\u7ecf), with 68,000 characters. \nIt hosts one of Ten Scenes of West Lake, \"Evening Bell Ringing at the Nanping Hill\" (\u5357\u5c4f\u665a\u949f).",

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. It is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in East China. IHangzhou comprises 10 districts, 1 county-level city, and 2 counties. The ten urban districts occupy  8,292.31 km2 (3,201.68 sq mi) and have a population of 8,241,000, in which there are six central urban districts and four suburban districts.

The most recent estimates of the city's urban area population are between 6,658,000 and 6,820,000.During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 9,018,000 in 2015. The entire province had a population of 8,700,373, and the encompassing urban agglomeration (including Shaoxing) is estimated to have population of 8,450,000.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 13.4 million, although other sources put the figure at over 21 million. The Hangzhou metropolitan area includes the major cities of Shaoxing, Jiaxing and Huzhou.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHangzhou's economy has rapidly developed since its opening up in 1992. It is an industrial city with many diverse sectors such as light industry, agriculture, and textiles. It is considered an important manufacturing base and logistics hub for coastal China. In recent years, Hangzhou has seen substantial development in its financial sector, featuring for the first time in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2018 at rank 89.\nThe 2001 GDP of Hangzhou was RMB 156.8 billion, which ranked second among all of the provincial capitals after Guangzhou. The city has more than tripled its GDP since then, increasing from RMB 156.8 billion in 2001 to RMB 1.3509 trillion in 2018 and GDP per capita increasing from US$3,020 to $21,184.The city has developed many new industries, including medicine, information technology, heavy equipment, automotive components, household electrical appliances, electronics, telecommunication, fine chemicals, chemical fibre and food\nprocessing. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has also strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta+\" classification according to GaWC.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\nHangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone was established and approved as a national development zone by the State Council in 1993. It covers an area of 104.7 km2 (40.4 sq mi). Encouraged industries include electronic information, biological medicine, machinery and household appliances manufacturing, and food processing.Hangzhou Export Processing Zone was established on April 27, 2000 upon approval of the State Council. It was one of the first zones and the only one in Zhejiang Province to be approved by the government. Its total planned area is 2.92 km2 (1.13 sq mi). It is located close to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport and Hangzhou Port.Hangzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was set up with approval from the State Council as a state-level high-tech Industrial Development Zone in March 1991. The HHTZ is composed of three parts, with the main regions being the Zhijiang Sci-Tech Industrial Park and Xiasha Sci-Tech Industrial Park. HHTZ has become one of the most influential high-tech innovation and high-tech industry bases in Zhejiang Province. As of 2013, HHTZ hosts more than 1,100 software developers and BPO enterprises. Major companies such as Motorola, Nokia and Siemens have established R&D centers in the zone. In 2011, the GDP of the zone rose by 13.1 percent, amounting to RMB 41.63 billion. This accounted for 5.9 percent of Hangzhou's total GDP. The HHTZ positions itself as the \"Silicon Valley\" of China. The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places. Adjacent to the lake is an area which includes historical pagodas, cultural sites, as well as the natural environment of the lake and hills, including Phoenix Mountain. There are two causeways across the lake.\nOther places of interest\nGrand Canal, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the Canal in Hangzhou was built in 610 AD.

These islands are different in size and shape, and have distinctive scene.\nLongjing tea fields, west of the lake.\nQiantang riveris the largest river in Zhejiang Province, China. Every year during August 15th to August 18th of the lunar month in China, the Qiantang Tide occurs. It is called \u201cthe Biggest Tide in the World\u201dIn March 2013 the Hangzhou Tourism Commission started an online campaign via Facebook, the 'Modern Marco Polo' campaign. Over the next year nearly 26,000 participants applied from around the globe, in the hopes of becoming Hangzhou's first foreign tourism ambassador. In a press conference in Hangzhou on 20 May 2014, Liam Bates was announced as the successful winner and won a $55,000 contract, being the first foreigner ever to be appointed by China's government in such an official role.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Scenic places near West Lake ===\nJingci Temple is located just south of West Lake.\nLingyin Temple (Soul's Retreat) is located about 2 km (1.2 mi) west of West Lake.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world. China National Tea Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6\u535a\u7269\u9986) is a national museum with special subjects as tea and its culture.

Yue opera, originated from Shengzhou, Zhejiang Province, is the second-largest opera form in China. Also, there are several big shows themed with the history and culture of Hangzhou like Impression West Lake and the Romance of Song Dynasty.\nHangzhou has historically been an important hub for artists and scholars. In modern times, Hangzhou was home to the China Academy of Art and prominent painters such as Lin Fengmian and Fang Ganmin.\nTea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating Longjing, a notable variety of green tea, the most notable type being Longjing Tea. Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown in Longjing village near West Lake in Hangzhou, hence its name.The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon silk production, umbrellas, and Chinese hand-held folding fans.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of Zhejiang provincial cuisine, which is claimed as one of China's eight fundamental cuisines. The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China. Those planted by the West Lake is the best Longjing tea.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port of Hangzhou is a small river port with a cargo throughput that exceeds 100 million tons annually.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Netherlands, Qatar, Portugal and the United States. Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city. Public universities include Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology, and Hangzhou Normal University etc.  Xiasha, located near the east end of the city,  and Xiaoheshan, located near the west end of the city, are college towns with a cluster of several universities and colleges.\n\nChina Academy of Art (founded in 1928)\nChina Jiliang University\nHangzhou Dianzi University\nHangzhou Normal University (founded in 1908)\nZhejiang Chinese Medical University\nZhejiang Forestry University\nZhejiang Gongshang University (founded in 1911, the earliest business school in China)\nZhejiang University of Science and Technology\nZhejiang International Studies University (also known as Zhejiang Education Institute, founded in 1955)\nZhejiang Sci-Tech University\nZhejiang Shuren University\nZhejiang University (founded in 1897), one of the top universities in China.

Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. It is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in East China. IHangzhou comprises 10 districts, 1 county-level city, and 2 counties. The ten urban districts occupy  8,292.31 km2 (3,201.68 sq mi) and have a population of 8,241,000, in which there are six central urban districts and four suburban districts. The central urban districts occupy 706.27 km2 (272.69 sq mi) and have a population of 3,780,000 and the suburban districts occupy 7,586.04 km2 (2,928.99 sq mi) and have a population of 4,461,000.\nIn the early 90s, the urban districts of Hangzhou only comprises Shangcheng, Xiacheng, Gongshu, Jianggan.\nOn December 11, 1996, Bingjiang District was established.\nOn March 12, 2001, the City of Xiaoshan and the City of Yuhang was included into the City of Hangzhou as two districts.\nOn December 13, 2014, and in July 2017, the City of Fuyang and Lin'an were included into the City of Hangzhou as two districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nHangzhou city had a population of 5,162,039 (including Xiaoshan and Yuhang) at the 2010 census, an increase of 4.8% per year since the 2000 census. The most recent estimates of the city's urban area population are between 6,658,000 and 6,820,000.During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 9,018,000 in 2015. The entire province had a population of 8,700,373, and the encompassing urban agglomeration (including Shaoxing) is estimated to have population of 8,450,000.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 13.4 million, although other sources put the figure at over 21 million. The Hangzhou metropolitan area includes the major cities of Shaoxing, Jiaxing and Huzhou.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHangzhou's economy has rapidly developed since its opening up in 1992. It is an industrial city with many diverse sectors such as light industry, agriculture, and textiles. It is considered an important manufacturing base and logistics hub for coastal China. In recent years, Hangzhou has seen substantial development in its financial sector, featuring for the first time in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2018 at rank 89.\nThe 2001 GDP of Hangzhou was RMB 156.8 billion, which ranked second among all of the provincial capitals after Guangzhou. The city has more than tripled its GDP since then, increasing from RMB 156.8 billion in 2001 to RMB 1.3509 trillion in 2018 and GDP per capita increasing from US$3,020 to $21,184.The city has developed many new industries, including medicine, information technology, heavy equipment, automotive components, household electrical appliances, electronics, telecommunication, fine chemicals, chemical fibre and food\nprocessing. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has also strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta+\" classification according to GaWC.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\nHangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone was established and approved as a national development zone by the State Council in 1993. It covers an area of 104.7 km2 (40.4 sq mi). Encouraged industries include electronic information, biological medicine, machinery and household appliances manufacturing, and food processing.Hangzhou Export Processing Zone was established on April 27, 2000 upon approval of the State Council. It was one of the first zones and the only one in Zhejiang Province to be approved by the government. Its total planned area is 2.92 km2 (1.13 sq mi). It is located close to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport and Hangzhou Port.Hangzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was set up with approval from the State Council as a state-level high-tech Industrial Development Zone in March 1991. The HHTZ is composed of three parts, with the main regions being the Zhijiang Sci-Tech Industrial Park and Xiasha Sci-Tech Industrial Park. HHTZ has become one of the most influential high-tech innovation and high-tech industry bases in Zhejiang Province. As of 2013, HHTZ hosts more than 1,100 software developers and BPO enterprises. Major companies such as Motorola, Nokia and Siemens have established R&D centers in the zone. In 2011, the GDP of the zone rose by 13.1 percent, amounting to RMB 41.63 billion. This accounted for 5.9 percent of Hangzhou's total GDP. The HHTZ positions itself as the \"Silicon Valley\" of China. The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places. Adjacent to the lake is an area which includes historical pagodas, cultural sites, as well as the natural environment of the lake and hills, including Phoenix Mountain. There are two causeways across the lake.\nOther places of interest\nGrand Canal, also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the Canal in Hangzhou was built in 610 AD.

It is called \u201cthe Biggest Tide in the World\u201dIn March 2013 the Hangzhou Tourism Commission started an online campaign via Facebook, the 'Modern Marco Polo' campaign. Over the next year nearly 26,000 participants applied from around the globe, in the hopes of becoming Hangzhou's first foreign tourism ambassador. In a press conference in Hangzhou on 20 May 2014, Liam Bates was announced as the successful winner and won a $55,000 contract, being the first foreigner ever to be appointed by China's government in such an official role.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Scenic places near West Lake ===\nJingci Temple is located just south of West Lake.\nLingyin Temple (Soul's Retreat) is located about 2 km (1.2 mi) west of West Lake.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world. China National Tea Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6\u535a\u7269\u9986) is a national museum with special subjects as tea and its culture. Zhejiang Provincial Museum (\u6d59\u6c5f\u535a\u7269\u9986) features collection of integrated human studies, exhibition and research with its over 100,000 collected cultural relics.\nThere are lots of theaters in Hangzhou showing performance of opera shows. Yue opera, originated from Shengzhou, Zhejiang Province, is the second-largest opera form in China. Also, there are several big shows themed with the history and culture of Hangzhou like Impression West Lake and the Romance of Song Dynasty.\nHangzhou has historically been an important hub for artists and scholars. In modern times, Hangzhou was home to the China Academy of Art and prominent painters such as Lin Fengmian and Fang Ganmin.\nTea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating Longjing, a notable variety of green tea, the most notable type being Longjing Tea. Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown in Longjing village near West Lake in Hangzhou, hence its name.The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon silk production, umbrellas, and Chinese hand-held folding fans.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of Zhejiang provincial cuisine, which is claimed as one of China's eight fundamental cuisines. The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China. Those planted by the West Lake is the best Longjing tea.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port of Hangzhou is a small river port with a cargo throughput that exceeds 100 million tons annually.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Netherlands, Qatar, Portugal and the United States. Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city. Public universities include Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology, and Hangzhou Normal University etc.  Xiasha, located near the east end of the city,  and Xiaoheshan, located near the west end of the city, are college towns with a cluster of several universities and colleges.\n\nChina Academy of Art (founded in 1928)\nChina Jiliang University\nHangzhou Dianzi University\nHangzhou Normal University (founded in 1908)\nZhejiang Chinese Medical University\nZhejiang Forestry University\nZhejiang Gongshang University (founded in 1911, the earliest business school in China)\nZhejiang University of Science and Technology\nZhejiang International Studies University (also known as Zhejiang Education Institute, founded in 1955)\nZhejiang Sci-Tech University\nZhejiang Shuren University\nZhejiang University (founded in 1897), one of the top universities in China. (Project 985, Project 211, C9 League)\nZhejiang University City College\nZhejiang University of Technology (1953)\nZhejiang University of Media and Communications (1984)Note: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nProvincial key Public high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou No. 4 High School, Hangzhou No. 14 High School, Hangzhou No. 2 High School, Hangzhou Foreign Language School, High School Attached to Zhejiang University, High School attached to Hangzhou Normal university, Hangzhou No. 1 High School and Hangzhou Xuejun High School.\nPrivate high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou Green Town Yuhua School, Hangzhou Chinese International School, Hangzhou International School and Hangzhou Japanese School (\u676d\u5dde\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5b66\u6821) (nihonjin gakk\u014d).\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nHangzhou is twinned with:\n\n\n== Ancient proverbs about Hangzhou ==\nAn ancient proverb about Hangzhou and Suzhou is:\n\n\"Paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below.\" (\u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802\uff0c\u4e0b\u6709\u82cf\u676d)This phrase has a similar meaning to the English phrases \"Heaven on Earth\".  Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

        "wiki": "The Qiantang River or alternatively Tsientang River is a river in East China. An important commercial artery, it runs for 459 kilometers (285 mi) through Zhejiang, passing through the provincial capital Hangzhou before flowing into the East China Sea via Hangzhou Bay south of Shanghai. Its original name, the \"Zhe River\" or \"Zhe Jiang\", is the origin of the name of Zhejiang province. The river is also known, along with Hangzhou Bay, for having the world's largest tidal bore, a phenomenon where leading edge of the incoming tide forms a wave (or waves) of water that travels up a river or narrow bay against the direction of the river or bay's current.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIts upper stretch near the Anhui\u2013Jiangxi border is also known as the Xin'an River (\u65b0\u5b89, \"Newly Peaceful\"); its middle stretch through the mountains of Zhejiang is also known as the Fuchun River (\u5bcc\u6625\u6c5f, \"Abundant Spring River\"); and the former name of its lower stretch\u2014the Zhe (\u6d59) or Crooked River\u2014gave Zhejiang Province its name.Historically, it was first documented in the Classic of Mountains and Seas (\u5c71\u6d77\u7ecf) as Zhejiang River (\u6d59\u6c5f), later in Zhuangzi (\u5e84\u5b50)as Zhe River (\u6ddb\u6cb3), and in the Water Classic (\u6c34\u7d93) as Jianjiang River (\u6f38\u6c5f\u6c34). All those names probably originate from the language of extinct Baiyue peoples. In the early 18th century, the Kangxi Dictionary (\u5eb7\u7199\u5b57\u5178) regarded Zhejiang River (\u6d59\u6c5f) as Crooked River for its crooked lower stretch and countercurrent tidal bore.The origin of its current name, the Qiantang River (\u94b1\u5858\u6c5f), literally the River of King Qian's Dyke, however, has nothing to do with the King Qian of Wuyue. It previously referred to the lower stretch within the Qiantang County(\u94b1\u5510\u53bf, former name of Hangzhou City) and later in the 20th century began referring to all stretches of the river.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIt was linked by the Eastern Zhejiang Canal to Shaoxing during the Spring and Autumn Period and to Ningbo's Yong River during the Three Kingdoms Period. It was linked by the Grand Canal to Beijing during the Sui Dynasty. Its present name derives from a major dyke constructed near Hangzhou by the Tang warlord Qian Liu, who established the Wuyue Kingdom in the early 10th century.\n\n\n== Basin ==\nQiantang River is one of the famous rivers in the southeast coast of China. It runs through Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, provinces, which is the largest river in Zhejiang. \"Qiantang\" originally refers to the name of the river below the gate of Hangzhou, but now refers to the whole river basin. Qiantang River basin generally is abundant rainfall with developed water system (total of 60 tributaries), which is feather distribution. If count from the north source (Xinan river), the length of Qiantang river is 588.73 km. While if count from the south source (Qu river), the length of Qiantang river is 522.22 km. The main rivers of Qiantang river basin are Majin river, Changshan river, Qu river, Lan river, Xinan river, Fuchun river and Qiantang river.\n\n\n== Hydrological characteristics ==\nOverall, the runoff of Qiantang River is abundant. However, the incoming water of Qiantang River is strongly impacted by seasonal variation. In general, the runoff from April to June can occupy about 50% of the total annual flow. Because Qiantang River valley is located in the southeast coastal monsoon climate zone, the main source of runoff is atmospheric precipitation. The runoff and precipitation in Qiantang river valley show obvious consistency in both regional distribution and annual variation. The average annual discharge is 2.905\u00d71010 cubic meters, and the average annual sediment discharge is 6.68\u00d710^6 tons. In addition, the annual runoff of the Qiantang River and its tributaries showed significant changes in abundance and drought. \nTidal bore is one of the symbolic features of the Qiantang River. Due to The riverbed of the estuary (Hangzhou bay) sharply shrank and lifted, he tidal range increases along the way, resulting the sharp deformation of tide waves. The average tidal range of Zhenhai on the south bank of Wankou was 1.69 meters, the average tidal range of Ganpu was 5.45 meters. Tidal current hangzhou bay is a clockwise rotating tidal current and the speed is generally 15~20 m/s, The north shore can up to 3~4 m/s. The average income tidal current of Ganpu station was 18,850,000 cubic meters per second. On the other hand, the river bed at the estuary of the Qiantang river is wide and shallow, forming a broad intertidal zone. Under the influence of seasonal runoff and tidal fluctuation, the riverbed is easy to produce violent deformation. In autumn, due to the strong tide, the main trough oscillates along the direction of the rising tide crest. In the season of abundant runoff, the main trough swings along the direction of ebb tide. Because of the process of main trough oscillation, the beach ground is easy to collapse and retreat quickly.\n\n\n== Tidal bore ==\n\nThe river and Hangzhou Bay are known for the world's largest tidal bore. The oldest known tide table (AD 1056) is for the Qiantang River and may have aided ancient travelers wishing to see the famous tidal bore. The tide rushing into the river mouth from the bay causes a bore which can reach up to 9 meters (30 ft) in height, and travel at up to 40 km per hour (25 miles an hour). Known locally as the Silver (or Black) Dragon, the wave sweeps past Hangzhou, menacing shipping in the harbor.\nIn August 2013, the tidal bore turned out stronger than expected due to Typhoon Trami, reaching more than twice its usual height as it broke on the flood barrier, sweeping it and injuring numerous spectators.\nThere have been attempts to surf the tidal bore. The first person to ride the bore was Stuart Matthews from England. The 1988 record was 1.9 km by Stuart Matthews. Then, in October 2007, a group of international surfers brought by Antony Colas, did several attempts, one wave being ridden continuously by French Patrick Audoy and Brazilian Eduardo Bag\u00e9 for 1h10min, for 17 km. In September 2008 a group of American surfers convinced the Chinese government to allow them to surf a section of the river.In November 2013, Red Bull held the first surf competition on the river, called the Qiantang Shoot Out. The bore was considered the most unusual wave in the world for a surfing contest.\n\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe Qiantang River basin is rich in ecosystem types. Forest ecosystems are mojor distributed in the west and south which are composed by evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved forests. The forest ecosystem with complete functions as well as the widely wetland breeds a variety of species. However, with the development of industry, the ecological environment of Qiantang River basin has deteriorated and soil erosion is becoming serious. Although the forest coverage is high, the trend of islandization and fragmentation of wildlife native habitats is obvious and biodiversity is under threat.In recent years, the government tries to combine the environmental protection, prevention and control of water conservancy projects. The construction of \"sea pond\" is the symbolic part of \"green barrier\" of Qiantang River. \n\n\n== Notable points ==\n\n\n=== Qiantang river tidal bore ===\nQiantang River Tidal Bore is an important scenic spot of Qiantang River. Generally, around August 15th, Lunar Calendar is the best time to observe the tides. At that time, the largest Qiantang river tidal bore can be several meters. Before the arrival of the sea tide, a tiny white dot appeared in the distance, which turned into a silver thread in a blink of an eye. Later on, accompanied by waves of dull thunder, the white line rolled to the sea. In ancient Hangzhou, Phoenix mountain, Jianggan area were the best place to watch. Due to the change of geographical location, from the Ming dynasty, Haining, Hanguan was the first resort for tide observation, so it was also called \"Haining Tidal Bore\".\n\n\n=== Qiantang river bridge ===\nQiantang river bridge, also called the first Qiantang River Bridge designed by Chinese bridge expert Yisheng Mao, which is a double-deck truss girder bridge spanning the Qiantang river in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province, China. It is located at the southern end of Hangzhou city and about 700 meters to the east of Liuhe pagoda, between Nanxing bridge station of Zhejiang-jiangxi railway. It is the first double-deck railway and highway bridge designed and built by China itself, which is a milestone in the history of Chinese Bridges. Qiantang river bridge is 1453 meters long, 9.1 meters wide and 71 meters high. The upper deck of the bridge is a two-way two-lane highway with a design speed of 100km/h, and the lower deck is a single-track railway with a design speed of 120km/h. During World War II, the Qiantang River Bridge was hit by Japanese air raids. And then, the Qiantang River Bridge was blown up to the piers only, to resist the Japanese attack. It was repaired in 1948.\n\n\n== Culture ==\nQiantang River has been regarded as the birthplace of Wuyue culture. The characteristics of Wuyue culture are pardon, inclusive, intelligent, realistic, pioneering and brave, which also have been the cultural deposits displayed by Qiantang River. In addition, Liangzhu culture, southern Song dynasty culture, West lake culture and other regional cultures are also distributed in the area of Qiantang River basin. Liangzhu culture has a long history, which adds the thick and simplicity tone to the Qiantang River. The secularization and leisure of the southern Song dynasty culture, combined with the river crossing, have the charm of Qibao teahouse and Jianqiao old street, and contributed to the economic development of the dynasty.\nQiantang River has been deeply loved by ancient Chinese writers and writers.\" Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains\" by painter Gongwang Huang. It was regarded as the culmination of ancient Chinese landscape painting and the peak of art. Zhou Mi's \"observation tide\" was praised as a literary classic and it still listed as a piont article in the textbook of ancient Chinese literature. Sun Quan, as a hero and the ruler of the kingdom of Wu in The Three Kingdoms period. In modern times writer Dafu Yu, revolutionary writer and artist Yan Xia, and scientist Wang Chong are the famous persons born in Qiantang River Basin, and these people made an important contribution to the development of Qiantang culture.\n\n\n== Tributaries ==\nLan River\nJinhua River\nQu River\nXinan River\nFengshui River\nLvzhu River\nPuyang River\nCao'e River\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nJournal articles",

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta. Its administrative area (sub-provincial city) extends west to the mountainous parts of Anhui province, and east to the coastal plain near Hangzhou Bay. The city center is built around the eastern and northern sides of the West Lake, just north of the Qiantang River.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nHangzhou's climate is humid subtropical (K\u00f6ppen Cfa) with four distinctive seasons, characterised by long, very hot, humid summers and chilly, cloudy and drier winters (with occasional snow). The mean annual temperature is 17.0 \u00b0C (62.6 \u00b0F), with monthly daily averages ranging from 4.6 \u00b0C (40.3 \u00b0F) in January to 28.9 \u00b0C (84.0 \u00b0F) in July. The city receives an average annual rainfall of 1,438 mm (56.6 in) and is affected by the plum rains of the Asian monsoon in June. In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 30% in March to 51% in August, the city receives 1,709.4 hours of sunshine annually.\n\n\n== Administrative divisions ==\nHangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. It is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in East China. IHangzhou comprises 10 districts, 1 county-level city, and 2 counties. The ten urban districts occupy  8,292.31 km2 (3,201.68 sq mi) and have a population of 8,241,000, in which there are six central urban districts and four suburban districts. The central urban districts occupy 706.27 km2 (272.69 sq mi) and have a population of 3,780,000 and the suburban districts occupy 7,586.04 km2 (2,928.99 sq mi) and have a population of 4,461,000.\nIn the early 90s, the urban districts of Hangzhou only comprises Shangcheng, Xiacheng, Gongshu, Jianggan.\nOn December 11, 1996, Bingjiang District was established.\nOn March 12, 2001, the City of Xiaoshan and the City of Yuhang was included into the City of Hangzhou as two districts.\nOn December 13, 2014, and in July 2017, the City of Fuyang and Lin'an were included into the City of Hangzhou as two districts.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nHangzhou city had a population of 5,162,039 (including Xiaoshan and Yuhang) at the 2010 census, an increase of 4.8% per year since the 2000 census. The most recent estimates of the city's urban area population are between 6,658,000 and 6,820,000.During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 9,018,000 in 2015. The entire province had a population of 8,700,373, and the encompassing urban agglomeration (including Shaoxing) is estimated to have population of 8,450,000.The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 13.4 million, although other sources put the figure at over 21 million. The Hangzhou metropolitan area includes the major cities of Shaoxing, Jiaxing and Huzhou.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\n\n=== Structure ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nHangzhou's economy has rapidly developed since its opening up in 1992. It is an industrial city with many diverse sectors such as light industry, agriculture, and textiles. It is considered an important manufacturing base and logistics hub for coastal China. In recent years, Hangzhou has seen substantial development in its financial sector, featuring for the first time in the Global Financial Centres Index in 2018 at rank 89.\nThe 2001 GDP of Hangzhou was RMB 156.8 billion, which ranked second among all of the provincial capitals after Guangzhou. The city has more than tripled its GDP since then, increasing from RMB 156.8 billion in 2001 to RMB 1.3509 trillion in 2018 and GDP per capita increasing from US$3,020 to $21,184.The city has developed many new industries, including medicine, information technology, heavy equipment, automotive components, household electrical appliances, electronics, telecommunication, fine chemicals, chemical fibre and food\nprocessing. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has also strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta+\" classification according to GaWC.\n\n\n=== Economic and Technological Development Zones ===\nHangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone was established and approved as a national development zone by the State Council in 1993. It covers an area of 104.7 km2 (40.4 sq mi). Encouraged industries include electronic information, biological medicine, machinery and household appliances manufacturing, and food processing.Hangzhou Export Processing Zone was established on April 27, 2000 upon approval of the State Council. It was one of the first zones and the only one in Zhejiang Province to be approved by the government. Its total planned area is 2.92 km2 (1.13 sq mi). It is located close to Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport and Hangzhou Port.Hangzhou Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone was set up with approval from the State Council as a state-level high-tech Industrial Development Zone in March 1991. The HHTZ is composed of three parts, with the main regions being the Zhijiang Sci-Tech Industrial Park and Xiasha Sci-Tech Industrial Park. HHTZ has become one of the most influential high-tech innovation and high-tech industry bases in Zhejiang Province. As of 2013, HHTZ hosts more than 1,100 software developers and BPO enterprises. Major companies such as Motorola, Nokia and Siemens have established R&D centers in the zone. In 2011, the GDP of the zone rose by 13.1 percent, amounting to RMB 41.63 billion. This accounted for 5.9 percent of Hangzhou's total GDP. The HHTZ positions itself as the \"Silicon Valley\" of China. The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places. Adjacent to the lake is an area which includes historical pagodas, cultural sites, as well as the natural environment of the lake and hills, including Phoenix Mountain.

Every year during August 15th to August 18th of the lunar month in China, the Qiantang Tide occurs. It is called \u201cthe Biggest Tide in the World\u201dIn March 2013 the Hangzhou Tourism Commission started an online campaign via Facebook, the 'Modern Marco Polo' campaign. Over the next year nearly 26,000 participants applied from around the globe, in the hopes of becoming Hangzhou's first foreign tourism ambassador. In a press conference in Hangzhou on 20 May 2014, Liam Bates was announced as the successful winner and won a $55,000 contract, being the first foreigner ever to be appointed by China's government in such an official role.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\n\n=== Scenic places near West Lake ===\nJingci Temple is located just south of West Lake.\nLingyin Temple (Soul's Retreat) is located about 2 km (1.2 mi) west of West Lake.

A Hui from Ningbo also told an Englishman that Hangzhou was the \"stronghold\" of Islam in Zhejiang province, containing multiple mosques, compared to his small congregation of around 30 families in Ningbo for his mosque. Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world. China National Tea Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u8336\u53f6\u535a\u7269\u9986) is a national museum with special subjects as tea and its culture. Zhejiang Provincial Museum (\u6d59\u6c5f\u535a\u7269\u9986) features collection of integrated human studies, exhibition and research with its over 100,000 collected cultural relics.\nThere are lots of theaters in Hangzhou showing performance of opera shows. Yue opera, originated from Shengzhou, Zhejiang Province, is the second-largest opera form in China. Also, there are several big shows themed with the history and culture of Hangzhou like Impression West Lake and the Romance of Song Dynasty.\nHangzhou has historically been an important hub for artists and scholars. In modern times, Hangzhou was home to the China Academy of Art and prominent painters such as Lin Fengmian and Fang Ganmin.\nTea is an important part of Hangzhou's economy and culture. Hangzhou is best known for originating Longjing, a notable variety of green tea, the most notable type being Longjing Tea. Known as the best type of Long Jing tea, Xi Hu Long Jing is grown in Longjing village near West Lake in Hangzhou, hence its name.The local government of Hangzhou heavily invests in promoting tourism and the arts, with emphasis placed upon silk production, umbrellas, and Chinese hand-held folding fans.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\nHangzhou's local cuisine is often considered to be representative of Zhejiang provincial cuisine, which is claimed as one of China's eight fundamental cuisines. The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China. Those planted by the West Lake is the best Longjing tea.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Port ===\nThe Port of Hangzhou is a small river port with a cargo throughput that exceeds 100 million tons annually.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nHangzhou is served by the Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport, which provides direct service to many international destinations such as Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, Netherlands, Qatar, Portugal and the United States. Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi. The China Railway High-Speed service inaugurated on October 26, 2010. The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city. Public universities include Zhejiang University, Zhejiang University of Technology, and Hangzhou Normal University etc.  Xiasha, located near the east end of the city,  and Xiaoheshan, located near the west end of the city, are college towns with a cluster of several universities and colleges.\n\nChina Academy of Art (founded in 1928)\nChina Jiliang University\nHangzhou Dianzi University\nHangzhou Normal University (founded in 1908)\nZhejiang Chinese Medical University\nZhejiang Forestry University\nZhejiang Gongshang University (founded in 1911, the earliest business school in China)\nZhejiang University of Science and Technology\nZhejiang International Studies University (also known as Zhejiang Education Institute, founded in 1955)\nZhejiang Sci-Tech University\nZhejiang Shuren University\nZhejiang University (founded in 1897), one of the top universities in China. (Project 985, Project 211, C9 League)\nZhejiang University City College\nZhejiang University of Technology (1953)\nZhejiang University of Media and Communications (1984)Note: Institutions without full-time bachelor programs are not listed.\n\n\n=== Primary and secondary schools ===\nProvincial key Public high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou No. 4 High School, Hangzhou No. 14 High School, Hangzhou No. 2 High School, Hangzhou Foreign Language School, High School Attached to Zhejiang University, High School attached to Hangzhou Normal university, Hangzhou No. 1 High School and Hangzhou Xuejun High School.\nPrivate high schools in Hangzhou include Hangzhou Green Town Yuhua School, Hangzhou Chinese International School, Hangzhou International School and Hangzhou Japanese School (\u676d\u5dde\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u5b66\u6821) (nihonjin gakk\u014d).\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nHangzhou is twinned with:\n\n\n== Ancient proverbs about Hangzhou ==\nAn ancient proverb about Hangzhou and Suzhou is:\n\n\"Paradise above, Suzhou and Hangzhou below.\" (\u4e0a\u6709\u5929\u5802\uff0c\u4e0b\u6709\u82cf\u676d)This phrase has a similar meaning to the English phrases \"Heaven on Earth\".  Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937. From 1937 to 1945, the city was occupied by Japan. The Kuomintang returned in 1945, and governed until 1949. On May 3, 1949, the People's Liberation Army entered Hangzhou and the city came under Communist control. After Deng Xiaoping's reformist policies began in the end of 1978, Hangzhou took advantage of being situated in the Yangtze Delta to bolster its development. It is now one of China's most prosperous major cities.\n\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. It also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.In February 2020, the city was under curfew measures due to the outbreak of coronavirus beginning in Wuhan that spread across China.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nHangzhou is located in northwestern Zhejiang province, at the southern end of the Grand Canal of China, which runs to Beijing, in the south-central portion of the Yangtze River Delta.

In late summer (August to September), Hangzhou suffers typhoon storms, but typhoons seldom strike it directly. Generally they make landfall along the southern coast of Zhejiang, and affect the area with strong winds and stormy rains. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from \u22129.6 \u00b0C (15 \u00b0F) on 6 February 1969 up to 41.6 \u00b0C (107 \u00b0F) on 9 August 2013; unofficial readings have reached \u221210.5 \u00b0C (13 \u00b0F), set on 29 December 1912 and 24 January 1916, up to 42.1 \u00b0C (108 \u00b0F), set on 10 August 1930.

The Alibaba Group, the world's largest online business-to-business portal and China's largest website in terms of market value, is headquartered in the zone.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\n\nHangzhou is known for its historic relics and natural environment. Although Hangzhou has been through many recent urban developments, it still retains its historical and cultural heritage. Today, tourism remains an important factor for Hangzhou's economy. One of Hangzhou's most popular sights is West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The West Lake Cultural Landscape covers an area of 3,323 ha (8,210 acres) and includes some of Hangzhou's most notable historic and scenic places.

Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world.

The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China.

Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China. A new elevated airport express highway is under construction on top of the existing highway between the airport and downtown Hangzhou. The second phase of Hangzhou Metro Line 1 has a planned extension to the airport.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nHangzhou sits on the intersecting point of some of the busiest rail corridors in China. The city's main station is Hangzhou East railway station (colloquially \"East Station\" \u4e1c\u7ad9). It is one of the biggest rail traffic hubs in China, consisting of 15 platforms that house the High Speed CRH service to Shanghai, Nanjing, Changsha, Ningbo, and beyond. The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou. The Hangzhou railway station (colloquially the \"City Station\" Chinese: \u57ce\u7ad9) was closed for renovation in mid 2013 but has recently opened again.\nDirect trains link Hangzhou with more than 50 main cities, including 12 daily services to Beijing and more than 100 daily services to Shanghai; they reach as far as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi.

The service is operated by the CRH 380A(L), CRH 380B(L) and CRH380CL train sets which travel at a maximum speed of 350 km/h (220 mph), shortening the duration of the 202 km (126 mi) trip to only 45 minutes.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\nCentral (to the east of the city centre, taking the place of the former east station), north, south, and west long-distance bus stations offer frequent coach service to nearby cities/towns within Zhejiang province, as well as surrounding provinces.\n\n\n=== Public transportation ===\nHangzhou has an efficient public transportation network, consisting of a modern fleet of regular diesel bus, trolley bus, hybrid diesel-electric bus and taxi. Hangzhou is known for its extensive bus rapid transit network expanding from downtown to many suburban areas through dedicated bus lanes on some of the busiest streets in the city. Bicycles and electric scooters are very popular, and major streets have dedicated bike lanes throughout the city. Hangzhou has an extensive free public bike rental system, the Hangzhou Public Bicycle system.\n\n\n=== Metro ===\nThe first line of the Hangzhou Metro entered into service in late 2012. with major expansion plans still ongoing. It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations. In early 2011, 30 electric taxis were deployed in Hangzhou; 15 were Zotye Langyues and the other 15 were Haima Freemas. In April, however, one Zoyte Langyue caught fire, and all of the electric taxis were taken off the roads later that day. The city still intends to have a fleet of 200 electric taxis by the end of 2011. In 2014, a large number of new electric taxis produced by Xihu-BYD (Xihu (westlake) is a local company which produced televisions in the past) were deployed.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\n\n=== Universities ===\nHangzhou has a large student population with many higher education institutions based in the city.

Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

          "It was a discovery for me to see how Buddhism linked India and China. The statues are true relics over a 1000 years old. The walks are calm and zenful and one can easily spend couple of hours in this place without feeling lost :)",
          "In a beautiful natural setting on the side of the hill with a small river, the stone carvings are just amazing. The Lingyin temple is right next to the carvings. There are walking tracks through the forest and up the hill. Great place to visit. We were there on a cold say,",
          "Leave lots of time as there is SO much to see and explore here. It is very beautiful and there are thousands are carvings!",

          "Best spot in Hangzhou and it's taken me 3 months to get here. This is definitely where India meets China and gives you a good sense of the Buddhism links. The statues are true relics over a 1000 years old. Peaceful zen walk and hike with three other temples nearby. Worth",
          "The carvings in the mountain side are very impressive. Fei Lai Feng blends right into the Lingyin Temple it would be difficult to see where one ends and the other picks up if not for the ticket booth. Both are a Hangzhou Must",

          "Hangzhou is a surprising city. Its is one of the fomer capitals of China and while its name is not that famous to us, westerners (until the G20 took place there this august), it has plenty of treasures which make it really worth visiting. Fei Lai Feng and the adjoining Lingyin",
          "One of the most beautiful temples I have ever visited. I was in awe of the beauty. This temple is indescribable. All visitors to Hangzhou should come here. It is absolutely stunning! I saw it in the pouring rain and it was worth it!",
          "Enjoy this visit and amazed to see the carvings on the rocks. They are now well maintained and protected. Enjoyed the stroll around the area including a visit to the temple for a prayer or two. Worth the visit",
          "We visited during a hazy and cold December day and still thought this was a magical place. This small rocky peak is believed to have flown to Hangzhou many centuries ago and in order to keep it from flying away, they needed to carve 200 Buddhas into the rock (as the story goes).",
          "Feilai Park is set in the woods with Buddhist stone carvings along a stream and dotted with small temples. I found it more serene and charming than West Lake & probably the nicest place I visited during my short stay in Hangzhou. Worth spending a few hours there. There was no",
          "lots of sculpture of here. visit on a sunny day so u can see it clearly. If you go in winter, make sure you arrive there around 1pm so you have enough time to go up to mountain and come back down. When I get there it was already 4pm so a bit dark. And not enough time to see all",
          "Fei Lai Park area contains several temples including Lingyin, buddhist stone carvings into cliffs, and a cableway up to the mountain top. Lingyin Temple can be overwhelmed with tour groups, and my pick is Yong Fu Temple about 200 metres further on which is attractively perched",
          "This might have been the most interesting site in Hangzhou. There are a lot of these carved along a rocky hillside on the way to the temple. Worth a look for sure.",
          "It's a big park in Hangzhou, where you can visit temples and walk up the hill, among others. The most impressive is all Buddhas carved on the stones. Everywhere you look, you find one. Unfortunatelly we saw just one temple, because it was closing time, so avoid to go in the last",
          "Hired a bike and cycled here from the West Lake. Takes about 30 minutes, easy ride. 40 RMB for entry. The stone buddha carvings are very impressive as you enter. The rest of Fei Lai Feng is a bit of a walk up hill so bring some water. Give 1-2hours to see it all properly.",
          "highly recommended. The carvings on the stone are just stunning and impressive! Definitely worthy for a visit.",
          "This is definitely worth visiting if you have the time. The carvings are amazing especially considering their age.",
          "While the Temple is a pleasant Temple to visit it doesn't offer a great deal outside of the usual - but the walk in past these base relief sculptures makes a visit essential.",
          "Nice if you wanna see a bit of nature (and people if it is a national holiday) Le status on the rock are nicely done, and the place is big enough to spend a few hours there. You can get there by city bus or by walking.",
          "Very much worth. Be aware that the temple is IN the park meaning impossible to visit first the park, go for lunch and then visit temple. Other than small noodle shop inside impossible to eat. Start the visit of the park and the temple early afternoon.",
          "I visited here with group of colleagues. There are lot of carved images of Buddha and the main temple with monks. Nice place to walk around with some steps to climb and takes about 2 hours if you want to take full tour quickly. For international visitors who don't know Mandarin,",
          "Historical Facts Was founded by Indian Monk named Huili. Literally means \"Peak Flown in From A far\" because the shape, although unique in China, it was common in India.",
          "Good walk visit for watching many budas made at the walls of a small mountain. See the temple and participate with local people. nice walk.",
          "I went on a rainy day, so I could not see the temple in all its splendor and still found it very nice. Wear very comfortable shoes because you have to walk a lot and there are many stairs.",
          "The rock carvings in Fei Lai Feng are truly amazing. It is not just the realism of the carvings but the craft that allowed them to do this 800 years ago. For me, it was the best place I saw in Hangzhou and I can't imagine anyone coming here and not seeing the carvings.",
          "A great temple if you are up for another one. Nice carvings. Get there early to avoid the crowds of locals.",
          "This is our 3rd destination in city Hangzhou! The mini mountain call feilai peak is Buddhist culture many statues.... This is a temple complex from 10th century...!!",
          "The walk up from the bus is through stunning tea fields. A wade in the river is as lovely as the carvings",
          "The stone carvings are breath taking. Altough you cannot touch the smiling buddag anymore, it is still worth visiting and looking at what is left from previous generations. Also visit the temple in the Fei Lai Feng parc.",
          "You will see the rock carvings on your way from the Lingyin park entrance to the sacred Lingyin Temple. It's amazing to see so many carvings on the walls of the mountain, added gradually throughout the various historical Chinese dynasties. As the park opens at 7am, visit early",
          "You can get to this Buddhist temple complex and Fei Lai Feng mountain peak with a bus #2 (3RMB)- very convenient (the bus is air-conditioned). I loved this day out despite +36C! You buy a ticket and you can spend the whole day admiring the sculptures carved in the rock. Pity",
          "Fei Lai Fung is next to Lingyin Temple. There are lots of stone statues on the way to Lingyin Temple, the most famous one is the laughing budda built more than 1000 years ago. There are many statues and caves for photography.",
          "Buddhas everywhere carved into the stone! You can buy incense here to burn at the temple to carry your prayers to heaven.",
          "After living in Hangzhou for 3+ years, Fei Lai Feng is one of the first places I take guests and visitors. It's removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown and the West Lake tourist area. This makes it a (mostly) quiet get away depending on the season you visit. It's an easy",
          "Huge area with temples, buddha statues and natural oddities and specialities. This can get very crowded on sunny day but it's totally worth visiting. My kids liked this a lot too. It was so exciting to get into caves and see all the statues. Beware of taxi driver cartell when",
          "We visited the place on weekend. There were lots of people and it was a little crowded. We took the bus and reached the place. The place was beautiful and we had a great time in the Fei Lai Feng. Since we were new to the place and did not have Chinese speaking guide, we nearly",
          "Amazing stone carvings. You will need to go up and down many stairs around to see all stone carvings. It was great to see that the local people continue to go see this and pay tribute as they pray and touch the stones. There's also a little pond where water is running and the",

          "So impressive that we couldn't get enough. Our group of four climbed to the top of the stairs and then climbed on top of the rocks. There is a beautiful view of West Lake, the city and on the other side the mountains. We saw several young ladies in high heels. I don't know how",

          "Beautiful scenery, even tho it was a rainy day, we still had a wonderful experience, The price is reasonable and the hike to the top is an easy one. We only saw one cave probably if you walk more you may get to see others not sure... Spring was the perfect season to visit,",

          "Went there on a Sunday ( it also happened to be birthday of Goddess of Mercy ) and the traffic was horrible! Car parks are impossibly full and naturally everywhere is overflow with visitors. Can be very nice on a cool autumn morning without crowds ( very hard in China! )....",
          "You can spend a lot of time trying to find all the different tucked away carvings and statues. Although the main route is often crowded (up to lingyin temple) the crowds soon thin out as you push of the main path.",
          "This is a park in the surroundings of the Lingyin Temple. And it is worth it. The statues graven on the stone have hundreds of years and some of them are almost undamaged. Nice!",

          "Walked through on our way to the Temple. Thankfully had a guide with us who spoke English and could explain the significance of several carvings along the way. As a foreigner, I'd suggest visiting here along with the temple via an organized tour or hire a private guide. If",

          "Not sure what can I add to many previous reviews. Easy to reach by no. 7 bus for 3 RMB from NW corner of West Lake. Not as grandiose or as \"dramatically displayed\" as similar cliffside carvings near Luoyang, but still very impressive. Make sure to wear comfortable sturdy shoes",

According to 2019 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, the consolidated population of Indianapolis and Marion County was 886,220. The \"balance\" population, which excludes semi-autonomous municipalities in Marion County, was 876,384. It is the 17th most populous city in the U.S., the third-most populous city in the Midwest, after Chicago, Illinois and Columbus, Ohio, and the fourth-most populous state capitol after Phoenix, Arizona, Austin, Texas, and Columbus. The Indianapolis metropolitan area is the 33rd most populous metropolitan statistical area in the U.S., with 2,048,703 residents. Its combined statistical area ranks 28th, with a population of 2,431,361. Indianapolis covers 368 square miles (950 km2), making it the 16th largest city by land area in the U.S.\nIndigenous peoples inhabited the area dating to as early as 10000 BC. In 1818, the Delaware relinquished their tribal lands in the Treaty of St. Mary's. In 1821, Indianapolis was founded as a planned city for the new seat of Indiana's state government. The city was platted by Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham on a 1-square-mile (2.6 km2) grid next to the White River. Completion of the National and Michigan roads and arrival of rail later solidified the city's position as a manufacturing and transportation hub. Two of the city's nicknames reflect its historical ties to transportation\u2014the \"Crossroads of America\" and \"Railroad City\". Since the 1970 city-county consolidation, known as Unigov, local government administration operates under the direction of an elected 25-member city-county council headed by the mayor.\nIndianapolis anchors the 29th largest economic region in the U.S., based primarily on the sectors of finance and insurance, manufacturing, professional and business services, education and health care, government, and wholesale trade. The city has notable niche markets in amateur sports and auto racing. The city is home to three Fortune 500 companies, two professional sports clubs, four university campuses, and several museums, including the world's largest children's museum. However, the city is perhaps best known for annually hosting the world's largest single-day sporting event, the Indianapolis 500. Among the city's historic sites and districts, Indianapolis is home to the largest collection of monuments dedicated to veterans and war casualties in the U.S. outside of Washington, D.C.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Etymology ===\nThe name Indianapolis is derived from the state's name, Indiana (meaning \"Land of the Indians\", or simply \"Indian Land\"), and polis, the Greek word for \"city.\" Jeremiah Sullivan, justice of the Indiana Supreme Court, is credited with coining the name. Other names considered were Concord, Suwarrow, and Tecumseh.\n\n\n=== Founding ===\n\nIn 1816, the year Indiana gained statehood, the U.S. Congress donated four sections of federal land to establish a permanent seat of state government. Two years later, under the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818), the Delaware relinquished title to their tribal lands in central Indiana, agreeing to leave the area by 1821. This tract of land, which was called the New Purchase, included the site selected for the new state capital in 1820. The indigenous people of the land prior to systematic removal are the Miami Nation of Indiana (Miami Nation of Oklahoma) and Indianapolis makes up part of Cession 99; the primary treaty between the indigenous population and the United States was the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818).The availability of new federal lands for purchase in central Indiana attracted settlers, many of them descendants of families from northwestern Europe. Although many of these first European and American settlers were Protestants, a large proportion of the early Irish and German immigrants were Catholics. Few African Americans lived in central Indiana before 1840. The first European Americans to permanently settle in the area that became Indianapolis were either the McCormick or Pogue families. The McCormicks are generally considered to be the first permanent settlers; however, some historians believe George Pogue and family may have arrived first, on March 2, 1819, and settled in a log cabin along the creek that was later called Pogue's Run. Other historians have argued as early as 1822 that John Wesley McCormick, his family, and employees became the area's first European American settlers, settling near the White River in February 1820.On January 11, 1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital. The state legislature approved the site, adopting the name Indianapolis on January 6, 1821. In April, Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham were appointed to survey and design a town plan for the new settlement. Indianapolis became a seat of county government on December 31, 1821, when Marion County, was established. A combined county and town government continued until 1832 when Indianapolis incorporated as a town. Indianapolis became an incorporated city effective March 30, 1847. Samuel Henderson, the city's first mayor, led the new city government, which included a seven-member city council. In 1853, voters approved a new city charter that provided for an elected mayor and a fourteen-member city council. The city charter continued to be revised as Indianapolis expanded. Effective January 1, 1825, the seat of state government moved to Indianapolis from Corydon, Indiana. In addition to state government offices, a U.S. district court was established at Indianapolis in 1825.Growth occurred with the opening of the National Road through the town in 1827, the first major federally funded highway in the United States. A small segment of the ultimately failed Indiana Central Canal was opened in 1839. The first railroad to serve Indianapolis, the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, began operation in 1847, and subsequent railroad connections fostered growth. Indianapolis Union Station was the first of its kind in the world when it opened in 1853.\n\n\n=== Civil War and Gilded Age ===\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Indianapolis was mostly loyal to the Union cause. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a rallying place for Union army troops. On February 11, 1861, president-elect Lincoln arrived in the city, en route to Washington, D.C. for his presidential inauguration, marking the first visit from a president-elect in the city's history. On April 16, 1861, the first orders were issued to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis as a headquarters for the state's volunteer soldiers. Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits signed up to fight for the Union.Indianapolis became a major logistics hub during the war, establishing the city as a crucial military base. Between 1860 and 1870, the city's population more than doubled. An estimated 4,000 men from Indianapolis served in 39 regiments, and an estimated 700 died during the war. On May 20, 1863, Union soldiers attempted to disrupt a statewide Democratic convention at Indianapolis, forcing the proceedings to be adjourned, sarcastically referred to as the Battle of Pogue's Run. Fear turned to panic in July 1863, during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but Confederate forces turned east toward Ohio, never reaching Indianapolis. On April 30, 1865, Lincoln's funeral train made a stop at Indianapolis, where an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 people passed the assassinated president's bier at the Indiana Statehouse.Following the Civil War\u2014and in the wake of the Second Industrial Revolution\u2014Indianapolis experienced tremendous growth and prosperity. In 1880, Indianapolis was the world's third largest pork packing city, after Chicago and Cincinnati, and the second largest railroad center in the United States by 1888. By 1890, the city's population surpassed 100,000. Some of the city's most notable businesses were founded during this period of growth and innovation, including L. S. Ayres (1872), Eli Lilly and Company (1876), Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company (1910), and Allison Transmission (1915). Once home to 60 automakers, Indianapolis rivaled Detroit as a center of automobile manufacturing. The city was an early focus of labor organization. The Indianapolis Street Car Strike of 1913 and subsequent police mutiny and riots led to the creation of the state's earliest labor-protection laws, including a minimum wage, regular work weeks, and improved working conditions. The International Typographical Union and United Mine Workers of America were among several influential labor unions based in the city.\n\n\n=== Progressive Era to World War II ===\n\nSome of the city's most prominent architectural features and best known historical events date from the turn of the 20th century. The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, dedicated on May 15, 1902, would later become the city's unofficial symbol. Ray Harroun won the inaugural running of the Indianapolis 500, held May 30, 1911, at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Indianapolis was one of the hardest hit cities in the Great Flood of 1913, resulting in five known deaths and the displacement of 7,000 families.\n\n\n=== Post-World War II ===\n\nAs a stop on the Underground Railroad, Indianapolis had a higher black population than any other city in the Northern States, until the Great Migration. Led by D. C. Stephenson, the Indiana Klan became the most powerful political and social organization in Indianapolis from 1921 through 1928, controlling City Council and the Board of School Commissioners, among others. At its height, more than 40% of native-born white males in Indianapolis claimed membership in the Klan. While campaigning in the city in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy delivered one of the most lauded speeches in 20th century American history, following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. As in most U.S. cities during the Civil Rights Movement, the city experienced strained race relations. A 1971 federal court decision forcing Indianapolis Public Schools to implement desegregation busing proved controversial.Under the mayoral administration of Richard Lugar, the city and county governments restructured, consolidating most public services into a new entity called Unigov. The plan removed bureaucratic redundancies, captured increasingly suburbanizing tax revenue, and created a Republican political machine that dominated Indianapolis politics until the 2000s decade. Unigov went into effect on January 1, 1970, increasing the city's land area by 308.2 square miles (798 km2) and population by 268,366 people. It was the first major city-county consolidation to occur in the United States without a referendum since the creation of the City of Greater New York in 1898.Amid the changes in government and growth, the city invested in an aggressive strategy to brand Indianapolis as a sports tourism destination, known as the Indianapolis Project. Under the administration of the city's longest-serving mayor, William Hudnut (1976\u20131992), millions of dollars were poured into sport facilities and public relations campaigns as part of an economic development strategy. The strategy was successful in landing the U.S. Olympic Festival in 1983, securing the 1984 relocation of the NFL Baltimore Colts, and hosting the 1987 Pan American Games.\n\n\n=== Modern Indianapolis ===\nEconomic development initiatives focused on revitalizing the city's downtown continued in the 1990s under the mayoral administration of Stephen Goldsmith. During this period, a number of cultural amenities were completed at White River State Park, the Canal Walk continued development, Circle Centre Mall was completed, and new sports venues (Victory Field and Bankers Life Fieldhouse) were opened. In 1999, several cultural districts were designated to capitalize on cultural assets within historically significant neighborhoods unique to the city's heritage as a means to promote continued economic development.During the 2000s, the city invested heavily in infrastructure projects, including two of the largest building projects in the city's history: the $1.1 billion Indianapolis International Airport Colonel H. Weir Cook Terminal and $720 million Lucas Oil Stadium, both opened in 2008. A $275 million expansion of the Indiana Convention Center was completed in 2011. Construction began that year on DigIndy, a $1.9 billion project to correct the city's combined sewer overflows by 2025. Rapid transit was reintroduced to Indianapolis with the opening of IndyGo's $96 million Red Line bus rapid transit project in 2019.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nIndianapolis is in the East North Central region of the Midwestern United States, in central Indiana. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Indianapolis (balance) encompasses a total area of 368.2 square miles (954 km2), of which 361.5 square miles (936 km2) is land and 6.7 square miles (17 km2) is water. The consolidated city boundaries are coterminous with Marion County, with the exception of the autonomous municipalities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, Southport, and Speedway. Indianapolis is the 16th largest city by land area in the U.S.\nIndianapolis is within the Tipton Till Plain, a flat to gently sloping terrain underlain by glacial deposits known as till. The lowest point in the city is about 650 feet (198 m) above mean sea level, with the highest natural elevation at about 900 feet (274 m) above sea level. Few hills or short ridges, known as kames, rise about 100 feet (30 m) to 130 feet (40 m) above the surrounding terrain. The city lies just north of the Indiana Uplands, a region characterized by rolling hills and high limestone content. The city is also within the EPA's Eastern Corn Belt Plains ecoregion, an area of the U.S. known for its fertile agricultural land.Topographic relief slopes gently toward the White River and its two primary tributaries, Fall and Eagle creeks. In total, there are about 35 streams in the city, including Indian Creek and Pogue's Run. Major bodies of water include Indian Lake, Geist Reservoir, and Eagle Creek Reservoir.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\nIndianapolis is a planned city. On January 11, 1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital, appointing Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham to survey and design a town plan for Indianapolis. Ralston had been a surveyor for the French architect Pierre L'Enfant, assisting him with the plan for Washington, D.C. Ralston's original plan for Indianapolis called for a town of 1 square mile (2.6 km2), near the confluence of the White River and Fall Creek.The plan, known as the Mile Square, is bounded by East, West, North, and South streets, centered on a traffic circle, called Monument Circle (originally Governor's Circle), from which Indianapolis's \"Circle City\" nickname originated. Four diagonal streets radiated a block from Monument Circle: Massachusetts, Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana avenues. The city's address numbering system begins at the intersection of Washington and Meridian streets. Before its submersion into a sanitary tunnel, Pogue's Run was included into the plan, disrupting the rectilinear street grid to the southeast.\nNoted as one of the finest examples of the City Beautiful movement design in the United States, the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza Historic District began construction in 1921 in downtown Indianapolis. The district, a National Historic Landmark, encompasses several examples of neoclassical architecture, including the American Legion, Central Library, and Birch Bayh Federal Building and United States Courthouse. The district is also home to several sculptures and memorials, Depew Memorial Fountain, and open space, hosting many annual civic events.After completion of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, an ordinance was passed in 1905 restricting building heights on the traffic circle to 86 ft (26 m) to protect views of the 284 ft (87 m) monument. The ordinance was revised in 1922, permitting buildings to rise to 108 ft (33 m), with an additional 42 ft (13 m) allowable with a series of setbacks. A citywide height restriction ordinance was instituted in 1912, barring structures over 200 ft (61 m). Completed in 1962, the City-County Building was the first skyscraper in the city, surpassing the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in height by nearly 100 ft (30 m). A building boom, lasting from 1982 to 1990, saw the construction of six of the city's ten tallest buildings. The tallest is Salesforce Tower, completed in 1990 at 811 ft (247 m). Indiana limestone is the signature building material in Indianapolis, widely included in the city's many monuments, churches, academic, government, and civic buildings.Compared with similar-sized American cities, Indianapolis is unique in that it contains some 200 farms covering thousands of acres of agricultural land within its municipal boundaries. Equestrian farms and corn and soybean fields interspersed with suburban development are commonplace on the city's periphery, especially in Franklin Township. The stark contrast between Indianapolis's urban neighborhoods and rural villages is a result of the 1970 city-county consolidation, which expanded the city's incorporated boundary to be coterminous with Marion County.\n\n\n=== Neighborhoods ===\n\nThe city is divided into 99 community areas for statistical purposes, though many smaller neighborhoods exist within them. \nIndianapolis's neighborhoods are often difficult to define because the city lacks historical ethnic divisions, as in Chicago, or physical boundaries, seen in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. Instead, most neighborhoods are subtle in their distinctions. The Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission recognizes several neighborhoods as historic districts, including: Central Court, Chatham Arch, Golden Hill, Herron-Morton Place, Lockerbie Square, Old Northside, Old Southside and Oliver Johnson's Woods. Expansion of the interurban system at the turn of the 20th century facilitated growth of several streetcar suburbs, including Broad Ripple, Irvington, University Heights, and Woodruff Place.The post\u2013World War II economic expansion and subsequent suburbanization had a profound impact on the physical development of the city's neighborhoods. From 1950 to 1970, 97,000 housing units were built in Marion County. Most of this new construction occurred outside Center Township, expediting out-migration from the city's urban neighborhoods to suburban areas, such as Castleton, Eagledale, and Nora. Between 1950 and 1990, over 155,000 residents left Center Township, resulting in urban blight and disinvestment. Since the 2000s, Downtown Indianapolis and surrounding neighborhoods have seen increased reinvestment attributed to nationwide demographic trends, driven by empty nesters and millennials. By 2020, Downtown is projected to have 30,000 residential units, compared to 18,300 in 2010.Renewed interest in urban living has been met with some dispute regarding gentrification and affordable housing. According to a Center for Community Progress report, neighborhoods like Cottage Home and Fall Creek Place have experienced measurable gentrification since 2000. The North Meridian Street Historic District is among the most affluent urban neighborhoods in the U.S., with a mean household income of $102,599 in 2017.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nIndianapolis has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfa), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfa) using the \u22123 \u00b0C (27 \u00b0F) isotherm. It experiences four distinct seasons. The city is in USDA hardiness zone 6a.Typically, summers are hot, humid and wet. Winters are generally cold with moderate snowfall. The July daily average temperature is 75.4 \u00b0F (24.1 \u00b0C). High temperatures reach or exceed 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) an average of 18 days each year, and occasionally exceed 95 \u00b0F (35 \u00b0C). Spring and autumn are usually pleasant, if at times unpredictable; midday temperature drops exceeding 30 \u00b0F or 17 \u00b0C are common during March and April, and instances of very warm days (80 \u00b0F or 27 \u00b0C) followed within 36 hours by snowfall are not unusual during these months. Winters are cold, with an average January temperature of 28.1 \u00b0F (\u22122.2 \u00b0C). Temperatures dip to 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) or below an average of 4.7 nights per year.The rainiest months occur in the spring and summer, with slightly higher averages during May, June, and July. May is typically the wettest, with an average of 5.05 inches (12.8 cm) of precipitation. Most rain is derived from thunderstorm activity; there is no distinct dry season, although occasional droughts occur. Severe weather is not uncommon, particularly in the spring and summer months; the city experiences an average of 20 thunderstorm days annually.The city's average annual precipitation is 42.4 inches (108 cm), with snowfall averaging 25.9 inches (66 cm) per season. Official temperature extremes range from 106 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C), set on July 14, 1936, to \u221227 \u00b0F (\u221233 \u00b0C), set on January 19, 1994.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau considers Indianapolis as two entities: the consolidated city and the city's remainder, or balance. The consolidated city is coterminous with Marion County, except the independent municipalities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, Southport, and Speedway. The city's balance excludes the populations of ten semi-autonomous municipalities that are included in totals for the consolidated city. These are Clermont, Crows Nest, Homecroft, Meridian Hills, North Crows Nest, Rocky Ripple, Spring Hill, Warren Park, Williams Creek, and Wynnedale. An eleventh town, Cumberland, is partially included. As of 2018, the city's estimated consolidated population was 876,862 and its balance was 867,125. As of 2010, the city's population density was 2,270 people per square mile (880/km2). Indianapolis is the most populous city in Indiana, containing nearly 13% of the state's total population.The Indianapolis metropolitan area, officially the Indianapolis\u2013Carmel\u2013Anderson metropolitan statistical area (MSA), consists of Marion County and the surrounding counties of Boone, Brown, Hamilton, Hancock, Hendricks, Johnson, Madison, Morgan, Putnam, and Shelby. As of 2018, the metropolitan area's population was 2,048,703, the most populous in Indiana and home to 30% of the state's residents. With a population of 2,431,361, the larger Indianapolis\u2013Carmel\u2013Muncie combined statistical area (CSA) covers 18 counties, home to 36% of Indiana residents. Indianapolis is also situated within the Great Lakes Megalopolis, the largest of 11 megaregions in the U.S.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census of 2010, 97.2% of the Indianapolis population was reported as one race: 61.8% White, 27.5% Black or African American, 2.1% Asian (0.4% Burmese, 0.4% Indian, 0.3% Chinese, 0.3% Filipino, 0.1% Korean, 0.1% Vietnamese, 0.1% Japanese, 0.1% Thai, 0.1% other Asian); 0.3% American Indian, and 5.5% as other. The remaining 2.8% of the population was reported as multiracial (two or more races). The city's Hispanic or Latino community comprised 9.4% of the city's population in the 2010 U.S. Census: 6.9% Mexican, 0.4% Puerto Rican, 0.1% Cuban, and 2% as other.As of 2010, the median age for Indianapolis was 33.7 years. Age distribution for the city's inhabitants was 25% under the age of 18; 4.4% were between 18 and 21; 16.3% were age 21 to 65; and 13.1% were age 65 or older. For every 100 females, there were 93 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90 males.The U.S. Census for 2010 reported 332,199 households in Indianapolis, with an average household size of 2.42 and an average family size of 3.08. Of the total households, 59.3% were family households, with 28.2% of these including the family's own children under the age of 18; 36.5% were husband-wife families; 17.2% had a female householder (with no husband present) and 5.6% had a male householder (with no wife present). The remaining 40.7% were non-family households. As of 2010, 32% of the non-family households included individuals living alone, 8.3% of these households included individuals age 65 years of age or older.The U.S. Census Bureau's 2007\u20132011 American Community Survey indicated the median household income for Indianapolis city was $42,704, and the median family income was $53,161. Median income for males working full-time, year-round, was $42,101, compared to $34,788 for females. Per capita income for the city was $24,430, 14.7% of families and 18.9% of the city's total population living below the poverty line (28.3% were under the age of 18 and 9.2% were age 65 or older).As of 2015, the Indianapolis metropolitan area had the 18th highest percentage of LGBT residents in the U.S., with 4.2% of residents identifying as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nOf the 42.42% of the city's residents who identify as religious, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, at 11.31%. The second highest religious group in the city are Baptists at 10.31%, with Methodists following behind at 4.97%. Presbyterians make up 2.13% of the city's religiously affiliated population, followed by Pentecostals and Lutherans. Another 8.57% are affiliated with other Christian faiths. 0.32% of religiously affiliated persons identified themselves as following Eastern religions, while 0.68% of the religiously affiliated population identified as Jewish, and 0.29% as Muslim. According to the nonpartisan and nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute's American Values Atlas, 22% of residents identify as religiously \"unaffiliated,\" consistent with the national average of 22.7%.Indianapolis is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis. Joseph W. Tobin, C.Ss.R., served as archbishop from 2012 to 2017 and was elevated to cardinal in November 2016. On June 13, 2017, Pope Francis announced Charles C. Thompson would replace Tobin, who was reassigned to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark in January 2017. Thompson is the youngest American archbishop. The archdiocese also operates Bishop Simon Brut\u00e9 College Seminary, affiliated with Marian University, while the Christian Theological Seminary is affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).\nIndianapolis is the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis, based from Christ Church Cathedral. The Indiana-Kentucky Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Indiana Conference of the United Methodist Church are also based in the city.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nIn 2015, the Indianapolis metropolitan area had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $134 billion. The top five industries were: finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing ($30.7B), manufacturing ($30.1B), professional and business services ($14.3B), educational services, health care, and social assistance ($10.8B), and wholesale trade ($8.1B). Government, if it had been a private industry, would have ranked fifth, generating $10.2 billion.Compared to Indiana as a whole, the Indianapolis metropolitan area has a lower proportion of manufacturing jobs and a higher concentration of jobs in wholesale trade; administrative, support, and waste management; professional, scientific, and technical services; and transportation and warehousing. The city's major exports include pharmaceuticals, motor vehicle parts, medical equipment and supplies, engine and power equipment, and aircraft products and parts. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the region's unemployment rate was 2.8 percent in May 2019.As of 2020, three Fortune 500 companies were based in the city: health insurance company Anthem Inc. (33); pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly (123); and Simon Property Group (496), the largest real estate investment trust in the U.S. Columbus, Indiana-based Cummins (128) opened its Global Distribution Headquarters in downtown Indianapolis in 2017. The city is home to three Fortune 1000 companies: hydrocarbon manufacturer Calumet Specialty Products Partners (604); automotive transmission manufacturer Allison Transmission (890); and retailer Finish Line (972). Other companies based in the Indianapolis metropolitan area include: real estate investment trust Duke Realty; media conglomerate Emmis Communications; retailer Lids; financial services holding company OneAmerica; airline holding company Republic Airways; contract research corporation Envigo; and fast food chains Noble Roman's and Steak 'n Shake.\nLike many Midwestern cities, recent deindustrialization trends have had a significant impact on the local economy. Once home to 60 automakers, Indianapolis rivaled Detroit as a center of automobile manufacturing in the early 20th century. Between 1990 and 2012, approximately 26,900 manufacturing jobs were lost in the city, including the automotive plant closures of Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. In 2016, Carrier Corporation announced the closure of its Indianapolis plant, moving 1,400 manufacturing jobs to Mexico. Since 1915, Rolls-Royce Holdings has had operations in Indianapolis. It is the third largest manufacturing employer and thirteenth largest employer overall in the city, with a workforce of 4,300 in aircraft engine development and manufacturing.Biotechnology, life sciences, and healthcare are major sectors of Indianapolis's economy. As of 2016, Eli Lilly and Company was the largest private employer in the city, with more than 11,000 workers. Other notable life sciences employers include Corteva, Covance, and Roche Diagnostics. A 2014 report by the Battelle Memorial Institute and Biotechnology Industry Organization indicated that the Indianapolis\u2013Carmel\u2013Anderson MSA was the only U.S. metropolitan area to have specialized employment concentrations in all five bioscience sectors evaluated in the study: agricultural feedstock and chemicals; bioscience-related distribution; drugs and pharmaceuticals; medical devices and equipment; and research, testing, and medical laboratories. The regional healthcare providers of Community Health Network, Eskenazi Health, Franciscan Health, Indiana University Health, and St. Vincent Health have a combined workforce of 43,700.The city's central location and extensive highway and rail infrastructure have positioned Indianapolis as an important logistics center, home to 1,500 distribution firms employing some 100,000 workers. As home to the second largest FedEx Express hub in the world, Indianapolis International Airport ranks as the sixth busiest U.S. airport in terms of air cargo transport, handling over 1 million tons and employing 6,600 in 2015. Indianapolis is a hub for CSX Transportation, home to its division headquarters, an intermodal terminal, and classification yard (in the suburb of Avon). Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops, in the enclave of Beech Grove, serve as its primary heavy maintenance and overhaul facility, while the Indianapolis Distribution Center is the company's largest material and supply terminal.The hospitality industry is an increasingly vital sector to the Indianapolis economy. According to Visit Indy, 28.8 million visitors generated $5.4 billion in 2017, the seventh straight year of record growth. Indianapolis has long been a sports tourism destination, but has more recently relied on conventions. The Indiana Convention Center (ICC) and Lucas Oil Stadium are considered mega convention center facilities, with a combined 750,000 square feet (70,000 m2) of exhibition space. ICC is connected to 12 hotels and 4,700 hotel rooms, the most of any U.S. convention center. Since 2003, Indianapolis has hosted Gen Con, one of the largest gaming conventions in North America.According to real estate tracking firm CBRE Group, Indianapolis ranks among the fastest high-tech job growth areas in the U.S. The metropolitan area is home to 28,500 information technology-related jobs at such companies as Angie's List, Appirio, Formstack, Genesys, Hubstaff, Infosys, Ingram Micro, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud.Major shopping malls in the city include Castleton Square, Circle Centre, The Fashion Mall at Keystone, Glendale Town Center, Lafayette Square, and Washington Square.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Visual arts ===\n\nFounded in 1883, the Indianapolis Museum of Art (IMA) is the ninth oldest and eighth largest encyclopedic art museum in the U.S. The permanent collection has over 54,000 works, including African, American, Asian, and European pieces. In addition to its collections, the Newfields campus consists of The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art & Nature Park: 100 Acres; Oldfields, a restored house museum and estate once owned by Josiah K. Lilly, Jr.; and restored gardens and grounds originally designed by Percival Gallagher of the Olmsted Brothers firm. The IMA also owns the Miller House, a Mid-century modern home designed by Eero Saarinen in Columbus, Indiana. The museum's holdings demonstrate the institution's emphasis on the connections among art, design, and the natural environment.The Indianapolis Art Center, in Broad Ripple Village, was founded in 1934 by the Works Project Administration.

          "We were lucky to see this as it was only available 7 days before our arrival this Springtime. Designed by the award winning movie-director Zhang Yimou and was first showcased to many G20 world leaders in 2016, the show employed the clever mix of laser, lights, multi-media,",
          "After G20 Summit, I believed that Impression westlake has been known to all the people who watch the evening show. I watched this show last year with some of my customers who came from Canada, Apr ,May, Sep, Oct are the better time to watch this show, summer is a little bit hot",
          "Worth every cent of the ticket price. Worth queuing to get in. It rained and we were handed ponchos. Zhang Yimou is really great in directing. As the crowd dispersed, it was almost impossible to get a taxi. We had to use a black market car but I was ok at negotiating so price",

          "The west lake is beatiful, you can go by day and take a boat trip or you can go by night and you can see the water show. A perfect place to take a break.",
          "Recommended to us by fellow travelers, this show did not disappoint. We booked a car to drop us off and pick us up to avoid the crowds and taxi lines mentioned in so many of the reviews. Suggest you hang behind and let the crowds race out of the stands to avoid being caught in",

          "Rather disjointed story line so not always understanding what you are seeing. Opening number was beautiful with the boats but the rest was just OK. We paid for VIP seats,WRONG! Not worth the expense. We see wonderful shows and theatre so maybe a little jaded. 1 person out of",
          "The show was truly impressive- a platform was built 5 inches below the surface of the lake and it is on the platform the actors portray the story of West Lake with beautiful lighting and music. Put your camera away as it is nearly impossible to get reasonable photographs in the",
          "Like other review.. you must see this if you visit Hangzhou.. it is worth every penny. The show was so breathtaking.. I was so afraid to miss the story when I had to go to the toilet at the time hahaha... It was a bit drizzling at the time and the guys at the ticket entrance",
          "directed by the man who was the director of the Olympics Games in 2008 Beijing, impressed by the combination of music and lighting, the story itself is not that touching since there's no lyrics or words shown",
          "This breathtaking performance was the highlight of our trip to China. A cast of 250 dances a legend in the water of West Lake, on partially- submerged stages, to the enchanting music of Kitaro. Changing coloured lights illuminate the trees and pagoda in the background. Lotuses,",
          "Treated my Chinese colleague to this show as, although he'd been to West lake many times, he'd not heard of it. He started explaining the story to me but then went quiet as he was totally transfixed by it all. We had the cheap seats and were perfect. Well worth the money.",
          "As a world famous tourist attractions, West-Lake have not only the charming sceneries but also many touched legends. And that is what makes it so special to Chinese. When we talked about the legends about West-Lake, it is hard not to mention <<The Legend Of White Snake>>.",
          "The whole area was like a Colonial garden and experience, another time and space from the fascinating allure of the French British Bund!",
          "It was pouring rain and we felt like fools sitting in the rain with the poncho provided, but all was forgotten when the show started. By far the best thing to do in West Lake",
          "Reading all the reviews I can only add my endorsement of this wonderful show. It was breathtaking. We had reserved seats and perhaps VIP I had my view slightly obscured by a tree and could not see the full area. Even with that no complaints. This is a MUST DO!!",
          "Designed by the team that created the opening ceremony to the Beijing Olympic Games, this combination of dance performance, court, and light show captures the story of forbidden love and the lengths people will go to requiet it. The breezier the night, the more fantastic the",
          "It is a must-see when you are in the West Lake area. The lights, music and acts were brilliantly brought together. The show is a feast for the eyes, heart and mind. We were spellbound from the moment the performance started. We dare not move a muscle or blink our eyes as we do",
          "The riot of colors and sound of music... All blending into a fantastic symphony.. If you are in hangzhou.. Do see the show... Can be a bit tricky to get to.. If you don't speak chinese. But our hotel booked a taxi for us in advance.. It was all just perfect..",
          "We enjoyed the Impression Westlake Show and thought it was World Class. The acrobats are wonderful and the finale with the motorbikes in a circular type cage was really amazing. I can thoroughly recommend the show.",
          "A spectacular on water 100's of performers float on and in water of West Lake with natural backdrop of hills, greenery of Hangzhou. Based on Chinese stories of the landmarks of West Lake. Fusion of old and new China in performance. Conceived and by famed Beijing Olympics",
          "From the opening of the show, we were all memerised and astounded .. On a stage a few inches under the waters surface,hundreds of actors dancing , moving in unison.. The lighting is spectacular, using the natural scenery / trees .. the logistics/ effects of framework rising out",
          "This was the second time I have seen this show. The first time we splashed out for top seats that were a complete waste of $$. This time we took middle price and they were actually better. Getting first row would be better though as we had very chatty Chinese distraction behind",
          "This show is worth the cost. If the weather is not so great - rain or cold- the VIP seats are great. The only objection is the lenghth of the performance. After a while it looses spectaluraity. It is still worth going to. Hundreds of actors dancing on the lake (on a platform a",
          "Have seen lots of these shows - cirque du soliel and other zhang yimou ones but this one was an experience all of its own. The start of the show's literally breathtaking. There are bits of the show that's ordinary but all in all, when in Hangzhou, Impression Westlake's a",
          "This is a series of three short Chinese plays acted out in a very modern style on a lake. The stage is an inch or so below the water surface so the performers appear to be walking on water. A lot of modern choreography and a large number of performers. To me as a westerner there",
          "At the start wow, its built up so much and the effects were great. However by the end of the third act nobody really applauded as it just fizzled out and then before we knew it the whole play was over. Very short considering people pay 250 rmb per seat for a 55 minute show tops.",
          "This show was designed by famed director Zhang YiMou. It's a great way to spend an evening in Hangzhou. This show is staged on a stage set in the waters of the West Lake. It's about 70 minutes long and entirely in Chinese. Even though I don't speak a word, the story is pretty",
          "The entry to the show pavilion is across Beishan Road opposite the Temple of Yue Fei - not where Google maps indicates. The show started at 7:45pm and lasted for about 1 hour. All 5 acts were spectacular with regards to the lighting, artistic composition and technology, that",
          "The difference between the cheapest and most expensive tickets is negligible. Taxi drivers are scabs there and refuse to use their meters (against Chinese law), make sure you know which bus (and where to catch it) will take you home, or be prepared to get ripped off by taxi",
          "Its really a must see for anybody going to Hangzhou. What a performance by artists. Really very very impressive combination of technology, lights, music and skill of artists. I will definitely see it again whenever I get chance.",
          "We went to the early show- which was almost full to capacity. It is outside and goes ahead even in the rain, as you are provided with a hooded rain coat. It really is a magical and spectacular show. Very gentle and slow moving with beautiful lighting effects and music. Be",
          "This is an impressive show and I would highly recommend it! For Westerners unfamiliar with the story, you should do some research first. The lights and choreography were spectacular. Be sure to dress warmly for colder months - including gloves, scarves and hats. Keeping warm",
          "It's my third time to watch a show of \"Impression Series\" so nothing seems to be surprising. Many techniques have been used in other shows one way or another so they all look familiar. If it's your first time to watch such \"Impression\" show, you would like it.",
          "The location is right opposite the yue-fei temple, and it has 2 shows (730pm and 915pm) both lasting about 50min. Traveling there was easy, but getting out of the place to return to hotel will be a BIG challenge since there are many visitors and taxis are few. We booked the",
          "I had not heard about this show, but when I saw in my hotel that it was directed by Zhang Yimou, China's most opulent film director, visually, I simply had to go, no questions asked. And the visuals were truly impressive, especially the mass scenes. Some left me simply",
          "I knew we would see the Impression West Lake show during our December overnight stay in Hangzhou. The question about where to sit was perplexing as I coud not find a good description or photos of the indoor seating on the boat. The boat has seating upstairs and downstairs. Since",
          "It was great to have been told the story ahead of time by our English translator so that we understood what was happening. The show itself takes place on the lake and the lighting and props are amazing.",
          "Amazing experience,perfect music,lights,dance and show on lake.It doesnt matter that it is in chineese because you will understand everything and although it is a love story(which i normally hate to watch) its fantastic.I was wondering myself is it really worth my time and",
          "You can see different scence in different season. But each one is beautiful. I alwanys go to visit westlake but I will choose the place which is not popular for the visitors.",
          "Wow! What and amazing show and experience.  There's much to say, but others have said almost all to say so I'll keep on short side and touch on highlights.   Let's start with basics. Was in Hangzhou with my family for three nights and two full days and did not know when would",
          "A visit to hangzhou must see impression westlake. The story is simple enough but the music and dance is just breathtaking. Perfect way to know more about the beloved lake..",
          "The \"Impression Westlake\" is a beautiful show. I loved how the whole story was reflected by the lake's water and how it seemed like the performers were walking, running and dancing on the water. The colors are amazing, the music is beautiful and the water catches a great place",
          "This is a must see for anyone who is in Hangzhou. Thought the story line is simple but the whole show is enchanting. Music by Kitaro give a very mythical feel. Vocals from Jane Zhang is purely angelic. The way the play with the lighting is magical. The 90mins show just went by",
          "We arrived Hangzhou on Xmas day...leisurely explored West lake for few hours. We walked for quite a long while before reaching a shop selling souvenirs...not knowingly we were right beside one of the entrance to Impression West lake. I remembered seeing great reviews of this",
          "As expected from Zhang Yimou, Impression Westlake is a feast for your sensors. From the first act to the last act, the touching storyline was told through a flowing choregraph performed over West Lake. It was breathtaking to see West Lake changed at night, and be prepared for a",
          "Impression west lake is actually one of the five impressions that are broadcasting across china. It's about 250- 600 rmb price range. Different prices comes different seatings and view and services. Definitely go to see it when you are in hangzhou wether if you are on a",
          "This fabulous show, put on by the producer of the 2008 Beijing opening ceremony, is spectacular. We were lucky enough to have our guide tell us the story, so we could better follow the show. Just beautiful",
          "Wonderful show and no one visiting Hangzhou should missed it. However, it was very cold in December. December is off-peak and there isn't much tourist. Thus, you can afford to buy the ticket on the actual day when the temperature is much higher, especially if you are getting the",
          "Loved it... Great show, music light, perfect for family and romantic diner out... Make sure you have warm clothe",
          "The first few minutes had me guessing if it was an actual person I was looking at or if it was a clever projection of lights to make it look as though a person was gliding on the lake. We were enthralled throughout the show and that says a lot for a person with a short attention",
          "This is worth watching! i don't think you could find a show like this anywhere else. It shows culture of the Chinese through this show. Its worth watching. No need to buy front row tickets or VIP. All the seats are generally in the same area.",
          "this is a great show to impress westlake..know the thousand years most popular histories on the place that i visited. i love the show...",
          "Find a Chinese who want to speak English and walk around the lake. The Chinese are incredibly friendly and helpful.",
          "West Lake has a great history, and is worth a visit, but during a very foggy day there is not much to see for westerners. The public toilets are about what you would expect in a high traffic area. Not too satisfactory for the women in our group.",
          "Although it's expensive for a 1-hour show, it is worth watching. There is no real storyline but the movements, lightings and coordination made it worth.",
          "We stayed at the nearby Four Seasons and were not familiar with this show until we saw it featured on the in-room TV. The concierge suggested we go with such finality it was impossible to do otherwise. We were thrilled we did! Seats on the covered boat viewing area were",
          "This is a must see attraction in Hangzhou. Its not cheap but I still believe it is worth its admission price. It would also help to read up on its story before watching the show to have some subtext on the performance. Story aside, the performance was great as the stage was a",
          "It's a lovely expanse of lake water, with fung shui buildings in the distance, on a strip of land; and an occasional Chinese boat. The walkway beside the lake, had vendors selling inferior fresh-water pearl necklaces. We were there in May 2000 (not 2012 The drop-down menu is",
          "Excellent production and I was in awe the entire time. Loved how the lake was used to stage this production. The choreography and stage works were excellent. The use of water during the performance is something not to be missed. As the music was by Kitaro, it was fantastic.",
          "It is good to have buggies going round. when tired , jump on one and pay RMB 10, for a quarter distance.",
          "The dance is nice, the arrangement is superb, with the perfect song! I will definitely recommend to everyone to Westlake! Just that the ticket is a bit expensive.",
          "A transport in fantasy and art. The best artistic performance I have ever witnessed. This is a dont miss ocassion.",
          "It has a long history and the different parts of the lake offer a glimpse into its history. A bird's eye view on top of another tourist attraction, Leifeng Pagoda, is breath taking.",
          "Beautifully staged and acted with gorgeous costumes. make syre that you buy the VIP seats in the stands, not on the boat.",
          "This was a beautiful show from start to finish. The lights, the music, the costumes, the sets... it was all more than I thought it would be. A true must-see if you are in the area. Wonderful!",
          "I had low expectations for this show, but was surprised by how much effort the performers clearly put into it. The water effects are nothing special, but the lighting is pretty good and the use of the lake as a stage is certainly not something you see every day.",
          "great acoustics & outstanding stage-set. Music by Japanese Kitaro is astounding! What I disliked is the terrible snack offered to those of us who paid quite a large sum for the VIP seats@ RMB 600.",
          "I went with not much expectations and we bought the tickets through the hotel's concierge. Tried to collect tickets at about 3 pm as I was near the impressions venue. But as it was too early, the tickets weren't ready. So don't go too early to collect the tickets. Anytime after",
          "We had an enjoyable and entertaining evening viewing the Impression light show. I knew the story and enjoyed the performance.I felt that the lighting was excellent and the venue unique.The performers lacked the precision to make this into an excellent production-perhaps they",
          "The West Lake Impressions show was the absolute HIGHLIGHT of our 6 day trip in China. The show was amazing and beautifully done. If I had it to do over again, I would have stayed in Hangzhou more days and probably saw this show at least twice.",
          "The show was spectacular. Do not book the expensive seats as the cheapest seats (250RMB) actually have the best views.",
          "The show is simply amazing. The music is fantastic and really its a show that you need to see once in a lifetime. Coloured and exceptionally well done. Its something special and the staff is extremely professional. Dancing and acting on the water lake . Really it was a big",
          "My friends and I missed the first 10 min of the show due to heavy traffic during the national holiday. Still we were all amazed by the spectacular performance.",
          "This show is really worth watching. Even though it was raining on the night that we went, we enjoyed it very much. It left us with a great impression! The performance was done on the lake and the sounds and lights effects were really good. It is a great way to spend your",
          "The Impression at West Lake was a magnificient show of Lights and Colour by Zhang Yimou. It tells the story of a couple and their struggles. The dances were pretty impressive, as if they were walking on water. A must-see for everyone who visits Hangzhou.",
          "For a show that ran for a decade and still wow audiences (even when watching a second time) this is worth the ticket.",
          "A unique show of dance, culture and lighting on the water of West Lake. Think Beijing Olympic opening ceremony in miniature but on the surface of a lake. Seats on one of the floating platforms have a slightly better view but any seat on the lake is good",
          "Sound and light showon the lake with numerous special effects. A very pleasant way to spend an hour in the evening if the weather cooperates.",
          "This show was devised and is directed by Zhang Yimou the same guy who did the opening and closing ceremonies for the Beijing Olypics in 2008 . It is simply beautifully produced. The show is presented on the lake - the stage is a few centimeters under the water. The lighting",
          "We loved this show. We weren't sure what to expect, and we were absolutely delighted to see this show, and if you're going to Hangzhou, definitely not to be missed. It did not matter that we could not understand the songs, the acting and the performance told the story itself.",
          "i booked the ticket from the sofitel hotel's business center, they help me to book a very nice angle for the show, it;s near the water to enjoy the wonderful show better. really worth tp see. very traditional, exquisite and moving.",
          "agree with most of the reviews here, this open air dance, music, and laser show on the lake is amazing. the performers were as if standing on the surface of the lake. bought our normal seats ticket at the tourist information centre in front of Leifeng pagoda 3hours before the",
          "if you ever find yourself in hangzhou, china, do not, i repeat, do not, miss the chance to watch this west lake impression. i went for a walk around this beautiful lake in the day time so i was completely surprised to see it became a giant stage in the night time. with a",
          "An open-air show on the water off a bank of the north-western part of Hangzhou's West Lake. The show skillfully combines colourful classical chinese-opera costumes, basic chinese-opera steps and gestures, a motor-propelled boat looking like a two-storey house of a wealthy",
          "Autumn is the best, Summer is too hot, Spring is humid, Winter is too cold, but I still love this place. Do stay around the lake, early morning lake is perfect, don't visit the city, you will waste your time in traffic, just find a place to stay and have a glass of Longjin tea.",
          "Even though I enjoyed the Impression show in Lijiang more the Westlake show was still entertaining. We chose the seats on boat no 2, second most expensive seats, but I think the regular seats is much better. In the boat, it was air conditioned and the windows sort of made",
          "Zhang Yimou's wonderful interpretation of a love story between a goddess and a mortal was beautiful and you really wondered how they did this. Beautiful music from Jane Zhang and Kitaro which you can buy on Amazon. Do not go to Hangzhou without going to this amazing show!",
          "Even though the show is not cheap but it's worth it to watch. The performance was on the water and with the music and lighting effect made it even more beautiful. Too bad that the stories was presented using Chinese. One hour passing by so fast with the amazement on every",
          "Like the light, sound, music and dance. Truly impressive. My parents and my 4 yr old love it. Would like to view it during autumn or winter again, think they may change to another theme.",
          "I has no idea what to expect from this show - we were taken by our hosts, who had watched it god know how many time. The only way to describe it is epic. The dancers on the water was one thing, but when the rig rose out of the water it was simply breathtaking. The lighting,",
          "Show is very pretty, but impossible to understand for a non Chinese speaking. A little pricey compared to other attractions in China but the cheap seats were perfectly fine and it was still worth it. Took our family of 6 and the kids were impressed too.",
          "It did not rain the night before nor on the night after. But it poured throughout the night we saw the show. The organisers provided us with disposable rain coats which kept us dry even though our shoes were soaked through. However, not one in my group of 8 asked to leave before",
          "when you heard hangzhou ,you must know the west lake. it is really the symobl for Hangzhou long long ago. in the ancitent , some of the king lived here and called here as the capital. West lake is so beatiful and many people from the world come here to have visit erery",
          "last for one hour, live show on the west lake, really impressive, but the price is a little bit high, around 40 dollars",
          "Impression West Lake is an outdoor show performed on a beautifully conceived stage on the water of the lake. Performers -- up to about 200 at once -- drift by on boats or move about on a stage built just below the surface, resulting in some lovely visual moments. The story is",
          "I must say I am hppy I have seen it, but it was not a super performance. The choreography was amateur work, but the abiance and backdrop were very nice. Nice for 1 time and if you visit Hangzhou I do recommend it. But do not expect Broadway peffection of acting.",
          "I don't really understand the stories... but really the highlight of my trip, really love the show. The music, the lighting, the effects, the artists just amazing.",
          "I came to Hangzhou for the main purpose of watching this evening show (I watched Impression-LiuSanJie in Guilin last month). Some previous reviewers said they didn't understand the storyline as the introduction was in Chinese only. Well, the story is about the Chinese legend",
          "I got the water platform seat but I felt I was too far from the performers but the scale of the performance, I was amazed",
          "Impression Westlake is interesting, charming even, but the Lake offers so much more to discover and enjoy.",
          "Great show/musical/play/love story on water. Impressive background of water, trees, pavillion/lights. You can buy tickets from the tour agent in yr hotel, or in any of the numerous tourist kiosks dotting Hangzhou, especially along the streets lining the lake. It seems that the",
          "We have seen Impression Lijiang Day Show several years ago and we expected the Night Show Impression West Lake to be much much better considering all the advantages they have ie; The wonderful location, the experiences gained from the past years and the IT technology which",
          "Yes, it is big, it applied a strange \"walk on water\" trick. However, it not really impressed me much. The way the story is told is not that great, and the duration is a little short.",
          "Fantastic show overall, with perfect timing of lights, sound and dancing, equivalent to the dancing at the opening of 2008 Beijing Olympic which was directed by the same Zhang Yi Mou. More than 200 dancers dancing in the middle of the lake as though they have got the Kungfu",
          "Only complaint is there are no translations of the words at the start of the show. Luckily my Chinese friend told me in English what it said.",
          "Very unusual venue -- lake, costumes, and choreography were excellent -- romantic event perhaps best for couples. Story line and pace may not be best for youngsters. Not as broad an appeal or ethnically interesting as his show at Lijiang, but I would not miss it while visiting",
          "Impression West Lake was a highlight of my holiday in China. It is the most stunning show imaginable. Seating is tiered at the edge of the lake so that everyone gets a good view. The stage is at water level in the lake so that the performers seem as though they are walking on",
          "I've lived in Hangzhou for over 1 1/2 yrs and had heard great things about this show. I finally got to see it last week and it certainly lives up to its reputation. I loved it. It was incredibly beautiful and very moving. It goes for an hour and has amazing acts, lighting,",
          "A good show,would have been good if there was translation in English. Light show was great",
          "I went on a monday and was imressed. the show is amaizing with the special effects and the amount of people. easy to compare with an opera in Verona or Vienna. I was unlucky with the weather. the show starts at 19.45 and ends at 20.45. Rain started 19.48 and stopped 20.43.",
          "Certainly worth every penny!!! Its essential to book your tickets early and avoid goin in Winter",
          "If you like \"his\" shows, go see this one, as it's quite different from the other ones performing in various places around China.",
          "Simply a great way to enjoy west lake in the evening. I went when it was raining, it didn't bother me, because it added to the romantic atmosphere of the story. Note: Staff hand out raincoats when it was about to rain.",
          "The Impression Westlake in Hangzhou is well worth seeing. The director, Mr Zhang Jimou (Beijing Olympic Games) has come with another great production. The setting is excellent, right on the lake with a beautiful background. We read the story before we went, but we didn't think",
          "We saw all three Impressions shows--Lijiang, Yangshuo and this one. This was excellent and well worth seeing. The setting is right \"on\" the lake as the stage is set into the water. Pay extra for the prime seats. Although the story for a Westerner is hard to understand, the",
          "I am ordinarily a big fan of this kind of production and have always liked Kitaro's music and certainly Zhang Yimou's productions, but this one did not really gel for me. Perhaps the choreography was a little chaotic, or I was just jet-lagged but it wasn't very gripping. My",

          "This is the most amazing night show that I have ever seen. The director of the show also created the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008. This ia a must if you are in Hangzhou",
          "It was one of the reasons for travelling to Hangzhou and we were very happy we did. Wonderful show, just excellent and a must see if you stay the night. Don't miss it.",
          "Well choreographed show albeit not much of a coherant storyline, but the visuals were stunning.",
          "I've been living in Hangzhou for several years and seen this show many times. Mostly when a friend or raletive visit this city, they asked to see this show cuz the director is very famous. The director of this show is the guy who directed the opening of 2008 Beijing Olympic, so",
          "The show is probably an ensemble of love stories and history of Westlake, but your guess is as good as mine even though I was educated in Chinese school. They should have some leaflets to at least explain the theme of major scenes. The lit up lake is very pretty but the story",
          "It is the first time I saw this kind of performance, outdoor, collosal, spectacular.....the stage is a bit below the water surface, so the audiences saw them walking and dancing on the water. The fee was quite expensive but it's worth to see. The art's performed based on the",
          "Travelled there with my wife and parents in-law. Had a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Westlake is quite big and the periphery is well laid out with walk-ways & benches, suited for long walks soaking the natural beauty along the way. We managed to catch up with the laser",

          "Whilst visiting Shanghai and Suzhou for business, I made a stop-over trip to Hangzhou just to watch this show. The show is spectacular, lots of colours, lights, sound and special effects. You may want to buy the sheltered VIP seats just in case it rains. Tickets can be",
          "This was my second visit to Hangzhou, last time being winter time, I missed the show. This time, I didnt miss the opportunity and I am glad I went for this show. Its really out of world, must watch for everybody.",
          "the special effect is wonderful, though story line very simple",
          "Very beautiful and unique choreography. We got our hotel to book the tickets for us. The receipt of the booking by our hotel had to be changed into tickets proper at the booth near the entrance. Lots of restaurants around. Very enthralled by the performance, the only thing",
          "Just don't miss it. It's just too good!!! I came out awed and never felt so good about paying for a 1-hour show which costs that much!",
          "Very nice lake, lots of upmarket shops and restaurants all around. More rich and western feel to the place.",
          "I have seen many different shows on my travels from cirque de soleil to water puppets but this is in a different league. The show on the water and the lighting gives a unique experience. I recommend it to all. I got the outside seats close to the water so the view is great.",

        "wiki": "Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport (IATA: HGH, ICAO: ZSHC) is the principal airport serving Hangzhou, a major city in the Yangtze River Delta region and the capital of Zhejiang Province, China. The airport is located on the southern shore of Qiantang River in Xiaoshan District and is 27 km (17 mi) east of downtown Hangzhou. Architecture firm Aedas designed Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport.The airport has service to destinations throughout China. International destinations are mainly in the east and southeast Asia, and points of Africa, Europe, and South Asia. The airport also serves as a focus city for Air China, China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Hainan Airlines and Xiamen Airlines.\nIn 2017, Hangzhou airport handled 35,570,411 passengers, which ranked 10th in terms of passenger traffic in China. Additionally, the airport ranked 6th busiest in terms of cargo with 589,461.6 tonnes and was the country's 9th busiest airport by traffic movements at 271,066.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe airport was planned to be constructed in three phases. The first phase of construction started in July 1997, and was completed and opened for traffic on 30 December 2000. It replaced the old Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport, which was a dual-use civil and military airfield. In March 2004, the airport officially became an international airport after immigration and customs facilities were built and put into service. A second runway of 3,600 meters is also under construction. Terminal extensions are also under construction as of 2012.\nThe airport was a hub of CNAC Zhejiang. After the airlines' merger with Air China, the latter inherited the Hangzhou hub.\nKLM launched the first intercontinental air route out of Hangzhou, to Amsterdam, on 8 May 2010.On the evening of 9 July 2010, the airport was shut down for an hour when an unidentified flying object was detected. Air traffic control could not locate it on radar and prudently waved off landing flights. Eighteen flights were affected. Though normal operations resumed four hours later, the incident captured the attention of the Chinese media and sparked a firestorm of speculation on the UFO's identity.\n\n\n== Facilities ==\n\nPhase One of the airport occupies 7,260 acres (29.4 km2) of land. It has a capacity of eight million passengers and 110,000 tons of cargo a year, and can handle aircraft as large as the Boeing 747-400. It has one runway which is 3,600 metres (11,800 ft) long and 45 metres (148 ft) wide. The passenger terminal can handle 3,600 passengers an hour and is 100,000 square meters in size (including an underground parking of 22,000 square meters). The departure level has 36 ticket counters, including 12 in the international side of the terminal. There are 2,900 seats in the departure lounge. The immigration and customs area occupies 9,500 sq. meter of terminal space.\nThe apron occupies 340,000 square metres of land, and there are 12 jetways and 18 departure gates.\nMaintenance facilities are certified to perform B-Check on all types of aircraft and C-Check on Boeing 737 and Boeing 757 aircraft.\nPhase Two of the airport expansion project began construction on 8 November 2007. It included an International Terminal, a second Domestic Terminal, and a new runway. The International Terminal was completed on 3 June 2010. The terminal has 8 air bridgegates, with one gate capable of handling the Airbus A380. All international flights, including flights to Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan depart from this terminal. The original terminal handles exclusively domestic flights. All other constructions were completed and operations began on 30 December 2012.The new runway is 3,400 meters (11,200 ft) long and 60 meters (200 ft) wide, which is capable of handling the Airbus A380. The new domestic terminal (T3) has 90 Check-in desks and 21 Self Check-in counters. It also adds 26 security lanes and 31 aerobridge gates. All public spaces of the terminal have free WIFI services. With the addition of the new passenger terminal, the airport now has a total terminal floor area of 370,000 square metres and will enable the airport to handle 8,520 passengers at peak hour and 32.5 million passengers annually.Loong Airlines has its headquarters in the Loong Air Office Building (\u957f\u9f99\u822a\u7a7a\u529e\u516c\u5927\u697c; Ch\u00e1ngl\u00f3ng H\u00e1ngk\u014dng B\u00e0ng\u014dngd\u00e0l\u00f3u) on the airport property.\n\n\n== Ground transportation ==\n\n\n=== Airport bus ===\nThere are airport bus services linking the airport to points throughout Zhejiang and cities in Jiangsu.\nBus services to/from downtown Hangzhou originate/terminate at the Ticketing Office on Tiyuchang Road with intermediate stops in between.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nThere are currently no subway or railway lines that serve the airport. However, two lines on the Hangzhou Metro: Line 1 and Line 7, both of which connect the airport with the city downtown, are currently under construction and are expected to enter operations by 2020 and 2021 respectively.\n\n\n=== Highway ===\nThe Airport is accessed by Airport Road, which connects to the Airport Expressway and is linked to downtown Hangzhou by the Xixing Bridge. The Airport Expressway also has an exit at North Shixin Road, which is linked to downtown Xiaoshan. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway has an exit at the airport.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nHangzhou Jianqiao Airport\nList of airports in China\nList of the busiest airports in China\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nAirport information for ZSHC at World Aero Data.

        "wiki": "Hangzhou (Chinese: \u676d\u5dde; Hangzhounese pronunciation: [\u0266\u0251\u0303.tse], Standard Mandarin pronunciation: [x\u01ce\u014b.\u0288\u0282\u00f3u] (listen)), also romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang, People's Republic of China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium. The city's West Lake, a UNESCO World Heritage site immediately west of the city, is among its best-known attractions. A study conducted by PwC and China Development Research Foundation saw Hangzhou ranked first among \"Chinese Cities of Opportunity\". Hangzhou is also considered a World City with a \"Beta\" classification according to GaWC.Hangzhou is classified as a sub-provincial city and forms the core of the Hangzhou metropolitan area, the fourth-largest in China. During the 2010 Chinese census, the metropolitan area held 21.102 million people over an area of 34,585 km2 (13,353 sq mi). Hangzhou prefecture had a registered population of 10,360,000 in 2019.Hangzhou was repeatedly rated as the best commercial city in mainland China by Forbes. As the headquarters of Internet industry enterprises such as Alibaba, Hangzhou has strongly attracted people who work in the Internet industry. Therefore, in the new growing cities that became popular in the 2010s, Hangzhou is one of the main representative cities. Since 2014, the rapid growth of population has caused the rapid growth of local housing prices.\nIn September 2015, Hangzhou was awarded the 2022 Asian Games. It will be the third city in China to host the Asian Games after Beijing 1990 and Guangzhou 2010. Hangzhou, an emerging technology hub and home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba, also hosted the eleventh G20 summit in 2016.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nThe celebrated neolithic culture of Hemudu is known to have inhabited Yuyao, 100 km (62 mi) south-east of Hangzhou, as far back as seven thousand years ago. It was during this time that rice was first cultivated in southeast China. Excavations have established that the jade-carving Liangzhu culture (named for its type site just northwest of Hangzhou) inhabited the area immediately around the present city around five thousand years ago. The first of Hangzhou's present neighborhoods to appear in written records was Yuhang, which probably preserves an old Baiyue name.\n\n\n=== Medieval history ===\n\nHangzhou was made the seat of the prefecture of Hang in AD 589, entitling it to a city wall which was constructed two years later. By a longstanding convention also seen in other cities like Guangzhou and Fuzhou, the city took on the name of the area it administered and became known as Hangzhou. Hangzhou was at the southern end of China's Grand Canal which extends to Beijing. The canal evolved over centuries but reached its full length by 609.In the Tang dynasty, Bai Juyi was appointed governor of Hangzhou. Already an accomplished poet, his deeds at Hangzhou have led to his being praised as a great governor. He noticed that the farmland nearby depended on the water of West Lake, but due to the negligence of previous governors, the old dyke had collapsed, and the lake so dried out that the local farmers were suffering from severe drought. He ordered the construction of a stronger and taller dyke, with a dam to control the flow of water, thus providing water for irrigation and mitigating the drought problem. The livelihood of local people of Hangzhou improved over the following years. Bai Juyi used his leisure time to enjoy the West Lake, visiting it almost daily. He also ordered the construction of a causeway connecting Broken Bridge with Solitary Hill to allow walking, instead of requiring a boat. He then had willows and other trees planted along the dyke, making it a beautiful landmark. This causeway was later named \"Bai Causeway\", in his honor.\nIt is listed as one of the Seven Ancient Capitals of China. It was first the capital of the Wuyue Kingdom from 907 to 978 during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Named Xifu (\u897f\u5e9c) at the time, it was one of the three great bastions of culture in southern China during the tenth century, along with Nanjing and Chengdu. Leaders of Wuyue were noted patrons of the arts, particularly of Buddhist temple architecture and artwork. The dyke built to protect the city by King Qian Liu gave the Qiantang its modern name. Hangzhou also became a cosmopolitan center, drawing scholars from throughout China and conducting diplomacy with neighboring Chinese states, and also with Japan, Goryeo, and the Khitan Liao dynasty.\nIn 1089, while another renowned poet Su Shi (Su Dongpo) was the city's governor, he used 200,000 workers to construct a 2.8 km (1.7 mi) long causeway across West Lake. The lake was once a lagoon tens of thousands of years ago. Silt then blocked the way to the sea and the lake was formed. A drill in the lake-bed in 1975 found the sediment of the sea, which confirmed its origin. Artificial preservation prevented the lake from evolving into a marshland. The Su Causeway built by Su Shi, and the Bai Causeway built by Bai Juyi, a Tang dynasty poet who was once the governor of Hangzhou, were both built out of mud dredged from the lake bottom. The lake is surrounded by hills on the northern and western sides. The Baochu Pagoda sits on the Baoshi Hill to the north of the lake.\nArab merchants lived in Hangzhou during the Song dynasty, due to the fact that the oceangoing trade passages took precedence over land trade during this time. There were also Arabic inscriptions from the 13th century and 14th century. During the later period of the Yuan dynasty, Muslims were persecuted through the banning of their traditions, and they participated in revolts against the Mongols. The Fenghuangshi mosque was constructed by an Egyptian trader who moved to Hangzhou. According to Odoric of Pordenone, Hangzhou was the greatest city in the world. It was heavily populated and filled with large family estates. It had twelve thousand bridges. Bread, pork, rice, and wine were abundant despite the large population. Ibn Battuta is known to have visited the city of Hangzhou in 1345; he noted its charm and described how the city sat on a beautiful lake and was surrounded by gentle green hills. During his stay at Hangzhou, he was particularly impressed by the large number of well-crafted and well-painted Chinese wooden ships with colored sails and silk awnings in the canals. He attended a banquet held by Qurtai, the Yuan Mongol administrator of the city, who according to Ibn Battuta, was fond of the skills of local Chinese conjurers.\n\nHangzhou was chosen as the new capital of the Southern Song dynasty in 1132, when most of northern China had been conquered by the Jurchens in the Jin\u2013Song wars. The surviving imperial family had retreated south from its original capital in Kaifeng after it was captured by the Jurchens in the Jingkang Incident of 1127. Emperor Gaozong moved to Nanjing, then to modern Shangqiu, then to Yangzhou in 1128, and finally to Hangzhou in 1129. The Song government intended it to be a temporary capital, but over the decades Hangzhou grew into a major commercial and cultural center of the Song dynasty, rising from being a middling city of no special importance to being one of the world's largest and most prosperous. Once the prospect of retaking northern China had diminished, government buildings in Hangzhou were extended and renovated to better befit its status as a permanent imperial capital. The imperial palace in Hangzhou, modest in size, was expanded in 1133 with new roofed alleyways, and in 1148 with an extension of the palace walls.\n\nFrom 1138 until the Mongol invasion of 1276, Hangzhou remained the capital of the Southern Song dynasty and was known as Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89). It served as the seat of the imperial government, a center of trade and entertainment, and the nexus of the main branches of the civil service. During that time the city was a gravitational center of Chinese civilization: what used to be considered \"central China\" in the north was taken by the Jin, an ethnic minority dynasty ruled by Jurchens.\nNumerous philosophers, politicians, and men of literature, including some of the most celebrated poets in Chinese history such as Su Shi, Lu You, and Xin Qiji came here to live and die. Hangzhou is also the birthplace and final resting place of the scientist Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095 AD), his tomb being located in the Yuhang district.\n\nDuring the Southern Song dynasty, commercial expansion, an influx of refugees from the conquered north, and the growth of the official and military establishments, led to a corresponding population increase and the city developed well outside its 9th-century ramparts. According to the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Hangzhou had a population of over 2 million at that time, while historian Jacques Gernet has estimated that the population of Hangzhou numbered well over one million by 1276. (Official Chinese census figures from the year 1270 listed some 186,330 families in residence and probably failed to count non-residents and soldiers.) It is believed that Hangzhou was the largest city in the world from 1180 to 1315 and from 1348 to 1358.Because of the large population and densely crowded (often multi-story) wooden buildings, Hangzhou was particularly vulnerable to fires. Major conflagrations destroyed large sections of the city in 1132, 1137, 1208, 1229, 1237, and 1275 while smaller fires occurred nearly every year. The 1237 fire alone was recorded to have destroyed 30,000 dwellings. To combat this threat, the government established an elaborate system for fighting fires, erected watchtowers, devised a system of lantern and flag signals to identify the source of the flames and direct the response, and charged more than 3,000 soldiers with the task of putting out fire.\nHangzhou was besieged and captured by the advancing Mongol armies of Kublai Khan in 1276, three years before the final collapse of the Southern Song. The capital of the new Yuan dynasty was established in the city of Dadu (Beijing), but Hangzhou remained an important commercial and administrative center for their southern lands.\nYuan China was very open to foreign visitors, and several returned west describing Hangzhou\u2014under the names Khinzai, Quinsai, Campsay, &c.\u2014as one of the foremost cities in the world. The Venetian merchant Marco Polo supposedly visited Hangzhou in the late 13th century. In his book, he records that the city was \"greater than any in the world\" and that \"the number and wealth of the merchants, and the amount of goods that passed through their hands, was so enormous that no man could form a just estimate thereof.\" The manuscripts of Polo's account greatly exaggerate the city's size, although it has been argued that the \"hundred miles\" of walls would be plausible if Chinese miles were intended instead of Italian ones and that the \"12,000 stone bridges\" might have been a copyist error born from the city's 12 gates. In the 14th century, the Moroccan traveler Ibn Battuta arrived; his later account concurred that al-Khans\u0101 was \"the biggest city I have ever seen on the face of the earth.\"\n\n\n=== Modern history ===\nThe city remained an important port until the middle of the Ming dynasty era, when its harbor slowly silted up. Under the Qing, it was the site of an imperial army garrison.In 1856 and 1860, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom occupied Hangzhou. The city was heavily damaged during its conquest, occupation, and eventual reconquest by the Qing army.\nHangzhou was ruled by the Republic of China government under the Kuomintang from 1927 to 1937.

Within the city of Hangzhou are two notable mosques: the Great Mosque of Hangzhou and the Phoenix Mosque.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nAs late as the latter part of the 16th and early 17th centuries, the city was an important center of Chinese Jewry, and may have been the original home of the better-known Kaifeng Jewish community.There was formerly a Jewish synagogue in Ningbo, as well as one in Hangzhou, but no traces of them are now discoverable, and the only Jews known to exist in China were in Kaifeng.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\nTwo of the Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism were from Hangzhou. There was persecution of Christians in the early 21st century in the city.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nThe native residents of Hangzhou, like those of Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu, speak Hangzhou dialect, which is a Wu dialect. However, Wu Chinese varies throughout the area where it is spoken, hence, Hangzhou's dialect differs from regions in southern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu. As the official language defined by China's central government, Mandarin is the dominant spoken language.\nThere are several museums located in Hangzhou with regional and national importance. China National Silk Museum (\u4e2d\u56fd\u4e1d\u7ef8\u535a\u7269\u9986), located near the West Lake, is one of the first state-level museums in China and the largest silk museum in the world.

The locally accepted consensus among Hangzhou's natives defines dishes prepared in this style to be \"fresh, tender, soft, and smooth, with a mellow fragrance.\"\nGenerally, Hangzhou's cuisines tend to be sweeter rather than savoury. Owing to the fact that Hangzhou is located near the Yangtze river, where the climate is mild, the local people enjoy a light diet incorporating river fishes. The rich history of the city provides the local people with stories revolving the origins of local dishes.\nDishes such as Pian Er Chuan Noodles (\u7247\u513f\u5ddd), West Lake Vinegar Fish (\u897f\u6e56\u918b\u9c7c), Dongpo Pork (\u4e1c\u5761\u8089), Longjing Shrimp (\u9f99\u4e95\u867e\u4ec1), Beggar's Chicken (\u53eb\u5316\u9e21), Steamed Rice and Pork Wrapped by Lotus Leaves(\u8377\u53f6\u7c89\u84b8\u8089), Braised Bamboo Shoots (\u6cb9\u7116\u7b0b), Lotus Root Pudding (\u85d5\u7c89) and Sister Song's Fish Soup (\u5b8b\u5ac2\u9c7c\u7fb9) are some of the better-known examples of Hangzhou's regional cuisine.\nThe famous and signature restaurants in Hangzhou include Xin Feng restaurant (\u65b0\u4e30\u5c0f\u5403), Zhi Wei Guan (\u77e5\u5473\u89c2), Grandma's Home (\u5916\u5a46\u5bb6), Green Tea Restaurant (\u7eff\u8336\u9910\u5385), etc. These restaurants create the advanced food and dishes of the traditional Hangzhou cuisine, and combine with the western cooking methods.\nLongjing tea is the most famous green tea and rank first among top ten famous teas in China.

Regional routes reach Hong Kong and Macau. It has an extensive domestic route network within the PRC and is consistently ranked top 10 in passenger traffic among Chinese airports. Hangzhou Xiaoshan International Airport has two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B. The smaller Terminal A serves all international and regional flights while the larger Terminal B solely handles domestic traffic. The airport is located just outside the city in the Xiaoshan District with direct bus service linking the airport with Downtown Hangzhou. The ambitious expansion project will see the addition of a second runway and a third terminal which will dramatically increase capacity of the fast-growing airport that serves as a secondary hub of Air China.

The subway station beneath the rail complex building is a stop along the Hangzhou Metro Line 1 and Line 4. There are frequent departures for Shanghai with approximately 20-minute headways from 6:00 to 21:00. Non-stop CRH high-speed service between Hangzhou and Shanghai takes 50 minutes and leaves every hour (excluding a few early morning/late night departures) from both directions. Other CRH high-speed trains that stop at one or more stations along the route complete the trip in 59 to 75 minutes. Most other major cities in China can also be reached by direct train service from Hangzhou.

It is the 17th city in China to operate a rapid transit system. In 2018, the state council approved the planning for 15 metro lines, including extensions to the three existing lines, scheduled to open in time for the 2022 Asian Games. By then the Hangzhou Metro network is projected to be 617 km (383 mi) long.The Hangzhou Metro began construction in March 2006, and the first line opened on November 24, 2012. Line 1 connects downtown Hangzhou with suburban areas of the city from Xianghu to Wenze Road and Linping. By June 2015, the southeast part of Line 2 (starts in Xiaoshan District, ends to the south of the city centre) and a short part of Line 4 (fewer than 10 stations, connecting Line 1 and Line 2) were completed. The system is expected to have 15 lines upon completion; most lines are still under construction. The extensions of Line 2 (Xihu District) and Line 4 (east of Bingjiang) were finished in 2018.\n\n\n=== Taxis ===\nTaxis are also popular in the city, with the newest line of Hyundai Sonatas and Volkswagen Passats, and tight regulations.

Marco Polo in his accounts described Suzhou as \"the city of the earth\" while Hangzhou is \"the city of heaven\".  The city presented itself as \"Paradise on Earth\" during the G20 summit held in the city in 2016.Another saying about Hangzhou is:\n\n\"Be born in Suzhou, live in Hangzhou, eat in Guangzhou, die in Liuzhou.\" (\u751f\u5728\u82cf\u5dde\uff0c\u6d3b\u5728\u676d\u5dde\uff0c\u5403\u5728\u5e7f\u5dde\uff0c\u6b7b\u5728\u67f3\u5dde)The meaning here lies in the fact that Suzhou was renowned for its beautiful and highly civilized and educated citizens, Hangzhou for its scenery, Guangzhou for its food, and Liuzhou (of Guangxi) for its wooden coffins which supposedly halted the decay of the body (likely made from the camphor tree).\n\n\n== Notable residents ==\nJack Ma: Co-founder and executive chairman of the Alibaba Group.\nZong Qinghou: Entrepreneur, founder, Chairman and CEO of the Hangzhou Wahaha Group.\nSun Yang: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nYe Shiwen: Olympic gold medalist and competitive swimmer.\nWu Yibing: World No.1 in the ITF juniors ranking and professional tennis player.\nLi Wenhan: Singer, actor, member of boy groups UNIQ and UNINE\nHu Yitian: Actor\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nHistorical capitals of China\nJiangnan\nList of cities in the People's Republic of China by population\nSuzhou numerals \u2013 in the Unicode standard version 3.0, these characters are incorrectly named Hangzhou style numerals\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n This article incorporates text from The Middle kingdom: a survey of the ...

Most notably, the name refers to the titular Dragon Well itself, located near Longjing village (simplified Chinese: \u9f99\u4e95\u6751; traditional Chinese: \u9f8d\u4e95\u6751; pinyin: l\u00f3ngj\u01d0ng c\u016bn) in Xihu District, as well as the area encompassing the well and the Longjing tea famously grown there.\nThe Dragon Well region consists of a number of villages, tea plantations, tea houses, parks, and a temple. The area is popular for drinking and buying tea as well as visiting the Eight Scenes of the Dragon Well (\u9f99\u4e95\u516b\u666f).\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Tea Fields of Longjing",

A 20-episode special edition of the drama aired on WeTV starting December 25, 2019.\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\n,Sixteen years in the past, the jianghu world is ruled by the powerful Wen sect, which dominates over the smaller Lan, Jiang, Nie, and Jin sects. The cheerful, mischievous, carefree Wei Wuxian, adoptive son of the Jiang clan, becomes fast friends with the righteous and duty-minded Lan Wangji during an educational seminar hosted every year at the Lan clan's compound. Things become complicated when, during their adventures, the pair find out that the head of the Wen sect is the evil mastermind behind a series of plots that would wreak havoc upon the lands.\nIn the present, Wei Wuxian is universally reviled as a practitioner of the dark arts; despite having been presumed dead for almost 16 years, he is portrayed as a vicious, bloodthirsty monster and his name is used to frighten children. Mo Xuanyu, the badly-abused nephew of the Mo clan head and the only cultivator in his otherwise mundane clan, uses a dark ritual to summon the spirit of Wei Wuxian into his own body and bind him with a curse that forces Wei Wuxian to punish Mo Xuanyu's enemies. While Wei Wuxian struggles to figure out what has happened in the world since his death and complete his curse-enforced mission, he ends up encountering Lan Wangji. The two work together to solve a series of murder mysteries, eventually finding and defeating the true culprit.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\nThe series aired every Thursday and Friday (GMT +08:00) with two episodes each, and VIP members could have early access to two more.

The project was first announced in March 2018.The series is co-directed by Zheng Weiwen and Chen Jialin; and the script written by a team consisting of Yang Xia, Deng Yaoyu, Ma Jing and Guo Guangyun. The main producers are credited to be Fang Feng, Yang Xia, Wang Chu and Liu Mingyi; while Yang Xia and Ji Peng serve as the art directors. The drama was filmed from April 2018 to August 2018 at Hengdian World Studios and Guizhou. Two weeks before filming, the cast gathered for script reading sessions and underwent martial arts and etiquette training.Due to the censorship in China, all BL content is removed from the drama and changes are made to the overall plot. As the original novel was written in a \"flashback\" style, additional scenes had to be inserted to improve the flow of the story. \nTwo versions of the script were prepared; one is told in the chronological order of story development, and the other is a narrative trajectory that follows the original novel. Finally, on the basis of not breaking the core of the original story, and to fully develop and layer the storyline, the team decided to adopt a mixture of both styles. To better fuse the different storylines together, the team decided to forgo traditional styles of filming, and more suspense was used in the lens composition settings.Despite being termed as \"xianxia\" drama, The Untamed includes many elements of traditional wuxia dramas, fused with a new style. Using traditional wuxia values such as \"chivalry and courage\", it allows the younger audience to better relate to the drama.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\nThe casting director gave a special \"character card\" to each of the cast members; which includes detailed descriptions of the character such as the looks, height, clothing style and even specific details such as \"Wei Wuxian has a natural smiling face\".Xiao Zhan and Wang Yibo were announced as the lead actors in April 2018. Xiao Zhan was recommended by a friend of the producer Yang Xia, who chose him because of his \"clean gaze\". Wang Yibo got the role through an audition, because of his \"natural coldness\".Lu Zhixing and Bian Jiang, who dubbed Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji in the audio drama and donghua adaptation of Mo Dao Zu Shi respectively, were hired to voice Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji in the series.\n\n\n=== Design and concept ===\nAccording to producer Yang Xia, while designing the sets and costumes of the different sects, the team started out by searching for a culture placement where the design could be based on. The costume designer of the drama is Chen Tongxun.For the Gusu Lan sect, influence from the Song Dynasty were taken into consideration while designing the costumes and sets. While designing the \"jingshi\", blue and green shades were used to showcase the elegance and dignified strength/character of the sect; while darker shades of wood were used to show off the magnificence. Cascading collars and sleeves were used to design the clothes, to highlight the strictness of the sect.For the Yunmeng Jiang sect, influences from the Hubei and Jianghan district were taken. Warm and light colors were used to showcase the cheerful and free-spirited nature of the sect. The architecture and sets were designed to be widely spaced, and yarn was used to create the feeling of \"transparency\". Narrow sleeves and neat designs were used to highlight the \"wandering pugilistic\" feel of the sect. A water recycling device was used in the lotus lake of the set, allowing ripples to be seen on the lake surface. A special ceiling was built for the ancestral hall.For the Qinghe Nie sect, the set was designed to be surrounded by high walls and the entrance isn't easily seen because it was often invaded by Qishan Wen sect. For Qishan Wen sect, designs from the Shang dynasty were used. For Lanling Jin sect, the designs were inspired by the luxurious and elegance of the Tang dynasty.\n\n\n=== Controversies ===\nA fire broke out at on July 11, 2018 while the cast and crew were filming in Nanma, Dongyang, at a facility that belongs to Hengdian World Studios. The fire reportedly spread as wide as 300 square meters, and resulted in the death of two crew members.During filming, a rumor surfaced that the producers of the drama had replaced Lan Wangji as Wei Wuxian's love interest with a female character, Wen Qing. This rumor caused significant backlash amongst fans of the original novel. The production team strongly denied such claims.On July 29, 2019, Tencent announced that VIP users have the option to pay in order to watch episodes that have not yet aired. Starting from August 7, the final episode will be released early for some viewers who choose to avail the option. This has caused outrage among viewers of the show, who were concerned that this would open up the risk of the ending being spoiled and also the possibility that the episodes will be pirated, which will then have a negative effect on views. In response, Tencent explained that in this way, they can cater to demands of certain viewers who are requesting for episodes to be released faster while the rest can still watch the series at their preferred pace.\n\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe main composer of the soundtrack is Lin Hai. The theme song was titled \"\u5fd8\u7fa1\" (pinyin: W\u00e0ngxi\u00e0n) before being renamed from Episode 11 onwards to \"\u65e0\u7f81 (pinyin: W\u00fa j\u012b;)\".

        "wiki": "The Citadelle of Quebec (French: Citadelle de Qu\u00e9bec), also known as La Citadelle, is an active military installation and the secondary official residence of both the Canadian monarch and the Governor General of Canada. It is located atop Cap Diamant, adjoining the Plains of Abraham in Quebec City, Quebec. The citadel contains the oldest military building in Canada, and forms part of the fortifications of Quebec City, which is one of only two cities in North America still surrounded by fortifications, the other being Campeche, Mexico.\nThe strategic importance of Cap Diamant was recognized by the French as early as 1608. Several defensive fortification were built on the site by the French, and the British after their conquest of New France. The modern citadel was built from 1820 to 1850, in effort to secure Quebec City against a potential American attack. The British used the citadel until 1871, when they formally handed the property over to the Canadian government. Following the handover, the citadel was used as a military installation by the Canadian Armed Forces, and as an royal and viceregal residence.\nThe Citadelle is a National Historic Site of Canada and forms part of the Fortifications of Qu\u00e9bec National Historic Site of Canada. The fortress is located within the Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec, which was designated a World Heritage Site in 1985. The site receives some 200,000 visitors annually.\n\n\n== History ==\nCap Diamant's strategic value was identified by Samuel de Champlain in 1608 and led him to found Quebec City at the base of the escarpment. The promontory was practically insurmountable and thus the only side of the settlement ever to be heavily fortified was the west, the only one not naturally protected by the hill.\n\n\n=== Early fortifications ===\n\n\n==== French-rule ====\nThe first protective wall (enceinte)\u2014Major Provost's palisade\u2014was built by command of Governor General of New France Louis de Buade, sieur de Frontenac and completed just in time for the Battle of Quebec in 1690. Three years later, a plan by engineer Josu\u00e9 Boisberthelot de Beaucours for new, 75-metre (246 ft) wide enceinte was developed by the French military engineer Jacques Levasseur de N\u00e9r\u00e9 and approved in 1701 by King Louis XIV's Commissary General of Fortifications, S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban.\nThe proposal to build a full fort was deemed by the government in France to be too costly, despite both the importance and vulnerability of Quebec City. After the fall of Louisbourg in 1745, considerable work on the battlements took place under the direction of military engineer Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de L\u00e9ry.\n\n\n==== British-rule ====\nThe first British Lieutenant Governor of Quebec, General James Murray, saw the weakness of Quebec City's defences (indeed, Murray's post existed precisely because the British had conquered Quebec City four years before Murray's appointment as governor in 1763). He urged the construction of a citadel, but the imperial government at Westminster, like the French before, deemed a large fort to be of little value; a smaller, wooden citadel was built.\n\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, after seizing Montreal in the autumn of 1775, American rebels, led by General Richard Montgomery and Benedict Arnold, attempted to take Quebec on 31 December. There, Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded and forced to retreat. The Americans attempted to keep Quebec under siege, but withdrew after the arrival of British reinforcements in the spring of 1776.\n\n\n=== Present fortification (1820\u2013present) ===\n \nAs tensions between the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as fears of further rebellion in British North America, grew in the late 18th century, the British reinforced the defences of their colonies according to a plan drawn up in the 1790s by Gother Mann. The ramparts around the Upper Town cliff and four martello towers (still extant) on the Plains of Abraham were completed before 1812. A citadel was a key part of Mann's design, but no fort was built because the cost was deemed prohibitive.That opinion finally shifted following the War of 1812; as part of a wider improvement of Canada's defences coordinated by the Duke of Richmond, then Governor-in-Chief of British North America, the existing star fort was built between 1820 and 1850 under the direction of Lieutenant Colonel Elias Walker Durnford of the Royal Engineers. Intended to secure Quebec City against the Americans and serve as a refuge for the British garrison in the event of attack or rebellion, the Citadelle incorporated a section of the French enceinte of 1745 and the layout was based on S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban's design for an arms, munitions, and supplies depot, as well as a barracks. That, though, was somewhat of an anachronism by the time of the fort's completion, in comparison to other contemporary European military architecture. Additional buildings were completed in 1850.After Canadian Confederation in 1867, Canada became responsible for its own defence; the British departed the Citadelle in 1871. Two batteries of the Royal Canadian Artillery were established at the Citadelle and an artillery school was opened in 1871, followed by a cavalry school. From the late 19th century, living conditions for soldiers at the fort gradually improved; canteens were opened and the casemates were made more comfortable. The preservation of much of the fortifications and defences of Quebec is due to the intervention of Governor General of Canada the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, who also established the Citadelle as a viceregal residence in 1872, reviving a tradition dating to the founding of New France. Since 1920, the Citadelle has been the home station of the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment of the Canadian Forces.\nThe Quebec Conferences of 1943 and 1944, in which Governor General of Canada the Earl of Athlone, Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed strategy for World War II, were held at the Citadelle of Quebec.\nThe Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada designated the Citadel as a national historic site in 1946. The fortress was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada in 1980 and, five years later, the Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec, of which the Citadelle is a part, was placed on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n== Function ==\n\nThe Citadelle is a functioning military installation for the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as an official residence of both Canada's monarch and its governor general. The latter, by tradition, resides there for several weeks during the summer as well as other shorter periods throughout the year. As is done at the other federal royal residence, Rideau Hall in Ottawa, Canadian award presentations and investitures and ceremonies for both incoming and outgoing ambassadors and high commissioners to Canada are held at the Citadelle. The residence is also open to the public, running a visitors' program and free tours of the state rooms throughout the year as well as educational tours for students. The Citadelle attracts approximately 200,000 visitors each year.A number of military ceremonies related to the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment take place at the Citadelle's parade ground, such as the changing of the guard and of battalion command and the consecration of each successive Batisse the Goat as regimental mascot. Additionally, daily at noon, a cannon is fired from the fort, the sound of which can be heard throughout Quebec City. Originally, two guns were fired each day, at 12:00 pm to alert Quebec City residents of the lunch hour and Angelus, or noon-day prayer and at 9:30 pm, marking the curfew for gunners and soldiers in the city. The tradition has continued since 1871, save for between 1994 and 2004.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\nThe fort is an uneven star shaped citadel and comprises four bastions and three straight curtain walls, all constructed with locally quarried sandstone. Within its walls are 24 buildings constructed mostly of grey cut stone.\n\n\n=== Royal and viceregal residence ===\n\nThe Officer's Barracks, a neo-Norman structure built in 1831 by the British Army, has been a residence of the Governor General of Canada since 1872. The residence today has a total of 153 rooms over 4,459 square metres (48,000 sq ft), including offices for the governor general's secretary.The entrance into the original area of the residence is through a set of double doors beneath a neo-classical porch bearing the words GOUVERNEUR G\u00c9N\u00c9RAL on the frieze and the crest of the Royal Arms of Canada in the tympanum. Within is a foyer with marble tile floor and a stair descending to the basement and, through another set of doors in a screen with translucent leaded glass sidelights and fanlight, is a hall; both rooms are in the Georgian style, in beige, cream, and gold. The Small Dining Room is similarly Georgian in decor, with robin's egg blue walls and white-painted trim. From the ceiling hang two crystal chandeliers.Soon after the building became a royal residence, additions to accommodate the viceregal party and household were required, including a ballroom and sunroom. These, however, were on 2 February 1976 destroyed by fire and the other rooms of the residence suffered smoke and water damage. The Department of Public Works and Government Services Canada (which oversees the infrastructure of the Citadelle) restored the original wing and new state rooms were built in place of the lost post-1872 additions, the work being completed in 1984. \nThis new wing was built at the east end of and at a slight angle to the 1831 structure, the roof being copper and the exterior walls of the same masonry as the adjacent buildings, but, using more regulated block sizes and a flatter relief of pilasters and windows, as well as less detailing overall. The wing contains a separate entrance and ceremonial foyer with twin spiral staircases ascending to a piano nobile; the stairs have wood handrails with aluminum pickets and between them is a niche for sculpture. On the upper level is an event space, lounge, and sunroom with a terrace overlooking the St. Lawrence River. The former two areas are fully barrel vaulted and linked together by a continuous, narrow skylight in the roof under which crystal pendants of different lengths hang and transfer the natural light into the rooms. Interiors of the modern addition were designed by Quebec artist Madeleine Arbour, who was inspired by the colours of winter in Quebec, and use Canadian materials, including granite, walnut, and aluminum. The residence is furnished with pieces from the Crown Collection, mostly in New France style, antique furniture mixed with contemporary Canadian art.\n\n\n=== Royal 22e R\u00e9giment Museum ===\n\nBuilding 15, constructed in 1750, also known as the powder magazine, houses the Museum of the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment and Canadian Forces Museum, which collects, preserves, and displays artifacts of Canadian military historical significance, as well as the Museum, which features weapons, uniforms, and other military artifacts of the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment. The Museum is affiliated with: CMA, CHIN, OMMC and Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n=== Other buildings ===\nBuilding 1, the Former Hospital Administration Building, is the principal structure in Mann's Bastion. It is a two-story, rectangular, symmetrical stone structure with a hipped-roof pierced by two brick chimneys. The west-facing facade features restrained decorative detailing of pilasters supporting a flat cornice along the length of the five-bay fa\u00e7ade. Loopholes are visible on the second floor on both sides of the building. The rear elevation facing into the bastion is functional and plain in appearance.\n\nBuilding 2, also known as the Men's Barracks, was formerly the armory and powder magazine. It faces the parade ground near the throat of the Prince of Wales Bastion. It is a long, rectangular, two story masonry building built of smooth limestone with a hipped roof clad in sheet copper. The main fa\u00e7ade of the building has little ornamentation and is regulated and orderly, with small, regularly placed, multi-paned windows.\nBuilding 5, the Former Powder Magazine, is a low, rectangular stone structure with a gabled roof and a surrounding protective blast wall. Two doors at ground level and three openings at gable level pierce the symmetrical fa\u00e7ade. Along the plain side elevations are three half-barrel-vaulted passages, or traverses, two on the west and one on the east.Building 7, also known as the Memorial Building, forms part of a complex of three structures, which includes a chapel and a workshop, situated near the parade ground. They are attached by a 19th-century protective wall. It is a small, rectangular, one-story masonry edifice with a pyramidal stone roof and a row of windows on all four elevations. Its principal fa\u00e7ade is distinguished by a modern porchway. Governor General of Canada Georges Vanier and his wife Pauline Vanier are interred here at the commemorative chapel.Located within the King's Bastion and adjacent to the governor general's residence, Building 10 is the former military prison and presently the museum annex. Constructed in 1842, it is a two-story rectangular stone structure with a hipped roof pierced by three brick chimneys. The west elevation facing the citadel is restrained but decorated by pilasters. Loopholes pierce the walls on both stories. There are several irregularly placed windows with iron bars.\n\nBuilding 14, the former ordnance store, stands along the parade ground. The long, rectangular two story structure is constructed of stone with a hipped roof clad in copper sheet. The symmetrical fa\u00e7ade features small, evenly spaced windows.\nBuilding 16 is the museum office and former cooperage.Building 17, also known as the Men's Barracks, stands on the south side of the parade ground near the throat of the Dalhousie Bastion. Two stories high for most of its length, the rectangular building has exterior walls of stone and features symmetrical elevations, a hipped, copper clad roof, and a projecting course of stone above the ground floor.\nClearly seen from the river and aligned on the meridian for observation purposes, Building 20, also known as the Ball House, is the former observatory and time ball tower. It is a compact, tall, two story stone structure of several architectural shapes. The rectangular section with a gabled roof was the former observatory and the square section formerly housed the time ball installation topped with an antenna. The building is entered from the ground floor of its small porch, which joins the two buildings.Building 32, formerly the Defensive Guard House, is located at the eastern end of the north main ditch below the King's Bastion. It is a small, squat, one story masonry edifice with a gable roof supported by wood rafters. A chimney rises through the roof, which is covered in painted tin sheeting.\nThe former caponier, Building 46, is located at the south end of the ditch separating the counterscarp from the Men's Barracks. Its two walls and small turret in the middle of its gabled roof are the only visible elements of this small stone building. It is integrated with the ramparts and pierced with loopholes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGovernment Houses in Canada\nGovernment Houses of the British Empire and Commonwealth\nList of forts\nRamparts of Quebec City\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Fortifications of Qu\u00e9bec National Historic Site\".

          "The day we visited it was toooo windy, hence colder than it really was so we avoided taking the walking tour, instead focused on the Le Musee Roya 22 Regiment. I am not particular drawn to military history but this was very interesting and very well done. I would enjoy",

          "I toured here during August 2019 and when I went back to Que City I was hoping to check it out again but missed it. The Citadel and also the Museum of the 22nd Regiment is one you want to explore. There is so much history in Quebec that often gets overshadowed by the neighbours",
          "We had toured the inside previously when it was warmer, but this time we just walked near the walls for great views of the city and river. It's an impressive fort for sure and strategically located.",
          "Having visited the fort and citadel in Kingston and Halifax, my wife and I were keen to check out La Citadelle. Our first mistake was not knowing it was an active military base. When we entered we saw the visitor signs and thought it was a purely tourist site, so imagined us",
          "Unfortunately the military museum was closed when we visited over Christmas but we were able to learn about the history displayed on a wall in a tunnel leading from the entrance to the courtyard. Well worth a visit on a fine day but tricky and limited owing to the icy conditions.",

          "With my love for history this was a must see place and remains a MUST SEE for all. The fort has a storied and rich history and it continues to make history as it is still an active billet for a unit of the Canadian military. Maude the guide was very energetic, knowledgable and",

          "You can walk the walls of the citadel in Quebec. It is free and you get some great views. The whole area above the museum is mostly grass and you can meander along the old ramparts. On a windy day I would be careful towards the edges because it is a long drop down to the streets",
          "Wonderful place to visit. You have to go with a guided tour of the fort but it is well worth it. Terrific history of the area and explanation of why the fort was built. Good way to learn more of its history",

          "We took a group walking tour of the Citadel and appreciated the shared knowledge of our guide. The physical structure and the importance of the Citadel's placement to Quebec were some of the facts that were given to us. Fascinating visit!",

          "A great place to tour. We watched the changing of the guards. It's quite impressive and it's not just a 15 minute event. This took at least an hour or more. They do the changing of the guards and the band plays as well. The whole event is quite impressive. After that event",

          "We arrived just before 10:00 in order to see the changing of the guard. The pomp and circumstance was far too long for our taste (patience?). We did enjoy the (mandatory) group tour. It took about an hour to see the various areas which seemed to us the right amount of time",

          "This is an hour of your time that is absolutely worthwhile. I believe our guide was Sarah. She was so animated and enjoyable. The history lesson she provided and what you will see is worth the time. Highly recommend.",
          "Short & sweet tour but worth it. I went to learn more about our history as a Canadian. Living in BC we don\u2019t always pay attention",
          "We stopped by the Citadelle since it was almost next to our hotel. Entrance fee is $16 pp. Great historic tour!",
          "As a history teacher I really enjoyed this tour! We had the added bonus that the regiment was practicing for the Canada Day performance! Thank you so much for a great tour!",
          "Knowledgeable guides. Great review of some of the USA's history with Quebec. Spectacular views. Well worth the time.",
          "This was a wonderful and informative tour! Sarah, I believe that was her name. She is practicing her English by being a tour guide. Sarah is hilarious and very well-informed. It's just about an hour which is a perfect amount of time.",
          "The tours are informative and the whole area is fascinating. Plenty for families - well worth a visit..",
          "Ceremonial honour guards with rifles in hand are a reminder of the military heritage of this great city and country. La Citadelle also contains a residence of the Governor General of Canada. Lots to see and information to absorb. Beautiful centuries-old construction.",
          "We went on the Governor General tour and the fort tour (each about an hour), and they are worth it. The governor's tour was free, and you get to tour the public rooms of the residence. We learned about her and her predecessors. When she is not in QC, you get to go on a patio",
          "but for the entrance, the citadel was gated and under construction so could not get up for the views. The entrance is just to the side of the St Louis gate were you can have a free quick peek or a guided tour...not free. We did not take the tour but watched drills for a bit.",
          ".. and the best bit was a free tour of the governor general's house which gets you into the main compound for a brief look without having to pay for the separate tour. The art collection is really good as are the rooms. A real find.",
          "We attended the changing of the guards and it was a lot of fun, marching band, bear hats, goats, what else can you ask for? The ceremony starts at 10am so make sure you\u2019re early to get a seat. Note: if there\u2019s rain in the forecast they might cancel the ceremony so plan",
          "We had a great tour guide, Megan. Her enthusiasm and peppy personality made this tour fun. We lucked out and got to see the first changing of the guard for the year. Quite the ceremony.",
          "We visited the Citadel over the summer and had a good time! It helped us learn a lot about the history of Quebec City, and was very enjoyable. Since it is still an active military base, you can only go around with a tour guide, which made it all the more better. Our guide Yo was",
          "We went here on a whim and so glad we did. We lucked out and found parking in the citadelle, it is free and good for 2 hours which is all you need. Admission comes with a 1 hr tour, we were bummed to learn that changing of the guard ceremony happens one week after we left but",
          "As an active military base, there is not much inside that you can see. Most of the tour was outside the buildings. I loved the historical background and stories that our guide provided. Great tour on a beautiful day.",
          "A fascinating visit. The walking tour around the citadel is very well done with just the right amount of information given out. An hour is perfect for this tour",
          "Visited the citadel on a Saturday. You have to go on guided tours as it us a working military base, if you visit on the weekend you can also see round the Govenors residence. Both guides were excellent. Alexandra (apologies if I have the wrong name) kept a sizeable group",
          "The tour of the Citadelle was very informative. You get to hear about the base, some Quebec history and get a great view of the city. Don't miss this tourist stop.",
          "It took me a few moments after thinking the soldiers were short to realise they were girls under those enormous hats. Great stuff.",
          "the changing of the guard something different, just managed to get their with moments to spare. watched them then march down the streets. Great",
          "Tour guide is very informational with interesting history about the Citadelle. See the trainees and guards. See Baptist the goat (mascot) Learn the story behind this!",
          "There is limited access to the fort, since it's still an active base for the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment. If you are planning your trip to see La Citadelle, you might want to plan it around the changing of the guard from June 24 to Labour Day.",
          "It gives a beautiful view of the city Staff is courteous and knowledge. We did not see the change of guard as it was to start on 21st June. Walked around it. Feel if you can walk and have time do it yourself",
          "Very friendly and efficient staff and tour guides. Nice buildings and history with great views of the town. Building work in progress at the moment",
          "Worth visiting - guided tour only - but tour is a bit light on substance. Nevertheless interesting to see - particularly the canon that commanded the St Lawrence River.",
          "Our tour guide was terrific - he had great knowledge of Canada's history and he had a great sense of humour so we were kept laughing throughout the tour. Although we were too early in the year to see the changing of the guard, we did get to see them rehearsing, which was fun. I",
          "We were going to spend our time in the museum and not take the tour. But the museum was so interesting that we did decide to take the tour and were so glad we did! We learned and saw so much. Our guide was fantastic! Best of all, we were able to observe the soldiers practicing",
          "Important to understand history of cities you visit and this has all you need to know. Tour and guide were great and the museum is filled with even more to explore.",
          "Incredible tour with so much history, highly recommend you take this tour. Second time I have done this tour. 3 years ago I had the most incredible tour guide and I was so impressed.",
          "went with the family. wonderful way to spend the day. guided tours explain the architectural details and history of the fort. the museum of the \"van doos\" is AMAZING. absolutely amazing. in the very back in a chamber with medals from decorated soldiers.",
          "If your in Quebec City, you must take a tour. Our tour guide Megan was excellent and very knowledgeable. The museum was also very well done and I learned a lot.",
          "This old fortress is in a commanding position and has a very good feel about it.The Museum contained many interesting articles and the tour guide was very clear and concise.Also saw the summer residence of the Governor General.",
          "Was a great place to see history in action. Our guide Sam was on his very first tour and was great!!",
          "We had a fun, through, and entertaining tour of the Citadelle. Our guide, Jean-Phillipe, did a wonderful job giving the tour in English. He was funny, engaging, and provided a lot of interesting history about the fort and the area. He answered everyone's questions cheerfully",
          "If you like military history or the history of Quebec City in general this is a great stop. Interesting and informative. Excellent views of the city as well.",
          "Very good tour of this ancient fortress. The views from above are worth the trip alone even if one doesn\u2019t do the paid tour.",
          "We did the tour on a freeeZing windy day and still managed to enjoy it. Our guide was a lovely young girl (can\u2019t remember her name but it was something like Simran). We was very knowledgeable and had a great personality. She even took us to see the shooting of the noon",
          "Interesting fortress housing lots of military items. Take the fact filled tour and enjoy the panoramic views of old Quebec City. The efforts made to remember all of the fallen Canadian soldiers is touching and impressive.",
          "Visit a live working army barracks, and hear stories of the beginnings of the buildings, their occupants. Learn about the birth of Quebec City, its battles and fortunes. Entry fees apply and includes the museum and guided tour. A great way to spend a few hours",
          "Excellent guided tour and museum of the old Citadelle in Quebec and the role it played in fortifying the city of Quebec. Still an active military installation for the Royal 22nd Regiment of the Canadian forces. Highly recommended.",
          "The citadel is the centre piece of old Quebec and while you can stroll the boundaries, the only way to access this working military base is to take the 1 hour guided tour at $16 Canadian. Well worth the cost. Tour takes in a few highlights and provides access to the regiments",
          "The exhibit on the history of the 22e Regiment is very interesting and informative. Very well presented. Highly recommend",
          "My husband & I recently visited La Citadel, taking the approximately one hour guided tour (the only way you can see it because it\u2019s an active military base). Our guide was very informative and knowledgeable about Quebec history as well as life at the Citadel. We liked going into",

          "An important part of Quebec history, now an active military base. The tour is a must to understand the site. Very educational and interesting.",
          "It\u2019s been enjoyable walking the long way going up from the castle using the steps with the great view of St Lawrence river, a good exercise though after a sumptuous breakfast @ Frontenac. What a beautiful view, a spectacular experience and don\u2019t miss it while you\u2019re in the Old",
          "Still an active facility, the large fort preserves many of the buildings and structures from hundreds of years ago. Enjoyed the included tour very much, and learned about the local history.",
          "Set at Cap Diamant, La Citadelle is the largest military fort in North America. Begun by the French in 1750 with most of what we see today built by the British to defend the city. Beautiful views of the St. Lawrence River from here along with views of the Chateau Le Frontenac",
          "History lesson here! Kids of all ages along with adults will enjoy this historic site. First come the French, then the British! Why was the Citidel selected to be built here Ali g the St Lawrence river will be answered plus so much more. Fascinating!",
          "For people interested in Quebec history, relations between French and English in Canada this is a place to be. Sign up for a tourist guide tour. At 12.00 there is a tour in English but also separated in French. We had Jean-Philip and he was excellent! He had an answer for all",
          "Coco did a fabulous job expalinging tonus on the group tour for ACI It was very cold that day but we learned alot!",
          "We climbed the hill to the citadel twice. The tour was far more interesting than I expected. We enjoyed the history of the regiment.",
          "Home to the 22 Regiment since 1920, the Citadel is an example of British and French cooperative efforts to protect Quebec City from attacks via the Saint Lawrence Seaway. An active army post it serves to educate all on its history and its museum depicts the role of the 22",
          "You have to go on a guided tour as this is an operational military base. The tour involves quite a lot of walking. The Citadel is on a high piece of land and can be wind swept. You will enjoy your tour more if you are wearing appropriate foot ware and clothing for the",
          "Great Museum with WW1 and WW2 artifacts. Wonderful view from the terrace. Worth the tour and worth visiting the museum.",
          "Terrific museum and guided tour of the Citadel. The Canadian Army should be proud to have this facility on display.",
          "Theres a lot more to see and learn af the citadelle than you may think walking in. The weather was not fantastic the day we went, and a good deal of the tour is outdoors. Great tour guide too. Interesting galleries inside as well. Just wish the gift shop attendants told us to o",
          "I learned a lot (not hard since as an American, I don't know anything about Canadian military history). The outdoor tour affords spectacular views of the city, and you get to see the oldest military building in Canada. The museum exhibits are moving, informative, and",
          "Very much enjoyed the uniqueness and architectural design of La Citadelle. Even though it was winter, we could still clearly see it from our hotel. Really beautiful part of history!",
          "We wanted just to walk around the fortress without visiting the museum but most of the places are restricted. Probably after the renovation it gets better.",
          "We took a tour of the Citadelle which was very informative. Lovely chatty tour guide. It was really cold and snowing so everything was white and beautiful. Great tour and museum.",
          "So firstly a confession - I am a bit if a tragic when it comes to all things militaire. Our guided tour was a wonderful experience, even on a crispy -21C Quebec morning. Great to understand the history of La Citadelle, but also to learn the story of the Royal 22\u1d49 R\u00e9giment, the",
          "Toured fort recently on a one hour guided tour. The view looking over Quebec City and the St Lawrence River was breath taking from the fort. Lots of history to learn about and a Museum worth taking in after your tour all included. Bring your camera!!!",
          "On a visit to Quebec City I had the fortunate opportunity to be invited to tour the La Citadelle de Quebec. As a Revolutionary War re-enactor and U.S. veteran I got to visit the interior of the barracks, magazine and the Royal 22nd Regiment Museum. Now I have to admit that most",
          "Our tour guide led us through the citadelle with humor and enthusiasm. The museum, for which you need a tour ticket, is worth the price for it\u2019s affecting exhibits covering the 22nd Regiment\u2019s deployments. World War I personal items were poignant. It is bracing to be reminded",
          "The tour guide was very knowledgeable and gave great attention to details. She was very easy to understand and we learned a lot of the history of the Citadelle.",
          "Visited the museum inside, and took the outdoor tour. It was really interesting to hear all the history.",
          "I did not read the website completely. Although the museum is pretty cool and has many items to look at and read about I was so disappointed when we found out that the changing of the guard(which was my primary reason for going) is only done June 24 through the first Monday in",
          "Citadelle is still an active military site so its guided tour only (in French or English). The tour takes you to different buildings on foot outside, so I\u2019d recommend to wear comfortable shoes and bundle up during cold months. The guide was friendly and knowledgeable.",
          "I came to the Citadelle on a very cold December day and took a tour with Yo, she was really knowledgeable, accommodating and enthusiastic and did a fantastic job explaining the history of the site. I totally recommend visiting and taking a tour too.",
          "The stone structure of La Citadelle de Quebec was not even there in its present form during the battle for quebec. Most of it was built by the British after the war and the surrender of the french had already happened.. Subsequently it never saw action and its battlements have",
          "It is quite a long climb up from the Chateau Frontenac to reach the citadel. Still it was a sunny day and we were hoping to see the Sherman tank, that is kept there. This, however was nowhere to be seen. We learned later that it is undergoing repair and hidden from view. The",

          "What an amazing experience. While vacationing in Quebec City this summer, we took the recommendation from several people to visit the Citadelle. Nestled in the outskirts of Old Quebec City, the Citadel is home to the Royal 22nd regiment. This is an active military base, museum",
          "Take the time to visit this active base and learn more about the history of Quebec and Canada. Great views of the city and the river!",
          "This structure sits on the tallest hill in Quebec City and is so huge, it overwhelms the entire highest plateau. From here, you can view the harbor, the upper and lower city and as far as the eye can see. It is no wonder that foreign ships would be terrified to see the cannons",
          "Situated at the top end of the town, overlooking the river below, you can feel the history of this structure, and you feel for those that had to live here, as with all buildings of this type, practicability overcame the need for stunning architecture, but if you love militarism,",
          "Quebec City is fun of history and the Citadel is a big part of that history. The Citadel is located in the Upper Town. To reach the fortification, it is a 15-20 uphill walk from the Provencial Parliament building. There are markers with useful information as well as canons,",

          "Very nice tour that takes you around the grounds of the Citadelle. The guide was very knowledgeable and had a good sense of humor. Great views of the walled city. Can walk from the Citadelle to the Plains of Abraham and then down the side of the cliff back to the Old Town.",
          "Very interesting Citadel and a free guided tour is provided in English and one in French. There is an admission to the Citadel but not much......Parking is easy. The grounds are nicely maintained as this is an active military base but really set up for the tourists. Do this one",
          "The Citadel is a must see while in Quebec. So much history of the Van Doo's. Their nick name was given to them by the British, who had trouble pronouncing 22..Vingt-Deux. I don't know if the unit liked it or not, but they decided to keep the name. Please remember that this",
          "If you\u2019re going to visit La Citadelle, you should definitely go and watch the changing of the guards. The precision with which they match is truly remarkable.",
          "We enjoyed the changing of the guards very much! The guards\u2019 precision were absolutely flawless!! If you\u2019re in the area, do not miss out! But get there early to get a good spot for pictures!",
          "I am not a history buff, but I loved the guided tour of the Citadel. The guide was always informative and, at times, appropriately somber and humourous. The Citadel is a fortress built by the British after defeating the French in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The tour",
          "The ceremony is only held from June 1 to September 1 and is definitely worth the price which includes a tour of the fort.",
          "it is easy to join the tour here. The guide is passionate about her work and led us to see all the viewpoints",
          "I enjoyed our tour guide. He was a local and his love and pride for Quebec was infectious. While not the most \"wow-ing\" place in Quebec, it was enjoyable and I recommend it for people who enjoy history or the military. You get some good views of the city from the Citadel, and",
          "You will need to wait until next year to catch the impressive changing of the guard. Without the morning ceremony the Citadel is still worthwhile. But the guard change makes for a fine experience. Tips... Best spot for watching the ceremony is at the west edge of the parade",
          "Visiting the Citadel is must imho, with the tour you get lots of information, not overloaded and its all interesting plus you get to look around the citadel which is a must, fascinating.",
          "It\u2019s amazing how camouflaged the Citadelle is with its grassy mounded rooves. Walk all around it and down into some of it. There is a military museum inside but you don\u2019t have to go into it if you don\u2019t wish to (fee to enter). Informative displays in the entrance tunnel explain",
          "There is an interesting exhibit in the main building. However, if you want to visit the Citadelle grounds, you must go on a 50 minute tour. The tour is nice and it included in the ticket price but this may be useful information for planning purposes.",
          "We got there at 9:30 am so that we could see the changing of the guard ceremony. Unfortunately, all of the preliminary information of this ceremony was incorrect. The last day that the ceremony takes place for the year is September 3. Nevertheless, we had a very knowledgeable",
          "We wanted to visit the Citadel, and it was steps away from our hotel. By pure serendipity we were just in time for the Changing of the Guard, do try and see this - 10:00am start. The guided tour was by turns interesting and humorous. Many of the museum exhibits are enlightening",
          "Only spring and summer time until first Monday of September, they do the old custom ceremony everyday at 10 am. It\u2019s 40 minuets long outside. It\u2019s worth to watch. I personally liked the royal goat! He was well trained and looked proud to be part of the ceremony. There is",
          "Quebec City is the real place for family vacation. Visited most of the tourist attractions. Place is so clean, driving is easy as most of them are so professional. I would suggest start your trip from ls chateau frontenac as this hotel is right in the middle of the attractions.",
          "Our tour guide was friendly and it was a very interesting history lesson. It\u2019s an hour long tour which I would say is the perfect length. Almost all of it is outside though, so I imagine in the winter it wouldn\u2019t be as enjoyable.",
          "Nice place, great scenery but a little hard to get to. There are lots of stairs and hills so be prepared for a great workout. You\u2019ll need to eat some crepes for energy!!",
          "We went to the Citadelle to see the changing of the guard at 10:00 in the morning and also the flag ceremony the took place on Wednesdays (normally at 5:00 but moved up to 4:00 mid August due to sun going down quicker). The ticket to see both events also included the museum",
          "The changing of the guard of course run with military precision, including making sure everyone got a good spot to view the event. They even allow photos with their patient mascot afterwards",
          "We took a tour of the Citadelle in late August and our tour guide, Thomas, was fabulous. Engaging and very open to taking questions, especially from kids. His humour and easy manner made the tour very enjoyable. The Citadelle is so full of history and has beautiful views of the",
          "Amazing ceremony of changing the guards (90 years tradition!), starring Batisse. Also, amazing history for this regiment, well documented in the museum. Plus, an excellent coffee \ud83d\ude0a. Of course, a gift shop is there as well. Very good decision to be there at 10 AM for this",
          "Even though we live a few hours from Quebec and have been here many times, we never took the time to tour the citadelle. It was very interesting and the tour guide was funny and knowledgeable. Definitely worth doing once.",
          "We decided to see the changing of the guard, and it didn't disappoint! I have always wanted to see this in London, but haven't gotten there yet, so decided to see it at the Citidel. The precision and ceremony of the guards was amazing. I would recommend that you arrive by 9:30am",
          "Seeing the changing of the guard is worth waiting for. As someone from the States, it reminded me of .... nothing. I have seen the tomb of the unknown soldier in DC, but this is pageantry. It\u2019s so precise and sharp. And yes, even the goat is spot on.",
          "My husband and I took a one hour tour which was interesting and then the next day we decided to see the Changing of the Guard. Remember to keep your receipt so that you don't have to pay to get in twice! Batisse (the goat) is the star of the show ... and the band! To",
          "The only option is a guided tour. The guide was quite nice but the tour fell flat focusing only on limited parts of the fort and equal time on the story of the regiment stationed there. After 1 hour I was wondering why so little of the fort\u2019s history was the subject of the",
          "Changing of the Guards is a must do part of the Citadelle experience. So you must go early enough to see the changing of the Guard ceremony at 10am. It last about 35min., marching, a band, a goat, it\u2019s a big deal inside on parade grounds. Then you go right to a guided tour. Only",
          "We took a tour on a Saturday morning, and although it was a large group, the leader kept our attention and did not disappoint. The weather was misty and cool, but it there were still beautiful views of the city from this high point. The history of the Citadelle was very",
          "We got a real insight to the Citadelle de Quebec. Went on the 1 hr guided tour around. The tour guide was knowledgeable and able to answer any questions. Our pass allowed us to return the next day to watch the changing of the guard ceremony. You get a fantastic view of the",
          "My wife and I visited here during a guided walking tour of Old Quebec. We were able to go into the old living quarters within the fortifications. Our guide was great at giving historical background and context to everything we saw. Very good experience overall. Wish we had",
          "This is our third recent trip to QC and we\u2019ve been to the Citadelle many times, but took a tour for the first time last week. Guides are very knowledgeable, and it costs about $15can for a ticket - for the Citadelle tour only, which is about 45 mins long. If you want a tour of",
          "Did the English tour of the fort. Guide was good but as English was her second language spoke rapidly. Good history of the fort and some great views of the city from the ramparts.",
          "Beautiful old buildings and grounds. Interesting small museum. Changing of the guard ceremony quite elaborate and interesting. Nicely narrated tour of the complex with enthusiastic tour guide. Highly recommend for history and military buffs as well as anyone else.",
          "Check it out - just get there early (and make sure you observe the time limits for parking spaces) if you want to check out the changing of the guard!",
          "Tours offered in English and French. Great historical perspective. It was a nice thing to do on our first day as it informed much of what we\u2019d see after. The view alone is worth the price of admission.",
          "There is a lot of Canadian history! It\u2019s amazing to recap what we learned in school years ago! The tours are free! The tour is about 1 hour and well worth it, the guides know there stuff. The changing of the guard is something to witness, and if your real lucky you may get to",
          "We headed over here after breakfast one morning. They only do this once a day and only certain months during the year. The admission price includes entrance to the museum (which explains their great history) and also the changing of the guard and an hour tour after if you choose",
          "We enjoyed our visit and would go again. The staff was very kind and the museum was well put together.",
          "While I can\u2019t rate the hotel, as I didn\u2019t stay there, I did have a meal there and enjoyed the luxury and beauty of the place. The view is astounding, so go over and have a meal or a drink if your in Quebec City! Gorgeous!!",
          "Fun and colorful 35-minute ceremony that requires a substantial uphill walk that is rewarded with chairs and a grassy knoll before the parade ground. Can\u2019t beat those bear hats and regimental goat!",
          "The Citadel is a fascinating historic site. However, as an active military complex, you are not allowed to explore it except within the confines of a tour. The guides are genial, but the content is limited in content, and pass through interesting buildings very quickly. There",
          "Be sure to be at the Citadel by 10:00 a.m. for the changing of the guard. There is a Goat major who escorts the 22nd Regiment's goat mascot and is part of the ceremony. There's lots of marching about, stomping and shouting of orders along with a band. The Citadel is an actual",
          "Get there before 9:30 to see the changing of the gaurd ceremony. The ofocoap ceremony starts at 10, but you need to get there early to se all that goes on.",
          "The Citadelle is a beautifully maintained fortress high on a hilltop with views of the St. Lawrence River and the Chateau Frontenac. It has an informative museum in it, but the highlight is the 10 a.m. changing of the guard ceremony. Make sure to arrive no later than 9:30 a.m.",
          "Awesome display and kept the young ones entertained and interested in what was going on. Of Particular interest was the company mascot. A must see with youngsters in tow!",
          "Although a bit of a climb up to the parade ground -- very worth the hike! Precision drilling of troops in traditional ceremony. Complete with bi-lingual explanations and military music.",
          "We visited the Citadelle on a rainy summer day. We were not aware that it was an active military base. We had a guided tour (in English). Our tour guide Sarah was great! She said she was learning English so be patient with her - we thought she did a fantastic job. She was",
          "Very interesting 1-hour tour. Note the Citadel is an active military base so we couldn't explore everything. Interesting info on the history of the Citadel and its place in Quebec City history, as well as the brave service of the 22nd Regiment. Beautiful views of Quebec City and",
          "The tour guide was informative and funny. She kept a good pace of the one hour tour. Questions were encouraged and answered well. The view was spectacular as we had a clear sunny day. We plan on returning for the changing of the guard ceremony since the receipt can be used for",
          "We were so lucky to visit while they were changing flags with a ceremonial parade. Super special. Fun to walk back to the Frontenac Terrace along the stairs on the water.",
          "If you like that sort of thing, seeing the changing of the guard at the Citadelle is very worth your time. I have been to that ceremony in London at Buckingham Palace. and it is almost always a mob scene where you have to get there very early to be anywhere near the ceremony",
          "A musr see when in the city of Quebec! Entry fee is great and is the tour! Kids enjoyed it as it was not too long. Museum is absolutely fantastic. Really enjoyed it with the family of little ones and tweens!!",
          "We decided to do this tour too late to see the changing of the guards but they said we could still come back the next day with our receipt to watch it, which I thought was a bonus (except for us it was the last day). The tour guide was very informative and we learned a lot on",
          "Watching the changing of the guards was cool and there was a tour that was included with the entrance fee. Tour was an hour long but wished we could have gone in more buildings or explored the grounds freely. Due to it being an active base, we were not permitted.",
          "We really enjoyed watching the changing of the guard ceremony. Be sure and be there early in the morning if you want to see it. Also, they offer free tours of the grounds.",
          "This was a very impressive ceremony and he band was terrific. The goat was amazing too, the goat was incredibly well behaved. All in all, though, we felt that this was twice as long as it needed to be. Other's may disagree, of course, but it seemed to move very slowly and",
          "The 2 hour walking lantern tour will take you here in the early evening when it is cool and quiet. The walk includes private passage into the old fortress. We missed the changing of the guard.",
          "It took place at 10 am. The goat mascot is brought out. There is a small museum inside. You can have your photo taken with the goat or the guards.An interesting formal ceremony",
          "Interesting to walk where so much history was made- very special - good to learn about our history in our country - recommended for all - family friendly",
          "The Citadelle and its tour are great. This is an active military installation - try to be there for the changing of the guard. You learn about the brave Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois who serve in and served in the 22d R\u00e9giment. A fabulous view of the St. Lawrence River.",
          "We had a very nice guide (Jessica) who walked with us. It felt like all the tour guides were very knowledgeable of the site and its history, as well as the history of Quebec City itself. While you do not have access to all the buildings on site, the few that are open to tours",
          "We took a guided tour of the Citadel on a very warm day. The tour guide was sensitive to the heat and found shady spots to stop and talk about each feature. She was full of information about the place, military history and stories about Quebec. It was fun and informative!",
          "We had heard that the changing of the guard at the Citadelle started at 10am however we were very surprised to find out that it cost $16/adult, $14 for seniors. Having just been to Ottawa, you could see the changing of the guard for free on the lawns in front of the Parliament",
          "We took the English speaking tour with Felix. He was very informative and mixed in some humor which is always nice. Basically it\u2019s a tour around the grounds with the ability to go into a few buildings. The museum is cool too. The views of the city are spectacular. We missed the",
          "One of the most interesting things to do in Quebec. A nice walk to the history of the city and also a place for many photo shoots. There is an English guided tour every 30 minutes. It worths!",
          "We arrived at the Citadelle in time to watch the changing of the guard at 10 a.m. So glad we did! It was a great ceremony reminiscent of the changing of the guard at Buckinham Palace. The only negative was the loud-speaker. I assume the person speaking was letting us know",
          "If you have some time in Quebec City and have a love of history, stop by the La Citadelle de Quebec. The changing of the guard is very cool to watch. Keep an eye out for their billy goat mascot, Batisse. There is also a very interesting museum on the 22nd Regiment and it's",
          "I visited on a sunny Sunday morning and thoroughly enjoyed the Changing of the Guard. The band was great and Batisse the goat was adorable. While I didn't stick around for the tour, I walked through the museum before the ceremony and found it moving. Next time I'll hit the tour.",
          "We went for the 10am Changing of the Guard ceremony which was quite interesting to see. The ceremony is conducted in both English and French though this is the only French only regiment in Canada.The ceremony takes about 40 minutes and then is followed by a 45 minute tour of",
          "We visited on a beautiful sunny morning and enjoyed the spectacle that is the changing of the guard. (We used to live in London and yet have never seen the changing of the guard ceremony at Buckingham Palace!) The guided tour afterwards with Evelyn was informative and",
          "Attractive location. Guards stationed at the location are as big an attraction as is the actual location. Worthwhile visit",
          "We took our grandson their to see an active military base that has a changing of the guard ceremony. The pomp as circumstance was wonderful!! The military band was great. Afterwards we had a tour of the facility. Our guide, Leo was informative with a nice sense of humor!! It",
          "A must-see visit. We were almost put off by the weather - it promised rain - but the ceremony went ahead with ominous clouds overhead. Great spectacle, and followed by a tour of the citadel. Vive le R22R",
          "While I didn\u2019t see the Changing of the guards, I did walk the perimeter of the Citadele and it certainly was built to last. High stone walls surround the Citadele and it is atop of a hill overlooking the Chateau Frontenac. You can see the advantage of this place over the years",
          "If you visit Quesbec you have to spend time in and around the Citadelle. It's not only military historie. It provides a magnificient view over the city and the river. It shows with how much vision engeneers choose this location and how well they build it. MAGNIFICIENT!!",
          "We had a 1 hour in the Cittadelle by a young guide. Interesting information was shared on the history of this building and the people that have been in the building in the past. Queen Elizabeth is also queen of Canada and has delegated her power to the Governor General (canadien",
          "We went in the morning to see the Changing of the Guard with our 2 teen daughters. I think they liked the goat the best. It was very interesting to watch though. Unfortunately it started to rain on us so we skipped the tour and did the museum. My husband liked it a lot but",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the tour of the Citadel. It was $16 per person. The tour guide was excellent giving great information and details regarding the buildings and the history.",
          "Loved it, and every Canadian should visit to help better understand its history. Beautiful vantage points of the river. And the military history..... brought a tear to my eye all the Canadians that fought and died. I would highly recommend watching the changing of the guard,",
          "All 315 steps of it. That\u2019s what it said at the bottom, and they were right, because being pedantic, I counted them. It\u2019s certainly worth visiting, although we didn\u2019t go inside as we preferred to enjoy the sunshine, but we read all the plentiful information along the walls",
          "If you pay to go inside you can see the changing of the guard, you can have an outside tour of the grounds and also a tour of the governor's residence. Well worth it for a family price admission. The views are amazing. The changing of the guard is fascinating to watch. Good",
          "My sister and I went over to the Citadel to see the changing of the guard ceremony. We had low expectations and weren\u2019t thrilled that we\u2019d have to pay an entrance fee to see the ceremony. However, it was well worth the cost and the guided tour that was included was fantastic.",
          "This is a great look at history and invasions across the St. Lawrence River. The view of the river is fantastic with lots of things to see you. This is a must see for anyone that comes to Quebec city.",
          "Excellent tour. Great views and interesting facts. Learned a lot. A good way to spend an hour. Very organized.",
          "we went to the city with the kids and we had a fantastic experience. We recomend La Citadelle to everyone.",
          "Just walked around the outside of the walls and was not much to see. Probably should have paid for the tour to go inside and get the history of the place. Maybe next time.",
          "The changing of the guards is a long, strange process, but Batisse the goat (the mascot of the Canadian army) who is a glorious, majestic creature is part of the ceremony. Hang out by the left side to be able to get in line to get your picture taken with him as quickly as",
          "Get there early if you wish to have a great viewing spot for the changing of the guard. following the changing of the guards, you must tour the grounds which will give a great sense to the history over the last few hundred years.",
          "The citadel is an interesting fort. However, it does cost money to get in since you need to take a guided tour. If you are travelling on a budget, you can walk along the outer wall for free and the scenery is wonderful.",
          "It's a working Army military barracks that is home to the 22nd Regiment - the only French speaking regiment in Canada. Thank you for letting me be a part of your history that you obviously take great pride in. DO go to see the changing of the guard. The tour is both informative",
          "There are many things to do at the Citadelle, including seeing the changing of the guards ceremony, touring the Governor General\u2019s residence, and touring the Citadelle. It is definitely worth seeing the changing of the guards, which is at 10am everyday. It\u2019s a good idea to get",
          "Even if you have to hike up the hill from old town to visit, La Citadelle de Quebec is worth the effort. A very impressive changing of the guard ceremony, lots of history, and an excellent military museum make this attraction a must while in Quebec City. (...not to mention the",
          "We did the grounds tour and watched the changing of the guard that occurs 1 time a day. The guides are young and very nice. The tour was just the right amount of time and very interesting.",
          "Interesting place that is yet a military base. All visit is guided and the changing of the guard is very peculiar (10am). You must see also the Governor House that is a must.",
          "Took a tour and learned tons of history as well as came back another day to watch the changing of the guard. It was a once in a lifetime for me and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Everyone was quite pleasant and made the experience all the more fantastic!",
          "We were really impressed with the guided tour of La Citadelle. Our guide Sabrina was exceptional in her knowledge, friendliness and humor. The grounds are beautiful and the tour is interesting. The museum inside which is included in your tour price is also a nice touch. The",
          "The Citadel is a working army base and as such you just can\u2019t walk around unless you are on either of 2 tours. The 1st is a tour of the Governor Generals house and the second one of the Citadel. We were able to go into the museum and outside the museum. You can\u2019t see much",
          "An active military post! We did not get to get into any buildings because it is an active base. History of area was good but tour guide, did not know a lot. Folks taking the tour knew more. We found it interesting and worth our time",
          "We arrived for the 10:00 a.m. for the changing of the guard. It goes on for 45 minutes. You could actually see the show by being there for 10:30 a.m. as the best parts take place the last 15 minutes. Afterwards you are divided into groups for a guided tour. This was very",
          "Chose a cool day and conquered the falls early in the morning. We had a great time. I was able to snap a pic with a rainbow! We parked near McDonalds and saved some money!",
          "The Citadel is worth the trip. You will take a guided tour of the grounds to learn the interesting history of the the Citadel. Our guide was extremely nice, but I forgot her name. She told us that she was still learning English, and to be patient, but she spoke very well and was",

          "Visiting La Citadelle de Quebec was time well spent on our visit to Quebec City. The guide was very knowledgeable and shared the history, past and present, as well as answering questions. Very interesting was the history of the goat and its significance. The strategic purpose",
          "Saw both the Citadel and the Governor's House. Guided tours for each for excellent. Great history, wonderful views and very friendly guides. Saw the practice for the retreat of the guards - marching band, gun salute, etc - fantastic.",
          "A must see for visitors to Vieux Quebec! Precision marching performance of the changing of the guard. Most impressive. Strongly recommend to visitors(adults,children). Within the fortification there is a nice museum and a small store to purchase souvenirs such as cast painted",
          "Even having seen changing of the guard before this is still well worth doing. The fact that the fort is still active adds to the experience and the guided tour was excellent, make sure you catch one of these. Views of the city have to be seen from the top!",
          "Very large fort, wear your walking shoes! Interesting history, beautiful views & an active fort. There is also a war museum inside & changing of the guards.",
          "I went for the changing of the guard at 10 am which lasted about 35 minutes. The mascot is a goat with golden horns and I have never seen such a well-behaved goat. I\u2019m glad I got there in time for that. Right afterwards, there was a guided walking tour by Jeanne. She was quite",
          "We learned so much here. We came for the changing of the guards at 10am and tour afterwards. Because it\u2019s still an active military base, you\u2019re not allowed to walk around by yourself. Come early for free, but limited parking. Great views of city and St. Lawrence river.",
          "Lots of history and interesting even if history isn't your thing. Take the walking tour as you will have access to more locations and our tour guide was great. Changing of the guard at 10AM every day, but show up at least 20 minutes early to buy tickets. Or buy your tickets",
          "We enjoyed our tour of La Citadelle de Quebec. They offer tours in French and English. The tour takes an hour and it is worth it. There are some great views of the city from the top.",
          "An absolute must if you come to Quebec City. The tour was informative and the changing of the guard was a unique experience for me. (Even my 10 year old son was engaged the entire time.) The family pass was very reasonable for the experience.",
          "Due to rain we missed the changing of the guard at the Citadel...but we pressed on with a small group to tour the rest of the museum. Of note is that this is a working military installation and you are lead through the area with a guide. We enjoyed the stories and historical",
          "Very informative tour with our English speaking guide who explained the history and the present day workings of the Citadelle.",
          "Unfortunately I got into the citadel a little late. The changing of the guard starts at exactly 10AM but I didn\u2019t know that and I missed the first 20 minutes.Still from what I saw, it was just what you would expect of such an event. The precision of the regiment was absolutely",
          "Worth visiting inside and out. The history in general is interesting, but you\u2019ll learn about the military angle of it as well. Make sure to look around, the different angle of view on the old city are sweet. Enjoy,",
          "The changing of the guard is not to be missed very well done and a good value. Quebec should be proud of their fellow Canadians.",
          "A great stop, we were actually lucky enough to see the \"changing of the guard\" while we were there. That was very interesting to see. You can also take a tour throughout but we chose not to and just to walk around.",
          "If you are going to go, get there for the changing of the guards at 10 am.. seeing the goat mascot is worth it! After the ceremony you can have your photo taken.",
          "We did the tour. It was about an hour. The only buildings you can go in are the museum and old jail. The rest of the tour is walking and listening to the guide. It is very minimal walking. My sons (17 &20) found it very interesting and engaging.",
          "A wonderful place to walk for an afternoon to see the old citadel. Many people here speak only French so please be respectful and try and understand that this is their first language. There are many bilingual people in restaurants and hotels.",
          "......you don't need to go back. After visiting the Citadel in Halifax, we had quite high expectations for the citadel in Quebec. The Quebec Citadel is a military base for the Royal 22nd Regiment and this will affect your visit tremendously. You are only able to move from",
          "Hard to find entrance. We walked almost the whole length of the Terrasse and back before giving up and finding a steep hilll up to what we thought was the free fort. You can walk the outer perimeter but you can\u2019t cross anywhere because 40ft of inner fortification! So",
          "I do recommend that you make the time to include this venue. Good history and views from the wall overlooking the terrace area and river. Included in the tour is a visit to the Governors House which we didn't do. We were too early for the changing of the guard ceremony which",
          "I will be honest and say I had low expectations for this, but the visit turned out to be great! The way to see the Citadel, since it's an active military facility, is to go on a tour. The one hour tour is led by an informative guide who gives you a good amount of history",
          "We paid to watch the guard change and for a tour. What a waste! The French tour seemed to go places but our English tour only got to go inside 2 old buildings. They said we couldn\u2019t go other places because it was a working military base. You can wonder all over other bases. It",

          "Visiting the Citadel is worthwhile even if you are not a military buff. The tour is well down giving you the history of both Quebec and the fort. The views from the ramparts are wonderful. The changing of the guard is fun to watch. It is performed on the parade grounds so",
          "The visite to the site and the museum of Citadelle was very informative for us. We spent about 3 hours for the visite of the site and the museum.",
          "The citadel is very interesting... designed on a European plan to defend the river and against ground invasions... and outmoded almost as soon as it was completed (due to better cannons). The view is amazing! Quite the defensible position. The down side is that you must take",

          "We had an excellent guide and I enjoyed the tour. Sadly I missed the changing of the guard. It takes place at 10:00 AM but on that day a new commander was installed and it was a private ceremony. There are fantastic views, particularly when you stand by the big canon named",
          "We were not disappointed with this place. A professional and fun place for an interesting experience. How proud we are to be Canadian.",
          "Our guide was very good and enthusiastic. The tour last about 1 hour, mostly outside. It was interesting and has amazing views of the port and city. The museum would only be of interest to military geeks :-) You can also visit the Govenor General's quarters for more history",
          "Very impressive Changing of the Guard ceremony daily at 10:00am, weather permitting. Never tire of the English Red Coats and Bear Skin hats in this most French City.",

          "When we got there, the skies were overcast and rain was predicted. In buying our tickets, we were told they were non-refundable and the changing of the guard would be cancelled if it rained . Initially, during a very light drizzle, the ceremony continued. It was only when the",

          "All tour are guided as it is still an active military base. The history is interesting focusing mainly on the 22nd regiment which is based out of the citadel. The only disappointment is that it is very difficult to get good pictures of the citadel because of how it is designed",
          "Decided to start our tour of Quebec City by watching the changing of the guard. We were fortunate to have clear skies and a slight breeze while enjoying this time-honored ritual. The whole ceremony lasts thirty minutes so be prepared to entertain young kids the last 10 minutes",
          "All tours are guided because this is considered an active military installation. Our young tour guide Tomas was very nice. The tour is heavy on Canadian military history of the 22nd regiment and the history of the fortification. Some nice photo opportunities are available during",
          "Just missed the Changing of the Guard, but we still had had a nice tour. Our guide Saida was knowledgeable and had to really projected her voice since it was a windy day. You get a real nice history lesson about the military- French, British and Canadian.",
          "July 1 is Canada Day. A big celebration. If the Holiday falls on a week-end, the Holiday is observed the next Monday. That is why we did not get to see the Changing of the Guard ceremony even though we went to the Citadelle on 2 different days. The soldiers and others did",
          "We took the guided tour and then saw the changing of the guard, very much like what you see in front of Buckingham Palace, but in French! A loudspeaker explains the major portions in both French and English. Bring bottled water if you go on a warm day.",

          "The daily changing of the guards is a popular event. Most of the people watch from the west side of the parade ground just outside the visitor center, but you are facing east in full sun. Walk around to the right and go to the other side of the ground and you will get a better",
          "Finally after the 2009 fire that nearly razed this building, the rebuilt version is about to open in the near future. They have done a great job on the walls and the copper roof is spectacular. We will visit inside during our next visit for sure!",
          "To drive 15 hours and pay for an outside tour that includes going into one small building is extremely disappointing. There was no changing of the guard or any drills what so ever. No mascot, no band.There was nothing to see except for some brick buildings. The kids were bored",

          "5 stars for the view. 3 stars for the tour that was just so-so. You have to be interested in military history and want to ask questions. Since it\u2019s a military base, you have to take an hour long guided tour.",

          "This is not the most interesting fortress, but it certainly represents an interesting bit of history and is well worth a visit. Be sure to sign up for the tour - without a guide, most areas of the fort will not be accessible. The fort museum is worth a visit as well.",

          "From the outside this place looks amazing. Good to walk around and appreciate the architecture of this building",
          "Interesting. Try to see 10am changing of the guard.  It's quite involved. Good if you like learning history of French Quebec too.",
          "Very beautiful to have it preserved for generations to come.",
          "This historical citadel is a part of Quebec City that is a must-visit to learn about the history of Quebec City and the integration of the French-speaking soldiers into the Canadian military, and even fighting for Britain.\n\nThere is a small \u2026",
          "Fun place to visit. Great history for adults. The kids weren't as entertained. I would have enjoyed more of an interactive experience.",
          "Beautiful, historical and fascinating. The tour of the Governor's residence is free, though there are pay attractions as well. We didn't see the changing of the guards in the morning, but I've heard it's a very neat spectacle.",
          "The changing of the guard was cool. The museum inside was small, but interesting. Be prepared to walk up a pretty steep hill to get to the Citadelle.",

          "Nice visit. Interesting. Nice view and place. The guide (forgot her name, sorry :( redhead) was absolutely fantastic.",

          "La Citadelle da Quebec is a very nice to walk around",
          "Took a carriage ride full of information and humor. It helped that the weather was perfect.",
          "Nice experience walking around. Highly recommend the 1 hour 15 minute citadelle tour by foot to delve into the history of the fort.",
          "The citadel is the centre piece of old Quebec and while you can stroll the boundaries, the only way to access this working military base is to take the 1 hour guided tour at $16 Canadian. Well worth the cost. Tour takes in a few highlights \u2026",
          "Amazing architecture. Good views of the city. Ceremonial changing of the guards every day at 10am. Tours in both English and French. Entry fee 16 dollars Canadian for adults.",

          "Fantastic museum that comes to life in the mornings.\n\nThe museum and the shop is fantastic! But the parade at the Citadelle is something worth waking up and coming out to watch it. Come early, and you\u2019ll have good spots. If late, you\u2019ll end \u2026",
          "Must see place.  Be there at 10am for the changing of the guard and stay for the tour.  lots of history and lots of interesting information about this oldest fort in North America",

          "Great visit, super interesting tour. Worth going.",
          "Only guided tours available. I wish I could have explored at my own pace with maybe audio guide available. My wife had a leg injury and walked slow and could have in no way kept up with the guided tour speed, even though she wished to go inside and go around.",
          "Home to Canada's famed VanDoos. A must see.",
          "Lots of fun great gift shop",
          "Good place to visit  in Quebec city.  A lot of information.  You can easily spend couple hourse if you want to explore it throughout.  Anyone interested should also explore the plains of Abraham. The two sites are closely related. I also \u2026",

          "An historic location at the Citadel of Quebec. From the top of the hill you can see the St Laurence River and it\u2019s easy to picture the British fleet waiting to capture the city.  \n\nThe Citadel is both a museum and the home to a military \u2026",
          "If you want the best view of Quebec City, this is the place to go.  Had a scenic overlook that was flanked by 17-18th century cannons.  The tour guide was nice and it was enjoyable to visit a place that holds such distinction for French Canada.",

          "Amazing place.  Guides are great",
          "Highly recommended to be there at 10am to watch the Change of the guard activity. Be onsite at least 30 min earlier for security check and ticket purchasing. If you drive - spare another 30 min to find a nearby parking slot.",
          "Great tour with fun guide (Zach). The view of the city was impressive and it was interesting learning all the history.",
          "Fantastic views of the city. Really interesting history guided tours.",
          "The walk up was easy and comfortable as there was a lot of soothing wind from the seaside. \n\nHowever, part of the Citadelle was under reconstruction and I believe it will go on for another year or two, so we could go to the top where the flag flied.",

          "Great Canadian historical site. Changing of the guards is a fun thing for the kids to see",
          "Not much to see. Access is confusing and you don't get to see much. It looks more interesting from a distance than actually at the site. Lots of construction going on as all walls are newly rebuildt and nothing original is left.",
          "Wow beautiful City look like mini London.... Beautiful Architecture... Beautiful and careing people highly recommended city",
          "As an active Canadian Forces base, there are restricted areas that you can't visit. Very interesting place to see if you are interested in the area's history.",
          "Guided tours only, as the place is an active military base, so a guaranteed informative one-hour activity for families, plus all the time you wish to spend in the museum and a good gift shop. The tour includes some indoor and outdoor time, \u2026",
          "Amazing ! A must visit ! An education and a learned appreciation for the Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois! \u2764\ufe0f",
          "We only did the outside walking portion, but the views are incredible and to walk on the grounds where so much history was made is humbling. We walked the grounds from Plaines d' Abraham over to the Citadelle.",
          "If you can go here when they have the changing of the guard it\u2019s awesome to watch. It\u2019s a great tourist attraction and great for families. The day we were there they were not having it but I\u2019ve been before And it\u2019s  great",
          "We bought the guided tour (no self-guided tours available) hoping to see the quebec city from the top but the walls were unfortunately under construction so we couldn\u2019t get a view of the city (however, as the tour guide Zachary showed us, \u2026",
          "Absolutely love Quebec City. I come here at least once a year",
          "We had a wonderful tour guide for the outdoor experience and tour. This is still an active military base - one of which the individuals still speak French on base. The indoor museum is also very fascinating. Be sure to check it out as it is \u2026",
          "Was looking for a scene in Korean drama, accidentally found free parking here. And then we always park there the first and second day. It is a hidden parking zone lol.",
          "Interesting historic place with some beautiful views. If you get the chance, try the guided tour as it brings lots of color and detail to the magnificent scenery.",
          "It\u2019s very nice place",
          "At least see once.  Plan ahead! Arrived at 845am and got the last parking on base.  Change of Guard starts at 10am. If it's always the same,  I recommend watching on the left side (facing parade ground/ gift shop behind you).  Pro: closest to gaurd. Con: not facing front.  Or on the right. Pro:  facing front.  Con: furthest away.",
          "Main tourist attraction, lots of food places, things to see and do. Nostalgic Old Town Quebec.",

          "One of the most picturesque place in North America !",
          "Our tour person was Ina rush, like she was late for something, inside the fortress was boring nothing really interesting to see, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you like to be there go for it, waste of money in my opinion.",
          "Ceremonies are nice but some guides are better than the others so it all depends on how lucky you are.",
          "Do not leave Quebec City without visiting the Citadel and taking a guided tour. Put this on your list of top 3  things to do here. Historically and currently significant and visually beautiful. Recommend going at 9 AM when it opens to take \u2026",
          "Walking in a such big history place is just amazing!",
          "Sarah was an excellent tour guide. Her English was wonderful.",
          "The tour was a bit underwhelming. The guide wouldn't let us enough time to read the signs which was annoying. However the only way to enter the citadelle is to do a tour and that in itself is worth it",
          "One of the best places I have been too. Our tour guide was really funny and great at explaining. The staff was nice and it's amazing well kept. The view you see there with the lawrence and dufferin terrace and fronrenac is insanely breathtaking.",
          "Beautiful walled city...a great way to spend the day exploring.",
          "Fantastic Views, but windswept and quite a hike to find the entrance from the riverfront walkway. There is no signage to tell you that the only entrance is quite a hike up around and behind the Citadelle. It is best approached from the \u2026",
          "Very interesting but we picked a rather windy day to visit.",
          "Fascinating but didn't like that the only tours were guided",

          "It was a very interesting place. Cannot believe it, There was a royal goat!",
          "Really beautiful, good music and nice restaurants",
          "Very cool. Worth a visit",
          "I love Quebec City and loved the changing of the guard at La Citadelle. The exhibits are informational and you must go on a tour as the tour guides explain a lot of the history. Since you are on an active military base, you can't roam \u2026",
          "So much history and so many amazing things to see!",
          "Great location to see view of old town quebec. A place to sit and reflect  currently undergoing major renovations.",
          "The tour is great. The guides are knowledgable and tell you all kinds of intetesting tidbits. As an important part of Old Quebec City this is a must. Daily changing of the guards. July 3rd every year is Freedom of the City... About 100 bearhatted soldiers march to City Hall... Learn about the resident goat too!!",
          "It's interesting to learn the history behind this still- active military base that is situated strategically above the Old City of Quebec.",
          "Great place, nice architecture and views",
          "Must visit place. Well maintained and the arrangements are great.",

          "A beautiful old fort still active site to see",
          "Worth a visit if you're in Quebec, especially if you visit early for the changing of the guard at 10am (during summer only). The tour guide was very friendly and knowledgeable. The only reason I give it 4 stars is we didn't get to see the military equipment and vehicles this time around (2018) which they had back in 2006.",
          "Nice place to visit exempt for the amount of people visiting each day! A lot less visitors in the fall and winter months.",
          "The tour is great and the fort is very easy to get around.",
          "Great historic site. A must do visit.",
          "Great tour even though it was snowing and no views! We have two boys 8/11 who weren\u2019t with us but they would\u2019ve loved the history and the grounds. Our guide was super informative which helped me learn a lot about the local history/fort. About an hour long, if I was back in the summer I\u2019d want to explore the grounds again.",
          "Amazing views and very informative tour. Also got to see a cannon being fired. I'd recommend the 11am tour so that you can see the cannon fired at noon.",
          "Good tour and historical information of the citadel.  You can take a femch ornenglish tour throughout the citadel.  You cannot walk around alone as it is a operational base.  Very cool!",
          "Nice tour and GREAT views of the Chateau and Levy.",

          "Took the tour at the citadel and was super interesting to have the history explained by our guide.  It was fun for the kids as they got to see and hear the history. We had a great view as well of the Chateau Frontenac as well from one of \u2026",
          "Had a fantastic tour by Ian. It was much better than I expected it to be.",
          "Went in the winter, i believe it would be much better in the spring or summer where you can actually see the changing of the guard. It was decently expensive $16 just to see inside of two buildings. The only option is a guided tour. They \u2026",
          "Gorgeous is all I can say. Definitely take the stroll around the fort for a great hike and varying a gles for photos.",
          "Interesting fort with a very interesting history. Get there early to see the changing on the guard, colorful and fun changing of the guard. Loved the Royal goat. Also the only way to walk around the citadel is through the official tours, \u2026",

          "An amazing place. I loved Quebec city very much",
          "Great history lesson, amazing views and humbling to see the names of all the battles that the regiment has fought in etched into the buildings. Our tour guide Sarah was nothing short of awesome.",
          "We did the tour of the Citadelle in early January. The weather was perfect (sunshine and no wind) and we saw one of the best views of the city. The tour guide was extremely friendly, professional, and extremely well educated on the history of the city. I\u2019d definitely recommend this if you have a couple hours to kill before a meal.",
          "So interesting. We learned a lot about the government and early history in Canada.",
          "Historic place, nothing fancy here of you have seen other forts of the era like Fort Knox in Maine. If you have questions to ask, hold it for guide and not for the attendants.",
          "Great place to spend a few hours on a rainy day. The museum is choc full of interesting information and the free guided tour is very well done.",
          "This place is very busy in the morning for the change of guards. This is an active military base so don't be messing around here. But if you just want to take peak at the change of guards you can do it at the gift shop and no tickets \u2026",
          "Very impressive, a lot of things to do near by. Highly recommend it",
          "Definitely worth a visit if you're visiting Quebec city. The Citadel is still an active military post, so you can only visit it with a guide, but tickets are cheap, the museum has a lot of Canadian Military history and there are some beautiful views from the Citadel walls.",

          "Our guide was great and explained things very well. Very interesting.",
          "This place is amazingly beautiful. There is nothing not to like.",
          "Very beautiful place located in heart of Quebec city. Downtown around. Lots of cafes, where you can sit and take some bite. The castle itself is awesome, lots of military from 22 regiment that you can see and talk with. The old prison would be nice to visit to feel the atmosphere of that time",
          "Excellent tour and very friendly and knowledgeable tour guide. Great view of the city from above.",
          "If you are interested in authentic Quebec, the Citadel is one those wonderful places that truly is the \"real thing\".  The buildings embody what was \"high tech\" in the 1800s.  Being a citizen of the US, it was fascinating to hear the tour \u2026",
          "An interesting and fun way to learn about old Quebec.",
          "MUST VISIT PLACE. Wanna go back to old times? Great place to visit.",
          "A must see when visiting Quebec. Lots of interesting history mixed with an active military base. Don't travel all the way to England to see the changing of the guard! Just drive on up north and see the real deal for less.  The folks who work here were very nice and answered all my questions. Great outing for the kids.",
          "It\u2019s really good place to know about History of Quebec.",
          "Not much to see.  Museum was just ok.  Views were nice.",

          "Really nice old fort.  Grounds are well kept and the tour was nice as well.  As stated by other visitors, try to get there for the 9am tour.  When it's over they will have the changing of the guard and admission will give you access to \u2026",
          "At 10am guard change is sheduled, this is a paid event. If u want to see it free then wait towards the end u will get a glimpse of final moments in front if door \n\nThere is a free limited parking spot hope\nIt helps",

          "Quebec was a wonderful City. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit there.",

          "Not the best for little kids but very interesting",
          "Awesome historical monument and great views of the river.",
          "Great to enjoy the changing of the guard and an informative and well judged museum to the Royal 22nd Regiment with some interesting exhibits.  Be aware this is an operational military base and you can\u2019t simply wander around - 1 hour long \u2026",
          "Another interesting place to visit, did the walk around the wall not forgetting the great number of steps to climb, unfortunately there was some scaffolding to be seen.",
          "Walking in the Quebec City old town just like walking in a city of Europe.",
          "An integral part of the Canadian history, especially the Quebec region. It is an active military base. They have guided tours, in French, and in English.\n\nFrom inside, you get to see a lot of cannons, military buildings, and a great view of the river. Then you have the museum.  Can easily spend a couple of hours here.",
          "Very good prices, good variety, I seldom go there.\n\nYou can find stuff that you cannot find in some other places.\n\nGood quality stuff!\n\nI would go there every time in the future for all their products as they are very good.\n\nEvery time I go \u2026",
          "I'm sure the place is worth visiting but make sure you get there early. It closes right on the dot and they wouldn't let us in a 1/2hr before it closes. We got a chance to walk around a little bit and take some pictures. I believe the view is tremendous from the top side.",
          "Citadel and d place around Abraham's park were in the vicinity of Fairmont and near the museums n fortifications in upper Quebec. Great open spaces n the view is wonderful. Adds to the history of quebec city. Parking at times can be an \u2026",
          "An absolute must see for tourists and locals! Beautiful.",

          "Great view, great tour guide, very interesting tour",
          "I was expecting to be blown away by the Citadel, but it was mostly underwhelming. You're required to take a paid, guided tour because it is an active military encampment, but you don't really see much of the facilities aside from the ones that have been converted into museums.",
          "Wow! One of the most amazing views! It is where the Saint-Laurent is the narrowest!",
          "Always a must-see when in Qu\u00e9bec City. If I were to ever move from Toronto, Qu\u00e9bec City would be at the top of my list of Canadian cities!",

          "Consider that there are to many stairs if u don't want to pay for the funicular",
          "This is a military base, so you won't be able to see it without committing yourself to an 1.5hr tour. Wish they advertized it at the bottom of the hill",
          "Nice place to visit, fresh air, good excercise to take a walk during weekends",
          "Beautiful historic site.  Definitely must see while visiting Quebec.   We went during the winter but I can see ourselves returning during the summer and just relax on the surrounding grassy area and make a day from it. The views are breath taking from there.",
          "Very charming lots shops and places to eat.",
          "Gigi was a nice tour guide, however most of the tour was outside and it was pretty chilly. I was hoping they would show more buildings from the inside, like they did in Fort Henry, Kingston. Still worth it, at least for the views of the old town from the top.",

          "Quebec City is amazing. Especially the lower City.",
          "This is a very cool place to visit. It is actually a live military base and you can see Canadian soldiers around. If you get a tour with a tour guide, the views are amazing and you learn a lot, but it isn't cheap. However you see so much \u2026",

        "wiki": "The Fairmont Le Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac, formerly and commonly referred to as the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac, is a historic hotel in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The hotel is situated in Old Quebec, within the historic district's Upper Town. The Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac was designed by Bruce Price, and was built by the Canadian Pacific Railway company. The hotel is presently managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts.\nOpened in 1893, the Ch\u00e2teauesque-styled building has 18 floors; its 79.9-metre (262-foot) height is augmented by the 54 m (177 ft) elevation it sits at. It is one of the first completed grand railway hotels, and was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1981. The hotel was expanded on three occasions, with the last major expansion taking place in 1993.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nThe Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac is situated on 1, rue des Carri\u00e8res, at the eastern edge of Old Quebec's Upper Town, built on the promontory of Quebec, a raised mass of land that projects into the Saint Lawrence River. The hotel property is bounded by rue Saint Louis to the north, and rue Mont Carmel to the south. Terrasse Dufferin is a terrace that wraps around the hotel from the northeast to the southeast, overlooking the Saint Lawrence River. Two public roads run through the hotel, rue du Tr\u00e9sor, and rue des Carri\u00e8res. The hotel building was designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, known as the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac National Historic Site of Canada. The area was designated as a National Historic Site in January 1981.Located near the edge of the promontory of Quebec, the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac is situated near several major historic attractions within the historic district of Old Quebec's Upper Town. To the northeast of the hotel lies the Ursulines Monastery of Quebec, a 17th-century monastery founded by a missionary group of Ursuline nuns, and another National Historic Site of Canada. To the south of the hotel lies the Plains of Abraham, a historic area within The Battlefields Park, and the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Another major attraction south of the hotel is the Citadelle of Quebec, situated at the atop Cap Diamant, an elevated point of the promontory. The Citadelle serves as an active military installation for the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as a secondary official residence for the Canadian monarch and the Governor General of Canada. East of the hotel lies the Terrasse Dufferin, and Old Quebec's Lower Town directly below it.\nThe Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac was not the first hotel built on the site. The first hotel was built during the 1780s, and was known as the Ch\u00e2teau Haldimand, named after the Governor of  Quebec who ordered the hotel's construction. That hotel was later demolished to make way for the present hotel.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nThe Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac is one of Canada's grand railway hotels built by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The Ch\u00e2teauesque architectural style used throughout the hotel would later serve as a template for other Canadian grand railway hotels erected in the late-19th to early-20th century. The central fortress-like tower design is derived from medieval chateaus found throughout France's Loire Valley. Ch\u00e2teauesque elements include the hotel's asymmetrical profile, with steeply pitched roofs, massive circular and polygonal towers and turrets, ornate gables and dormers, and tall chimneys. The exterior base of the hotel is largely made of grey stone ashlar, with steel framing running up the building, Glenboig brick cladding. Materials that make up the interior of the building includes mahogany panelling, marble staircases, carved stone, wrought iron, and glass roundels. However, as opposed the other Ch\u00e2teauesque-styled buildings found in France, the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac did not utilize elements of Italianate architecture, instead placing a greater emphasis on Gothic elements. The hotel also draws certain elements from Victorian style of architecture, with rich polychromatic surfaces throughout its exterior.Built in 1892\u201393, the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac was originally designed by architect Bruce Price. Price's plan called for a horseshoe-shaped hotel, made up of four wings of unequal length, connected at obtuse angles. Public rooms made up the majority of the first two floors of Price's designs. The original proposal called for a square structure, however the completion of the Terrasse Dufferin led to the development for a more picturesque building. Since its completion, the hotel has undergone several major expansions and renovations led by several different architects and architectural firms. William Sutherland Maxwell led two major expansions to the hotel, one in 1908\u201309, and another in 1920\u201324 (co-led with his brother, Edward Maxwell). Renovations in the 1990s was led by the Arcop, an architectural firm based in Montreal. The hotel was again expanded in 1993, with the addition of a new wing.\n\nAccess to the hotel's main entrance is marked by several porte-coch\u00e8re with large dormers and a cupola. The porte-coch\u00e8re leads guests into the hotel's centre courtyard, as well as the entrance to the hotel's main lobby. The building stands 80-metre-tall (260 ft), containing 18 floors primarily made up of guest rooms and other hotel amenities. After the addition of the tallest tower in 1924, the hotel became the tallest building in Quebec City. It remained the city's tallest building until 1930, when \u00c9difice Price was completed just northeast of the hotel. Although several buildings in Quebec City are taller, the hotel continues to hold a prominent position in the city's skyline, as it is perched atop a tall cape overlooking the Saint Lawrence River.\n\n\n=== Facilities ===\nThe Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac includes 611 guest rooms and suites spread throughout the hotel building. Eight executive suites were renovated into specialty \"themed rooms\". Most of the suites are themed to the heads of state and government that have visited the hotel, such as the Trudeau-Trudeau Suite, named after two Canadian Prime Ministers, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and Justin Trudeau. The Churchill Suite and Roosevelt Suite are two suites named after attendees of the First and Second Quebec Conferences, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, respectively. Other suites themed in honour of world leaders include the Charles de Gaulle, named after the former President of France, and the Elizabeth II, named for the Queen of Canada.Aside from world leaders, the hotel also offers suites themed to Alfred Hitchcock, a director who filmed much of I Confess at the hotel, and William Cornelius Van Horne, the second President of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and Celine Dion. The Celine Dion Heritage Suite utilizes an Art Deco style throughout the suite, decorated with images from Dion's family photographer.A number of rooms at the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac are also occupied by restaurants and other food-based services. As of 2018, three restaurants operate within the hotel: 1608 Wine and Cheese Bar, Bistro Le Sam, and Champlain. As a part of Fairmont Hotels and Resorts' larger \"Bee Sustainable\" program, the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac hosts four queen honey bees in hives on the hotel's rooftop garden. The honey is harvested three times a year and is used by the hotel's restaurants. The hotel has nearly 70,000 honey bees producing 295 kilograms (650 lb) of honey per year. The hotel's rooftop apiary also operates a pollinator hotel.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nIn the 1870s, a restoration project began in Quebec under the British governor general of Canada aimed at restoring the capital to its former 17th century look. One of the contributors to this project was Lord Dufferin, who supervised the construction of the old city wall and many public buildings that followed the theme of old, medieval, European Quebec. Dufferin also made a plan to reconstruct the Chateau Saint-Louis which was located on the cape where the Chateau Frontenac currently stands and served as the home of the French governors from 1620 to 1834. Dufferin's plan did not take off until the City Council and the Board of Trade adopted the idea and planned to instead construct a grand hotel on the site to attract upper-class tourism to the area, but after failing to finance its construction, businessmen from Toronto and Montreal with connections to the Canadian Pacific Railway took control of the project.\n\n\n=== 1890s\u2013present ===\nThe Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac was completed in 1893, and was designed by American architect Bruce Price and overseen by William Van Horne, the Canadian Pacific Railway's general manager and a key developer of the Canadian railway hotel system. The hotel was a part of a series of Chateauesque-styled hotels built for the Canadian Pacific Railway company during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The last of the Canadian Pacific Railway's Chateauesque hotels was completed in 1908, leaving the rival company Grand Trunk Railway to continue the trend. The hotel was expanded in 1924 to designs by William Sutherland Maxwell. The 1924 expansion saw the addition of the hotel's central tower. The hotel was named after Louis de Buade, Count of Frontenac, who was the Governor General of New France from 1672 to 1682, and again from 1689 to 1698.\n\nThe World War II Allies' met during the First and Second Quebec Conference (in 1943 and 1944 respectively). During these conferences, officials including American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, discussed strategy for World War II.In 1953, this hotel was used as the filming location for the final scene in Alfred Hitchcock's film I Confess, featuring Montgomery Clift and Anne Baxter.In 1993, the hotel saw another expansion, with the addition of the new wing that included a pool, fitness centre, and outdoor terrace. On June 14, 1993, Canada Post issued 'Le Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac, Qu\u00e9bec' designed by Kosta Tsetsekas, based on illustrations by Heather Price. The $C0.43 stamp features an image of the hotel building, and is perforated 13.5 and printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.In 2001, the hotel was sold to Legacy REIT, which is partially owned by Fairmont, for $185 million. The hotel was renamed the Fairmont Le Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac in November 2001, shortly after Canadian Pacific Hotels reformed itself as Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, taking the name of an American company it acquired in 2001.\n\nIn 2011, the hotel was sold to Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge. Shortly after acquiring the hotel, Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge announced an investment of $9 million for the restoration of the building's masonry work, and to replacement of the building's copper roofs. The company further announced another $66 million investment for general improvements and renovations throughout the hotel. When the roof was being replaced, an image of the roof was printed on polypropylene safety netting and hung from scaffolding to hide the refurbishing project from view. The extensive renovation saw conference rooms expanded, restaurants remodeled, modernization of the lobby, and the gutting and rebuilding of three-fifths of the hotel's rooms.The hotel was featured in the 2016 Korean drama Guardian: The Lonely and Great God.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Quebec City\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nKalman, Harold D.

A suspension bridge over the crest of the falls provides access to both sides of the park.  There is also an aerial tram (Funitel) that carries passengers between the base and the top of the falls. In the summer the park hosts an international fireworks competition with the falls as a backdrop.During summer months, the falls give off a yellow glow due to high iron content in the waterbed.The Ice Hotel was located at Montmorency Falls for its first year.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Falls were the site of a key scene between the lead actors in the 1947 film Whispering City, which was filmed on location.In his poem \"Sleep and Poetry\" (1816), John Keats says that human life is \"a poor Indian's sleep / While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep / Of Montmorency.\" Recreational sleighing on the frozen falls is recorded in Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem The Montmorency Waterfall and Cone of 1835.\n\nThe Falls appeared during the finale of The Amazing Race Canada 5 in 2017 and were the site of the episode's first task in which competitors scaled a cargo net suspended over the Falls.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCanyon Sainte-Anne\nCharlevoix tourist train\nList of Waterfalls\nS\u00e9paq\n\n\n== References ==\nR\u00e9seau S\u00e9paq, Parc de la Chute-Montmorency Historic Site brochure, 2003.\n\n\n== External links ==\nVivre Au Canada.tv: Montmorency Falls during summer\n \"Montmorency, Falls of\" .

          "This a well worth a visit as the falls are very impressive. It is very popular though and we queued for quite a while to get into a parking lot. There are lots of trails in the park and you can also zipline if you're brave enough.",
          "Traveled by bus which was easy to use. Coffee shop not open at the top, but we went on the cable car to the bottom where there was an open cafe and gift shop. Lovely views, great walks, spectacular falls.",
          "Even visiting on the coldest day of the year (-30 C with windchill), it was an awesome experience. Tram ride and view from the suspension bridge are truly memorable. We can't wait to return when the ice melts!",
          "Worth a visit if you have the time in Quebec City. I would spend a few hours there and get a view of the waterfall from a number of different vantage points. The volume of water the pours over the falls is incredible. Get up close and hear how loud the waterfall is, I fount that",

          "This is a nice thing to do while you're in the area. We ate hot dogs and burgers and a \"Food cart\" type place right outside near the falls. Then we walked across the suspension bridge. I do recommend it. Zip lining is available, though we did not do that.",
          "Was recommended this place from friends and went to visit it, it is a beautiful place to see with some activities available to do, I did not do the zip line but it looked a lot of fun, I went around the waterfall and the park, beautiful autumn scenery, took the stairs down to",

          "There were mounds of ice along the trail to get to the falls which made for quite dangerous walking. It was also windy and very cold (I am a skier) From the bridge you can see the top of the falls but no spot could you appreciate the entire falls-there appeared to be a platform",
          "Welcome center was closed for the season, so we drove to the top. Lots of parking access and lots of people, Short walk to the Falls so we walked across the 'sky bridge' which provided excellent views of the Falls as well as the local area. Nice and easy walk to the Falls",

          "First thing to say is to go there before the month of October. Everything seems to close down for the season at the end of September.. The falls are still open for around $8.00 or so admission. Parking on top is scarce because it is a suburb area. If you look you can find",

          "My wife and I travelled from historic Quebec City to the Chute-Montmorency in about 15-20 minutes. We had recently visited Niagara Falls and although this attraction could not compete with Niagara from a volume and sheer size standpoint it was stunningly gorgeous in its own",

          "While driving from Quebec to Montreal, we stopped along the park (across the falls) to view them from a distance. Just lovely. We saw a suspension bridge (but my fear of heights kept me at a distance). Beautiful majestic falls, worth the visit. There are walking trails to view",
          "A must do while in Quebec, taller than Niagara Falls (having seen both Falls, Niagara is still more impressive) but Montmorency Falls are spectacular, there are several options for walks around the falls, plenty of food options, and toilet on the outside of the restaurant as you",
          "We went as part of a tour. Pay the extra fee and take the cable car to the suspension bridge, the view from up there is worth it, as well as exploring the top of the falls. There was also a gift shop/dining up there, but we did not have time to go in. If you just look at the",

          "We had great weather for our visit. It was in the mid 20*c and fall colours were beautiful. We took the tram to the top of the falls from the parking lot at the base. The visitor centre at the top had lots to see and the views from the various lookout areas were stunning.",
          "Spectacular sight. We got a to see it as part of a bus tour of Quebec and the surrounding area. You can walk up to and around the Falls. Beautiful scenery. The falls is right next to the Basilica of St Anne. Gorgeous architecture and engineering. A great stop to see 2",
          "Went to the Falls on a cold rainy snowy day but was still stunned by the sheer size of the Falls and the ability to explore from lookotu points, bridges n stairs leading all the way from the top to the bottom. Excellent opportunity for tons of spectacular photographs.",

          "Tip: Drive to the Manoir House unless you just want to ride the cable car! This site is a beautiful natural site. And the views are breath-taking. If you're the adventurous sort you can ride the zip line. Be ready to get your exercise walking to and across the suspension bridge",

          "The beauty of Mother Nature cannot be overstated. The Parc is nicer on the high side. Not sure why they have to charge for the use of the gondolas if one already has paid for the parking. There was a lot of work going on when we visited, so probably would look nicer on a sunny",
          "This waterfall is just a short drive outside of old Quebec and well worth the trip! We walked along the trail to get closer to the mesmerizing waterfall and see the view from the base. We did not do the cable car to the top, but drove up to see the view from the bridge at the",
          "I visited in September. It was a little chilly, but I really enjoyed the walk up the stairs and the view from the falls. Nice little insta photo-up moment, wasn't too crowded that time of year. If you're expecting something big and flashy, this isn't it, but if it at all appeals",
          "We were so lucky with gorgeous weather. We had a Uber driver take us to the falls from the center of town and it was about a 15 minute drive. So worth it!",
          "We took a tour to these falls and they seem very overrated. The falls were large but the walkway and man-made structures around it detracted from the beauty. I was very disappointed with this tour. The gift shop was small.",
          "We accessed the Falls by taking the city bus from the train station. Very inexpensive. The bus costs less than $5, (access at one of the shops in the train station) and we arrived at the top of the Falls. There are cupolas from which to take pics, a zip-line that crosses the",

          "On a recent visit to Quebec City, we are glad that we made this roughly 30 minute drive to visit the Montmorency Falls. It was a nice complement to the time we spent in Old Quebec. It's always impressive to see major water falls, and this one did not disappoint. We did walk",
          "See it from the ground across the river, see it from the gondola, see it from above on the bridge, see it from a walkway below, etc. Yes it is just a waterfall, but an impressive one due to its height not width. But the options of how to see it varies widely. I'm sorry we didn't",
          "Don't get there after 4pm as the service at the ticket counter and staff is pretty poor. The Falls aren't that spectacular. We didn't get to go on the gondola because our tour was running late. We got to see the falls from the gondola grounds. The bus driver redeemed himself",

          "The Falls are very impressive. Not as wide as Niagara Falls, but higher. There are opponents for zip lining and taking a cable car. I only had about an hour in my schedule, so sadly, I didn't get to do either of those, but it was a lovely fall day and I am glad I didn't miss",

          "Ok. It not exactly Niagara, but a nice waterfall. Took the cable car to the top. The suspension bridge over the falls is cool. Climbed down and back up the stairs, which gave multiple photo ops. 500 steps each way but worth it. The park also offers great views of Quebec City",
          "We chose the option of viewing the falls from the bottom, a brisk walk from the building that also hosts the train station. It's possible to get close enough to enjoy a cooling mist on a hot day. There is a wooden stairway that leads to the top, but we chose not to use it. Some",

          "You could fill in a whole day I\u2019m sure we had half a day and probably cut ourselves short- we used the HoHo bus which sort of restricts when you can go/leave but is probably the cheapest way - I wanted to have a crack at the zip line but time and \u2018counter instructions\u2019 didn\u2019t",
          "After I went all the way down, I decided to cross over the bridge, to the other side, when I saw the double rainbow! It was amazing!",

          "About 7km outside the old city walls, is a pretty falls with hikes to the upper and lower area. A suspension bridge over the falls allows for some interesting views of the city. There is also a hotel and cafe at the top of the cable car ride (for a fee).",
          "Not quite as impressive as Niagara Falls, but a nice scenic view. You can walk over the bridge to take photos and it wasn't too crowded as some reviewers suggested.",
          "A couple of weeks ago, I visited the Chutte Montmorency. Since we last came here in May, 2019, there has been a gate that was placed near the McDonalds north of there. The price is still fair and worth it. We took a walk down the stairs and took some pictures. You won't regret",
          "The stairways were closed and the cable cars crowded which limited our ability to view the falls. It is interesting but not very special",
          "Was a rainy day but would be really crowded in hot weather. Bus stopped t foot of falls for photo/toilet stop then up to the top. Had time to walk to the zip wire where views are good and then over the top of the bridge. Plenty of walks to do if it\u2019s a fine day when at least",

          "Must see during Quebec trip! Easy walk over the falls and possibilty to Zipline over it. Can be very crowded in the afternoon",
          "Spend an hour and see it all. It is worth the 15 minute cab ride. Don\u2019t go on a multi hour tour. Beautiful park especially during the color in the fall. The waterfall is impressive. If you like a work out then try the stairs. Have the cab drop you off and pick you up at",

          "Absolutely amazing. Unfortunately too fast. Deal is great in that you get link to video of your ride that you can download and there is no extra charge. You do have to walk towards start again to return zipline equipment.",
          "Very nice park and beautiful waterfall. Staff very helpful and courteous. Worth the cost. We took rideshare car to site, but if planning visit without tour company, know may be difficult getting rideshare back. We ended up taking taxi which was called by guest services, but",

          "The water was thundering off the waterfall as there had been so much rain. There is a bridge over the top so that you can see the force of the water. Very busy place. Although it seemed a lot to pay to go and see it it was worth the money.",
          "We visited on an \"off and on\" rainy day, wanting to get some outdoor activity in spite of it. It's touted as being almost 100' taller than Niagara but not as wide. We initially parked at the bottom and realized the footpath to the stairs where you can walk up to the top was",

          "Even though none of our group speaks French, due to the kindness of Quebec folk, we were able to get directions to the falls via city bus (only CAD3.50 each way) and a straight shot from town on the 800 bus. It was an uncrowded Sunday, so it was a relatively quick trip. This",
          "In the Fall the colors are magnificent especially when juxtaposed to these beautiful falls. We traveled from the west side of the city on bus 800. At C$8.75 each for seniors this was a cheap way to get there to see this site. If it\u2019s raining you can still see it but bring rain",

          "Recent rain meant a great fall of water, was surprised to hear it is a longer fall than Niagara. Worth the visit. The thrill seekers can take a zip line but a pleasant boardwalk for everyone.",

          "This place is beautiful, but you will probably spend 2-4 hours here depending on your group size and activity choices. We took the cable car up to the top, then walked across the suspension bridge to the zipline. On the way, we stopped at viewpoints for pictures. We went on the",

          "They charge you 4$ for parking + 8$ gor entrance/person. This alloes you for a 10 minutes walk to the base of the waterfall, after you have parked and enter the park, you realise you have to pay again for the cable car... We have taken cable cars for less then half the price,",
          "Well worth the drive or bus tour to see these falls. The cable car ride to the top has awesome views of the falls. There is a zip line across the falls, the cost of this was $27.00 Canadian, about $21 is US $. The manor at the top was lovely also. The stairs are currently",
          "Stunning views of falls taller than Niagara! The bridge across the top is a bit daunting for those with vertigo, but spectacular. Lots of room for walking & exploring around the falls, and pictures from the cable car are encouraged. Wonderful afternoon!",
          "A senior couple will pay $18.00 to gain access and park. If you want to take the gondola ride to the top of the falls, you must pay an additional $14 per person. The alternative is to get back in you car and exit the site for a 10 minute drive to re-enter at another location",
          "Stunning falls with a rainbow at the end. It is $8 per person to take the cable car up to the suspension bridge. The bridge gives an extraordinary view above the falls. There is a restaurant located at the top.",
          "Not Niagara but really impressive with a well designed park to get around. It includes a huge flight of stairs you can go down to get wet and view the falls from below and get exercise climbing back up again. The suspension bridge over the top is a nice touch and the more",
          "The Montmorency Falls was named by Samuel de Champlain the founder of Quebec. Looming 83 meters high, some meters higher than Niagra Falls. We took a cable car to the top and observed the falls and surrounding beauty for above.",

          "I booked the zip line experience for my daughter and myself on a recent trip to Quebec. The entire experience was great! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Keep in mind there is a weight limit which can vary each day depending on weather conditions. Luckily I made the cut",
          "We took a guided bike tour with Cyclo Services from Old Quebec out to Montmorency falls, which included admission to the park and the cable car ride. We found the experience to be totally worth it. After taking the cable car to the top, we then walked across the (very solid)",

          "Costs CA$20 for admission for 2 people. If you want cable car ride, it's additional cost. I believe you have to hike up to the bridge above the falls. Being that it was raining, we didn't want to walk. So basically you can actually see the falls while driving up Route 138",

          "The zip line was so much fun! I thought it would be scary since it\u2019s literally over a waterfall, but it goes at such a nice speed and you really get to experience the view of the magnificent waterfall. There\u2019s two zip lines at once, so you can go with friends. It\u2019s $27, I wished",
          "We really enjoyed this trip although we had a beautiful sunny day. We parked at the bottom and took our time walking up - 477 steps with multiple landings for resting and taking pictures. There's also a cable car if you can't do the climb. There are places to picnic at the top",
          "This site has a zip line and that is awesome because it is running over the fall. Other than that Fall it self is not very beautiful as compare to Niagra Falls. But this is the first point of attraction in Charlevoix area.",

          "What an amazing site! I would not compare it to Niagara Falls. However, to be able to go in a cable car and view the top of the falls on a bridge was awesome. The restaurant up top was delicious. Was totally surprised by the steps and walkways that have been made to make it",
          "Chute Montmorency in English is Montmorency Falls. A few kilometers away from the motel we were staying at , it was a memorable sight - tons of water gushing straight down from a height of 83 metes -even about 30 metres higher than Niagra Falls we were told! It sure",
          "Montmorency Falls might be higher than Niagara Falls but no other comparison. Took an Uber from Quebec approx $20 each way for both of us which is a lot better than the shuttle service offered online. Dropped off and picked up when we wanted. Shuttle is a limited scheduled",
          "This was a lovely afternoon trip in beautiful weather - that can't be guaranteed at the falls. It's a well kept space with AMAZING toilets up at the top! It put my expectations of Niagara into context when we read it was taller. The cable car save an uphill trek but isn't a",
          "We visited Quebec for our family vacation. While in Quebec, we decided to visit this place. We drove to the top of the hill and park our vehicle there and then walked around. Our daughter went zipline as well. It is so amazing because of the height of the zipline over the falls.",

          "We enjoyed the falls, though I was surprised to be charged for parking, as other information I read, led me to believe it was complimentary if you purchased ticket for cable car. Regardless, in the grand scheme of things it\u2019s wasnt overly pricey. We took the cable car up and",
          "This is so worth it! Drove to the Falls from Montreal for a day trip and really enjoyed it. My teens did the zip line and they loved it especially the free video. Such a beautiful spot! The walk up the steps is not easy but doable! Definitely worth the visit and the admissions.",
          "Visited with family. Very pretty. We walked up the stairs, which is quite the walk, but I recommend. Not as amazing as Niagara Falls, but if in the area, worth the visit.",
          "We took a shuttle bus to the falls from the street in front of Chateau Frontenac. This service was very convenient. Arriving at falls around 11:00 we encountered massive traffic jam caused by private vehicles entering the parking lot. Once we arrived at the visitor center, we",

          "We came here as part of a very nice bike tour. It was great to have a guide and learn about local history along the way. Only regret is that we would have liked to spend more time at the falls and check out some of the hiking trails. There is a pretty good gift shop.",
          "We have been twice. The first time from the bottom of the falls and the second time from the top of the falls. I like it from the top more as the path to walk there have awesome views and shady. I didn't cross the bridge but my bf did. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "It\u2019s a very beautiful and relaxing view I recommend going. It rained while we were there so we experienced two different feelings. It was amazing as all family members can enjoy. I saw couple of babies with their family and my 3years old also enjoyed it. So don\u2019t worry if you",

          "We didn't go to the top, but were able to get great views and photos from the viewing area across the train tracks outside of the visitor center and skyway entrance. It only costs the price of parking the car to see. It is no Niagara Falls, but it would be fun to zipline across.",
          "North of Quebec City are the Montmorency Falls (99 feet higher than Niagara Falls, but without the power). For hundreds of years people have been awed by their majesty. Speaking of majesty, two and a half centuries ago the kingdoms of England and France fought a battle here",
          "What a great spot to spend a summer afternoon. Climbed the steps to the top and enjoyed the park and orchards. Many spots for viewing the waterfall and taking photos. Was a bit crowded but is worth the trip. Wear comfortable shoes. Bring a few dollars to get a slushee or ice",

          "...because if you don't you either get trampled by all the masses of tourists or you'll have to wait quite a while for the cable car if you choose not to walk up to the top. After all the falls are very impressive and definetely worth a visit.",

          "We spent a couple of hours here. Parked at the bottom of the falls.(The lot at the top was full) and walked up the wooden stair case to the top. The view at the bottom was by far the best. So if you are limited for time do the bottom and skip the top.",
          "Gorgeous view of waterfalls, suggest to take a look from below and than either drive up to the falls or take a cable car and walk the suspension bridge. We did not do zip line, but it looks great. Walking up the falls using the steps or hiking sounds even better. Great park",
          "The Employees make you feel welcome and safe . The price of the Zip line was very affordable and the Video which they take for you is Free , yes I said Free ! Best of all is the View of the Falls and feeling the cool mist as you Zip by at approximately 50 miles an hour.I loved",
          "We booked a trip with Cyclo Bikes to ride to the falls. It was a fairly easy trip. The falls are gorgeous and a very popular attraction.",
          "Unless you climb down or wade below the falls it only takes maximum of an hour. It is easily viewed from the bridge",
          "After you've been eating, drinking, and shopping your way through Quebec City the waterfall may be just what you need. The trip is quick out of the city and takes you to another land completely. The vibe is very chill and relaxed around the water. There are places where you",
          "These falls are great at 272' . You can enter 3 ways 2 from either side up top and one from below. Best is the bottom or right side facing the falls as it has a great staircase down to a huge platform at the bottom in the mist. This is a must see when in Quebec city. Only",
          "It was a great trip! Buying the tickets online prior to arriving was great and saved us time. The earlier you go the less you wait in line for the cable car. The falls are beautiful and the children even walked in a little at falls. We brought a picnic basket and there was a",
          "The zip line that goes by the falls is relatively cheap at around $20.00 USD and the park has several cameras set up. When you go for a run, the park gives you a ticket to download a free video. The video cuts between each leg and angle giving you a very well edited view of",
          "Super busy, lots of tourists. Didn\u2019t stay long. It was cool, but we moved on. For honestly a better waterfall experience, I would recommend the one in L\u00e9vis.",
          "The climb up the stairs is long and steep; about 475 steps, but we thought well worth it. Great view from the top. But one thing; don`t climb unless you are in good physical condition. Like I said, long and steep but there are benches on the way up.",
          "Took the bus out to the falls, walked down the stairs and rode the gondola back up. Beautiful falls, swarming with people, many of whom stopped in the middle of the stairs and pathways taking selfies. Was a very hot day, so to avoid passing out from heatstroke we waited the 45",
          "If you have a couple of days in Quebec then it\u2019s worth visiting these Falls. We looked at the different options for getting there & back and for a family of 4 it worked out best value to use a taxi - about $35 each way. It also meant we got there early, so avoided the long",
          "Great half day trip , only 10-15 minutes from downtown Quebec. We took the cable car to the top, walked across the bridge and down the stairs. It took us a leisurely 1.5 hour if that, with lots of stopping for pictures.",
          "Accessed by the bike trail, this was a great way to spend a morning. At the time we were not able to take the tram to the top but many people were doing just that.",
          "We enjoyed the views from the cable car but, for the money, I recommend parking at the top near the Manoir to walk the area and enjoy the suspension bridge. We visited at dusk and found the crowds to be quite light. We did not take the stairs but would definitely try that next",
          "This was great! Scary, and fun at the same time - the guides were all really nice and helpful. So worth the price and you get a free video of your zip to pull off their website and share!",
          "it was my second time zip lining..the first was during my visit to a mall in Edmonton a few years back. But this was the real deal!! You zip down, feel the breeze, see the falls right in front...wow..what an experience. Getting there - we bough the tickets and parking ticket",
          "My husband and I had been to Quebec City many times but this last trip we had a rental car. It was worth the drive to the Parc de la Chute-Montmorency. The walk was wonderful and the sun was shining. It was busy however that didn't take away from our overall positive experience",
          "If they gave this waterfall a little love it would be worth going. Maybe I'm jaded because I just left Niagara Falls. But it's disappointing.",
          "Take the cable car up and walk down the stairs they have. It's awesome just walking on top of the falls and feeling the sound and power just under your feet. Loved it.",
          "We visited the falls and although there was an hour wait for the gondola, we still enjoyed the views and photo opps. We decided quickly not to stand in line for the cable car because of the crowds, but it didn\u2019t ruin our trip, as we could see a lot from the ground. You can also",
          "Great place to visit and you can do in less than 2 hours. Steps are tough but don\u2019t have to do them.",
          "This is a must if you go to Quebec City it's a short distance away- Take the gondola and then at the top go over the bridge and down to the bottom- This makes it a lot easier - Great views from the top- If you have someone that can not get around well - You can drive around to",
          "This waterfall is easily accessible, whether you walk down and around the landing area, and take the funicular back up to your starting point (which we did) or do it the other way round. If you're brave enough, there's also a zip line across!",
          "We parked at the top (only because that's where our sat nav took us), walked across the bridge and ended up wandering down all the wooden steps, across another bridge and back up via the cable car. It's definitely worth going to although it could do with some investment as it",
          "If you visit Quebec City then Montmorency is well worth a visit. The falls are impressive and the grounds and trails make for a nice morning or afternoon outing.",
          "Best advice I can give - go early. We got there shortly after 10 am and were able to walk right in the cable car and ride up. The views were beautiful and walking was pleasant. As we left around 11:30, the line for the ride up was long and snaked outside. Great photo ops!!!",
          "Montmorency fall is very beautiful no matter where you are. You can take pics either at the distance, stand right in front or above it crossing the suspension bridge. To get up to the bridge you can either take a round trip cable car for about $14.50CAD/ pp or hiking up lots",
          "Nice park and views. the cable care workers were on strike so just the falls area was open. They have a big walk to the top but only for someone in decent shape. You can use your ticket and drive to the upper park with bridge across.",
          "We went to the park but line up for tickets was so long, it extended to outside of the building. We decided to just walk around and were able to be as close to the waterfall as possible - we were soaked from the mist! Very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere!",
          "I wouldn\u2019t recommend coming here if you only have a few days in town. We went on a Sunday and it was so crowded. Long lines. Niagara Falls much better. Glad I saw it. We stayed at bottom due to very long lines for gondola Too many stairs for me to climb to top.",
          "The views are amazing, the park is beautiful, but it is crowded. We got there before 10am and barely had to wait for the cable car to the top and the stairs weren\u2019t that crowded. Once we left, however, the lines were very long and the stairs were packed.",
          "We parked up at the North East end entrance where you pay to get in, I believe it was American $10, not bad and it supports the park,...many people we noticed were parking outside the park and walking in, not the hassle we wanted to have to worry about. If you park up on top of",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this lovely waterfall. We started with a walk across the suspension bridge, then hiked through the small forested area to reach the stairs leading down to the lower level. It's fun to watch the zip-liners zoom across in front of the falls as",
          "We stopped here after spending a day at Ile d \u2018Orleans as it was on the way back to Quebec. The waterfalls are nothing to write home about, especially if you\u2019ve been to places like Yellowstone and Niagara Falls. Yes, it is about 100 feet higher than Niagra Falls, but",
          "There was no problem accepting our prepaid reservation from TripAdvisor. It saved us time in line. The park was beautiful. Everyone was friendly and the zip line was exhilarating. Highly recommend. When you are done, take a drive around Isle d\u2019Orleans.",
          "Higher than Niagra Falls, this is a beautiful sight with easy access from the highway. You can take a cable car to the top, walk up (and/or) down 473 steps, zip line across the falls, or take a rugged hike up and around to the falls. There is also a suspension bridge across the",
          "This is about 20 minutes outside of old Quebec and a must do when visiting the area! We had our Uber drop us off at the parking lot at the top of the falls, where we then took the cable car down, with stunning scenic views. After that, we did the climb up many stairs back to the",
          "Loved this waterfall hike. We actually did a biking tour to the falls and took the gondola up. There is a parking lot near the top though that allows you to get to the top of the falls without the gondola. The waterfalls are higher than Niagra falls but not as wide or as much",
          "The Montmorency Falls are spectacular. Park at the top the North side less congested The gondola down gives a great view of the falls and the city of Quebec looking west You need to have some stamina to climb the stairs back up and enjoy the suspension bridge on to of the Falls",
          "I am soo happy I did this Zipline. We didn\u2019t make a reservation so we had to wait about 45 minutes for our turn which was fine. The cost was affordable at @$30 per person. Such a beautiful view. You don\u2019t get sprinkled from the falls because you are so high up but I wouldn\u2019t",
          "We booked a round trip bus ticket from Old Quebec to Montmorency Falls which cost about $20 per person. We stayed there for about 3 hours, which was sufficient for us to see everything we wanted. When you arrive (late morning for us) - it is very busy in the terminal. If",
          "You can drive, you can take a bus tour. These falls are impressive, Some stalwart youngsters take the LONG stairs up to the top. We recommend the cable car up and back, great views. You can walk across the suspension bridge across the top of the falls.(not scary and I hate",
          "The falls are visible from the highway. But you can ride the lift if you get a park ticket. Also zip line is available for those wanting to hike up 100,000 steps (not sure how many but it looked like a long way). However the zip line did look worth the hike!",
          "Beautiful waterfall. Easy to get to, not expensive. Long walk up to falls but worth it. Great for pictures",
          "Visited this site again after several years. It is a natural beauty for sure, but is diminished by efforts to commercialize it. For example there is a large in-your-face closed in foot bridge spanning across the entire brink of the falls from one side to the other\u2014it really",
          "The falls at Montmorency Park were beautiful. The walkway above the falls and zip line that runs in front of the falls allow for awesome views. Loved the trip up to the top of the falls in the lift.",
          "We visited the Falls in July on our way home from Tadoussac. We paid $12 for parking and walked up the boardwalk to the falls. It is probably 25-30 % higher than Niagara Falls, but not very wide. It is very pretty, but I think the bridge that spans the top detracts from its",
          "Fun place. The bridge over the falls was pretty cool. Nice trail to get some food or slushies. Fun to watch the zip liners go across the falls",
          "This was definitely on the list of things to see in Quebec and it didn\u2019t disappoint. At first we parked up at the top. Then walked a bit spent time on the bridge then watched the zip liners. We wanted to go to the bottom but we didn\u2019t want to take all the stairs cause it was in",
          "We spent half a day exploring the waterfall and park - it was a great day! The kids loved exploring the area and adults were awed by the waterfall. It\u2019s a perfect half-day outing made more comfortable with food options and clean restrooms in the park!",
          "We took a bike tour to the site. Nice waterfall but not majestic like Niagara Falls- even though this one is higher. Fun cable car to top, walk across a very crowded bridge then took the 400+stairs down. Go in the morning before crowds get crazy.",
          "Great place to get your steps in for the day. Great views from the suspension bridge and from the stairs going down to the bottom of the falls. It can get crowded as you can only go two-wide on the stairs (one going down and one up). They also have a zip line (very reasonably",
          "We drove from Montreal to MONTMORENCY FALLS via Trois Rivieres... we had SUCH a GREAT time! We took the cable car to the top , admiring the birds eye view of the falls , as well as the walkway on the rocks .. we then walked on the suspension bridge across the massive falls",
          "I\u2019ve been to the falls before, prior to the advent of the cable car and when it was much less crowded. Going again I would skip the cable car ride, would park near the Manior and walk across the bridge and go the other side of the falls. It was really too crowded this weekend to",
          "Very pretty but scary when your are on the bridge. If you are physically limited I would skip going up or down the stairs, you can use the cable cars although there is still a little walking. Not to busy where you wait forever. You can zip line over the falls.",
          "There are a number of tours from Quebec City to the falls, but the simplest, cheapest and most flexible is to get the number 800 bus, which takes about half an hour. Exact money required to pay on the bus, or call at the kiosk in the station to get a preloaded card (you will",
          "We spend half a day here, climbing the almost-500 stairs, viewing the falls from the suspension bridge, enjoying ice cream at the Manoir, and descending via the cable car.",
          "We visited this on our way to Montreal...A nice leisurely walk and a well laid out attraction..my son even took the chance to zip line across the falls all for a very reasonable $30....There is a bridge at the top over the falls and various viewing platforms dotted around to",
          "Visited early to take advantage of good light for photos of the falls and to avoid crowds. Walked up stairs to falls, across the bridge and down paths other side. Also took advantage of the trails away from the falls and walked down to the river banks. You can walk close to the",
          "We spent about a half day at the park and took the cable car down, walked up the stairs (about 25 floors according to fitbit), and walked across the bridge above the falls. We also spent some time just relaxing in the park after walking up the stairs. So, I've been to Niagara",
          "We pretty much spent the whole day here. We had two family members do the zip line which was great (about $25 each). We also paid for the round trip gondola ride as it was a really hot day and those stairs down the mountain looked completely exposed. At the bottom we walked out",
          "We went in the late afternoon when it was a bit cooler and walked up the steps. Highly recommend if you are reasonably fit! I felt a huge sense of accomplishment when I got to the top and stood on the center of the bridge above the falls. I also saved the $12 or however much",
          "This is a special place. The amount of water flowing over is enormous. The sound is surprising. You can get quite close underneath. We were getting damp from the spray. If you feel the need, there is a climbing option and also a flying fox. Don\u2019t bother with the top. You can",
          "We stopped by the falls leaving Quebec to go to Montreal, even though it was a little out of the way. We took advice of other travelers and parked behind the McDonald's, walked across the bridge and onto the path leading to the falls. We had a great view. We were able to walk",
          "Montmorency falls is beautiful, of decent size and the proximity to the city is very good and also one can easily get there quickly. The view to the river is breathtaking. But the hype of taller than Niagara Falls made me think of Niagara, where I used to live and it is nowhere",
          "Beautiful park, friendly staff. The gondola ride was so lovely, views beautiful. Bathrooms kept clean, lots of food and drink stations. Lovely artworks in the park and the gardens were beautiful.",
          "This is worth the trip from old Quebec and can be reached on public transport. It\u2019s accessible on foot and the cable car isn\u2019t necessary if you don\u2019t mind the climb!",
          "The falls were beautiful. My 15 year old daughter zip lined across and it was amazing! The downside was that the zip line was the ONLY thing my 12 year old son wanted to do on our whole trip, and when we got there, he couldn't do it because although the website said he had to",
          "This was a really nice visit to a beautiful waterfall! There are several parking lots - I parked in the one at 2490 Ave Royale (closest to the restaurant) as the other one off Rue Montmorency was full by the time I got there at 11:30am on a Monday. It cost about 12 and change",
          "There are two paid parking areas for the Montmorency Falls (north and south end). But did you know you can save a pretty penny by parking outside the park? It's nice to support the park but the price tag may be a bit much for some so just park somewhere outside the park in the",
          "The place was beautiful but feel they should have informed people before they paid to enter the park that the employees were on strike and none of the activities were going due to this.",
          "otherwise, a very high fall, but hard to take photos of because of the zip line and wires crossing. Nice parks around it.",
          "We decided not to purchase the cable car but instead take the staircase, which we did not regret! The view to the waterfall is amazing and as the water amount was huge, we got socked - perfect for a hot day. Once on the top, we walked across the bridge. We had our own lunch, so",
          "amazing view worth to go\uff0cwe spent half a day in there, did not take the zipline, buy good view \uff0cget ready for a lot of stairs up and down",
          "We came here primarily to do the zipline, which was really fun. Plus you can download a free video of yourself or show off your adventure on social media. But there is so much more to this park than just the zipline, lots of hiking/walking areas, the gondola, rock climbing, etc.",
          "A friend of ours last minute told us about this beautiful spot. We decided to go for a few hours on our Quebec vacation. We were 3 families with children aged 3-11 traveling together. It cost $12.50 Canadian per vehicle to park which I was told is free during the winter months",
          "Beautiful park. Hike around the falls as well as off the beaten track on some of the other trails. Nice place to spend a day.",
          "this is a great fall to visit, you can walk through stairs ( 469 stairs ) or get the cable car ( around 15 canadian $ ). it has a very beautiful view from the top and an exciting zipline, you can do cliff-climbing also you must not miss this experience",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this park. It is close to old Quebec. The falls are small but pretty and on a hot day cool you off when you walk nearby. There is a cable car to take you from the top to the bottom of the falls. Then you can walk on a promenade to the bottom of the falls",
          "I would highly recommend the falls but not taking the cable car I would walk next time to the top the views are amazing",
          "This is a wonderful stop for everyone. The falls are impressive! The paths are easy and well maintained and the gondola is quick and nice. Take the stairs down if you want to see rainbows.",
          "Well worth a visit to this waterfall which is taller than Niagara but less wide. We enjoyed walking above the falls and got some amazing photos as we descended by the steps.",
          "We drove to the park today to see the waterfalls. Unfortunately, or fortunately the cable car workers were on strike for additional wages. No problem we\u2019re used to hiking up and down stuff. Remember to take some water. We climbed the stairways to the top and walked across",
          "We were very fortunate to have an incredible weather day with loads of sun and a great breeze. The falls are amazing and a lovely site. They almost sneak up on you as you near the location. The gondola was not available, but it was still a very nice visit.",
          "Peaceful, majestic, impressive--well worth a visit. Good for families, nice trails, friendly staff. Choice of foods in snack bar need to be more vegetarian-friendly, though.",
          "Only a short distance from the city and a must see. Fantastic waterfall and a long climb down, and back again of course, to the bottom of the falls. Well worth the effort. Cable car if you would prefer and the zip-lining all add to a great day out. Lovely park area surrounds it",
          "I would highly recommend going to see these falls. We have visited Quebec City many times and didn't take the time to see the attraction. I'm so happy we did. The restaurant at the top was charming- very limited boring menu selection( burgers, poutine, fish and chips) but worth",
          "Beautiful waterfall that was spectacular due to the spring runoff. Worth seeing from the top but much better viewing from the bottom. Bring good walking shoes and take the 487 steps from the bottom to the top.",
          "I reviewed this elsewhere re: the Cyclo Services bike tour. We were lucky--a spectacular morning to enjoy a long-but-easy ride to the falls and back to Q City. Montmorency Falls Parc is a very well-organized woodsy park with tons of photos opps and a cool \"mist shower\" waiting",
          "Whether looking up from the base (where people fly fish), or trekking up the stairs that climb the hillside, or watching from the cable car, while ziplining or just gazing down from the bridge on top, there's no shortage of stunning views of these beautiful falls and grounds.",
          "A very well organised and reasonable priced attraction, starting with a cable car ride, no more than two minutes. If you are reasonably fit get a one way ticket and walk back down to the car park and coffee shop. Even with sight seeing stops its about a 45 min walk over the",
          "a little bit of a drive bu well worth it extra effort to get there plan early as later in day crowded",
          "Although the falls are impressive, it seems that the entry fee is excessive, just to walk up and see it. You can see the other falls in Levis for free, which makes it seem even more expensive.",
          "Best place to visit and zip-line is a must to do. Tried the Zipline and telefrique is also good to see experience",
          "It\u2019s worth a trip to see the falls. There are a couple of different access points. We went from the terminal and rode the gondola both ways. Currently (July 2019) there are some outdoor art installations in the park at the top. Worth a look. Also, don\u2019t miss the tiny museum",
          "Very secnic too crowded for my liking. Would be nice ifyou couldhike up and down both sides. 12:50 to park",
          "When going to Quebec City this is a place not to miss. We, as humans, are somehow fascinated by waterfalls, and this is a great place to experience them from the top, the bottom and the middle. You can be there for a few minutes, or spend in it several hours. I would rather go",
          "It is a nice Waterfalls near Quebec city. Firstwal, it has an exhibition room, where you may see the pictures of Chute-Montmorency in Four seasons--Winter, Autumn, Spring, and Summer. Therefore, you will be able to see the beautiful view of this waterfall in All the time. It is",

We then walked the bridge over the falls, walked up river to the \u201cflat rocks\u201d and",
          "On our way to Tadoussac from Mississauga, we stayed at a campsite and visited this Falls. Its beautiful and a perfect fitness challenge. We did not use the cable car, instead we use 500 step stairs to go up, and my wife and i did it well with only one water bottle empty lol.",
          "There are very few waterfalls, where you can get 360 degree view of it. There are multiple view points to watch the waterfall and enjoy the beauty of it. A must visit. Along with it you can enjoy zipline and gondola ride",
          "There is something for everyone here. Beautiful gardens, well-maintained walkways, zip-lining, trams, restaurants...there were even people fishing in the shallow water near the falls. Everything is run very efficiently. My only complaints are that the tram windows are super",

          "We stopped to see this waterfall, but did not do any of the hikes or activities. The wind was blowing lots of water over the trail to the waterfall. There is a charge for parking and the other activities like the cable car and zipline. You can check out the activities and",
          "We went here and had a great day! The falls are beautiful and the location is perfect. However, go on you own - avoid the pricey tours and the cable car ride. Drive to the top, have a picnic in the beautiful park at the top. The natural beauty of the falls and it\u2019s location",

          "A must see place if you are visiting Quebec city. 25 minutes drive from old Quebec city. Beautiful fall with fewer activities like ziplining and a cable car ride on a beautiful location . Parking is really tough on weekends. You have to wait atleast 25 minutes depending on the",
          "Absolutely awesome. I don't know how else to describe it. We spent time up at the top level near the manor as well as at the bottom. We drove around because some of our family members were afraid of the cable car. Three members went across the suspension bridge and loved it",
          "Gorgeous place! My husband decided we should do the zipline. I'd never done anything like that and was a little apprehensive (I am mid 50's and he's mid 60's). But why not? It was FUN and quite an adrenaline rush. There are weight restrictions.. min. 90 lbs and max 220 lbs.",
          "Parc de la Chute-Montmorency was beautiful and my girls and I had fun there. But it was costly. $12.00 to park, $43.00 to go up in the gondola (one way ticket price). There seemed to be people parking up at the top somewhere so if you are planning on going i would recommend",
          "The falls are quite impressive, and the cable car was fun to get to the suspension bridge was also fun. But, as we were on a bus tour, we had very limited time. I would not walk the 470+steps, which was the other option to get to the suspension bridge over the falls (instead of",
          "Cost to park at the top was $12 (or somewhere around there). We started at the top, walked over the main bridge (holding cell phones pretty tightly), and then made our way down some of the stairs to the bottom (ok for me, not quite all the stairs). GREAT views and it was",
          "Everything was lovely and interesting and such a friendly, clean city! Lots of beautiful old buildings, great restaurants and delicious food! Falls were spectacular too!",
          "Great walk over the falls on the suspension bridge good value gondola ride up and zip line if you are brave Eneogh",
          "The falls and the entire park is a sight to see. When you walk on the trail, fall on your left side, the experience is wonderful. There is a lot of walk and hiking so make sure you bring your water and wear comfortable shoes. It has also a cable car to view the river and park",
          "We loved the view but didn\u2019t stay as long as we had planned because of the heat and crowds. Zip lining over the falls was the highlight and very affordable. They video tape the experience and we were able to down load it for free.",
          "Bought zip line tickets dat before because the ride is so popular. Took 10:40 bus to falls. Bought cable care ticket and walked over bridge to make our 12:00 zip line. So much fun. Easy for first timers. Best views from stairs in way down.",
          "Though this is a very \u201ctouristy\u201d place - the day we spent there was well worth it. We parked at the upper parking lot - took the tram down. Then hiked up the steps, and some of our party walked the suspension bridge while 2 others took the zip line across. The zip line was",
          "We rented a car and one of the stops was this beautiful waterfall - just 20 min from old Quebec. We parked at the top and paid $12.50 for the entrance. We walked around, down towards the end of the fall - be aware, it\u2019s a really good thigh workout up. There was also zip lining",
          "We did it all: one of our group did the zip line, 5 of us took the gondola and walked down the steps, and we all had a great meal at the Terrasse of Manor Montmorency. Superb views, cooling sprays, but a good 35 minute wait for the cable car. There was something for everyone.",
          "We drove 15 minutes outside of the city to see this waterfall. We drove round to the top of the water fall 1st and paid $10 to park. There we could walk across the suspension bridge and enjoy the top of the waterfall. It was way too hot to walk up the giant stairs from the",
          "I love zip lining and couldn't wait to try this one out. A spectacular view of the falls and also take in a view of the river and neighboring towns, so make sure to look left too! I highly recommend reserving your spot in advance as this is a very popular attraction. The only",
          "We accessed the Park from the upper entrance. If we accessed from the lower level ,we would need to ride the Cable car to get to the suspension bridge over the falls. As it was Canada day long weekend, there were long queues to get into the Parc parking. We ended up paying $10",
          "Visited here as a party of 5, one 16 year old. 3 did the zip wire and loved it. We walked round the park and had lunch at the restaurant. The food was good and the Park beautiful. I would definitely recommend and return if I was ever in Quebec again. Don\u2019t miss it.",
          "We had a great afternoon at Montmorency. We reserved a table with a view at the restaurant and then went to the suspension bridge afterward. We were lucky to have a clear and warm day. Beautiful!",
          "The location is great if you're visiting Quebec, not out of the way; right next to the highway. I recommend going right when it opens. I recommend this for all places (zoos, aquariums, etc.). Beat the crown that starts to arrive when you're leaving! Park at the second lot, not",
          "The park and tram trip are terrific and the falls are stunningly beautiful with easily accessible stairs and bridge. The five star rating is due to the administrative staff who graciously allowed me to change my reservation after mistakenly booking it for the wrong day. Thank",
          "As stated the falls and park are nice; however, the parking staff will charge you full fare even when being dropped off by an Uber driver. We didn't use the parking lot, though they charged us to be dropped off at the gate. I have sent 2 emails to the parks administration and",
          "If in Quebec, it's a sight not to be missed. Recommend taking photos of the Falls, the tram and the height the zip-liners have to climb to get to the take-off point.",
          "The property here is huge! So much to see. You can walk in a huge loop around everything, there are many many many stairs, many choices for lookout points along the way. There are paid activites on site, including zipline, rock climbing and a gondola. We did not do any of them,",
          "Spectacular waterfall but very commercial. The zip line, gondola and crowds detract from the beauty. Be sure to take the path along the river away from the falls; there are no crowds on the path and the river and its tributaries are worth the walk. Unfortunately there was",
          "A beautiful waterfall and popular location. You can park either at the top or the bottom. There is a nice garden area walking up to a facility with shops and people gathering. We enjoyed watching zip liners in the distance near the falls. The walk to the falls is very people",
          "Did the zip wire over the falls with my daughter and our friend and it was a great experience. Despite there being a lot of people around, the start slots are staggered to keep queuing down and everything was pretty streamlined. Once kitted out and up on the deck, you\u2019re",
          "Nice little hike to the waterfall. Views ar spectacular. Cross the bridge and walk towards the viewing point on the other side. Make sure you parc in the upper parking lot. If you park below you will have to pay for the expensive cable car taking you up.",
          "This site has a lot more than the gorgeous falls! It has the gondola with beautiful views while going up, the Manoir and restaurant. The boutique has exclusivities plus the exhibit on the second floor of the Manoir. Amazing history of the falls from its sawmills , textile",
          "We enjoyed the steep stairs down to the falls and some nice views of the falls themselves. There are picnic tables and the gift shop has nice restrooms. If you're interested in history, don't miss the remains of the 18th century Montmorency Redoubt from the French and Indian",
          "The tourist information proclaim this waterfall bigger than or as big as Niagara Falls. This is false advertisement. Don\u2019t be fooled. Don\u2019t go. It\u2019s a waste of time.",

          "Very fun and unique opportunity. We came near the end of December, so be sure to wear lots of layers. The wind gets extremely strong, but the views are worth it. You can pay to take the cable car up to the top of the falls or down to the bottom if you enter from the top.",

          "The Montmorency falls are definitely a place to go to if you are visiting Quebec. Just so you know these are even taller (84m) than the Niagara falls (51m), they are just not as explored as the Niagara falls (not as wide also). There is a \u2026",
          "Excellent location for all tourists in the city. Stunning beauty, great picturesque location. You can take some amazing photographs and get very closeup to the falls. The cable cars are well worth it, parking was free when we went.",
          "Nice falls to visit while in Quebec City. Its about a 15 minute Uber drive from Quebec City and worth your time to visit. $9 entry per person, $7.50 for seniors. Not as large or majestic as Niagara Falls  but you can get up close. There is \u2026",
          "Spectacular Walk And view, was there in the Winter and still was amazing...!!",
          "Great view \ud83d\udc4c and amazing experience. Zipline seemed fun and scary. Good nature's liver point with lots of space to get amazing pictures. Their food truck had great sandwiches and chicken wings. Worth at least one visit!",
          "A very high fall in a nice park. Able to walk down to the base of the fall, zip past the fall via zip line. Two parking lots to visit - the one at the to of the fall and another on Highway 138 that will allow you to walk to the fall without having to climb the stairs. Picturesque park with picnic benches and lots of tree shade.",
          "Great place to spend the good part of a day if you would want. Couple of playgrounds for the kids even.  It is best to walk the trail behind the Manor, go across the suspension bridge, and then go down the stairs and to the tram to go back up. Then you only have to buy a one way ticket.",
          "If you\u2019ve seen Niagara, you could just skip this one. The trails are great. The falls view is just okay. \nHowever if you want to bring food and drinks for picnic, that would be wonderful. There is plenty of grassland and trees. You can also find the slides and swings for kids.",
          "Must visit the falls if you're in Quebec City. Beautiful sight. You don't need to pay if you're walking in -- be sure to come in from the top-east side of the falls, from the small town. If you go through the main area on the west side where vehicles come in, you have to pay.",
          "Stunning waterfall \u2764\ufe0f",
          "A really nice walk around the falls. If your a tourist like me, do the loop in the cable car for the full experience. Best photos to be had when you walk down the staircase on the right of the falls.",
          "Beautiful falls with awesome views from well kept walk ways, perches and bridge.  Would love to come back in the summer!",
          "Beautiful. We went in the winter. Spots can be slippert but a good place to visit",
          "It was such a great experience for me and my family.\nLoved the view and the bridge walk. Just wear your walking shoes as it is quite a walk.",
          "Beautiful place. Peaceful, apple field nice touch. Nice bike ride too, next to the road, so easy to follow and arrive, just be aware the iron walkway is only open on the weekends. That was a tiny bit disappointing.",
          "The most amazing place. Breathtaking.",
          "Beautiful scenery. Nice gondola. Walk was good.\nIf you're adventurous, the zip line and rock climbing look like they could be fun.",
          "Beatiful scenary. Recommended for a visit and walk around.",
          "My 65-year-old husband and I climbed the 400 plus stairs to the top of the mountain! We ate our picnic lunch while sitting in the park under an apple tree. Then we walked over the bridge suspended above the falls - taking tons of photos! We \u2026",
          "Very beautiful experience!  Don't go chasing waterfalls, but if you find yourself in front of one don't turn away.  Forces of nature.  On the bridge in a storm.  Ziplining in the rain.  Rainbows on the river. Highly recommended!",
          "My partner and I had a great guided tour (which ended up being a private tour because no one else had signed up for that time). Our guide was super knowledgeable about the history surrounding the waterfalls and the old buildings around. \u2026",
          "Overall speaking a nice experience. Although cable car offered me a full view of the waterfall, the viewing spot was too far away from the fall, therefore I wouldn\u2019t recommend to take it.",
          "Beautiful falls just a short drive away from Quebec City. They are a very romantic spot, accesible and very walkable.",
          "Beautiful waterfall with a drawbridge you can walk across. There's also a star that you are able to walk all the way down to the bottom of the fall. Just to let you know that it'll be exhausting when you climb all the way back up \ud83d\ude02",
          "Only 45 minutes away from Old Quebec by bus. Just take the 800, it's its last stop and just costs 3.5 CAD. The entrance is a little door and you dont need to pay to access the park. The falls are nice but what really takes your breath away is the gorgeous rainbow in the bottom. A must if you're in Quebec city.",
          "Crossing the bridge was terrifying \ud83d\ude05 If you don't have a fear of bridges though you'll love it. Honestly, it was breathtaking. It is a beautiful scenery in a place rich with culture. I would love to visit in the summer as well, when it is warmer.",
          "Gotta do the zip line!  Best $30 I spent.",
          "The fall is magnificent and awe inspiring. Best views are from the lifts and the extension bridge above the falls. Careful while taking pictures with your phone on the bridge though",
          "This is a \"fall\" gem. Come during the fall to view this fall! The picturesque landscape gives way to scenic sights that has the potential to take your breath away. The most intimate experience of the falls involves walking a flight of 450 \u2026",
          "Beautiful place highly recommended.\n\nGoing to the park is optional from the top.",
          "It is a wonderful park. The falls look so mesmerizing and wonderful. Overall an amazing experience. If you are visiting Quebec City you must take out some time and go there...",
          "Very nice tourist trap.  Can involve a lot of walking.",
          "Really enjoyed our visit today. The grounds are beautifully groomed and maintained. Many spots great for photos; all instagramable! The gondola is a nice ride down where you can snap some great pics of the falls. There is also a cafe at the \u2026",
          "Lots of parking $12 entry. Walk across falls and down the stairs. And back up again if you can. Otherwise take the cable car. It\u2019s expensive though for a few minute ride up. One way it almost as expensive as a return ticket. There is zip \u2026",
          "The beautiful waterfall is amazing. For having the best experience - walk down the stairs to the bottom the falls. Its a different world out there!",
          "I was astounded with les chutes montmorency! I was vacationing in Quebec and wasn\u2019t sure what to do but I took a bus from Quebec City almost directly to les chutes. If you plan it right (you can just use google maps) then it\u2019s not hard to \u2026",
          "Very nice photos can be taken. The falls is very nice and we should make a lot of activities here",
          "This falls is experienced to the fullest if you go up close to it. You can also take the cable car to the top to see it from the bridge as well. Definitely nice to see, especially being 30m taller than Niagara falls.",
          "Recommended for all Quebec City visitors",
          "Entrance is not free. Sites on the internet said that the entrance was free but had to pay an entrance fee so. \nOther then that it was pretty cool. It has excellent views.",
          "Breathtaking view. A prefect place to spend time with family or loved ones. There is also activities to take part and lookout points to take beautiful pictures. Definitely a must to visit. Great experience.",
          "Beautiful , I could just stare at this amazing falls for hours",
          "Very cool! They need to have a spot to take a great picture of the whole thing! My best pic I took leaning down on the ground, between some trees through a fence.",
          "Absolutely beautiful! I've been several times and each time is always so fun. I enjoy getting up close and feeling the force of the falls!",
          "Spectacular views... no need to pay for the cable car if u just need the views. Walk along the trails and there are good views over the falls and off the falls themselves. The zipline is worth more than the cable cars. Of course if you want to walk down to the river bed, then it's either the cars of a hike down the hill.",
          "I've seen many many falls but these are absolutely spectacular and a must see if you visit Quebec City.",
          "Beautiful spot ... Love what they've done here!",
          "The falls were beautiful! We enjoyed the walk up to the pedestrian bridge and then down the other side.",
          "Nice place to see every time of the year. \nBut from now on, you have to pay for the entry. 8$ for QC no-residents  and 4$ for QC residents",
          "Really really nice place to go if you have a car or can get there. \nThe access to the bridge but in 1993 is free of charge. \nWhat does have charge is the parking spot. If you are on a budget or simply don't want to spend $8 on parking, \u2026",
          "This is the best waterfall i have seen in Ontario after Niagara Falls. The flow of the water is huge and you will be really thrilled to see this one. I would 100% recommended to visit this place.",
          "Really nice place BUT restaurant was closed in May and they said will open in summer, cable car is convenient but cost around $15 each. Nice view from bottom level (you can walk through stairs if young and fitted), can spend 1 hour here, small garden.",
          "Breathtaking, parking gets busy so I would go early. Take your time and explore the grounds, there\u2019s a lot to see. There is a panoramic staircase and zip lining if you\u2019re adventurous!",
          "Brilliant because there are some great ways to get so close to this Spectacular Waterfall..... was even partly frozen at the base in early November!!!!   Cable Car to top looks fun!!!",
          "Besides the Falls being lovely, the staff are quite helpful as well.",
          "Is beautiful! The cost to enter into the park is $3 for Canadian residents and $6 for the others",
          "Stunning setting, stunning waterfall, and stunningly close access. This was an unforgettable experience, and very accessible. We took the tram up, the bridge across, and the stairs down, and each part gave us a different and appreciated view of this natural wonder.",
          "The bathrooms and the buildings need to be better taken care of, they were very dirty, but the Falls are really beautiful!",
          "If you are a tourist. This is a place that you don't want to miss. All the facilities are available. Buses go here, good parking facilities, restaurant and washrooms at different locations.",
          "The scenery is awesome, but there's not much to do in December.",
          "A very pleasant and fun experience! The view and zip lining is an absolute joy to experience from the looks of it. The one thing I was disappointed about was that there aren\u2019t enough or even any water fountains that we saw yesterday. \n\nIt \u2026",
          "Very beautiful place to visit. It\u2019s only 15 minutes from old Quebec City.  It\u2019s best to park your car on the top and walk down the stairs.  Then take the cable car up.  Parking was $12.50.",
          "It\u2019s a nice hiking place to view the falls.",
          "Great place to spend a bit of time and go for a walk. There are a couple different trails to take for a walk around the falls. Info center with gift shop and bathrooms on site. There's also a little gondola type ride you can take to the bottom of the falls and get a great view.",
          "This place was breathtaking. If you are visiting Quebec City, take the time to go and see the falls. I went just after a snowstorm so there was still about a foot of snow on the ground and some of the falls were frozen! I only walked halfway across the suspension bridge because it was windy! Great memories.",
          "Impressive waterfalls with equally impressive staircase down to the base of the falls. I suggest taking the 800 bus from just outside old Quebec. An easy, free, half-day trip when visiting Quebec City.",
          "Worth the very short drive. Really impressive",
          "Excellent place. This waterfalls are next to Quebec City. The place is really wonderfull, be readdy for walk and sters. In spring and summer you can use the cableway and get amazing view. In fall and winter you should be wearing to no get frezze! The experience is really nice!",
          "Did the cycle tour from old Quebec City. Was a 4 hour tour. Great time and easy pace. The falls are beautiful, suspension bridge gives a great view from above.",
          "Great walk up the stairs and on the bridge over the falls. Great views. Charge you for parking and then if you use the gondola car to ride up and/or down.",
          "Great day out watching people on zip wires highest falls in Canada",
          "Beautiful park, nice museum, nice gift shop, beautiful waterfall.",
          "Pretty cool; nice walk and tram ride (not included in park entry fee) to top. Poison ivy along trail is protected, so pay attention. Doing the zipline next time...",
          "Not as much water as niagara but just as spectacular. Take the bridge across to get an awesome view.",
          "Beautiful falls and great hiking trails.  Lunch at Manior Montmorency was delicious! A great way to spend a day in Quebec!",
          "Breathtaking! An absolute highlight of our trip to Quebec City! It's fun too w a staircase u can descend to get closer to the power of the falls - you'll likely get a bit wet! Be warned, the return ascent is challenging for those less physically fit!",
          "Fun place to spend the day! Several lookout points to take beautiful pictures. Rock climbing and zip-lining available. Short drive from Quebec City. Free street parking available outside the park. Well worth the visit.",
          "Amazing scenic views specially in the month of October (Fall). Dont forget to ride the Trolley. Must visit while in Quebec City.",
          "The bridge over the fall is amazing, with a great view",
          "Several different ways to get a great, close up view of the falls make them accessible to all. Great facilities, protective fencing  and play and picnic areas make it ideal for families.\n\nDrive to the top, take the cable car or challenge \u2026",
          "Beautiful. Must see. Do not miss this piece of beauty. Marvelous and scenic. Do go for Ziplining if you are here it's worth it.",
          "One of the most breathtaking sights that I have ever seen in the winter.",
          "100x cooler in real life than the photos! It's amazing! Rainbows, mist, huge wind swept plains with wide river flowing from waterfall! Beautiful walkway! Great views!",
          "Awesome view up top take the gondola up and walk across the bridge",
          "Really nice. There is beautiful bridge and wonderful especially in Autumn.\nAmazing Zipline and perfect view.",
          "Nice walk. Free access in the winter",
          "Great fall but don't go down in the parking down the falls close to the highway. They charge for parking and say you cant take the stairway up so you also have to pay for the cable car, you end up paying 60$ for the package when you can go \u2026",
          "Excellent falls view from the adjacent bridge and also from the hilltop.. better to park your car at the base camp and take the Cable car to the hill top..",
          "So much fun! You don\u2019t want to miss the hike or the falls! Great restaurant as well!",
          "The elderly guy at the ticketing counter entry was very rude. Bordering on being an openly racist. Very un-Canadian SEPAQ employee indeed",
          "I had read some reviews about the zip line before I went, and now that I've gone, here is what I thought:\n-it's a lot of fun I wish it could have been longer\n-the staff is very organized\n-making a reservation before hand, like I did, makes \u2026",
          "Has everything. Parking, food, nature trails, river access and the largest waterfall. Great, scenic views from many positions throughout the park. There is also a cable car and pedestrian bridges of many sizes and types. Overlooks the river and island.",
          "Great visitors centre, shops for clothes and a good drinks selection.  Well worth a visit. We did it on the way to the airport.",
          "Great place, lots of amazing views no matter I on top of the waterfall, on the bridge or at the bottom, if you don't mind a huge crowd of tourist (like everywhere), a little walk and stairs then you'll really enjoy it.\nThere's also the \u2026",
          "Amazing views specially from the green colored  bridge across the falls.",
          "Beautiful scenery.\nYou can visit the falls and the trail for free, but there is a small fee for the parking. Can also go there using the public bus (800)",
          "My wife and I had a wonderful afternoon viewing the falls.",
          "Awesome waterfall! I love the bridge that goes over the top of the falls.",
          "Do not take Google's suggestion to take the first left.  This gate is closee.  Go south for another 800 meters  turn left at the lights.  Good parking on the south side.  Also if you go to the top there is no fee.  If you go to the bottom you have to pay a fee.",
          "great place, with all facilities. i had a great time there. its huge and beautiful \ud83d\udc4c",
          "Worth to see. Really awesome. First go up with the cable car, then a nice walk over the bridge on top of the falls and the panoramic stairs down again.",
          "Amazing falls and bridge they even have a zipline going directly across if you like  and a tram . Great for all. A large park and food truck for a bite to eat or just to rest and enjoy nature.",
          "What a site.  An experience to be with the nature's creative excellence.",
          "Lots of walking lots of stairs... Beautifully kept park. If you're in a hurry, there's a cable car; if you just can't wait... there's a zip-line... Pack a picnic...",
          "Nice place to visit, and free",
          "This place an incredible gem. Climb, bring a bathing suit, picnic, water shoes and just lavish in nature. The climb is absolutely worth it!",
          "By far my best memory of Quebec city. Easily spent a couple of hours. We walked up the stairs on a muddy cool day. But everyone on the way up was in good spirits and enjoying themselves. Sun came up a little later. The ziplining was cool to watch and staff at the trolley were friendly.",
          "Beautiful falls, lookout pavilions, zipline, nice trails, suspension bridge over the falls. Great views and good place to have a picnic and spend the day. Also excellent washrooms!",
          "Beautiful views. A must do if you are in Quebec City. Views from the suspension bridge are breadth-taking.",
          "great falls. unlike Nigeria u can go at bottom. keep spare set of clothing for change. the zip line is cool goes by the falls. in some way this fall is more fun that Niagara",
          "Lovely place.  Great for photography.  Did not take cable car for to lack of time, have to meet bus.",
          "You can feel the mist if you take the closer staircase. The climb up the stairs was long but worth it for the views. The bridge across the top sways slightly in the breeze. There are picnic areas and playgrounds all around for families.",
          "The view is stunning! Enterance fee of $8cad. Worth the hike. You can reach the bridge by hiking up or walking over. You ca. Pay to zipline over the falls for $26cad. I'm visiting during October and still super busy.",
          "Great waterfall! Some of the staff are less than helpful. Full restaurant was operational but no bathrooms available for anyone to wash hands it relieve themselves.",
          "Just about 20 min drive from Quebec city downtown, visiting the falls is a must and going down from the staircase and climbing back up for 545 steps is the cherry on top. But don't worry, you still get really good views from the top and the suspension bridge if you're not into it.",
          "Lovely place equally good in winter/summer",
          "This falls really is impressive. On a sunny spring day the walk is pleasant and the views are exhilarating. Definitely worth a visit. At the upper park, there is some free 90 minute parking to be found on the street.",
          "This is an incredible experience I had no idea was here. There is a bridge over the falls that is so cool. There is a zip line too. I freely admit to skipping that experience but it would be truly exciting.",
          "Great place to visit.  Stunning to see.  Reasonable prices on parking and entry.",
          "My recommendation is to go early we went about 10:00 a.m. and had to wait 30 min just to get into the park. Otherwise a beautiful place to go.",
          "Stunning falls, atop a huge cliff, winding paths to get to. The bridge to cross over right above it makes the trip worth it.",
          "Gorgeous falls. These pictures don't do it justice but they are grand. When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you'll feel the mist of the falls which is very welcomed lol",
          "More than just a beautiful waterfall. The onsite park, the personnel and the many available activities make this place a perfect place to spend a sunny day with friends, family or alone jogging around. All the facilities to have an enjoyable afternoon are provided there. Great experience.",

          "Lovely lit up at night in winter",
          "Beautiful waterfall,  100 feet taller than Niagara Falls. There is a cable car and you are able to take it down to the bottom of the falls. At the bottom there is a well worn path that will take you directly to an ice wall adjacent to the \u2026",
          "Very nice lots of history museum very informative",
          "A lot of stairs. Great view at the bottom near the water. The cable car was super quick as well going up",

          "The walk on the suspension bridge over the falls is very thrilling",
          "Great place to visite even during winter.",

          "Wonderful place. Especially in summer everyone who loves taking picture and enjoy the scenery, this background will have lasting memories",
          "Great Scenic Spot , park entry is free and parking around park too is free, there are many spots to enter park. \n\nTop of the fall , there is a paid parking lot fees is 12.49 $ with tax. This can be avoided if park outside. \n\nThere is a zip line and Gandola activities at the fall",
          "amazing place. you have to see it",
          "Parc de la Chute-Montmorency is a beautiful park at Montmorency Falls. There is a lot to do with a beautiful hike that goes over a bridge which crosses the falls and then winds down a set of wooden stairs and boardwalks. There is a cable \u2026",
          "Beautiful Park but it is not the $12.50 fee for parking! it us a tourist trap ... find a side street where you can park for free near the grocery store!",

          "Great falls and place for walking.\nA little scary on the cross bridge. But beatiful place",
          "Awesome place. Just a heads up, the tram is a ripoff $12 one way!... Just do the walk it's very doable.",
          "Great area, but it's too popular with tourists, used to be pretty quite and not as expensive. It's a nice walk, some of it requires more effort, not enough shade, but it should be better during weekdays. It offers some activities too, you can climb near waterfall, winter time it's also not bad in terms of views.",
          "An easy to get to huge and stunning waterfall.  Go during the week when it is less packed.",

          "This is a beautiful place. Be prepared to walk .definitely do the cable car it is great",
          "A beautiful spot to spend a couple hours with the kids. Cable car, suspension bridge and steps to the basin give you a view from all angles. There's also a few playgrounds on the grounds to give the kids a break from take photos haha",
          "Amazing place to see during winter.",
          "It's not Niagara falls but good experience as well. It looks like you just have to pay for a car or bike. It's free if you just walk there. We have spotted a free parking on the other side of official entrance. Would not recommend a \u2026",
          "We enjoyed our trip to this water falls from Quebec Old city. We took metro bus 800 and it took around 45 minutes. Outdoor activities are not opened yet such as zip lining. Still there is lot of snow on the ground and it is slippery at \u2026",
          "Beautiful place. The different activities well laid out and managed. Plan to be there at least 2 hours if you are not planning to picnic (there are areas to picnic at the top and the bottom of the cliff). Parking was $12. Be ready to get \u2026",
          "This location is amazing and beautiful. It is impressive to see this waterfall. If you go don't forget your camera or video camera. Tourists go there all year round.

          "Had a great experience here. The waterfall is impressive and the zipline was fun. Four stars because I only give five if I want to go back, and this is a \"see it once\" for me. It was a bit touristy and crowded, and I prefer quieter \u2026",
          "Excellent half day trip close to Quebec City. The bottom of the falls has a train stop, parking lot, bike rack, and snack shop. Sepaq has an office there too. \n\nThe walk up the stairs is surprisingly intensive and will break a sweat. There \u2026",

          "Nice place but it should be free, unfortunately you have to pay almost $5 to get in.",

          "A good place to get a view of the Quebec City. Good for hiking and picnic",
          "If you feel that Niagara Falls are a bit far from MTL, go to Quebec City. 15 min up north from it you'll find Montmorency Falls! Some people say this waterfall is way cooler then Niagara.

          "2nd time there and still beautiful. The nature walk was nice.",
          "Wow, amazing time and experience. Very clean, park staff is very helpful. You pay for parking $12 truck and trailer. Entry to the park is free, nice souvenir store. You can walk to the bridge if you go to the upper parking lot, then across \u2026",
          "The falls are beautiful and powerful. The ride up is a bit steep at$18 after paying $10 to get in,  but the walk up is long,  so worth the price.",

          "This place is so cool. And only 15 mins in a cab from Old City Quebec.",
          "A nice little tour of this waterfall just outside of Quebec City. The zipline was fun and little scary at the same time.\n\nTake a nice stroll to the bottom of the fall to take some pictures and can drive up afterwards to see the fall from the bridge.",

          "A beautiful spot great scenery a little bit overpriced but that's the way it goes towards Darius you have to pay fees",
          "This fall is so beautiful! One of the Must do things in Quebec! They have cable cars and also ziplining! Super Fun place!",
          "What a gorgeous place. The cable car was a fun ride, and the stairs back down were really cool and offered tons of great views.",

          "Beautiful natural place. Either in winter or summer, a very nice place to visit.",
          "One of the most gorgeous places. We parked on the street based on the reviews on here that it costs money to park inside. We did the zipline $27/person. It was so worth it. They include a free video that you download from online. The video \u2026",
          "This is a must visit place if you are visiting Quebec City. It is just few kilometers away from Quebec City. The parking is not free but you could park down the hill and climb up. It is a beautiful location and the best thing I liked is the \u2026",

          "Good place to visit all year long",
          "Magnificent! Perfect little getaway just outside the city. Convenient and accessible for all ages there's something in it for everyone.",
          "Pretty cool but don\u2019t buy any tickets as it\u2019s a waste of money - we bought tickets in advance and then nobody checked them so we could have basically walked in for free",
          "Greatest view on the St.Laurence.  very informative visit.  Great for families!",
          "Beautiful falls with a nice trail if you feel energetic.... do take the zipline and definitely go to the bottom of the falls.",
          "Beautiful falls. Nice going down the stairs. Sucks coming back up. ;)",
          "Not that expensive to visit.  A good climb up the stairs to make it to the top over 400 steps if you choose this option but you can always pay a supplement and take Via Ferrata for $33.  There's a nice mobile cantina up the top and there's \u2026",
          "Beautiful! Went first week of April. Our daughter is one and half and so worth taking her to. Easy to walk around!!! And the fall is something is a must see when your in Quebec.",
          "If you can make it all the way up (by car or walking up the stairs), it is well worth the trip with beautiful parks, restaurant, trails, and the view on top.",
          "Spectacular view of the falls from various angles.",
          "Cold but bright day, perfect for viewing the waterfalls",
          "Getting into the park was a pane. Ticket boots were cash or credit, not marked ahead so cars end up in wrong lane. Took over 20 minutes to get through from road. Additional costs once inside, namely use of the gondola.",
          "Beautiful location. Great for picnic. Leave yourself at least 2 hours to see longer if you want to stay for lunch.",
          "Very nice facility. I appreciated the use of the wheel chair provided free of charge",
          "Beautiful.\nA place for breakfast would have been nice",

          "Great view. Has multiple entrances. The view from the base is the best. The bridge at the top  has a different angle, but good too. Has everything you need. Zip line. Cable car. Restaurant and washroom. Good for family.",
          "Very nice stop just 15 min from downtown by car.",
          "The falls and hospitality of the people were disappointing.  We were taken advantage of because of the language barrier and overcharged for everything. Will not recommend this place to anyone.",
          "One of the activities I like is zipping it\u2019s longer then the one in old port Montreal. I loved this one .\nPrecious place to be with your favourite ppl.\nFree parking outside u don\u2019t have to go inside and pay 20$ . Park on the side of the street .\nVery clean air nice park and incredible waterfall Montmorency.\nI love this place.",
          "Worth visiting.  Beautiful waterfall.  I would recommend going down the staircase for a great view.",
          "Beautiful waterfall and park area with cable cars and ziplines available. Food and lodging on the premises.",
          "We stopped in on our way to Mont Saint-Anne and the winter mist from the falls had frozen a mini mountain in front of the main chute. With great care, we climbed up - a great adventure for the little guy. Pay close attention to ice thickness when doing this, a warning that you will hear from the attendant at the entry gate!",
          "A must go. Suggest going right before the sunset. There would be few people. We were the only two tourist on the bridge. The view is terrific.",
          "Great place and view. You can do Zip line for around $30 and you get free video of your adventure",
          "Nice views of the city. Most of the best views are from the stairs going down the falls. Cable car is pricey for the length of the ride but it is a hard trek up the stairs.",
          "We had a very good time to this falls and trails. \nWe can also have a pic nic and it\u2019s dog friendly !",
          "One of the most popular destinations in Quebec City. These falls are actually higher than Niagara falls. Less water ofcourse but the place is very beautiful. There are two ways to reach the top of the falls from the bottom. Either by paid cable car or the stairs.",
          "Nice falls. Aggressive parking lady. But she keeps the trains running on time.",
          "If you did not had the chance to visit the falls in the winter time, you better think about it. It is almost another story compared to what you get in the summer time and it is a lot less crowded. I could say that it is astonishing.",
          "Great view from bridge on top of fall...Also dont forget to take a cruise along the Lawrence river to enjoy the awesome view",
          "Really great place to visit when in Quebec city..view from the top is awesome. Must visit place. And they have parking as well named Montmorency falls base parking.",
          "Really nice views of waterfall and colours of the autumn trees, but tour operators spoilt the day.",
          "Wow! Short walk with incredible rewards.",
          "Beyond gorgeous!  The stairs were brutal but hey,  still a blast.   Be mindful if you've mobility concerns but there are other ways to get to the top or drive around.  Very nice :-)",
          "Really nice place, full of nature. Easy access by public transportation.",
          "It is a lovely visit. It can be seen or missed.",
          "This is an excellent attraction. A bit far away from city centre, but there is a bus. There's ice on the surface, but water is still flowing on the bottom. Magnificent view.",

          "Beautiful Waterfalls.. Should not miss this place.. Skyline is one of the best activity that go over the Waterfalls :)",
          "A jaw dropping view of the montmorency falls, you can even walk all the way down near the falls to take photos and read historical facts.",
          "The Monmorency falls were lovely. These falls are about a hundred feet higher than Niagara. Even though they were partially frozen, the entire view with water falling through frozen ice was breathtaking. Taking the cable car is worth it \u2026",
          "A gorgeous place to using during the summer. Would recommend starting off with walking alongside the waterfall and then taking the gondola back up. Was able to capture some beautiful photos while enjoying different perspectives of the waterfall. A great tourist spot when visiting Quebec City.",
          "Great place to walk around the park and on the hanging bridge and to see the falls",
          "A very gorgeous place to visit and to see the majestic falls of Quebec. Start your journey below the falls, then use the stairs to go up to the bridge. You can also use the cable car to see a different view. However, walking and climbing the stairs is more exciting and helps you burn excess fat. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Having great moment here with my wife",
          "I went with my whole family it was extremely enjoyable. Their museum nkt so much but overall we all had a great time.",
          "Brilliant!  If you can park close to ths bus stop it looks like you can walk in to the area for free.  We paid $12 to park in the paid lot, which is fine.",
          "Definitely worth the visit, such a beautiful spot! I\u2019d suggest driving to the top, parking and then exploring around the falls. You would save money if you do not want to take the funicular up the mountain (although the view is amazing from \u2026",
          "Great waterfall. Walked to the falls which wad just great. Didn't take the cable car as it seemed pricey for what you get. Also it didnt take you that close to the falls.",
          "Spectacular, along with the Fall changing of the leaves made it a majestic experience.",
          "Very scenic! Beautiful walk around the falls. We spent a couple of hours there. The autumn colors were beautiful. In the summer you could probably spend more time and picnic there. Very easy access from Quebec City just 20 minutes. You can get a bus tour if you don't have a car.",
          "Not as pretty as Niagara but a good place to relax",
          "Amazing place with scenic views and lots of stuff to do. Rode in the cable car and did some zip-lining over the falls. It was rad!",
          "Grate place would recommend going if you are visiting qwebec or jest looking of a nice view lots of activity\u2019s like zip lining next to montmorency falls",
          "The majesty and power was something to behold.",
          "Nice natural beauty and safe to explore. Zip lines was affordable great experience.",
          "Went again in the winter. Breathtaking.",
          "Beautiful. Just gorgeous. Remember to take an extra set of clothes and some rain covers if you want to have a good time.",
          "Small waterfall but a good place to go if you have time. Walk up to the bridge is not bad at all. There are viewing platforms along the way up so you can rest as well.",
          "Stunning waterfall just outside of Quebec City. Great place to hike down and get up close and personal with the falls, with a breathtaking view. The ziplines and gondola rides are affordably priced for a one time vacation, and each have \u2026",
          "Nice view but no need to go up the gondola. The best view is at the edge of the falls from the bottom.",
          "My gosh, nature in all its beauty. Free is a great price too.",
          "Very cool    fun little bike ride  to get there and climbed the stairs to the top",

          "Nice Water falls spot near Quebec City, a bit crowded. A lot of options, stairs, cable car, via Ferrata, tirolien.. the view is much nicer from the bottom than from the top",
          "Beautiful waterfall.  Don't miss it if you're in the area.  Great patio dinning.",
          "So big and powerful . It is a must see if your in Quebec!!",
          "Must be really nice in the winter or spring but in the summer we appreciated much more the Canyon Ste Anne (last 2 pics)",
          "One of the best days in Quebec was visiting Montmorency Falls.  The zip line adventure was a great deal costing $33cad and get this, it included a video.",
          "You need all day to do the holes hikes. We went with a tour group. We'd like to go back on our own",
          "Amazing falls i love how close you can get to them",
          "Beautiful frozen rivers and falls.",
          "This fall you can meet in Quebec. Don't prepare with Niagara it is smaller but beautiful",
          "I found that walking halfway down the stairs was sufficient to get a great view of the falls.",
          "What a view! I took this 360 photo and this should represent what this falls looks like. I am amazed to see view and make sure you check the locality near to this fall as it has a lot mansions with perfect architecture",
          "Mesmerising views of the fall. Make sure to be in the middle of bridge span. That's where you experience the best views.",
          "We arrived at the same time as 4 tour buses and didn't have time to do the tram. The falls is pretty.",
          "Amazing tourist location. Beautiful scenery, easy access. View from the suspension bridge is breathtaking, but it is even better on the wooden steps. At the base of the falls, many people try to cross the water and this was the best part. \u2026",
          "Lots of spray and an impressive site!",
          "Have to check this out of you are anywhere near it. A must stop. Breathtaking!",
          "Zip line a must. Manior montmorency good food",
          "A very nice park, where you can take a medium length  walk (in winter, 1:15 round trip).\nThe falls, and the bridge going over it, are very impressive.   The falls aren't lit in many colours (at night) as we read somewhere, but still a \u2026",

          "Very scenic. Glorious rainbows, fierce force if nature in full display. Force is strong here!!",

          "Enjoyed walking around the falls. My husband doesn't like heights, so we couldn't Zipline or do the trolley car. Sat in the park for a bit. Wish I had thought to bring a picnic or bagette, cheese and some wine!\nWould recommend touring some \u2026",
          "If you ever visit Quebec City, don't forget to visit this paradise called Montmorency Falls. Its 15 km from the city but its totally worth the drive all the way to the falls. You can do zip-lining (which is cheaper than most places in \u2026",

          "Beautiful place! Definitely will visit again next time I\u2019m in the area.",

          "Magnificent views and good walking distance. Suggest to take the cable car up and walk back. 400 odd steep steps\ud83d\ude09",
          "So pretty. There is free street parking by the top and you can see the falls without the climb",
          "Motjer Nature is awesome!",

          "Amazing place and beautiful 83 meters fall and view ! Located at 15min at old Quebec with car. You can park in streets outside the parking to save the 11$ fees and just walk few minutes more. \nYou have some trails and wooden stairs (have to \u2026",
          "Nice views, very nice park, parking costs $9, map you get at the parking is not understandable.",
          "Good outdoor activity! Nice walk around the falls, and family friendly. Can get close enough to feel the water spray. Nice photos opportunities around it. Sufficient parking space, although it makes sense to find a spot on the road in order to avoid the rather high parking charges.",
          "Beautiful trail and optional stairs. The suspension bridge is great!",
          "It was SO MUCH FUN! I went up the gondola, which was fun, and went down the stairs. The falls were so beautiful and I got some amazing pictures from the suspension bridge. I disnt go ziplining but I really would like to! I would 10/10 go back again!",
          "A must see! Take the gondola for an easier way up then walk down.",
          "A beautiful stop when you can visit the waterfall and go for a hike through the woods too. This place can be pretty crowded, but it's because it's so beautiful. There are only paid parking lots; one at the bottom of the falls and one at the \u2026",
          "Amazing in winter to see the torturous path of  the water through ice and rock over the falls",
          "It's a wonderful park. Walking, picnicking, just sightseer or a cable car ride.",
          "Such a beautiful place. You would be crazy to go to quebec city and not visit the falls",
          "Beautiful place but too much stairs but it\u2019s fun",
          "Ahhh, great scenic place. \nNote: I would suggest that If you have kids then walk down first from the fall and then take chairlift to go up.",
          "Awesome power of water beautiful sites get to go very close you will definitely get very very wet",
          "Remember is to live and I remember very well my visit. I enjoyed walking on the bridge over the waterfall, the sound of the water and the view from there and the water in the surroundings and also the walk down by the wood stairway. I recommend anyone to stop by this place. It is very nice.",
          "Falls, zip line, cable car and rock face rope climbing makes it a great experience.",
          "If you live in or visit Canada without visiting these falls then you missed the most amazing place.. We had an astonishing day there.. Unforgettable experience.. A must visit location.. I think it is 30 higher than Niagra falls with access to both sides of the falls by Canadians.. Amazing place don't miss it",

          "The place is very beautiful. However the zipline requires little hardwork. Firstly you have to go to the starting point of the zipline. Once you have done the zipline and you come to the other end, you have to go to the starting point again \u2026",
          "Beautiful view n zipline amazin..just u need to walk alot n stairs even too",

          "I recommend anyone who's taking a trip to Quebec city to visit it.",
          "Relatively quick detour from Quebec City. Well developed around the falls so it is easy to walk all the way around with whole family. The stairs on the side are pretty intimidating but they put multiple viewing spots for breaks so doable. \u2026",

Just to get to a car park up top where you apparently dont pay at all. Check that option out unless you really want to ride the cable car.",

        "wiki": "The Plains of Abraham (French: Plaines d'Abraham) is a historic area within The Battlefields Park in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The land is the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, which took place on 13 September 1759, but hundreds of acres of the fields became used for grazing, housing, and minor industrial structures. Only in 1908 was the land ceded to Quebec City, though administered by the specifically created and federally-run National Battlefields Commission. The park is today used by 4 million visitors and tourists annually for sports, relaxation, outdoor concerts, and festivals.\n\n\n== Plains of Abraham Museum ==\nThe Plains of Abraham Museum serves as the park's information and reception centre. It features a multi-media exhibition about the siege of Qu\u00e9bec and the 1759 and 1760 battles of the Plains of Abraham. Other displays feature the history of the site through archaeological artifacts found in the park. Open year-round and located at 835 Wilfrid-Laurier Avenue, the museum serves as the starting point for tours and includes a gift shop.\n\n\n== Name and features ==\n The plains are likely named after Abraham Martin (also known as L'\u00c9cossais) (1589\u20131664), a fisherman and river pilot called The Scot. Martin moved to Quebec City in 1635 with his wife Marguerite Langlois and received 32 acres of land divided between the lower town and promontory from the Company of New France. Abraham's name appears in the toponymy of Quebec City at the time of the French regime, the deeds of the 17th and 18th centuries referring to the coast of Abraham, and a 1734 plan even precisely locating an Abraham Street. Later, the journals of the Chevalier de Levis and the Marquis de Montcalm referred to the Heights of Abraham, as did the diaries of British soldiers, who also employed the phrase Plains of Abraham.\nThe park itself presently occupies an area approximately 2.4 km (1.5 mi) long by 0.8 km (0.5 mi) wide, 98 ha (242 acres) that extends westward from the Citadelle of Quebec and the walls of Quebec City along a plateau above the Saint Lawrence River, and forms a part of The Battlefields Park. An interpretive centre and walking trails have been built on the site, and monuments commemorate the Battle of Sainte-Foy and James Wolfe, the latter being an astronomic meridian marker raised in 1790 by the Surveyor-General of Canada, Major Holland, on the site where Wolfe was said to have died.\nIn 1913, the National Battlefields Commission placed a column identical to one that had been built on the site in 1849, and a replica Cross of Sacrifice was constructed on the plains to commemorate soldiers who were lost in World War I; it continues to be the location of Remembrance Day ceremonies every year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOn September 13, 1759, the area was the scene of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, part of the French and Indian War, which was itself part of the Seven Years' War. On that date, British soldiers under the command of General Wolfe, climbed the steep cliff under the city in darkness, surprising and defeating the French, through a single deadly volley of musket fire, causing the battle to be over within 30 minutes. Both Wolfe and the French commander, the Marquis de Montcalm, died of their wounds, but the battle left control of Quebec City to the British, eventually allowing them to take control of Canada the following year.\nThe plains thereafter remained nondescript fields, with only a monument to Wolfe as a reminder of the events that took place. As Quebec City grew, development of the plains took place unabated, and hundreds of acres were built over. Only in 1901 did government intervention come, when the proposed subdivision of 88 acres (360,000 m2) of the region was halted by the purchase of the land by the Dominion Crown. At the same time, however, another area of the plains was taken and, despite public protest, covered by a Ross rifle factory, which included a water tank built upon an existing Martello tower. A movement to preserve the site continued, nonetheless, and by 1904, the Literary and Historical Society of Quebec was permitted by the federal government to put up plaques at various significant spots around the vicinity. The following year, a proposal for the establishment of an Historic Landmarks Association was placed before the Royal Society of Canada and Governor General the Earl Grey initiated his plan to preserve the battlefields, having visited the site and stating that he \"would never rest until such sacred ground became the heirloom of all Canada and the Empire.\"\n\nThe Mayor of Quebec City, Jean-Georges Garneau, in 1908 appointed a landmark commission under the chairmanship of Chief Justice of the Quebec Superior Court Fran\u00e7ois Langelier. Amongst its recommendations for permanently recording the celebrations for the 300th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City, the group called for a nationalization of the Quebec battlefields and the construction of a museum of Canadian history. The federal prime minister at the time, Wilfrid Laurier, suggested, however, that a preservation of the plains themselves would be a more fitting tribute, thus falling in line with the desires of the Earl Grey, who in January had travelled to Quebec to see whether the site could be dedicated as a part of the tercentenary celebrations. By 17 March, the park was created, becoming the first National Historic Site in Canada and was placed under the auspices of the newly and specifically formed National Battlefields Commission, a group that, following the lead of Edward VII, began to collect historical data relating to the plains and the battles that took place on them. Finally, on 24 July 1908, the King's eldest son, Prince George, Prince of Wales (later George V), dedicated the Quebec Battlefields Park at the Plains of Abraham, then presenting the title deeds of the lands to the Governor General. The events were popular with Quebec residents, leading Laurier to opine that Quebecers were \"monarchical by religion, by habit, and by the remembrance of past history.\" The official memorial record of the anniversary was titled The King's Book of Quebec; with the assent of the King (by then George V), the volume was published in 1911.\n\nThe site has become an urban park within Quebec City; the National Battlefields Commission has compared its use to that of Central Park in New York City and Hyde Park in London. It has thus seen various events staged on it, most regularly during the F\u00eate nationale du Qu\u00e9bec, the Quebec Winter Carnival, and the Quebec City Summer Festival.\n\n\n== Recognition ==\nOn 10 September 1959, Canada Post issued Plains of Abraham, 1759\u20131959, designed by Ephrum Philip Weiss with a picture engraved by Yves Baril and lettering engraved by Donald J. Mitchell. The 5\u00a2 stamps are perforated 12 and were printed by Canadian Bank Note Company.The site is mentioned in the 1975 song \"Acadian Driftwood\", by The Band, as well as in the song \"The Maker\", by Daniel Lanois. Gordon Lightfoot mentions the site in \"Nous Vivons Ensemble\" (1971). Geddy Lee mentions the site in his song \"My Favourite Headache\" from his solo album of the same name (2000).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPlains of Abraham - official site at National Battlefields Commission\n1759: From the Warpath to the Plains of Abraham virtual museum\nClash of Empires and The Battle of the Plains of Abraham \u2013 The Canadian War Museum\n \"Abraham, Plains of\" .

          "We had a stroll through this park and found it very enjoyable - particularly with the signs giving information about the battles held here",
          "I always enjoy going to this very important Canadian historic battlefield. Standing near the edge of the field you can just imagine the two armies colliding. You also wonder how on earth the British were able to scale the cliffs to confront the French army. A very interesting",

          "The field is big, so it's a nice place to walk. Unfortunately, when we came it was really cold and windy. You can get a very nice view of the plains if you go inside the fort at the top of the hill, and then up on the lookout posts. If you want decent photos, go early in the",
          "It was very interesting to see something learned about in school. Really require a tour guide or something to explain what happened. I would recommend doing some research on any events being held as there can be some events where 100k can be in the park.",

          "My kids had more fun with rolling and sliding in the snow on this battlefield than the actual significance in Canadian history. The view of this area showed the challenge of climbing this sloping hill and the interesting vantage point of hiding from the views of the defending",

          "I loved being on the site of the famous battle where both French and English commanding generals died in this deciding point in what we call the French and Indian War. I wasn't able to walk as far as I would like to due to the snow. Still, it was exciting seeing this preserved",
          "A large park in the center of the city, the Plains of Abraham allowed us the opportunity to wander through a very snowy historical area. Nice break from the city.",
          "I had a great Air BnB across from the plains, and after seven days had not finished exploring. My only complaint would be a lack of maps specific to the features and historical treasures found inside the plains, but there are more than enough maps of old Quebec and surrounding",
          "Our family of four was skiing there over Christmas time. We had our own skis and the parking was very easy. The place is beautiful in the winter, great views of the river. The lights at night make possible to ski on the main trails after the sunset.",

          "Lots of snow but beautiful views. Must be stunning in the summertime. Worth a visit. We walked up to what seemed like the top. Great view of isle d\u2019Orleans and the river.",
          "I was blown away by how eloquently they told the story of this battle and by the way they explored the experiences of average soldiers and residents. They didn't glorify war, but confronted its realities. In one interactive, you heard letters from a French and a British soldier",
          "The Plains of Abraham Museum is a great place to learn about the French vs English battles of the region. The video show was very interesting because it was basically constructed from the diaries of 4 men: a French, a Canadian, a First Nations and a British. The exhibits are",

          "My hubby is so into war history of any battle Britain fought anywhere so we went in for a look. It\u2019s not my cup of tea but it was still great. One of the only museums that I have ever known that allow you to touch and interact with most of the exhibits. The lady on the front",

The walking paths are kept surprisingly clear - the photo is of one such path and you\u2019d never know we\u2019d received 5+ inches of snow the night before! Going off these groomed trails is also quite",

          "We happened upon this while taking a self guided walking tour and spent more than an hour walking around the park by the St Lawrence River. If you want a peaceful and serene experience, this is a place to go!",

          "Like NYC's Central Park, this is a great place to feel grass and see blue sky while surrounded by concrete. There's a museum, and some displays, but mostly it's green grass and sky. OK, in the winter it's white ice and snow under grey skies, but you get the idea. (Actually, as",

          "When my daughter and I visited Old Quebec City, we wanted to do and see as many places and the Plains of Abraham was top on the list. This area is full of a rich history that is very much a part of Canada\u2019s past, and should be on every Social teachers agenda. We really enjoyed",
          "I recently visited Old Quebec and decided to take the Governors Walk to see where it would lead me. At the very top I arrived at The Plains Of Abraham. If you would like to experience a piece of history, I suggest you visit this historical landmark. You will not be disappointed.",
          "We listened to the french version of the taking of Quebec by Wolfe when he defeated by Montcalm through a cunning ruse, thus securing Canada for the British Empire. The roles of British and French forces are played by actors as are the first people and the French settlers.",

          "Great park to explore. Check out the 400+ wooden steps - we started from the top and went all the way down and then all the way back up. Great way to get your steps in for the day and such great exercise. Near top of the stairs, there are a series of different types of evergreen",

          "We took the governor's walk from the Frontenac around the Citadel of Quebec and from that edifice's walls viewed the site of the famous battle between the British and French. The plains house many artillery pieces from that era and bordered by military garrison building still",
          "Beautiful hike up a big hill well worth the effort. The view of the city from the top put all of the walking during the day in perspective. Take a camera! I had to run back to the hotel, grab my friend, and rush back before sunset to get a picture because it was so beautiful.",
          "As other reviewers have stated, this is a very historical site. The English and French battle it out on this site in the mid 1700s. The grounds are pristine and the markers are well positioned with interesting information about the battle. This is a great expanse to just walk",

          "The museum itself was very dry. A video was shown that was laughable for it's childish graphics depicting the absolutely significant battle between the British and the french. The (spoiler alert!) British won, although you would not guess that by visiting the museum or walking",
          "This is a beautiful (as well as significant historical) space. It was chilly and windy when we visited, but regarless we loved walking this space. We were surprised that the Saint Joan garden was decorated for Halloween. It was a creative mix of the historical and whimsical.",

          "I think the Plains of Abraham might be my favorite urban park. It has a history that many other similar parks, like New York\u2019s Central Park, lack: this was the site of the battle that determined the fate of North America. The grassy hills and tall trees offer a relaxing setting,",
          "If you're really really into the history of Quebec and Canada then this is a must stop. If you're just curious, then it's just an average stop. The focal point is the video that provides an overview of the key battles on the Plains (and Abraham was a local farmer by the way).",

          "Beautiful lawns, gardens and monuments decorate this space , including Joan of Arc in bronze. Its the site of a brutal 20 minute battle between the French and the English where both leaders were killed. Named after Abraham Martin who was a fisherman who was given land in the",
          "The Plains of Abraham are an uphill walk, but well worth your effort. You will be richly rewarded with stunning views of the Fairmont Frontenac and the city.",
          "This open area park is beautful and perfect for a long walk. The floral gardens all around are examples of the Candian love of flowers and so appreicated by all visitors.",
          "This is a nice place to go walk around and sight seeing. You get a great view of the water and a piece of history",
          "Granted not everyone might appreciate the historical significance of this place. There will be some who just see a nice well maintained park in a large city. I guess that's ok, but if you like history and know what happened here you can spend hours walking from the access area",
          "A good place to spend a peaceful afternoon, away from the crowds and traffic of Old Quebec City. Extensive grounds to walk as well as a nature trail partly through woodland. Not much historical information though considering the significance of the site.",
          "Just beautiful...a lovely place to walk and admire the views.Peaceful and quiet with lots of places to sit and contemplate.Many paths to walk or jog. Abundant flowers and trees.",
          "This Unesco site has great paths for strolling through the trees and flowers as well as plenty of history (old fort, watch tower, and more). Some of the best views of the Saint Lawrence as well. Be sure to take the stairs behind the fort to the Chateaux Frontenac.",
          "My wife and I spent part of a lovely afternoon strolling on our own through the park. Lots of vistas. Beautiful flower beds in spots. Great place to stretch your legs. Lots of locals running by. Separately, we also took a guided walking tour of La Citadelle, which is just",
          "You won\u00b4t skip this park with historical past while visiting Quebec city. Come here in the evening and ask about musical performance in Kiosque Edwin-B\u00e9langer. It is a great romantic experience!",
          "The tour absolutely does it's best to make history come alive. We were driven by a member of the team dressed as Abraham's wife. She acted well and made us laugh throughout the tour. Sadly, the area is now so altered that a powerful imagination is required to associate what is",
          "Strange feeling to stand on the ridge and look at one of the most historic spots in Canada. A beautiful park with walking and cycling paths. Promenade de Gouverneurs around the Citadel gives a beautiful view of the St. Lawrence and the south shore. You can actually drive right",
          "Lots of room to wander this grassy park and to ponder the battle of 1759 that Gen. Wolfe\u2019s victory over French forces led by Gen. Montcalm secured Canada for the British Empire. Along the north side runs the Grande Allee, featuring what may be Quebec\u2019s nicest residential",

          "We took the bus tour of the Plains of Abraham. The driver will be the character dressed as Abraham Martin or his wife. We had the Mrs. Martin character drive the bus and give an over view of the history of the Plains of Abraham. She was lively and had a good sense of humour.",
          "The Plains of Abraham Museum is small and the exhibits are not state of the art, but the entry ticket includes a bus tour around the Plains of Abraham. The guide did her best to be entertaining, which meant that she skimped on the historical details. Might be best for families",
          "The museum and the plains do not do much to ignite interest and passion. The bus tour did not go into enough details about the actual battle.",
          "Take your time to stroll through the area, and read the many plaques to get a sense of the fascinating history. A great way to spend a morning walking the pathways. The walk down the steps to the lower river level is quite a hike. If you plan on walking back up, it will take",
          "We were expecting the tour of Plains of Abraham to focus on the battles that occurred there but this was really just a tour of a big park. The guide used a few handouts to pass around to keep the guests interested but if you want to know about the battles just go to the Plains",
          "It was very hot exploring the Plains of Abraham, but worth going to see the views, walls of the Citadel, gardens and museum. Go before the buses arrive and you will enjoy some space and privacy!",
          "Biked through on our electric bike tour and walking would have been nice. Great people watching and May was great time be in the City.",

          "Very well kept area, and plenty of couples and families sitting around the area. Also, very quiet and not much happening (when I events ongoing).",
          "The Plains of Abraham is a gem for the city. Amazing grounds with trails and walking path with nice views of the river at the top of the park. The museum has a good deal of Canadian history on the display. This was a great opportunity to learn more about the history of our",
          "Have to stop and see this spot if you enjoy Canadian History. The museum gives you a great deal of information and for a fee you can see the upper floors and go on a hour bus tour. We chose just to look on the free floor and do a self guided tour as there was so much more to",
          "This park is a huge green space of historical significance. It's worth walking through and reading the various things posted. As a younger man, it was also a good spot to sit at night and stealthily partake in a beverage or two. I'm too old for that now.",
          "Relaxing walk with some great views along the way. The Garden for Joan of Arc was beautiful, It is an easy walk from all of the shopping and restaurants. The Citadel sits above and it also a great tour.",
          "Americans can enjoy this beautiful park as much as Canadians as they recall this important site where the French and Indian War was decided. A different outcome here could have changed U.S. history dramatically! The area, now a massive park, is central to Quebec, and a visit",
          "The park itself is a lovely, quiet park with lots of trails for wandering around. It is next to the Citadel so quite convenient to get to. We came across a garden within the Plains which was so beautiful and peaceful! Easy to find and well worth the search. Enjoy a little",
          "This was a stop on the excursion for the \"on-off\" bus. Scenic location with historical significance. Beautiful landscape. Superstars have concerts here.",
          "We almost missed this walk. Build to celebrate the first French Canadian gouverner. Built to last it seems so for all tourists to enjoy. You can enjoy the view over the river and at the same moment the view over the old town. If you visit old Quebec be sure you walk this plains!",
          "Scenic and safe place to walk. Small historical museum on site and easy walking with plenty of park benches to rest along the way. Lots of different paved walkways to choose from. Great place for a picnic overlooking the St. Lawrence River.",
          "The Plains of Abraham is a beautiful park with stunning views of the St. Lawrence, in any season. There is lots of space, benches for a rest, flower gardens in the summer, and great roadways and a large oval track for a run (the track also has a lane for skaters.) Several",
          "We walked around here after visiting the Citadel.... enormous open space with great views over both the river and the city. Can feel a bit exposed in the heat and humidity, and not a lot of refreshment places, so take water with you.",
          "We went on the bus tour included in the price of our entry to the Plains of Abraham Museum. If I could have given it negative stars I would have. The so-called guide, \u2018Marguerite Abraham\u2019 was RUDE, personally insulting, loud, offensive and historically inaccurate. I have trained",
          "Excellent views and interesting tour. Very nice in the morning and the guides are very knowledgeable.",
          "Plains of Abraham is a big park above the city. There is a beautiful view of Quebec and St. Lawrence river from there. We had a very nice walk there.",
          "Great area of open lands in the middle of the city. Gorgeous park. Walked only about a mile of the park and thoroughly enjoyed its beauty. Would love to come back and spend more time here.",
          "Enjoyed the museum - artifacts and film. All well done. We also did the mini bus tour with a costumed Margaret Martin as our guide.",
          "We loved checking the canons and the weather was nice. We learned some history of the war. My 9 year old really enjoyed it. It was a lot of walking though so wear appropriate shoes.",
          "During the music festival, it was fun walking around here at night listening to the music. By day, lovely gardens",
          "It was interesting to see, but it obviously looks much different than it did in 1759 (no surprise there). However, it was quite difficult to visualize the battlefield as I suspect the terrain has been moved around a bit over the centuries. It is a great park to visit, but more",
          "You can get a free guided walking tour that starts here which is excellent. Though our guide had no sense of humor, he was full of colorful facts about the fascinating city",
          "Beautiful area that allows families to enjoy the outdoors. Lots of events are held here. Walking jogging and biking are all enjoyed here. Public washroom located close to area.",
          "Not as impressed as I should be, thought this was a bit boring, but the tour guide was also a bit boring!",
          "Put on your walking shoes and stroll through the vast Plains of Abraham. Visit the museums. Go to the gardens. Read about the battles. It's all great.",
          "Very extensive park with nice views to the Lawrence river. It connects with the mist beautiful park here that is Joanna D\u2019Arc. Flowers everywhere and a statue from her in the centre. Really worth seeing.",

          "Drove through on bus tour looked like a great way to spend an afternoon . Great garden and vast space to be outdoors .",
          "Like the Parliament in Ottawa, the Plains of Abraham are part of our collective identity. The museum is small and quiet but the parc is beautiful and since it was the sight of such an important battle that changed Canada forever, it is a valuable visit.",
          "Wonderful bus tour - it was more of a one woman show on a bus. The exhibition (especially the movie) was also fantastic. The kids enjoyed it all as much as us.",
          "Beautiful, Immaculate park. Run, walk, bike, picnic. Nice place to take a break and relax or work out.",

          "My visit here included a 5K Run/Walk as part of a business Conference...I was impressed with the size of the park...great running track and paved in-line skate track. There are cannons and historical plaques around the park with a view of the river. Many trails through the",

          "This historic site is well worth a visit especially for Canadians, British and French. The museum video was good and the museum generally well prepared. The Abraham's Bus trip around the Plains was a bit disappointing: get off before the end to visit the Martello tower and the",
          "The plains are lovely and historic and there are beautiful gardens and promenades etc. The museum is a dud however. You have to buy an expensive ticket which includes a bus tour (which is an utter waste of time) as well as a film and museum and walking tour. The museum is also",
          "Visited the Plains of Abraham on Canada Day, a National Holiday. The large park is adjacent to the Citadelle at the edge of the UPPER TOWN and runs south parallel to the St. Lawrence River. The Quebec Museum of Fine Arts is at the other end of the park. It is a BIG park. Lots to",

          "The museum was okay, the best part being on the 3rd floor where military uniforms of both the French and the British are displayed. We took the bus tour that is included in the price. Although the bus driver who is also your tour guide, was cute and charming, the tour leaves a",
          "We visited the Plains of Abraham Museum and then did their private tour of the plains on a small bus with an expert and very entertaining guide in period dress. As a bit of a history buff myself, I had learned about the battle between British General Wolfe and French General",
          "We didn't spend as much time here as we might have due to the weather, but this is one of the nicer parks I've seen. Lovely views, well maintained, great place to walk or relax, what's not to love?",
          "This park is a wonderful retreat from the city or from the crazy crowded touristy streets of Quebec City. It's quite large, better to be seen on a bike than to walk.",
          "Very cool to see something with such history. To see something in person that you had read about in school. We had a very good view from the revolving restaurant",
          "The family and I hiked here after a heavy lunch at Louis Hebert nearby so we walked to walk and enjoy the weather and scenery. The park is amazing and we walked by the Bell amphitheater where Shawn Mendes had performed the evening before during the Festival d\u2019ete Quebec. The",
          "We went to the music festival that was at plains of Abraham. I would recommend paying for an upgraded ticket so you have access to a better location with less people. Besides a great concert there were free areas with food trucks and activities. Concert was a lot of fun We",

          "i went here running during our stay in quebec in june. the weather was really nice and the park just beautiful. i think this area is the best to go for a run, you have a lot of nice trails bit also streets and only a few cars. it was beautiful with all the trees and also a lot",
          "We walked around the battlefield after walking up from our hotel, Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac on the street. You can also access the battlefield from the boardwalk but there are a very steep steps It was interesting to walk the battlefield and to go over to the Citadel Also, the Plains",
          "Although the history and view from the Plains of Abraham are always great, I was a bit disappointed during my return trip after 12 years. The construction changed the walk and the way one would imagine the battles. The museum had changed and was much blander than our 1st visit.",

          "A refreshing view of the river a few moments walk from the old city walls. The Governors walk from the pavilion was closed for security during our visit, it would be an easy walk down to the river.",
          "This was a spot on my must see list, as it was one of the filming locations in the Korean Drama, Goblin. The views are gorgeous and we got a nice shot with our cruise ship way in the background. Beautiful view of the hotel from here as well. If you're a Goblin fan, make sure",

          "The Plains of Abraham are to Qu\u00e9bec City what Central Park is to New York or Golden Gate Park to San Francisco. It is an oasis of greenery in the heart of the city, with historic sites, running and walking paths, recreational activities, spectacular views, picnic areas, cultural",
          "Beautiful spot and does a nice job of presenting the history of it. Also they host local festivals nearby too.",
          "The word Plains should not evoke images of flat Nebraska. I ended up in the vicinity at the edge of the Citadel after a full day in the old city. It was a beautiful rolling parkland with open spaces, and walking trails and trees and views and I just didn't have the physical",

          "The Plains of Abraham museum provides an excellent introduction to the famous battle of 1759 in which the course of North America changed forever. Accessible to anyone with a modicum of interest in the past, what was especially vivid was the use of quotes in the audio visual",
          "We were so unexpectedly pleased with the museum here! It is small but perfect... The first exhibit encouraged you to be hands on... get put in the gallows.. Crawl into a field tent and write your journal with a feather, play a soldier's drum listening to the battle field",
          "This is a lovely space and well-used by visitors and locals. It was not in full splendour on our visit, except the Jeanne d'Arc Garden planted with bulbs and other early varieties. I would have liked more interpretive panels, better legends (many did not show the \"You are Here\"",

          "I was there at the end of April and was still freezing, but we visited the area and it\u00b4s huge and nice. I wonder how it is on summer time. It\u00b4s also a landmark of Canada history.",

          "We had an extra day in Quebec City and decided to wander through the park. It turned out to be a great morning. The size of the area is incredible. Make sure you read the history so you understand the significance of the area. There are great vantage points and a lot of quiet",
          "The museum was educational. It started with a display on crimes and the laws back in the day which preceded a 30-minute film. The (animated) film provided a good historical overview of the events. It was quite a surprise on the extent of battle and overall damage and death",
          "It was a good exercise for my wife and I. We finished walking lower town and followed google map to go there along the harbor. I carried my 3 years old boy and my wife carried stroller climbing up 420 steps to the lawn. It's lot of things to see and my son enjoyed running on",
          "Unfortunately we arrived in April when the snow sports season (skiing and snowshoeing) had finished, despite the 3foot deep piles of snow everywhere! Good for a stroll, I can imagine that in Spring, Summer and Autumn this would be a delightful place for strolling and picnicing.",

          "We walked for an hour in the park to get the views of the river and experience some history. On a cold wintery March day the park was quite deserted and the trails were a little rough and icy.",
          "We knew this was a very historic place. A battle was fought here that decided the fate of empires. However, there wasn't much to see or do in that connection. Instead, we enjoyed quite a pleasant walk, on a rather blustery day. At times, the path was a little steep, but there",

          "You can feel the history of this place surrounded by beautiful grounds and historic buildings surrounding.. Highly recommend a visit",

          "It was intereting to learn about this area as it was where the decisive battle between the British and French was carried out. It was amusing to see a telephone booth there now. In the summer there are music festivals and in the winter they groom the park for cross country",
          "This park is worth the visit, not only for its historical significance but also because it's a great walk with great views",
          "Go for a walk or a picnic in the park it has some wonderful history in the park but look it up before you go we took. Slay ride and had a wonderful experience would do it again",
          "Again you stroll through here with all the information on plaques sprinked around the area explaining what happened and when.",
          "Make sure you have a lot of time to do this walk justice, you will see information plaques throughout your walk explaining what happen and when. Just loved the history.",
          "As a history major, I can tell you there are few battles in history that change the fate of a nation, this single battle did that!",
          "The park is very nice to walk around. The museum is okay. Great for a nice place to stroll or have a picnic, but unless you have several days to visit, it would not be first on my list. The citadel however right next door is worth the visit.",
          "I visited in October and each morning I ran through the Plains of Abraham. There are well established roads as well as trails (that are used for snow shoeing in the winter) that made for lovely running through the beautiful fall foliage. Would make a lovely place for a picnic!",
          "We were able to take a tour around the park and go to the Plains of Abraham museum. The park was animated! Even in the middle of winter there were many activities (Skating and snow shoeing) not to mention the planned activities. The museum is amazing! Interactive battles exhibit",
          "This historic battlefield is just outside the citadel. The place where Wolfe and Montcalm fought during the 7 years war and the Americans attempted to take the city during the Revolution. Several watchtowers and statues are around the area along with the battlefield. They",

          "We went there in the winter, the view was amazing! But I felt like it should be more accessible. The ground was all very slippery. Some snow should be removed more often.",
          "Great open area, similar to Central Park but with much more rolling hill terrain and capped at one end by the city walls. Very large and scenic. Lots of people snowshoeing, nordic skiing, and skating on the rink.",
          "We went here to ice skate and it was really fun. They have onsite rentals and the staff are nice and friendly.",
          "Visited the Plains of Abraham while in Quebec. The view is outstanding but I cannot believe the French lost with such a commanding position.",

          "The Plains of Abraham are a ways out of the main part of the old city. We got there via the Hop On Hop Off Bus, but you could also walk. The Plains are adjacent to the Citadel. Be sure to read the history of this area before visiting it.",
          "I went for a jog here and it was a relaxing and beautiful oasis from the commotion of the city. You can walk on trails or on the roadway.",
          "We spent the morning wandering around the Plains of Abraham. Quite a lot of walking. Wonderful views of the city and surrounding areas. Would do a tour next visit. Museum looked interesting but did not have time",
          "Like the title says, it is a big park. But not any park. It's a also a nice way to walk to your next attractions out of the traffic and a nice environment. On one side you find the Citadelle, has you go west you'll cross the Martello towers and the Museum and on the west side",
          "Not much to see here, really. Just a big field along side some fortifications. There's a statue to explain who 'Abraham' was. Nevertheless, if one takes the 'Hop On, Hop Off' bus tour, one gets to listen to a whole lot of information on the battle at the Plains of Abraham.",
          "Elevated.Good views over the St.Lawrence river,history all around,both English and French,good walking area,worth a visit on a sunny day.",

          "This is a very nice large park. The trees and beautiful in the fall. It is worth reading about the very historic battle here, the result of which may be why Quebec is in Canada and not France! There is a very nice graded \"nature trail\" in the forest that starts near the",

          "I am interested in the siege of Quebec City in 1759 so had to visit The Pains of Abraham and the associated museum. The area is well kept and it is a pleasure to stroll through this lovely park. The leaders of both sides of the siege (Generals Wolfe and Montcalm) are recognised",
          "We walked along the Plains of Abraham and went to the museum. It's a nice walk and there is plenty to see. The museum is rather small and comes with a multi media show and several displays. But it's worth doing, especially if you really like history. You can get a deal if you go",

          "If I had to give this park any kind of negative review it would be the following, not enough public facilities (bathrooms and water fountains), and too many attractions that you have to pay for. I can kind of understand paying for the Plains of Abraham museum, and the maybe the",

        "wiki": "Quebec City ( (listen) or ; French: Ville de Qu\u00e9bec, Western Abnaki: Kephek), officially Qu\u00e9bec ([keb\u025bk] (listen)), is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. As of July 2016 the city had a population of 531,902, and the metropolitan area had a population of 800,296. It is the eleventh largest city and the seventh largest metropolitan area in Canada.\nThe Algonquian people had originally named the area K\u00e9bec, an Algonquin word meaning \"where the river narrows\", because the Saint Lawrence River narrows proximate to the promontory of Quebec and its Cape Diamant. Explorer Samuel de Champlain founded a French settlement here in 1608, and adopted the Algonquin name. Quebec City is one of the oldest European cities in North America. The ramparts surrounding Old Quebec (Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec) are the only fortified city walls remaining in the Americas north of Mexico. This area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985 as the \"Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec\".The city's landmarks include the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac hotel that dominates the skyline and the Citadelle of Quebec, an intact fortress that forms the centrepiece of the ramparts surrounding the old city and includes a secondary royal residence. The National Assembly of Quebec (provincial legislature), the Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec (National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec), and the Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation (Museum of Civilization) are found within or near Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n\n== Name and usage ==\n\nAccording to the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, and the Geographical Names Board of Canada, the names of Canadian cities and towns have only one official form. Thus, Qu\u00e9bec is officially spelled with an accented \u00e9 in both Canadian English and French.In English, the city and the province are officially distinguished by the fact that the province does not have an accented \u00e9 and the city does. Informally, however, the accent is usually omitted in common usage, so the unofficial form \"Quebec City\" is used to distinguish the city from the province. In French, the names of provinces are gendered nouns and the names of cities are not, so the city and the province are already distinguished by the presence or absence of a definite article in front of the name. For example, the concept of \"in Quebec\" is expressed as \"\u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec\" for the city and \"au Qu\u00e9bec\" for the province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== French Regime (1500s\u20131763) ===\nQuebec City is one of the oldest European settlements in North America and the only fortified city north of Mexico whose walls still exist. While many of the major cities in Latin America date from the 16th century, among cities in Canada and the U.S., few were created earlier than Quebec City (St. John's, Harbour Grace, Port Royal, St. Augustine, Santa Fe, Jamestown, and Tadoussac). \n\nIt is home to the earliest known French settlement in North America, Fort Charlesbourg-Royal, established in 1541 by explorer Jacques Cartier with some 400 persons but abandoned less than a year later due to the hostility of the natives and the harsh winter. The fort was at the mouth of the Rivi\u00e8re du Cap Rouge, in the suburban former town of Cap-Rouge (which merged into Quebec City in 2002).\nQuebec was founded by Samuel de Champlain, a French explorer and diplomat, on 3 July 1608, and at the site of a long abandoned St. Lawrence Iroquoian settlement called Stadacona. Champlain, also called \"The Father of New France\", served as its administrator for the rest of his life.\nThe name \"Canada\" refers to this settlement. Although the Acadian settlement at Port-Royal was established three years earlier, Quebec came to be known as the cradle of North America's Francophone population. The place seemed favourable to the establishment of a permanent colony.\n\nThe population of the settlement remained small for decades. In 1629 it was captured by English privateers, led by David Kirke, during the Anglo-French War. Samuel de Champlain argued that the English seizing of the lands was illegal as the war had already ended, and worked to have the lands returned to France. As part of the ongoing negotiations of their exit from the Anglo-French War, in 1632 the English king Charles agreed to return the lands in exchange for Louis XIII paying his wife's dowry. These terms were signed into law with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The lands in Quebec and Acadia were returned to the French Company of One Hundred Associates.In 1665, there were 550 people in 70 houses living in the city. One-quarter of the people were members of religious orders: secular priests, Jesuits, Ursulines nuns and the order running the local hospital, Hotel-Dieu.\nQuebec was the headquarters of many raids against New England during the four French and Indian Wars. In 1690 the city was attacked by the English, but was successfully defended. In the last of the conflicts, the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War), Quebec was captured by the British in 1759 and held until the end of the war in 1763. In that time many battles and sieges took place: the Battle of Beauport, a French victory (31 July 1759); the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, in which British troops under General James Wolfe defeated the French General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm on 13 September 1759 and shortly thereafter took the city after a short siege. A French counter attack saw a French victory at the Battle of Sainte-Foy (28 April 1760) but the subsequent second Siege of Quebec the following month however saw a final British victory.\nFrance ceded New France, including the city, to Britain in 1763.At the end of French rule in 1763, forests, villages, fields and pastures surrounded the town of 8,000 inhabitants. The town distinguished itself by its monumental architecture, fortifications, and affluent homes of masonry and shacks in the suburbs of Saint-Jean and Saint-Roch. Despite its urbanity and its status as capital, Quebec City remained a small colonial city with close ties to its rural surroundings. Nearby inhabitants traded their farm surpluses and firewood for imported goods from France at the two city markets.\n\n\n=== Modern history (1763\u2013present) ===\n\nDuring the American Revolution, revolutionary troops from the southern colonies assaulted the British garrison in an attempt to 'liberate' Quebec City, in a conflict now known as the Battle of Quebec (1775). The defeat of the revolutionaries from the south put an end to the hopes that the peoples of Quebec would rise and join the American Revolution so that Canada would join the Continental Congress and become part of the original United States of America along with the other British colonies of continental North America. In effect, the battle's outcome was the split of British North America into two distinct political entities.\nThe city itself was not attacked during the War of 1812, when the United States again attempted to annex Canadian lands. Amid fears of another American attack on Quebec City, construction of the Citadelle of Quebec began in 1820. The Americans did not attack Canada after the War of 1812, but the Citadelle continued to house a large British garrison until 1871. It is still in use by the military and is also a tourist attraction.\nUntil the late 18th century Qu\u00e9bec was the most populous city in present-day Canada. As of the census of 1790, Montreal surpassed it with 18,000 inhabitants, but Quebec (pop. 14,000) remained the administrative capital of New France. It was then made the capital of Lower Canada by the Constitutional Act of 1791. From 1841 to 1867, the capital of the Province of Canada rotated between Kingston, Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa and Quebec City (from 1852 to 1856 and from 1859 to 1866).\nBefore the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, the only French-speaking officer training school was the Quebec City School of Military Instruction, founded in 1864. The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867. In 1868, The School of Artillery was formed in Montreal.\n\nThe Quebec Conference on Canadian Confederation was held in the city in 1864. In 1867, Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the definite capital of the Dominion of Canada, while Quebec City was confirmed as the capital of the newly created province of Quebec.\nDuring World War II, two conferences were held in Quebec City. The First Quebec Conference was held in 1943 with Franklin D. Roosevelt (President of the United States), Winston Churchill (Prime Minister of the United Kingdom), William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister of Canada's) and T. V. Soong (minister of foreign affairs of China). The Second Quebec Conference was held in 1944, and was attended by Churchill and Roosevelt. They took place in the buildings of the Citadelle and at the nearby Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac. A large part of the D-Day landing plans were made during those meetings.\nUntil 2002, Quebec was a mostly urbanized city and its territory coterminous with today's borough of La Cit\u00e9-Limoilou. The Government of Quebec then mandated a municipal reorganization in the province, and many suburbs of the north shore of the Saint-Lawrence were merged into Quebec City, taking the form of boroughs. In 2008 the city celebrated its 400th anniversary and was gifted funds for festivities and construction projects by provincial and federal governments, as well as public artwork by various entities, including foreign countries.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nQuebec City was built on the north bank of the Saint Lawrence River, where it narrows and meets the mouth of the Saint-Charles River. Old Quebec is located on top and at the foot of Cap-Diamant, which is on the eastern edge of a plateau called the promontory of Quebec (Quebec hill). Because of this topographic feature, the oldest and most urbanized borough of La Cit\u00e9-Limoilou can be divided into upper and lower town. North of the hill, the Saint Lawrence Lowlands is flat and has rich, arable soil. Past this valley, the Laurentian Mountains lies to the north of the city but its foothills are within the municipal limits.\nThe Plains of Abraham are located on the southeastern extremity of the plateau, where high stone walls were integrated during colonial days. On the northern foot of the promontory, the lower town neighbourhoods of Saint-Roch and Saint-Sauveur (fr), traditionally working class, are separated from uptown's Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Saint-Sacrement (fr) by a woody area attested as Coteau Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve.\nThe area was affected by the 1925 Charlevoix\u2013Kamouraska earthquake.\nThe administrative region in which it is situated is officially referred to as Capitale-Nationale, and the term \"national capital\" is used to refer to Quebec City itself at the provincial level.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Quebec City is classified as humid continental (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfb).Quebec City experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are warm and occasionally hot, with periods of hotter temperatures which compounded with the high humidity, create a high heat index that belies the average high of 22\u201325 \u00b0C (72\u201377 \u00b0F) and lows of 11\u201313 \u00b0C (52\u201355 \u00b0F). Winters are cold, windy and snowy with average high temperatures \u22125 to \u22128 \u00b0C (23 to 18 \u00b0F) and lows \u221213 to \u221218 \u00b0C (9 to 0 \u00b0F). Spring and fall, although short, bring chilly to warm temperatures. Late heat waves as well as \"Indian summers\" are a common occurrence.On average, Quebec City receives 1,190 millimetres (46.85 in) of precipitation, of which 899 millimetres (35.39 in) is rain and 303 millimetres (11.93 in) is the melt from 316 centimetres (124.4 in) of snowfall per annum. The city experiences around 1,916 hours of bright sunshine annually or 41.5% of possible sunshine, with summer being the sunniest, but also slightly the wettest season. During winter, snow generally stays on the ground from the end of November till mid-April.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Quebec City was 36.1 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1953. The coldest temperature ever recorded was \u221236.7 \u00b0C (\u221234 \u00b0F) on 10 January 1890 and 14 January 2015.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMuch of the city's notable traditional architecture is located in Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec (Old Quebec), within and below the fortifications. This area has a distinct European feel with its stone buildings and winding streets lined with shops and restaurants. Porte St-Louis and Porte St-Jean are the main gates through the walls from the modern section of downtown; the Kent Gate was a gift to the province from Queen Victoria and the foundation stone was laid by the Queen's daughter, Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne, on 11 June 1879. West of the walls are the Parliament Hill area, and to the south the Plains of Abraham.\nThe upper and lower town are linked by numerous stairs such as the Escalier \u00ab casse-cou \u00bb (literally \"neck-breaking\" steps) or the Old Quebec Funicular on the historic Petit Champlain street where many small boutiques are found, not far Notre-Dame-des-Victoires church and Mus\u00e9e de la Civilisation.\n\nAlong with concrete high-rises such as \u00c9difice Marie-Guyart and Le Concorde on parliament hill (see List of tallest buildings in Quebec City), the city's skyline is dominated by the massive Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac hotel, perched on top of Cap-Diamant. It was designed by architect Bruce Price, as one of a series of \"ch\u00e2teau\" style hotels built for the Canadian Pacific Railway company. The railway company sought to encourage luxury tourism and bring wealthy travellers to its trains.\nAlongside the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac is the Terrasse Dufferin, a walkway along the edge of the cliff, offering views of the Saint Lawrence River. The terrace leads toward the nearby Plains of Abraham, site of the battle in which the British took Quebec from France, and the Citadelle of Quebec, a Canadian Forces installation and the federal vice-regal secondary residence. The Parliament Building, the meeting place of the Parliament of Quebec, is also near the Citadelle.\nNear the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac is Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec Cathedral, mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec. It is the first church in the New World to be raised to a basilica and is the primatial church of Canada. There are 37 National Historic Sites of Canada in Quebec City and its enclaves.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\nOne of the most notable is The Battlefields Park, which is home to 50 historical artillery pieces and the Plains of Abraham. The park offers views of the St. Lawrence River and has multiple historical structures and statues like the Joan of Arc on Horseback and a couple of  Martello Towers. Historically this was the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), a decisive British victory in the Seven Years' War which ended French rule in what would become Canada, and the later Battle of Quebec (1775) during the American Revolutionary War, where the British were able to hold onto its last stronghold in the Northern extent of its North American territory.\nOther large and centrally located parks are Parc Victoria, Parc Maizerets and Cartier-Br\u00e9beuf National Historic Site.\nQuebec City's largest park is the Parc Chauveau (fr), which is crossed by the suburban section of the city-wide Saint-Charles River and is thus also part of the 31 kilometres (19 mi) long Saint-Charles River's linear park. At Chauveau, activities such as canoeing, fishing and cross-country skiing are offered depending on the season, in addition to an interior soccer stadium. Among others, there is also the beach of Beauport Bay, as well as the Marais du Nord (north-end marsh land).\nQuebec is the only large city in Canada along with Halifax lacking a public greenhouse. Nonetheless, outside areas known for their public gardens or landscaping include:\nThe linear park named Promenade Samuel-De Champlain (fr) that stretches 4.6 kilometres (2.9 mi) alongside the Saint Lawrence River, from Pierre Laporte Bridge to Sillery's east-end. Its bicycle and pedestrian paths then continues all the way to Old Quebec and then along the Saint-Charles River. Just like the beach at Beauport Bay, the construction of the Promenade was funded by provincial and federal governments to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Quebec City in 2008.\nParc du Bois-de-Coulonge (fr), slightly west of the Plains of Abraham in Sillery, and known for its natural landscaping as well as traditional gardens, such as those surrounding the historical Villa Bagatelle (fr). The historical significance of the park also lies in the former presence of the viceregal Government House of Quebec (1845\u20131966).\nThe Domaine de Maizerets, where are found an arboretum and an observation tower, not far from the Saint Lawrence River and Beauport Bay.\nDomaine Cataraqui (fr) in Sillery.\nThe Roger-Van den Hende Botanical Garden (fr) of Laval University.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighbourhoods ===\n\nOn 1 January 2002, the 12 former towns of Sainte-Foy, Beauport, Charlesbourg, Sillery, Loretteville, Val-B\u00e9lair, Cap-Rouge, Saint-\u00c9mile, Vanier, L'Ancienne-Lorette, Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures and Lac-Saint-Charles were annexed by Quebec City. This was one of several municipal mergers which took place across Quebec on that date. Following a demerger referendum, L'Ancienne-Lorette and Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures were reconstituted as separate municipalities on 1 January 2006, but the other former municipalities remain part of Quebec City. On 1 November 2009, Quebec City re-organized its boroughs, reducing the number from 8 to 6.Quebec City's six boroughs (French: arrondissements) are further divided into 35 neighbourhoods (French: quartiers). In most cases, the name of the latter remained the same as the historical town (French: ville) or parish municipality it replaced. Neighbourhoods each elect their own council, whose powers rest in public consultations.\nCompared to many other cities in North America, there is less variation between average household incomes between the neighbourhoods. However, some disparities exist. The southwest former cities of Sillery, Cap-Rouge and Sainte-Foy are considered to be the wealthiest, along with some parts of Montcalm and Old Quebec.The city's traditional working-class areas are found in the lower town below Old Quebec (Saint-Sauveur and Saint-Roch) and directly across the Saint-Charles River to the north (Vanier and Limoilou). However, parts of Limoilou, Saint-Sauveur and particularly Saint-Roch have seen gentrification in the last 20 years, attracting young professionals and the construction of new offices and condos.Northern sections (Loretteville, Val-B\u00e9lair) and eastern sections (Beauport, Charlesbourg) are mostly a mix of middle-class residential suburbs with industrial pockets.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to Statistics Canada, there were 531,902 people residing in Quebec City proper in 2016, and 800,296 people in the metropolitan area. Of the former total, 48.2% were male and 51.8% were female. Children under five accounted for approximately 4.7% of the resident population of Quebec City. This compares with 5.2% in the province of Quebec, and 5.6% for Canada overall.\nIn 2016, 20.6% of the resident population in Quebec City was of retirement age (65 and over for males and females) compared with 16.9% in Canada. The median age is 43.3 years of age compared to 41.2 years of age for Canada as a whole. In the five years between 2011 and 2016, the population of Quebec City grew by 3%.In 2016, 6.4% of Quebec City residents reported visible minority status, a relatively low figure for a large city; the national average was 22.3%. The largest visible minority group were Black Canadians, who formed 2.4% of the population. Quebec City also has a lower percentage of aboriginal Canadians (3.4%) than the national average of 6.2%.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe great majority of city residents are native French speakers. The English-speaking community peaked in relative terms during the 1860s, when 40% of Quebec City's residents were Anglophone. Today, native Anglophones make up only 1.5% of the population of both the city and its metropolitan area. However, the summer tourist season and the Quebec Winter Carnival attract significant numbers of Anglophone (as well as Francophone) visitors, and English can often be heard in areas frequented by tourists.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, 94.6% of Quebec City's population spoke French as their mother tongue.  In addition, more than a third of city residents reported speaking both French and English.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMost jobs in Quebec City are concentrated in public administration, defence, services, commerce, transport and tourism. As the provincial capital, the city benefits from being a regional administrative and services centre: apropos, the provincial government is the largest employer in the city, employing 27,900 people as of 2007. CHUQ (the local hospital network) is the city's largest institutional employer, with more than 10,000 employees in 2007. The unemployment rate in June 2018 was 3.8%, below the national average (6.0%) and the second lowest of Canada's 34 largest cities, behind Peterborough (2.7%).Around 10% of jobs are in manufacturing. Principal products include pulp and paper, processed food, metal/wood items, chemicals, electronics and electrical equipment, and printed materials. The city hosts the headquarters of a variety of prominent companies, including: fashion retailer La Maison Simons, engineering firms BPR and Norda Stelo; Cominar real estate investment trust; Industrial Alliance, La Capitale, Promutuel, SSQ Financial Group, and Union Canadienne in the insurance sector; Beenox, Gearbox Software,  Frima Studio, Sarbakan and Ubisoft in the computer games industry; AeternaZentaris and DiagnoCure in pharmaceuticals; Amalgame, Cossette and Vision 7 in marketing and advertising; Institut National d'Optique (INO), EXFO, OptoSecurity in technology. It is also the domicile of the sole manufactory of the cigarette maker Rothmans, Benson & Hedges.\n\n\n=== Business districts ===\n\nWhile the traditional central business districts and their large office buildings are found on Parliament Hill (especially for provincial administration) and just below in Saint-Roch (nowadays notable for IT and the video game industry), a newer one has emerged in the Boulevard Laurier (fr) area of Sainte-Foy, where a number of accounting and law firms have moved since the 2000s. Other suburban places identified by the City for their potential are the Lebourgneuf area for private offices, as well as Estimauville Street where the Government of Canada already has many civil servants and where several city officials are expected to move in the 2020s.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nQuebec City is known for its Winter Carnival, its summer music festival and its Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day celebrations.\nThe Jardin zoologique du Qu\u00e9bec, now closed, reopened in 2002 after extensive repairs before ultimately shuttering in 2006. It featured 750 specimens of 300 different species of animals. The zoo specialized in winged fauna and garden themes, but also featured several species of mammals. While it emphasized Quebec's indigenous fauna, one of its main attractions was the Indo-Australian greenhouse, featuring fauna and flora from regions surrounding the Indian Ocean.Parc Aquarium du Qu\u00e9bec, which reopened in 2002 on a site overlooking the Saint Lawrence River, features more than 10,000 specimens of mammals, reptiles, fish and other aquatic fauna of North America and the Arctic. Polar bears and various species of seals of the Arctic sector and the \"Large Ocean\", a large basin offering visitors a view from underneath, make up part of the aquarium's main attractions.\nQu\u00e9bec City has a number of historic sites, art galleries and museums, including Citadelle of Quebec, Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec, Ursulines of Quebec, and Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation.\n\nOther tourist attractions include Montmorency Falls, and, just outside the city limits, the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr\u00e9, the Mont-Sainte-Anne ski resort, and the Ice Hotel.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nQuebec City has hosted a number of recent sporting events, as well as being shortlisted for the 2002 Winter Olympics city selection. The Special Olympics Canada National Winter Games was held in the city from 26 February to 1 March 2008. Quebec City co-hosted with Halifax, Nova Scotia, the 2008 IIHF World Championship. Regular sporting events held in the city include the Coupe Banque Nationale, a Women's Tennis Association tournament; Crashed Ice, an extreme downhill skating race; Quebec City International Pee-Wee Tournament, a minor hockey tournament; and the Tour de Qu\u00e9bec International cycling stage race. In December 2011, Quebec City hosted the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final at the Pavillon de la Jeunesse at ExpoCit\u00e9.\n\nThe city currently has two professional teams. The Dynamo de Qu\u00e9bec a professional soccer club which competes in the Premi\u00e8re ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec and the Capitales de Qu\u00e9bec, which plays in the Frontier League in downtown's Canac stadium. The team was established in 1999, and originally played in the Northern League. It has seven league titles, won in 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2017. A professional basketball team, the Quebec Kebs, played in National Basketball League of Canada in 2011 but folded before the 2012 season.\nThe city had a professional ice hockey team, the Quebec Nordiques, which played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 to 1979 and the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1979 to 1995, maintaining a strong rivalry with the Montreal Canadiens. Due to a disadvantageous exchange rate with respect to the US dollar, the team moved to Denver, Colorado, in 1995, becoming the Colorado Avalanche. A lower-tier team, the Quebec Rafales, played in the professional International Hockey League from 1996 to 1998.\n\nThe Videotron Centre was built with the hope of getting an NHL franchise (relocation or expansion) in Quebec City. The project was funded regardless of whether an NHL team arrives. It is also hoped that the arena can help Quebec City win a future Winter Olympics games bid. It has now replaced the Colis\u00e9e Pepsi as the main multifunctional arena in Quebec City.\nOther teams include the Quebec Remparts in major junior hockey (QMJHL), Universit\u00e9 Laval varsity team Rouge & Or, the Quebec City Monarks, and Quebec City Rebelles of La Ligue de Football de Qu\u00e9bec; the Alouettes de Charlesbourg of the Ligue de Baseball Junior \u00c9lite du Qu\u00e9bec; the women's hockey team Quebec Phoenix of the Canadian Women's Hockey League; and soccer club Quebec Arsenal of the W-League.\nQuebec City holds the COOP FIS Cross-Country World Cup. This is a ski event that welcomes the best of that sport.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nSince the 1970s, centre-right parties such as Union Nationale, Cr\u00e9dit social, Conservative Party of Canada (CPC), Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec and Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec (CAQ) have been more popular in the Quebec City region than elsewhere in the province. After the federal election of 2006, six of the ten conservative ridings of the province were found in its metropolitan area (where the CPC garnered 39% of the vote, against 25% at the provincial scale) and in the city proper, the CPC won three of the four seats that existed at that time (the riding of Quebec went to the Bloc). Along with the city's lesser support for Quebec sovereignty, this led political pundits to speculate about a \"Quebec City mystery\".Various lines of thought were offered, including the popularity of the talk radio stations CHOI and FM93 expressing fiscally conservative and non-politically correct opinions. Over the years, this genre has been qualified by its detractors as radio poubelle (fr) (\"trash radio\") and hosts like Jeff Fillion and Andr\u00e9 Arthur likened to shock jocks. Also, compared to the rest of the province, people of the area may favor harsher criminal sentences, and lower-class households may share political views more in line with those earning more. The reasons for this remain unclear. Another researcher put forward the historical factors that led to Montreal surpassing Quebec as the metropolis of British North America in the early 19th century. According to this theory, its permanent status of \"second city\" (albeit the capital) engendered feelings of \"repressed jealousy\".The \"mystery\" was relativized following the 2011 federal election. All five ridings within the city were won by the leftist New Democratic Party, in the so-called \"orange wave\" that temporarily swept the province. Nonetheless, five of the six seats won by the Conservatives in the province were found in the greater Quebec City area. At the 2018 provincial election, the leftist party Qu\u00e9bec solidaire managed to win two districts, Taschereau and Jean-Lesage, the most densely populated in town, but the centre-right CAQ, as it swept the province, won six of the nine districts encompassing the city, and 15 of the 18 in the administratives regions of Capitale-Nationale and Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches (south shore of the city).\n\n\n=== Municipal government ===\n\nQuebec City is governed by a mayor\u2013council government, which includes the 21 single-member districts of the legislative Quebec City Council and the separately elected mayor. The councilors are elected by first-past-the-post voting while the mayor is elected by the city at-large. Both usually belong to political parties and are elected at the same time every 4 years. The mayor is an ex officio member of the council but is not its president and has no vote. The current one is R\u00e9gis Labeaume, first elected in 2007.\nEach of the city's six boroughs has a council composed of 3 to 5 of the aforementioned councillors, depending on the size of its population. It has jurisdiction with matters such as local road maintenance, leisure, waste collection, and small grants for community projects and others, but cannot tax or borrow money. The boroughs are further divided into 35 neighbourhoods, which also have councils devoted to public consultations, each led by 11 citizens. Their geographical limits may be distinct from those of the city's 21 electoral districts, and councillors also sit at their neighbourhood councils as non-voting ex officio members.\n\n\n==== Public safety ====\nThe city is protected by Service de police de la Ville de Qu\u00e9bec and Service de protection contre les incendies de Qu\u00e9bec (fire dept.) The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Quebec City has one of the lowest crime rates in Canada, with 3,193 per 100,000 persons in 2017, only behind Toronto's CMA (3,115). Exceptionally, no homicide (defined as a criminal death, deliberate or not) was reported in 2007. Still, eight homicides occurred the following year.On 29 January 2017, a university student shot and killed six people with another 17 injured in a mass shooting at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre. Even after accounting for this event, the CMA of Quebec had the second lowest Crime Severity Index in the country in 2017, at 48.5, after that of Barrie (45.3). For the year 2017, the number of reported incidents investigated as hate crimes by the city police increased from 57 to 71, and for those specifically targeting Muslims from 21 to 42. The overall rate of reported hate crimes was thus 7.1 per 100,000 population \u2014 higher than the national average (3.9) and in Montreal (4.7) but lower than rates in Hamilton, Ottawa and Thunder Bay.There were two first-degree murders in 2018, seven in 2017 (six of which were due to the mosque shooting), one in 2016, two in 2015 and three in 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Universit\u00e9 Laval (Laval University) is in the southwestern part of the city, in the borough of Sainte-Foy, except for its school of architecture, which is at the \"Vieux-S\u00e9minaire\" building in Old Quebec.\nThe Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec system administrative headquarters and some of its specialized schools (\u00c9cole nationale d'administration publique, Institut national de la recherche scientifique and T\u00e9l\u00e9-universit\u00e9) are in the Saint-Roch neighbourhood.\nCEGEPs of Quebec city are Coll\u00e8ge Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier-Garneau, C\u00e9gep Limoilou, C\u00e9gep de Sainte-Foy and Champlain College St. Lawrence, as well as private and specialized post-secondary institutions such as Campus Notre-Dame-de-Foy, Coll\u00e8ge M\u00e9rici, Coll\u00e8ge Bart, Coll\u00e8ge CDI, Coll\u00e8ge O'Sullivan and Coll\u00e8ge Multihexa.\nThree school boards, including Commission scolaire de la Capitale, operate secular francophone schools, and Central Quebec School Board operates the few existing anglophone ones. Until 1998 Commission des \u00e9coles catholiques de Qu\u00e9bec operated public Catholic schools of all languages.\nQuebec City has the oldest educational institution for women in North America, led by the Ursulines of Quebec, which is now a private elementary school.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nTwo bridges (the Quebec Bridge and Pierre Laporte Bridge) and a ferry service connect the city with L\u00e9vis and its suburbs along the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River. The Orleans Island Bridge links Quebec City with pastoral Orleans Island.\n\nQuebec City is an important hub in the province's autoroute system, as well as boasting one of the highest \"expressway lane kilometres per 1000 persons\" in the country (1.10 km), behind Calgary (1.74), Hamilton (1.61) and Edmonton (1.24). Autoroute 40 connects the region with Montreal and Ottawa to the west and Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr\u00e9 and the Charlevoix region to the east. Autoroute 20 parallels the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, linking Quebec City with Montreal and Toronto to the west and Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, Rimouski, and the Maritime Provinces to the east. Autoroute 73 provides a north-south link through the metropolitan area, linking it with Saint-Georges, the Beauce region, and Maine to the south and Saguenay and the Lac-Saint-Jean region to the north.\nWithin the metropolitan region, Autoroutes 40, 73, and several spur routes link the city centre with its suburbs.\nAutoroute 573 (Autoroute Henri-IV) connects the city with CFB Valcartier. Autoroute 740 (Autoroute Robert-Bourassa) serves as a north-south inner belt. Autoroute 440 comprises two separate autoroutes to the west and east of the urban core. Originally meant to be connected by a tunnel under the city centre, the two sections are separated by a 6 km (3.7 mi) gap. There are no current plans to connect them. The western section (Autoroute Charest) connects Autoroutes 40 and 73 with Boulevard Charest (a main east-west avenue) while the eastern section (Autoroute Dufferin-Montmorency) links the city centre with Beauport and Montmorency Falls.\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nThe R\u00e9seau de transport de la Capitale (RTC) is responsible for public transport in the region. The RTC operates a fleet of buses and has recently implemented articulated buses. The RTC is studying the return of a tramway system to help ease overcrowding on its busiest lines as well as attract new users to public transit. The two billion dollar revitalization project needs approval from higher levels of government since the city does not have the financial resources to fund such an ambitious project on its own.\nRail transport is operated by Via Rail at the Gare du Palais ('Palace Station'). The station is the eastern terminus of the railway's main Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. An inter-city bus station, with connections to the provincial long-distance bus network, is adjacent to the train station, and hosts, among others, the services of Greyhound Canada and Orleans Express.\n\n\n==== Air and sea ====\nQuebec City is served by Jean Lesage International Airport (YQB), located at the city's western edge, 11 miles from the city centre.\nThe Port of Quebec is a major port on the St. Lawrence with facilities in the first, fifth and sixth boroughs.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Partner cities ==\nQuebec City is mainly twinned with :\n\n Bordeaux\n CalgaryIt has formal agreements with other cities although they are not active anymore as of 2012. These include Saint Petersburg, Guanajuato City, Hu\u1ebf and Li\u00e8ge and Namur in francophone Belgium.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of regional county municipalities and equivalent territories in Quebec\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nOfficial website of Qu\u00e9bec City Tourism\nFocus on Geography Series, 2016 Census \u2014 Census subdivision of Qu\u00e9bec City from Statistics Canada\nCBC Digital Archives \u2014 CBC Television Special: Preserving Quebec City (1976)\nCBC Digital Archives \u2014 Quebec City: 400 Years of History",

          "Went thinking it was going to an enjoyable experience. Left wanting to free all the animals and fish. The jelly fish are trapped in very small aquariums for their size. Beautiful to capture but sad to see them out of their proper habitat. The polar bears were showing signs of",
          "My husband and I went about 11am on a Saturday morning in the winter. There were quite a few families but still ample opportunity to see all the exhibits. Something to note if you go in the winter, you need to walk outdoors from the entrance to the buildings and there are some",

          "Nothing really spectacular here but if you're looking for a half day activity it will do. Beware that you weave in and out of buildings so on a cold or rainy day be prepared for that. Look for a discount coupon on the city's free tourist guide. Outside there are seals and",
          "A visit here is one that I am glad I did. With so much about the oceans and waterway we still don't understand this place makes that a great educational experience. Being from the Great Lakes region ( Lake Erie ) I never really thought much about the aquaculture that exists",
          "We all enjoyed the jellyfish the most. Lots to see inside and out. Worth a stop as it\u2019s close to many hotels.",
          "It was a cold day when we visited, but in spite of that we had a great time. Highlights for me were watching the seals and walrus swim, seeing the antics of the Arctic foxes and touching the coral in the \u201ctouch tanks\u201d. I am betting it would be even better in the warmer parts of",
          "A short ride from the city, this aquarium is pretty big, and is split among different buildings as well as a couple of outside showings. Regular shows are offered in each area. Various restaurant on site so you can easily spent at least a full day here.",
          "My partner and I spent the entire afternoon at the Aquarium. It was extremely interactive with touch tanks, and demonstrations. There are rays, an octopus, walruses, seals, and and underwater tube. Truly an unforgettable experience. Make sure to take time and enjoy the jellyfish",
          "Had a fun time at this aquarium seeing all the diversity in sea water and fresh water creatures. Excellent clean facility with washrooms, eatery and outdoor scenery. Got a glimpse of some live outdoors show which was fun despite the cold November weather.",
          "We had a great visit at this aquarium except that the polar bears weren't there. But the walruses were great and so was everything else.",
          "I visited the aquarium on a quiet, rainy weekday... and had a great time. I arrived at opening time and immediately went to see the scheduled programs featuring seals and arctic foxes. Both were fascinating, with the young staff members doing a good job (in both English and",
          "Great visit considering the time of the year we went. It will be really awesome once the polar bear exhibit opens!",
          "Visited this aquarium with family aged from 8 to 70 years and everyone agreed it was a great experience. Particular favourite was the Walrus in the outdoor pool, and the jellyfish exibition. The chance to put your fingers on the starfish and coral was good. Being able to put",
          "We enjoyed this aquarium\u2014nice modern habitats overall and kind staff. It\u2019s a smaller aquarium and the polar bear was closed for renovation, but still nice place to visit for a an hour or two. Pretty outside spaces for picnics too.",

          "Date of Visit: Saturday, June 22nd, 2019 This is a delightful aquarium. It is not huge, but it is very well done. The exhibits are fantastic. The grounds are nice, and well maintained. There is a lot for kids to see/do/learn. They have many species of fish, and marine life on",
          "I have visited here many times, but most recently in June 2019. We were very sad to miss the polar bears as their exhibit is being refinished. However, there was still lots of other things to see outside and inside. We were very impressed by the sand sculptures located around",
          "We had a good time at the aquarium. It had just enough things to do and see for the half day time. We recommend it to anyone.",
          "Visited the aquarium with my boys (14 & 10) and parents. Everyone enjoyed the visit. Took about 2-3 hours",
          "spent a good hour and a half visiting the grounds here. It still has a lot to offer. A little disappointed since the polar bear enclosure was closed for renovation but it was understandable. the grounds are unbelievably breathtaking and well taken care of. The aquarium still",
          "We were here 7/29/19, since our hotel was within walking distance, and were very disappointed. The main building was very hot, and overcrowded. People blocking the isles and displays with their strollers, while they hold their kid's. Almost all the tanks either needed to be",

          "We decided to go to the aquarium since our hotel was so close, and we\u2019re glad we did. Kids loved seeing the arctic foxes and touching the rays and starfish. It was a fun way to spend a drizzly morning, and the only disappointments were that the polar bear exhibit is closed (only",
          "I do agree with most reviews that this aquarium is okay comparing it to Ripley's or the aquarium in Boston. I did find the grounds and gardens quite beautiful but I find the actual aquarium a little ho hum. I do wish the marine animals had more space. The walrus did seem happy",
          "Our hotel was close by so we chose to visit, the first things you see are the jellyfish and honestly the exhibition is excellent and we spent quite some time there. The other floors are somewhat less interesting although the sea horses are well exposed. There are areas for",
          "Visited with my family of 4 - 3 adults and 2 teens. We have been spoiled by visits to aquariums in other trips. This one was just so-so. Lots of fish on display from the local waterways. Be prepared for a few outdoor exhibits as well. Pens for seals seemed small and kind of sad.",
          "This was our first time trip to Quebec city. The aquarium was so nice! Everyone was welcoming, and it was helpful that all of the staff was bilingual. The jellyfish exhibit was breathtaking and there is also a stingray touch tank that is fun for both kids and adults! Definitely",
          "I visited the aquarium today. I guess it's okay if you have little kids who are easily impressed, or if you haven't been to an aquarium before. If you've been to one of the world-class aquariums, such as Monterrey Bay, don't bother with this one. Quebec's version is",
          "After 30 years I returned tot he Aquarium. I was lucky, not too many people and a very nice day. A good place to bring kids 5 and up. Bring your lunch, food is expensive, I bought chip and drink, 8.50$ I went with the city bus, it would be nice if the Aquarium had a shuttle",
          "This is a really well-laid out aquarium. The staff were all very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. I especially loved the building with the jelly fish - it is beautiful and peaceful and the music is such a lovely addition to the experience. We spent a most enjoyable",
          "I always hesitate in writing these type of reviews for parks with animals as I don't want to discourage people from going as I wouldn't want the animals to suffer if numbers dropped and they couldn't stay open; however, we were not impressed with this spot for a number of",
          "I came here this morning with every intentions of seeing the polar bears, but they are gone for a few months due to renovations. I did still enjoy the visit. Lots if things to see and lots to learn. Tour guides were great and very knowledgable. I would highly recommend anyone",
          "We loved the arctic fox, Boris the walrus, the jeyyfish, and the seals. We missed seeing the polar bears.",
          "A brilliant idea to include a building with large tanks filled with various kinds of jellyfish! Extraordinary creatures, and exciting to watch them navigate inside their large brightly lit tanks. Hundreds and hundreds of them! The other building we could visit, to stay dry, was",
          "We had a nice time at the Aquarium de Qu\u00e9bec, but not more than that. After visiting Ripley\u2019s in Toronto, we had bigger expectations. We loved seeing the walrus and the grey seals, but unfortunately the polar bears were moved in another province due to renovation. We had done",
          "The light show in the evening over Christmas was good fun, as was the outside wildlife ! We fell in love with the pola bear playing with his snow shovel. The inside aquarium we found below average, but all in all wouldn't have missed it.",
          "Better experience than Toronto ( Ripley aquarium) as its not so crowded, has a nice indoor eating /picnic area, nice washrooms, and outdoor walking /exhibits. The ray touching and jellyfish tanks were favs with the 3 and 7 year olds. Sunday morning was a good time to visit.",
          "So, the thing is, I really want to give this place more stars. They try hard to make things that are generally not very flashy interesting. Let's face it, the Saint Lawrence river just doesn't contain very colorful residents. A lot of grays and browns. A large portion of the",
          "In the frequent trips we made to Quebec City, we have never had the opportunity to stop by here. Finally, we had a few hours to spare, so we decided to go. Very interesting displays, for both young and old. We were there on a school day, daytime, so not many young children, and",
          "Coming from Orlando, I have always felt bad for the polar bears and walruses. I know they are cared for, but their environment is totally man-made. I enjoyed seeing polar bears in the snow- enjoying the single digit temperatures. An amorous male walrus entertained my group but",
          "It\u2019s not a huge place, especially in winter but my family really enjoyed it. It was not crowded perhaps because it was a bit out of the way. We took a city bus to nearby and then walked almost 10 minutes down a highway (with no sidewalks!) to find it. Once there, it was well",
          "We were lucky because we went to the aquarium on a non-busy day. Only did indoor exhibitions because We had to travel back home and were limited in our time. It is a very nice place for little ones. My favorite exhibition was the astonishing jellyfishes! The person working at",
          "Unfortunately the day we went it was raining off and on. Our grandchildren REALLY liked the the live walrus show. The kinds of local fish were interesting, the tunnel walk under one of the tanks was very pleasant and most people seemed amazed. In another building the jellyfish",
          "Smaller than some other aquariums but still a lot of fun. Many of them are located outdoors so if it\u2019s a cold snowy day you\u2019ll need to dress warmly.",
          "Very nice place to visit to learn about local and foreign fish species. Employees are polite and helpful. Animals are well treated and I have seen improments over the years. Lovely family outing.",
          "It was a very nice visit. The Quebec City Aquarium is not just for aquatic animals. It has several buildings and displays on the property. 60% of the aquarium is indoors and 40% is outdoors. Due to a local zoo closing, it aquired some animals that are in some outdoor displays.",
          "We visited this aquarium to get out of the snow, and we came to realize that half of it is outside. We only visited the inside parts, which were nice.",
          "The Aquarium du Quebec is a hidden gem and well worth a visit when seeing the sites of this delightful city. The new Jellyfish Exibit defies description!",
          "WHEN: Weekday afternoon in October. Cloudy autumn day. Spent two hours there, needed four. WHO: Mum, Grandmom, 11yo and 8yo kids. Kids speak only English- bilingual adults. HIGHLIGHTS: Jellyfish room, touching anemone, the tunnel. I\u2019ve never seen so many jellyfish in an",
          "Very nice place to visit with kids. The tickets don\u2019t cost a fortune and the place is lovely. It is not huge but maintained well. My kids liked the aquarium very much. It had also a show of a cat fish , so I highly recommend to check the show times once you arrive.",
          "Situation next the the bridges Pont Champlain and Pont de Quebec, a 15min car ride from downtown Quebec city. Excellent place for families, although the price of entry can be slightly high for some families.",
          "As an American family of 5 (and multi-generational), we wanted to treat the 2 young children (aged almost 6 and 4) to an outdoor park. However, once in the park, and having found an outside scheduled demonstration of walruses, we soon discovered that the introduction - both in",
          "Being from Naples Florida, I see lots of fish is daily. Do you want to fish looked healthy, I loved the jellyfish display. Beautiful and again looking healthy. As far as the outside with the polar bears. And yes to me they looked sad but I believe they would look the same out in",
          "Horrible experience in complitely empty site. Staff was unreal. The worst area was of the mammal, where were present depresse seal and walrus without any toy or object for their entertainment. Two poor white bears \ud83d\ude2a. The actraction for visitors was to see staff throw fish from",
          "The aquarium was good to visit, but, they do not recognize anyone who does not speak french. We watched the demonstration with the seals, the presentation was all in french, except for a couple of sentences which were in English. We could see what the seals were doing but",
          "This is a fairly small aquarium so on crowded days it can be hard to get around. There is a bit of walking outside which really isn\u2019t that bad. They have a very nice jellyfish collection with LED light which makes it pretty awesome. The polar bears and seals are outdoors and",
          "Aquarium is just ok. The best part about this place is the jellyfish exhibit. We did the entire aquarium in about an hour. There were no shows or feedings going on when we visited. Some areas were packed with people and you have to love the guests that go the wrong way through",
          "We visited the aquarium in the morning. Since we did not rent a car, we hopped on the #25 city transit bus from the hotel de Ville stop to des Hotels and back to d\u2019Youville place after our visit. Easy and inexpensive. A short walk to the aquarium. The exhibits are typical of",
          "This is a very uncomfortable aquarium. If you go in the summer be prepared to be hot. Quite a bit of it is outdoors and even most of the indoor stuff is very hot and stuffy. A lot of the inside windows we couldn't really see through very well to see the fish. And the polar",
          "Good for families and kids, it is a bit too crowdy but amazing at the same time. You can get discounts based on age. The polar bear is treated a bit like a circus animale and i think it is not a good image they give about the acquarium.",
          "An interesting exhibit, though not as comprehensive as Ripley's in Toronto or Vancouver. There is a mix of indoor and outdoor exhibits, including arctic foxes, polar bears, walruses and seals. Indoors - all sorts of marine life, including deep water exhibits with cool lighting.",
          "The jelly fish section was very well presented. Seeing and being able to touch the sting rays was a thrill and so enjoyable for the whole family. I did find that the food court section should be a separate building or area as it made for a very loud and congested time and",
          "The aquarium had walruses, arctic foxes, seals and a polar bear in outside exhibits. The walruses and seals performed. The indoor tanks included an extensive jellyfish collection, sea horses and assorted fish, anemones and star fish. There was free parking and they offered",
          "In addition to being an excellent aquarium, complete with rare animals like polar bears, walruses, and arctic foxes, the aquarium also has a wonderful outdoor play area for children and some really impressive sand castles/structures in the shape of an octopus, mermaid, walrus,",
          "We had a few hours left in Quebec City so decided to take the kids to the Aquarium. We had been to the one in Toronto so we were not sure how this one would compare. We were pleasantly surprised! There were lots of interesting fish from all different parts of the world. They",
          "The aquarium is a little bit out-of-the-way from Quebec City, but if you are in the area and looking for something to do for 1-3 hours, the aquarium is a great stop! You will see many kinds of fresh and saltwater fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals such as polar bears and",
          "Never know what to expect when you visit places like this. Maybe the wrong time of year. Arctic Fox and Polar bear in 30 degree weather... We did not stay for the shows. $60 for a family of 3. Was ok to see but. Ould have bypassed this one.",
          "Although we are retired and traveling just the two of us, it was clear that the families with kids were enjoying themselves a lot. It\u2019s not a huge place, but lots of interesting exhibits.",
          "We were staying at a hotel right up the street from the aquarium so we decided to go check it out. We walked it all the way around. The splash pad seemed lovely for young children. But As you walk around it was just very drab and cheaply decorated. You go inside and it\u2019s really",
          "The exhibit that impressed me the most was the jelly fish exhibit. I have been to a number of aquariums and had not seen this kind of exhibit. In addition, the seals and walruses were great fun to watch. The grounds were well kept and interesting. The flowers and the Chinese",
          "We had an excellent time at the zoo. Most employees spoke English which was wonderful and truly appreciated. The zoo map was in English also. They has a great display of fish",
          "It was a beautiful aquarium. Indoor and outdoor. It is also open all year round so you can enjoy it anytime you go. Kids loved it and we as adults also enjoyed it.",
          "We really enjoyed ourselves. The walrus show was really funny and we loved the jelly fish displays. The ability to touch the rays and other aquatic stuff was great. We would definitely go there again.",
          "This was more expensive than we had anticipated, and we were a little let down. It's SO crowded inside the pavilions that you really can't stop to enjoy anything. There are plenty of young arms and legs climbing on things and getting in the way, too, making it hard for adults",
          "We never thought that we would spend the whole day, but wow, was there ever a lot to see! The huge jellyfish exhibit was outstanding. I loved being allowed to touch the sea life. The underwater tunnel; the seals, walrus and polar bears...it was an amazing day. We will surely be",
          "The underwater tunnel was short but amazing! There are inside and outdoor activities here. It was worth the ticketed price. You can bring your own food and have a picnic outside too. Plan on an hour or two unless you have small kids it may be a half day excursion!",
          "We enjoyed the exhibits inside as well as watching the walrus, polar bear and seal shows. Unfortunately for us, the presentations were in French so we couldn't understand a lot of what was being said about the animals. I am always mixed about wild animals in captivity and",
          "I\u2019ve never seen such a large exhibit of jellyfish! It was really fun to watch them swim around. We also really enjoyed watching the seals and walrus swim around! Wear a hat and sunscreen when you go!",
          "The place is recommended for families with kids. There are a lot of animals displayed outside as well, so remember sunscreen and hats for sunny day. We visited a scheduled program, but it was presented only in French. It also was a very hot sunny day, and the seat were not in",
          "We visited with our pre teens as part of a Quebec City vacation. The facility has a good layout with displays amongst several buildings and outside. The fish and walk through tunnel were great. I felt bad for the polar bear and arctic foxes sweltering outside in 33 degrees, I\u2019m",
          "It was hot July day. My son enjoyed many exhibits, jelly fish, Sea Horse, walruses show and hurricane simulator booth. He spend great time touching the Ray fishes with that noisy Parrot. Many food choices. Reasonable children play area.",
          "We stopped here on a recent trip through Quebec and we were glad we stopped. The jelly fish exhibit was incredible and the Ray touch tank was soooo much fun for our little girl. It poured off and on while we were there, but we still got to see most of the animals. My only",
          "This was not a WOW moment. Its summer and we get it. Kids are out of school, but the place was overrun by young summer campers when we visited. It was absolute chaos. The displays are not very good and the wildlife do not seem to be well cared for. This was a huge",
          "Average aquarium. Not the greatest food choices, but don't miss the jelly fish. The jelly fish are the best attraction, worth the price of admission alone.",
          "The Quebec Aquarium is a beautiful, multi-building exhibit that houses some of the most beautiful and bizarre fish specimens you can imagine. The jellyfish exhibit can't be missed, not can the ray tank, where you can actually touch these timid, friendly creatures. At certain",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Aquarium! It only takes about 2 hours at most but for the duration of the visit, it is packed with oceanic wonders! Well worth the price for a family visit! Great way to spend the morning/ afternoon. Particularly loved the jellyfish and",
          "My two friends and I had a wonderful time at the aquarium. The grounds were very well kept and they had some beautiful sand sculptures. There was a wide variety of animals all in clean, large enclosures. Part of the aquarium is located outside and part is inside. I saw many",
          "This was one of the best aquarium we visited in our life. The seals, the walruses, were full of life and in good health. We can see an amazing array of tropical fish and even watch them in a glass tunnel under the water. For my grand daughter, the highlight was the petting of",
          "This was a nice aquarium with and adequate number of attractions. The jellyfish exhibit was very good and we enjoyed the walrus as well!",
          "Awesome plaee to take the kids for a day trip. Lot of thigs to see and touch. it was a great touch to have the water sprinkles out while it was really hot hot outside",
          "You don't need more than about an hour or two to see everything. Do feed the animals in the touch tank! You need a big zoom lens to see the polar bears well. Small gift shop. A few stands for ice cream and water and one place to get some basic food. Lots of jellyfish in tanks",
          "A nice aquarium, but nothing amazing. Kind of run down looking in some spots. Can be done within two hours. Nice touch tank with manta rays and other little creatures. The walruses blowing bubbles against their glass tank were the best part. The poor polar bear looks like",
          "Out of all the aquariums I have been too, this one was absolutely on the lower end. The facility needs some work. That being said, I did enjoy my visit. The Arctic foxes and walruses were my favourite parts. The polar bear looked depressed and stressed. They should really",
          "average at best.....looks like they need some funding. its small and the only highlight was watching the male walrus yell back and forth to the females. if you just cant find something else to do.....then hit the city again and drink a beer.",
          "Fantastic place to bring our teen bunch. The manta ray pool was super interesting due to the ability to touch them as they swam by. The grounds were nicely kept and most importantly, the animals looked to live in really good conditions. The polar bear liked to swim past the",
          "On a rainy day, we visited the aquarium & saw wonderful exhibits of jelly fish & seahorses, among the usual things. They also have outdoor exhibits of polar bears, seals & walruses.",
          "Unexpected gem. Rainy day, so took a taxi from old Quebec City. What a jewel box. More of a zoo plus aquarium. Fresh and saltwater fish, walruses, polar bears, owls (yes, owls)... But the jellyfish... WOW!!! And felt like a kid being able to \u201cpet\u201d the anemones and the",
          "Don't miss this visit. Although this is not a huge attraction, it has some very interesting points: Polar bears and walrus behind glass pools. They are extremely cute and interact a lot with the audience, especially around feeding hours. A pond for interacting (touching)",
          "We almost didn\u2019t go as we had read some bad reviews, so glad we did. It is not big but we spent over 4 hours there. There is a lot of information if you take time to read about the animals.",
          "Finding 3 to 4 hours off dont hesitate to visit this beautiful natural park with small waterfalls spactaular views and you can see some varients of water living creatures in a very friendly atmosphere also a very proper place for children to have some fun and scientific advanture",
          "we had an awesome time during the May 24th weekend. Every exhibit was awesome and the staff in the gift shop was superb!!",
          "Love this cute aquarium! It is easily seen in 3 hours and has plenty of different animals! I would return! They also do shows for feeding the animals as well.",
          "Small but very well done. Perhaps the best collection of seahorses we have seen! The jellyfish were also outstanding. However, the show steelier, for us, were the mammals! As we walked up to one of the seal exhibits among some kids, the resting seals seemed to say 'it's show",
          "For being a smaller aquarium it did have a good diversity of animals. However being smaller some of the larger animals did not have much space and looked miserable. It was relatively clean in general. It did have decent ticket prices. It is good for kids at least.",
          "We had a few hours to kill before checking-in to our hotel and decided to spend it at the aquarium; it was well worth it. Although I do not believe in keeping large-ranging animals in captivity (Polar bear, walruses and seals) The aquarium itself was very well maintained and",
          "Pretty neat little aquarium, and decent prices. We went with two 17 month old girls, a 13 year old and 8 year old. All the kids seemed to enjoy different aspects of it. The polar bear exhibit was a little sad as the big one paced back and forth like he was in prison, and the",
          "The aquarium next to the Quebec bridge is a nice treat for spending a whole day, and the kids loved it, especially to pat the stingrays. A great variety of ecosystems with fish and other sea creatures from small sea horses to large seals and walruses. The aquarium is well",
          "Although we arrived late in the afternoon, we still enjoyed our time at the aquarium. Our favorite was the sting rays and the jelly fish exhibits. Even in winter, the seals and walruses were active and entertaining.",
          "This was not a very big aquarium however still had enough to see and do! Our highlights were seeing so many different species of Jellyfish and seeing the walrus and polar bears enjoy themselves in the snow. We even spotted Nemo and Dory! \ud83d\ude09 We didn\u2019t view any outdoor shows",
          "We had planned on visiting but the website had no animal feeding listed and when I called the attendant stated that they didn't have the information. I asked if I called the morning of the visit if they would be able to tell me and they said no, the office would not have that",
          "We took the kids to the aquarium on a recent family trip. We loved it as much as the kids did. The highlight was touching the sting rays. My son is still talking about it!",
          "There is a lot to do and the kids love the walruses who'll high five them through the glass. Worth the price of admission. Plus lunch in the food court was very good and reasonably priced.",
          "Not a horrible aquarium! I love aquariums so I always make it a point to visit one whenever I'm on vacation. I do agree that the flow of the aquarium was a little strange but nevertheless they had pretty good exhibits. The polar bears were giving one heck of a show, the",
          "Disappointed with the visit to the Ice Carnaval \"festivities\" in Old Quebec, we drove to the Aquarium. Pros: the manta ray (sting ray) pool. Looking at them circling the pool and being able to actually caress them as they swam by with some of them actually stopping to \"look\" at",
          "I can't put my finger on why I didn't enjoy this Aquarium more. Normally I love aquariums, and I never miss one. Maybe because it was a hot day, and it was crowded (which wasn't the Aquarium's fault, I know) but I did not find it engaging. Now sure, a number of the individual",
          "We visited the Aquarium du Quebec as part of our family Christmas vacation. It was absolutely wonderful!!! This place is definitely worth it, there are several themed areas to visit (deep sea, polar bears, walruses, seals, saltwater, fresh water, reptiles, stingrays (you can",
          "We were visiting when the outdoor light show was on and it was definitely a highlight. Our trip was a Christmas present to our mom, and it was definitely what she enjoyed most!",
          "Small but very nice. It only takes a few hours to go through. The walrus and polar bears stole the show. It\u2019s very small but worth a visit if you have young kids.",
          "What a majestic place! As we fought the -34 cold weather the employees did so, as well with cheerfulness and a big smile! The outdoor exhibit entertained us for at least 1.5 hours! There were plenty of places to warm up along the way. There are huts in which to purchase hot and",
          "With the below zero temperatures, we wanted to go someplace warm. Actually, about 35% of the exhibits were outdoors, but it made us feel better to see the polar bears, walrus and arctic foxes frolicking in the snow and cold. Some of the signs in the \"old\" building were dated,",
          "With two buildings and outdoor displays, there is a lot to see at this aquarium! We loved seeing the Arctic animals outside\u2014that is something special we have not seen at more southerly aquariums. The jellyfish and seahorse exhibits were very creatively done. Very congenial and",
          "This nice aquarium also has Arctic wildlife. The exhibits are clean and the animals look to be very well treated. The fish are plentiful and a joy to watch. There are also petting tanks. The Hyacinth Macaw looked to be a little jealous that everyone was petting the rays instead",
          "A funny and educational place were u can enjoy and explore the deep and far water and places and learn plenty of things, well maintained and organized",
          "Fun little aquarium, with different areas to discover different species. Felt some of the areas a little tight for the animals. Enjoyed the shows, touching the stingrays, seeing the jellyfish babies.",
          "I personally love aquariums and this one is more than an aquarium. It also has sea lions, white foxes, walruses, polar bears, and more. Take a trip out there!",
          "I came in with low expectations, but left feeling childishly happy and giddy... -The main multi-level building was larger than expected and good variety of aquatic species, including native species I'd never seen. -I've seen a lot of jellyfish exhibits around the world, but",
          "Enjoyed the jellyfish and seahorses in particular in the indoor exhibits. Touching the stingrays was a unique experience and we got to see them being fed. It was a very cold day so we didn't linger too long at the outdoor exhibits, but did enjoy the arctic foxes, huge walruses",
          "Had a nice 2 hour journey of the aquarium. Large outdoor areas with polar bears, walruses, seals, owls and a family of arctic foxes. Jellyfish & seahorses are well kept & good varieties. Touch pools for kids are available with stingrays, sea urchins, sea cucumber etc.",
          "It is a small place,but neat, not for adults on their own. The company that buses people there picks up at the Frontenac,but should shorten the time allowed.",
          "Although it isn't huge, the aquarium had a lot of unique things to see. We especially enjoyed watching the walruses being fed, the jelly fish room, and the sting rays which we were allowed to pet as they drifted by. It has a wonderful playground for kids, and the property is",
          "I'm from Montreal and I heard about that aquarium and as soon as I saw pictures of that hallway with water and fish all around I knew I had to give it a visit. It's a small aquariums with different little buildings with themes. It's quite nice and has a quiet place. If you plan",
          "The aquarium is small compared to most we have visited, and perhaps it was the time of year we went (late September), but there was construction everywhere, the glass was dirty and foggy in a lot of enclosures, and some of the displays (the exotic fish) weren't even open to the",
          "We went without the kids and it was a nice visit. We spent the morning at the aquarium and had plenty of time to visit the exhibits and see the animals. The polar bears are gorgeous and the seal show is fun to watch. We really enjoyed the deep water jelly fish exhibit. Our",
          "The aquarium is large, but not too large in size. Definitely expect to spend a few hours there. My boyfriend and I enjoyed ourselves, walking around looking at all the exhibits and the interactive components were really cool. You can pet sting rays and touch starfish which was",
          "This aquarium has a two indoor pavilions and several outdoor enclosures with large mammals like walruses. There are also arctic foxes and birds of prey. Inside the pavilions are species of Quebec and tropical ones. Only complaint would be the exhibits could use updating and some",
          "The whole family had fun in general. Beautiful aquariums with a lot of different species. At set times you can watch certain shows outside. The only downside for me was the loss of power (all day) they had the day we visited, only the generators were working. The corridors were",
          "Obviously lots of fish to see, but really enjoyed the polar bears, walrus, and seals. Nice indoor and outdoor viewing areas and some outdoor shows.",
          "This little out of the way aquarium is a nice place to visit during your stay in Quebec City. There is a daily shuttle bus from the city, but you cannot chose your time to arrive or depart. I ventured there on the city bus, which was a shorter ride than I was told, even with",
          "And our family \u2013 \u2013 two teens and two grannies spent a few hours at the aquarium. We mostly enjoyed the jellyfish and the amazing seahorses , But the kids also liked touching the stingrays and other sea life. A beautiful layout on a beautiful day, we were also enchanted by the",
          "It's a great place for a family visit. Great play park for the kids. Great showcase of different fish, reptiles and marine mammals. They must be lonely cause there is only one of each in some areas.",
          "Despite the hordes of toddlers and babies in strollers we had a fantastic time at the aquarium. Our favourite place hands down was the jellyfish tank room. It was seriously psychedelic! Our next favourite was the touch tank with the rays and skates. One of them was as friendly",
          "We loved our visit at the Quebec aquarium. Beautiful, well kept displays, a nice play area for the kids that entertained not only our 9 year old, but 12 & 13 year old as well. Lots of place/picnic tables for you to bring and enjoy your own lunch.",
          "Although presenting interesting species of fish, reptiles and marine mammals, the $50 dollars plus family admission is way too expensive for what this activity as to offer...",
          "We spent two hours and a half here and saw mostly everything in that time frame. We used our CAA card and received discounted tickets. We particularly enjoyed the seals, the walruses and the polar bears, though we look forward to seeing some in their natural environment in the",
          "We enjoyed our trip to the Aquarium. The exhibits were both indoors and outdoors and our favorites were the Polar Bears (under water viewing area) and walrus. The glassed in aquarium that you can walk through that is pictured was nice, but short and was very crowded when we",
          "Very small aquarium. We went as it was on our way into town after a long drive. Nice to stretch our legs, but not worth the money per se. Playground and splash area were nice, but highway noise ruined that for me (right beside a major road). Exhibits were small and crowded.",
          "Highlight included feeding the sting ray for $2 (touch for free), touch tank for sea creatures, aquarium tunnel (very small), jelly fish, polar bear, walrus... There are activity sheet for kids at the salt water museum. There is an obstacle course for young kids (tree to tree)",
          "Visited with my 3 teenagers (19,17, and 15) and had a great time! We arrived too late in the day to catch all the shows but we did see the Polar bears. They were very entertaining. We don't speak any french but the trainers presented the show in english as well as french which",
          "Our family visited the Quebec Area for a quick 4 days trip. The aquarium was at the top of our list! We all really enjoy the visit, was really looking forward to the outdoor shows but it rained way to much! Facility is very clean, easy to navigate, friendly staff. The sand",
          "I arrived at the aquarium very excited, as I love visiting zoos and aquariums. Sadly, I was quite disappointed by the time I left. The entire facility was poorly organized. With more than one building. In the main building it was organized so that you had to go up and",
          "On vacation in Quebec with our 4 children (ages 10, 7, 4 & 2) we planned a day to visit the aquarium. It was a beautiful, albeit hot, July day. There are a few buildings with cool exhibits and hands-on touch tanks, but the outdoors were the highlight for us. I highly recommend",
          "An amzing lace to visit, whether you are young or old. Everyone will enjoy meeting new friends and bonding with them.",
          "Our city tour tickets included this orange line ride and it did not disappoint.The kids really liked the petting of the rays, which seem gregarious and willing. The sea anenomes were the hugest and best habituated I have ever see and I felt their longevity must indicate",
          "We went to the aquarium as a rainy day activity on vacation. When we arrived, it was pouring rain. We sprinted to get under the awnings at the ticket count. A staff member told us were were supposed to go back and walk through the serpentine pathway to the ticket counter even",
          "If you've got small kids then this is a good place to break up the adult site seeing with a kids activity. It's not a large place and you'll probably only spend a couple hours there but the polar bears are worth the visit. They were constantly playing in the water while we",
          "This was our first aquarium, 20$adult ticket, started with jelly fish/2 owls/walrus-seal-polar bears, fish, accidentally came right when seals show was about to start (2 shows daily 11:30,15:45). Everything was in Frech but seals were interesting to watch. That was it, there is",
          "We were there in July, my wife and 2 kids (teens) and we all liked a lot the place! The polar bear Taiga was a key attraction and she is really cute! Besides, the aquarium has a large assortment of fishes, including seals and other animals. A must-see attraction!",
          "We spent a Sunday morning here and we loved it. The kids were greeted by pirates in the parking lot, who gave them little temporary tattoos and joked with them. We. Spent our morning wandering thru the different exhibits. The kids loved the hands-on areas where they could pet",
          "Our family of four had such a great time at the aquarium! The highlights/favorites were the sting Ray touch tank, the outdoor exhibits, the outdoor wooden adventure course and the friendly staff! You are outdoors more than we thought for an aquarium so remember sunscreen and",
          "It's not a big aquarium, but it does offer great fun, a lot of external activities and demonstrations (by far the best part) Loved the deep ocean animals too, and kids can feed stingrays (they love it)",
          "We usually avoid places with animals, but the kids were very keen to see it, so we went. It was surprisingly good, we all had fun. I still think it's not a very good idea to keep mammals in tanks, but they looked well-cared for. The kids absolutely loved the afternoon. We just",
          "I decided on a whim to go to the aquarium (I had heard it was a fun place to go). First, I was quite surprised with the low prices, since things in Canada tend to always cost a small fortune. When we went, it was only 40$ for the family! We spent about 3 1/2 hours there. We",
          "went with my friend who is staying in chcuitmie and had a great day she made me walk to far but had a great day loved the aquarium",
          "We were two families with kids that visited the aquarium today. Our kids are aged 10,11,12 and 15 while the kids in our relative's family are smaller kids aged 4 and 1 and a half. The aquarium was a lovely experience for us all, we all enjoyed ourselves from the oldest to the",
          "The kids loved the experience and seeing the polar bears, seals and many other sea creatures. The adventure explains the St Lawrence Seaway very well. The staff speak mainly french and really are interactive. Some english is spoken by certain staff. I loved seeing the different",
          "So much to see!! What a beautiful place. The staff, from the ticket booth to the zoo keepers and workers...everyone is so friendly and knowledgeable. The grounds are really well taken care of and even on a busy day it didn't feel overcrowded. So much to see and do. If you",
          "Unlike Ripley's Aquarium, Aquarium du Qu\u00e9bec actually has outdoor sections to it with Polar bears, owls, seals... and with live performances! It's really amusing and there's so many things to see while you're there. There's a Beavertails shop and lots of restaurants. Definitely",
          "We decided to check out the aquarium because it was raining. It wasn't as big as I thought it was. There was MANY children camps there which was very very loud. But all in all, not bad. I would have liked to see more animals.",
          "We did not feel like going into Old Quebec so we decided to stop at this aquarium and we were not disappointed. They had a variety of marine life. It was so interesting to look at the fish and marine animals. The coolest animals they had were the seals, walruses and polar bears.",
          "Part zoo, part aquarium, and part botanical gardens. It is reasonably priced, beautiful, and a great way to spend a coiple hours. Lots of jellyfish that are bioluminescent, seahorses and dragons, polar beaes,arctic fox, seals,walruses, and gorgeous flowers!",
          "The Quebec Aquarium is a nicely presented collection of marine life that inhabits the various waters of the province of Quebec. From sea urchins to Polar Bears it's all there. There are walk-through exhibits and outdoor presentations by walruses, harbor seals and more.",
          "Maybe I'm just being to picky because I have been to lots of diferent aquariums around the world and that one certainly didnt leave up to my expectations. It's really small and it doesnt have that much variety of animals. The place itself is really nice to walk around but you",
          "It was bigger than we were expecting. The highlight was the jelly fish room, which was dark with neon lighting in the different tanks with the different jelly fish species. There are short outdoor shows with the seals, arctic foxes, walruses which and fun and really cool. There",
          "The aquarium is a nice mix of outdoor and indoor exhibits (so bring some sun screen on the funny days as the live demonstrations can get very sunny). This aquarium had a nice mix of different aquatic creatures and even some mammals that live close to water, like polar bears and",
          "A two-hour morning visit was very enjoyable. There were a couple of any walruses and a seal show as well. A 20-minute Uber ride from Old Quebec.",
          "I cannot believe people did not rate this aquarium 5 stars!!! Given that I have a 4 year old and 2 year old who LOVE fish and wildlife I have been to a lot of aquariums. I have been to the Shedd Aquarium and just prior to Aquarium du Quebec we visited Ripley's Aquarium in",
          "Firstly, getting to and from the aquarium if you do not have a car is difficult. There is no city bus that goes to the property, Uber will cost you about $25 from Old Quebec and the tourism kiosk only has one bus in and out a day leaving you there for 5 hours. We were done in 2",
          "The aquarium is really small but I try to do something with my little one, and surprisingly have a great time myself. You can up close to see the polar bear and is amazing to see them swimming. Most the aquarium in the state lock the animal up and they don't look very happy. But",
          "I didn't expect this to be so informative and interesting. Wear comfortable foot ware, allow at least two hours, you can refill your water bottles with filtered water, there is a great picnic area,and food available if you don't wan to pack a lunch, and the exhibits are amazing.",
          "We brought our little one year old grand daughter and she loved all the fish, lights, walk ways and especially the interactive \"touch\" display. We touched the sea cucumbers, anemones and even petted the sting rays! SO FUN! Loved watching the polar bears and seals outside,",
          "I went to the aquarium with my mother and my two sons who are 1.5 and 4 years old. It was a magical day. We saw the walruses and the polar bears first thing in the morning. The polar bear was absolutely stunning. Then we visited the jellyfish exhibition and it was mesmerizing.",
          "Pleasantly surprised by the display and interactivity of the aquarium. The jellyfish sting rays polar bears and walruses were amazing! If we lived closer I would buy the yearly pass.",
          "Spent two hours meandering through the Aquarium with our 2kids (ages 6 and 14). Nice combination of outdoor and indoor displays. Consider buying tickets online to avoid the long entrance line. Highlights are the amazing jellyfish displays, the touch pools with rays and the sea",
          "Great place for everyone. Shows and lots to see. You can have lunch there as well. So much to do. We loved it.",
          "We had not planned on going here during our trip to Quebec City. However our schedule opened up and I am really glad it did. The price was not bad at all. $57 for a family pass (two adults, plus kids). Free parking. So it did not soak your wallet unlike some attractions out",
          "Really enjoyed seeing the two polar bears and the walrus. Most of it is outdoors so check the weather and dress accordingly.",
          "On our trip to Qu\u00e9bec City we took a trip to the aquarium. Teenage nieces and in-laws alike had fun. It was larger than expected and a larger collection of animals than anticipated. At one point we were rushed out of one of the buildings to catch the seal show. One of the",
          "We were not sure what to expect but...our family loved the Aquarium. We spent about 2.5 hours which was the right amount of time. We watched the polar bear \"show\" which was \"fantastique\" - even for our teenagers. The aquarium was not busy as we went during the week so there",
          "Came here with my husband, sister and nieces. Beautiful aquarium. While I really liked the polar bear display, one of the bears seemed a bit irritated and just walked back and forth in the enclosure. This was a bit upsetting and one of my nieces had to leave the display in",
          "It's not huge and visiting everything takes about 1.5 - 2 hours. We loved the experience and the kids were elated. As in every tourist place, the food was extremely expensive.",
          "Visited during March break and the weather was great for enjoying the outdoor exhibits. The kids were enthralled with the polar bears and arctic foxes, as well as the tropical fish. Loved the tunnel through the tank! Kids chickened out on the stingray touch tanks, but did some",
          "normally I don't like to visit animal prisons like this but this one was ok. I feel bad for the larger animals but the place seems to be well run and it was fun for the kids",
          "I highly recommend seeing this place if you enjoy animals. This was the first time I ever saw polar bears and it was such a great experience. They have a variety of animals and microbiology to see outdoor and indoor. We went when it was very cold (temps in 0-5 degrees) If you",
          "There is a lot of walking to get around both the extensive indoor and outdoor exhibits, but it's well worth the exertion. The aquariums are pretty typical, but the outdoor exhibits of animals are terrific. I loved watching the polar bears, and I spent the most amount of time",
          "This was a first for my daughter and she keeps asking to go back every year. It's interesting and good clean fun!",
          "The Aquarium du Quebec is a wonderful place to explore. We went with our two children and they loved it - in fact, the exhibits spawned conversation in the vehicle for the first hour of our drive after we departed, which is quite a feat given that the competition was an ipad",
          "My husband and I enjoyed our visit to the aquarium, especially the outdoor exhibits for the polar bears, the walruses and seals, and the arctic foxes. The indoor aquarium was nice, and we really thought the jellyfish/seahorse exhibits were very cool to see. Not bad for the",
          "Fun to see the baby walruses with Mom and Dad. Jellyfish display beautiful. Interesting \"touching\" stations.",
          "Despite being quite a distance form Old Quebec City ( 20 min. cab ride) the Aquarium du Quebec was worth the travel. Best to go during the week as it can get quite full of little ones. Best exhibit was the Polar Bears - stick around after the brief show and watch them under",
          "It is definitely over priced compared to its quality. Especially in winter, it was limited access especially with strollers.",
          "My first visit to an aquarium, this was so much fun. The aquarium has outdoor and indoor viewing, along with a cool tunnel, touch tanks, as an adult I really enjoyed it.",
          "Nice outing, we went last year january, definitely a must see, would recommend. Recommended for all ages",
          "Yes, even in February! The polar bears, walruses, and other arctic creatures were right at home outdoors in the cold. The indoor aquarium features many types of sea creatures and a touch tank. We ate lunch here too, it was surprisingly good, and not pricey. Fun for all!",
          "You must go here. Its a good aquarium. If you have kids they will love it. My favorite thing to do there is touch the stingrays and the small sharks.",
          "It was a great way to spend a few hours upon arrival. The kids loved touching the Rays, going down the slide outside (should have brought our snowpants for that), and standing watching the walrus swim by. Try to catch the shows- worth it and brief enough to keep the attention",
          "While a large portion of the aquarium is outdoors, even in winter it was fun to see the animals, especially because many are colder climate animals that thrive in the snow. The jellyfish exhibit was beautiful and very well presented. When you get too cold outside there are two",
          "The trip to the Aquarium was very entertaining. We went with our 2 sons, ages 2 & 4 and they had a blast. We saw bio-luminescent jellyfish, touched sting rays, sea urchins and starfish. Watched seals, walruses, polar bears and polar foxes, among many others. We spent over 3",
          "So it was very cold today and many of the attractions, including the shows are outside. Don't get me wrong, we knew this going in but it was pretty cold. It's definitely small, the money for entrance goes to a good cause, animal upkeep. The arctic foxes, polar bears and the owl",
          "Very different aquarium experience than in the states. A lot of the exhibits were outdoors with two major indoor buildings. Love the polar bears!",
          "There are a lot of outdoor areas and even though the weather didn't cooperate it was still fun. The animals were all very active in the cold rainy weather. The walrus just had 2 pups so that was fantastic. The inside parts were great for when it was pouring. Looks like it would",
          "A lot of activities every season... during winter, at Christmas, a lot of lightning, during fall activities for Halloween... during summer... water play.... it is a nice place with the family,,children loves this place!",
          "My boy friend really enjoyed the seal show, my favourite was the Polar Bear exhibit. Lots of marine life to see",
          "We have a subscription and are frequent visitors to the aquarium. There is a large play area outside for kids of different ages in summer. The different buildings have great aquariums with lots of variety. There are great shows as well.",
          "This is a fairly small aquarium and but has some interesting exhibits and a nice show with seals put on by the trainers. It also has a beautiful Jellies exhibit. Nice break for the kids if you need one.",
          "Visited the aquarium on a wet day recently where we had about 4 hours to kill. The aquarium was strangely deserted as the school semester had just begun. We had lots of time to wander through each of the exhibits. The polar bears were quite active and a delight to watch. We were",
          "This is a nice lace to visit. I wish they had some shows happening. It was a Saturday but all they had was feedings of the seals, polar bears and walruses to see. No the less we did stop to see a feeding and that was very entertaining. The jellyfish building is amazing. The",
          "This is only the 2nd aquarium that I've visited and it wasn't too bad. We got there an hour after opening and there wasn't a lot people which was nice because we could take our time observing and learning about each animal/fish. My favourite part was seeing the jellyfish,",
          "We are 28 & 32 traveling from Vermont The Aquarium was good. It seemed a little run down and needs some updating. The polar bears, walruses and seals were fun to see. The jelly fish exhibit and the touch tank of sting rays were very cool. Would be a good place to take your",
          "The aquarium is very clean and beautiful, but for the size and number of expositions it is quite expensive. But if you like marine life you should consider visiting.",
          "a lot of fish but not only fich...jellyfish very nice, you can visit Inside and outside. For the children a lot of interesting think. I like this kind of attraction",
          "Not only are two polar bears crammed into a tiny enclosure but the organisers have taken the opportunity to provide a polar bear show, where the bear must stand for it's food or jump in the water. The miserable polar bear watched as it's food went in the water unwilling to jump",
          "This place is rather small, only has 2 buildings with indoor exhibits. If you've been to the Ripley aquarium in Toronto and are expecting a tunnel underwater, you will be hugely disappointed. What looks like a tunnel in the pictures of the Aquarium du Quebec is in fact a small",
          "Seen a lot of different species that we had never seen before. Very interesting & deffinetly worth going. Unfortunately, it was pouring for the outdoor exhibits...but did it anyways.",
          "The polar bear show is amazing. Even the aquarium is not that big, if u got the kids, its worth 2 go.",
          "I was last here 12 years ago. At that time, I had found the aquarium a sad place, both for visitors and animals alike. Fast forward a decade, and there have been significant improvements. The seal show was excellent, and portrayed the aquarium, staff and its animal husbandry",
          "A gorgeous little gem o an aquarium. Beautiful exhibits, both indoor and out. Gorgeous grounds by the seaway. The seals and walruses were the best!",
          "Very nice aquarium. We stumbled upon it and were very glad we did. Happily spent 3 hours or so and saw everything.",
          "This is a smallish aquarium in a park setting. Good display of jellies and seahorses. We enjoyed the \"enrichment \" programs for the walrus, polar bear and seals. They are not exactly shows but still enjoyable. Friendly staff spoke English and French. Food in bistro was good.",
          "The aquarium is small in comparison to the other we have been to (New England) but all of the fish, jellyfish, starfish, seahorses, etc were interesting. The feeding show for the seals was very fun to watch. Our one complaint was it was very hot out and the polar bears were",
          "For those who have seen the larger aquariums like the one in Monterey, California, this one will seem rather small. It is very popular with visitors. But they allow strollers and the place can get very very crowded. Check out the octopus as well as the nice jellyfish exhibit. I",
          "As it was a rainy day we decided to visit the Quebec aquarium. A very clean and well organized park with plenty to see and be amazed by. The cost is worth the view and a CAA card will give you 10% off. The fee also provides you with a 20% discount on 6 other museums in",
          "It's an average aquarium. Small. Well maintained but if I go to Quebec I wouldn't go there again. Parking is free and you can't bring any food.",
          "Another highly recommended stop on your visit to Quebec City. This attraction also participates in the 20% savings program at select Quebec attractions, which saves you a bit of $. Even at full price I would visit here again. Plenty of species of underwater life to see, enjoy,",
          "I was looking forward to this excursion but for some reason i think i was looking for more than what we saw, there was no where telling us the times for feeding so we kept missing those and besides that it was tanks.",
          "Nice, not big but everything is close and you will have a great day. to better schedule your day attend to each presentation with the trainer before visiting all over.",
          "The aquarium is definitely best for children. There are a variety of animals including polar bears, seals, snow foxes and typical fish/amphibians. It's smaller than many other aquariums I have visited but easily walkable. Food is available on site and there are plenty of",
          "Spent the morning at the aquarium. It was extremely busy, and I had a difficult time determining what time different feeding shows were - they signs were at the exhibit, which was no help after we'd missed it. There were a few creatures - walrus, polar bear, seals, fox - in",
          "While travelling from PEI back to Toronto, we decided to visit this Aquarium as we were ahead of schedule. While not the largest or having the most features, for the price and attractions, it was a great value. There were lots of hands on exhibits for the kids and one of the",
          "True, the aquarium is not as spectacular as most of the ones I have visited in Europe or the US. However, activities like the touch basins or the interactive rallies make it quite unique and interesting for the whole family.",
          "My family and our friends decided to meet up at the aquarium. The pavilions were very entertaining for the kids. For example the kids could touch a sting ray in their environment. It brought smiles to all their faces. We also got to the feeding of the polar bears as well as",
          "I was surprised how crowded the aquarium was. There are not a lot of animals here or much to do but it is laid out nicely. The aquarium parts can be claustrophobic, but the seals, walruses, polar bears and arctic foxes steal the show.",
          "My wife & I decided to visit the Aquarium but we arrived at 4 & it closes at 5 so we had 1 hour to rush around & try to see as much as we can. We did manage to see part of a seal show where the trainers get the seals to do a lot of good little tricks. They had a couple of polar",
          "The grounds and landscaping are simply beautiful. The location is right by the Quebec bridge and you have a view on the St. Lawrence river during the seal show which was just average. The exhibits are informative and varied. The favorite for my 6 year old grandson was the",
          "Pros_ Polar bears and walruses and seals - fantastic.... The buildings for the sealife however were a bit too spread out and they let so many people in you cant get to see the different fish and sea life displays properly.. Its was just crazy when we went in August 2016. Way too",
          "A must-see for adults and children alike. Inexpensive, fun, and educational. Highlights: jellyfish galore, seahorses, seal show, octopus",
          "My wife and I went today and had a lot of fun. There are three sections, its a large park with other things besides just aquatic animals. Went into the deep sea area and got to feed the rays for a small donation, definitely have to try and was the highlight of our trip there.",
          "I would not recommend this aquarium. If it was free...maybe. We were through it in less than 1 hour.",
          "It was winter and chilling winds, but the place still had lots of people. The exhibits were really good and informative. I loved the ones with the Polar bears. Also, saw Walruses, Seals, arctic fox. Had a chance to touch the Rays. Polar bear and aquarium feeding times were",
          "We arrived around opening time which was nice since it wasn't too busy yet. The aquarium isn't too big so it can quickly feel a bit crowded. I liked the exhibits a lot. There was a lot of information along the way. Outside you can see seals, walruses, an ice bear and polar",
          "The place is a great family destination for local residents. There is great room for improvement. The acquarium shows its years and needs maintenance and renewal. It has old signs and old fashion show cases. It's located far from downtown Quebec City. I don't think it's worth",
          "Very impressed with the exhibits. Also they have free strollers so you don't need to pack one. There are outdoor parks and splash pads so once you've seen everything and you still have a hyper child, you can let them run obstacle courses in the woods or climb in the playground",
          "I really like the place. Very nice and instructive for all. My daughter had the time of her life. Se relay enjoy the place. They let you know from the beginning that you have a discount.",
          "This place is fantastic for kids, they have a large outside play and picnic area. We went without kids and still found interesting. Although its an aquarium, they have a few animals (2 polar bears, arctic foxes, seals & walruses). They focus on the 2 main aquatic regions that",
          ",I'm not a big review writer, however, after visiting the aquarium today I feel its important to let others know how upsetting my experience was. Firstly I must say the aquarium was very clean and tidy, my first impressions was like many other Zoos and Aquariums I have visited",
          "This is a lovely well run Aquarium. The animals looked well cared for and the staff are really friendly. Lots of school visits there when we visitied and the children looked like they were having a great time. Worth a visit.",
          "The staff were mostly all bilingual and all the signs were which was great. The outdoor sections were a little sad just because the animals don't have much space to live in and not much shade. They could use some updating. The indoor sections however were really great!! Very",
          "We visited on a rainy/cloudy day. Took advantage of a break in the rain to do the outdoor obstacle course, which the kids enjoyed. There were two indoor pavilions we visited when it began raining harder.",
          "Just over a half day visit was good to see everything. It has grown since my last visit. Walrus's have had pups which was neat to see. Very popular with children with some things to touch, good seal show and nice little playground. I liked the emphasis on local marine fish or",
          "The most beautiful display of jellyfish, sea horses. Outdoor show was cute but too long. Gift shop affordable. Plenty of staff around to guide you.",
          "This is basically a zoo. I found the entrance price quite high. It can be visited in about an hour and is just moderately interesting. I did enjoy the jellyfish exhibit but felt sad for the animals who have to be confined in such tiny enclosures and tanks for the public's",
          "We went to the aquarium with a bunch of friends while on a girls trip. Total waste of money. I love visiting zoos and aquariums, I've been to so many. The aquarium wasn't that big which wasn't a problem the problem was how small the enclosures were for the animals. There were 4",
          "We enjoyed our visit to the aquarium. The only down side was that it was raining the day we went so the outside shows were canceled or done in the rain.",
          "Being somewhat of a fan of zoos and aquariums, I have seen a few and this one has to be the worst. Though it does have potential you will be deceived once you realize that ALL the aquatic plants are fake, yes plastic! Considering that you can see one of the most beautiful",
          "Went with wife and kids. Very clean and well designed park. There weren't too many people so was not crowded.",
          "Though not the largest aquarium I've visited, this was probably the most charming. There's a play area for little ones and spots for picnicking. Almost an entire hall was devoted to jellyfish, and we saw several types of seahorses that we'd never seen before. And we must have",
          "We spent the better part of our day visiting the Aquarium today (about 3.5 hours) and were pleasantly surprised at the exhibits and the aquarium's commitment to educating the public on planet and wildlife conservation. The place is well laid out and the exhibits were fun to",
          "I am a huge lover of animals and very conflicted about 'zoos'... This aquarium doesn't raise any huge flags but left me feeling just uneasy about some of the pools and the mammals in them. Both my husband and I felt like this place was probably pretty cool in the late",
          "We brought our family here and spend much of the day. There are several buildings and performance areas that have scheduled shows during the day. Grounds are well kept, exhibits are pleasant and informative, lots of hands on for everyone. Just a lot of fun and a pleasant way",
          "i've been to aquarium du Qu\u00e9bec for the first time of my life last Week, Can i tell you that i almost cried all the way there? The inside part was great with the fishies and the raie and the star fish(the starfish aquarium was although smelling really bad not really attracted",
          "My friends and I visited the aquarium and had a wonderful time. We saw a good variety of fish both big and small, an octopus, a polar bear at feeding time, an owl, seals and a walrus with her baby. The setting was beautiful and everything looked well cared for. We were very",
          "Some parts are interesting but the rest is just depressing. Too small habitats for the animals, who are clearly unhappy (esp. polar bear), small enough aquarium that their low budget is spent on everything except the animals, instead of improving the lives of the animals. Don't",
          "This is a small aquarium / zoo. Unlike the other big aquariums we have been to in other cities, this one wasn't packed full of people so we didn't have to line up to get in, or jostle with other people to get a view the the exhibits. They've also focused much of the exhibit to",
          "We visited the aquarium on a windy, slightly rainy day but had a blast anyway. There was a small show with the seals and an educative presentation about the polar bears that showed us how much the staff really cares for the well-being of the animals and how they put a lot of",
          "Fairly small and good amount of animals. They looked healty and cared for. Only took 1 hour to get through.",
          "We spent four hours here with our teens and everyone enjoyed it. The jellyfish and seahorse exhibits are especially impressive. We also enjoyed seeing the seals and walrus. I would definitely recommend a visit here.",
          "The zip line, obstacle course, playground and park areas overlooking the river are outstanding and as good as the aquarium. The jellyfish are totally amazing.",
          "Had some time to our selves spent the day at the Aquarium. The staff was very friendly and the family loved it.",
          "Lots of fun, would be great for a family. Can see pretty much everything in about two hours. Lots of variety.",
          "Husband and I decided to check out the aquarium to get away from the old town for a while. Place was packed with kids from school trips. Received a 10% discount for being CAA members so bring your card if you are a member. Lots of aquarium was outside. Left the seal show shortly",
          "We spent a rainy few hours on a weekend at this very unique aquarium. It combines aquarium and zoo by focusing on marine-type animals. So, while more than half of it is inside, there are a number of outside exhibits - polar bear enclosure, walrus and seal pools, arctic fox",
          "My bf and I went on a short trip to quebec city. We hadn't expected for most of it to be outside and it was a cold windy day, totally our fault. However, we got there around 11am did the outdoor exhibits then headed inside. When we were done we looked at the map and realized",
          "In addition to 2 large buildings with the variety of fish (fresh and salt water) they also have outdoor areas with polar bears, seals, wlarus, and fox. They have a large selection of fish and put on several features throughout the day, feeding and talking about the fish and",
          "I like to go to the zoo and/or aquarium whenever we have the opportunity. This is a lovely, 'working' facility. The animals are very well kept. I especially enjoyed the seal, walrus (Hi Boris!) and other outdoor enclosures. The indoor displays were excellent, I was very",
          "The two buildings with the tanks are terrific. There are areas for children to touch sea cucumbers and starfish and to pet rays. The giant tank that you walk through and the jellyfish exhibit are beautiful. I don't like the outdoor areas with polar bears, seals and walrus",
          "It was a bit cold today but all the exhibitions were fun. There were seal, sea lion and polar bear shows. These are humane and educational. The staff is dedicated to the well being of the animals. The indoor buildings have strength: local fish and habitats are the most",
          "We visited the aquarium in April so although there were a lot of people it was no where near filled to capacity which was nice because there were really no lines and things flowed at a steady pace without having to wait long to see anything. Prices were more than reasonable,",
          "What a great experience for the young and young-at-heart! The beauty of this aquarium is the mix of indoor and outdoor activities. It really caters to the masses. You can touch the sting-rays and star fish .. go outside to see the bears .. have lunch on the outdoor picnic",
          "Enjoyed the marine pavilion. Outdoor areas were enjoyable but were slightly disappointed with the cleanliness of the habitats, but this could have been due to the time of year. Animals on display were incredible. Looking forward to visiting later this year.",
          "We went on a cold and drizzly day, but it did not stop us from having a great time at this aquarium. I really liked how it was set up with indoor and outdoor exhibits along with playground, picnic area and walking paths. What a great place to bring grandkids. I only wish it was",
          "We have travelled to many, many aquariums so our review may be a bit slanted. This aquarium is a good place to visit, even in the cold and rain, which was what we had :) The main building is large with clearly marked paths and exhibits, all very well done, very clean and the",
          "It was snowing when we went and still enjoyed the outdoor exhibits... just quickly. The under water tunnel is amazing, try and take in the feeding and fish lesson. They drop a scuba diver in the water to feed the fish... fun and informative. Sting Rays, Jelly Fish... all",
          "Very good exhibits, lots of animals on display. Most of the bigger creatures are outside so it's less fun in the snow. Best for kids and families. Cafe on site has reasonable prices.",
          "Visited with a group of teenagers who enjoyed over 3 hours of discovery, tons of photo opportunities and unique things to see. We do not have anything like this where we come from. We wish we would have had planned to be there longer. This was one of our best and most favourite",
          "Very clean. Interesting for all ages. There are polar bear, seal lion, otarie outside and a great variety of fishes, hippocambe, turtle, ray.",
          "It was a fun time to see these animals you only find in the Arctic areas.All attractions are fairly close together.After 3:00 the price for admission goes way down.It closes at 4:00 but it is still enough time to see everything.",
          "The Aquarium was a huge hit with our family (despite the abundance of things to do outside and the very, very cold February temperatures). You can easily spend hours here and most of the tanks, etc. have raised areas so children can easily get a great look at the display. Also",
          "Wow! On a beautiful, sunny day the aquarium is a great place to spend several hours. There were no crowds and we were amazed at how personal the experience was. Not once did we feel rushed which meant we had time to meet the stingrays, gaze at the jellyfish and stand in awe by",
          "Right off the highway, and easy to find. The Aquarium itself is large, and they have a very informative and bilingual staff. Enjoyed watching the various \"shows\" they had available, from feeding the Polar Bears to the scuba diving to feed the starfish in the large tank.",
          "On a whim we decided to visit the Aquarium while in Quebec. Our home city has a large aquarium so we weren't sure we needed to see another, but we are so glad we did! This aquarium has great exhibits of both fresh and salt water fish. It is very child friendly, there are steps",
          "We had quite the adventure here, both inside and out. My children loved touching the starfish and they were mesmerized by all of the jellyfish. I loved that so much was outside. It really helps to break up the experience when young ones can run and play outside. I would",
          "Our children were enamored with the jelly fish and seahorses above all else. We missed all the shows : unfortunate timing on our part. A lovely outdoor walk. Clean exhibits. Reasonably priced $54 all in for family of four.",
          "The aquarium was perfect for family. Lots to see. We loved the polar bears and walrus shows. Two buildings full of reptiles and fish.",
          "This place is like a smaller scale Monterey (California) aquarium. Animals outdoor all year long giving \"shows\" and and an assortment of Canadian wild fishes in the indoor aquariums. The Jelly fish building is worth the visit too. We saw the sea lions and polar bear feeding at",
          "Visited on a -17 degree fahrenheit day. Did not realize that 40% of the exhibits are outdoors! Brochure should mention that! I've never been that cold in my life (going from exhibit to exhibit in the arctic temperature). Ok way to spend a day, but make sure you wear snow pants",
          "Amazing! I've been to Ripleys aquarium in Toronto (the biggest indoor aquarium in Canada) and although this was not quite as grand I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Aquarium is kind of a mis demeanor, it's really a combination of a zoo and an aquarium. The aquarium is 60% indoors",
          "Not the Aquarium's fault that the extreme cold weather made it hard to enjoy. Most of the attractions are outdoors and the indoor pavilions were okay for an hour. I can imagine that during the spring and summer it would be a delightful place for children.",
          "We arrived in Quebec near the Hotel sector a few hours earlier than the rest of our party, and decided to kill some time at the Quebec Aquarium...I'm glad we did! It is spread out over 5-7 buildings that host different things, The first building has Jellyfish of every",
          "Was blown away by the polar bear and walrus exhibits. And thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience .. even on a pretty cold winter day. Something for everyone.",
          "I've been to the new Ripleys Aquarium in Toronto so in comparison to that, it wasn't that great. You didn't need a whole lot of time to get through it. It took us about 45 minutes. Loved the outdoor animals but I always have a few concerns when animals seem agitated with being",
          "My husband & I spent two hours or so at this aquarium. Though we had already seen Ripley's in Toronto, we very much enjoyed this as well. The great variety of jellyfish were awesome and beautiful! We also enjoyed the outdoor animals such as the little white fox, seals, walrus",
          "We were there for about 3 hours and had a great time lots to see. Our favorite was the walrus. But the fish tanks were neat as well. I recommend this place for sure. Staff at location were friendly and great.",
          "Late December visit with our teenagers and we all loved it - even if we weren't dressed as warmly as we should have been! Arrive early when school is out, as it's packed with young families. Plenty of indoor and outdoor activities and sights.",
          "We have been to the Aquarium 4-5 times in the last year. We enjoy the outdoors animals and shows as well as all the indoor species. Our families' favorites are the polar bears, the walrus and the seals (outdoors), the Awesome Ocean Discovery (a tunnel where all the fish are",
          "It was chilly but the outdoor animals did not seem to mind. Seals, Walrus, Polar bears, Arctic Foxes are all very entertaining. Indoors the many aquariums are filled with fresh and salt water creatures. It is smaller than Ripley's in Toronto but a great day none the less as",
          "Nice setting on the edge of the river. The jellyfish exhibit was the best I have ever seen. Better in summer months since you have to walk outside to get between buildings.",
          "We visited the aquarium in November and therefore it wasn't a great time of year for the outdoor exhibits. However, we enjoyed walking through the inside.",
          "Visited the aquarium on a beautiful winter's day and was very impressed. Fun to see the polar bears, walruses and seals outside in the cold and snow. Inside, there were so many highlights - the huge octopus, the jeyyfish exhibits, the touchtank with the rays, etc., etc.",
          "I was lucky to see the polar bears playing with each other and I was there just in time for a short but entertaining walrus show. The actual aquarium is small, but it has it's interesting parts. I guess I just wasn't too impressed because I've been to the Ripley's Aquarium in",
          "A great place to see walruses, seals, and polar bars. My wife really enjoyed the jelly fish and the sea horses.",
          "The place as good but with the winter the one portion was shut down. The walrus special event show good but I don't speak French. She- the marine biologist - would talk for 3-5 minutes in French and about 30 seconds in English for each routine. It was ok though as the kids",
          "The polar bears were amazing. The aquarium is a lot better since the renovations. It was great during the winter. All the species and shows were great.",
          "Visited the zoo today with my other half and was pleasantly surprised. The seals and walruses were very good to watch but the polar bears were amazing! However the only thing that lets the place down is the women who works in the cafe. She was very rude with her hand out waiting",
          "Loved it. The different species of fish blew me away and that includes jellyfish. I was surprised to see they also had polar bears and seals, birds, etc. and it was not just an aquarium. I could have spent all day here but only had a little over an hour. I definitely plan to",
          "We expected a lot more after seeing the advertisements. Maybe it would be better in the summer with the water park and picnic area open and maybe it would be more enjoyable for children. We were looking forward to much larger aquariums with a larger selection of aquatic species.",
          "Super place to take the kids in North Americas oldest city. Tons of history in .quebec but they have taken the time to think of families. Kids loved it , polar bears and seals especially. Great inside parts, got to touch lots of things...well the kids did, I opted out!",
          "Great place to visit especially with kids but also good for adults. polar bears, walrus and jelly fish displays were favorites.",
          "What a great experience. It was fantastic to see the Polar Bears, Walrus's, Owls, Manta Ray's, and different types of jelly fish. The atmosphere was first class.",
          "We spent longer here than we expected. The indoor parts were nice and we enjoyed the touch tanks. The staff were friendly and bilingual. The shows are all presented in French but they are willing to answer questions after in English. The polar bear show was cute and fun! My",
          "Great family activity, and a break from the history and shopping. The polar bears and walrus were especially entertaining, engaging with the visitors. There are shows at the seal and walrus areas, but only in French.",
          "The addition of outdoor display areas featuring polar bears, walrus, seals, and other wildlife make this almost like visiting a zoo. Worth a visit for kids and adults alike!",
          "Visited over Easter weekend. This is a great aquarium with an excellent variety of creatures. I enjoyed the combination of indoor and indoor spaces. The polar bears alone are worth the visit in my book! Kids had a blast, they still talk about being able to touch the stingrays.",
          "We always stop here on our way through Quebec City. Easy to drive to, it's a great activity for any age. The inside is 3 levels, including a glass tunnel to walk 'underwater'. There is a touch pool, too. The outside is even better with polar bears, walrus, seals, sea lions,",
          "The Aquarium is more than just fish. There is a small section where you walk under the fish and it is very small compared to most aquariums we have been to. So at first I was a little disappointed but then you start exploring and find out that there is so much more to see...",
          "This is not the best aquarium I have seen by a long shot. However, it has two attractions that make the whole visit worthwhile. It has a terrific sea nettle section that is the largest I have ever seen. It also has a large aquatic section with wonderful polar bears and walruses.",
          "Loved it here! The jelly fish area was our fave where you walk around in the dark and its all lit up with massive tanks of jellies....beautiful. The polar bears I found upsetting as it was 30 degree temps and I felt they were so out of their element. They had no place being in",
          "We had a mixed experience. The aquarium itself was fairly unimpressive in terms of the number of animals and the presentation. The seal show was narrated entirely in French, and it was not very interesting without understanding the commentary. Went mid morning on a Friday in",
          "My daughter visited, I was not available. Seems it is a great place to go, and even more if you have kids.",
          "In general the acuarium was good. We wouldn't return as a couple. If you have kids they will have a great time. In my opinion the park needs a little bit more attention and make the walrus area bigger, 2 swiming pools doesn't seem enough for 3 walrus.",
          "With a 4 years old kid. We spent 2 hrs hearing check! Wow? Look! He was just thrilled. A great afternoon with both indoor and outdoor activities.",
          "Disappointing. The walrus show was good. The polar bear show was poor and I'm not sure how happy those bears are. Probably a good day out for families but not for a couple. A wasted afternoon. After Sseaworld in San Diego and acquarium in Sydney Australia, this one was a",
          "I just want to point out that it was a very Hot day and that i felt very bad for the polar bears because they are not use to this temperature... not very animal friendly... even there was a winter fox outside in the heat... its not very fun seeing an animal dying of heat when",
          "If I were a child, I would rate this place 5 star, but I find it quite boring going there as an adult. The Aquarium isn't very big, there are a lot of activities for children and you can tell the facilities are all children friendly. I probably wouldn't come again.",
          "Went with the kids - we did get to see lots of fishes, as well as outdoor animals like the polar beer - he was taking his afternoon nap, i guess he did not favor the sun.. There was the beautiful water creatures - walrus, seals, very cute and there was the walrus show too -",
          "Walruses! My gosh, so amazing. They squirt mouthfuls of water at unsuspecting children. (Don't think about the salmonella.) The polar bears at my last visit two years ago were heart-breaking. One was pacing back and forth, over and over. Clearly out of its mind. Ugh just",
          "Great experience. Also had outdoor Arctic animals like polar bears and walruses. Free parking and great for little kids. All info is bilingual so it was great because I dont speak or read French. They lack the variety of fish that Ripley's aquarium has in Toronto but a must see!",
          "I really loved this place and loved touching the creatures, also not expensive. Easy to get to and lots of parking. Down part that saddened me, the Polar bears looked so sad and unhealthy. Also the owl in a small environment (cage) he kept flying into it trying to get out. ..",
          "We enjoyed our day here, lots to do and see. The kids obviously loved seeing the animals and fish; a nice surprise was the mini tree go with lots to climb and wear them out. The shows were neat, and the actress took time to talk with the kids and take pictures with them.",
          "This was an impromptu visit to kill time. Oh but what a surprise. I found the visit very informative on the habitants of the waters around Quebec, and other places of the globe as well. I learned a lot.",
          "We made a quick stop at the aquarium while travelling on the road, looking for a fun way to spend a few hours. This aquarium has a decent variety of jellyfish, seahorses, fish, and other animals that like the water. It's a neat little place, but actually quite small. It took us",
          "If you like seals, walruses, and polar bears, you must go! All were on display outside in their spaces and very lively and active to watch. I could sit there all day watching them. The inside main building has other types of fish including a touch tank. The hallways around the",
          "There's a lot to see at the Aquarium! It took us half a day to see everything... Very well organized and the staff is great.",
          "This Aquarium does have some highlights, tons of Jellyfish I have never seen. They have Polar Bears .. I love Polar bears. They have Walrus and Seals always cool. Plus some typically seen things at an Aquarium. They fall short in a few areas, it's small, seems dirty and that",
          "We are from Baltimore which has a nice aquarium, but the one in Quebec City is fantastic! We could not believe how nice this was - very clean and easy to walk around. The exhibits were spacious, and the staff very friendly. I also thought it was GREAT that the staff",
          "Very crowded on weekend, nothing exciting to see, grey fish in aquarium all around. Walrus and bears are fun. Overall too expensive for what it is.",
          "Very nice marine attraction! Friendly staff and many things for families to see and enjoy. Price is good and food is enjoyable. Large playset area for small children. Shows are ok. They put on a pirate show and other shows but are mainly french and gets boring if you don't",
          "We spend half day in the zoo and the kids had a wonderful time and so did we. The kids love the touching the ray. There is plenty of space for picnic and plenty of picnic table, play area for the kids. The site is accessible for strollers and wheelchair. Half day visit is more",
          "Two of my friends and I decide to visit the aquarium on a day it was raining. Aparently many families had the same idea. Although it was busy we still managed to spend three hours there looking at all the exhibits including polar bears and seals who were still active despite the",
          "Make sure you catch the early shows as they get busy (was not 50/50 French /English for the shows but signage was). Save some money and bring a picnic. There are places to stop and eat inside and in the shade outside. Also a play structure and fitness challenge.",
          "Our family has been in Quebec city for 5 days. Both our kids love animals so this was a natural spot to go. Both our 11 and 7 year old loved it. Good exhibits, seal show was fun. Even with our lack of French, we survived. Bring your CAA card for a discount ($55 total for our",
          "It is good for any age. Our kids (4 and 7) are always amazed to go there. Still, you can't spend a full day there because I find the Aquarium too small. The activities are highly educatives, but it won't last too long. Meeting polar animals are a nice experience.",
          "We took a cab from the old city on a very rainy day and found this aquarium to be very good. There are several buildings with different exhibits but you could buy ponchos at the ticket entrance to get you from building to building on a rainy day. The outdoor gardens looked",
          "Visited the aquarium with my sons (5 and 7) it was a good experience overall, but not that impressive. It is really hard to get there when coming with public transportation or by foot. The tiny path with no side walk could be dangerous given the amount of trucks passing by,",
          "This is one of the nicest aquariums I've visited aside from the New York Aquarium. It is very accessible, has plenty of parking, and has diverse exhibits that makes it a worthwhile place to spend about a half day.",
          "We arrived to the aquarium thinking that it will just be an ordinary and boring aquarium. But then we were surprised over the variety of animals seals,walrus, polar bears etc. We got to see a poor bear up close underwater. What an amazing sight even us (the adults) enjoyed it.",
          "We thought that the aquarium visit was great! Lots of underwater sea creatures to see. Fun different activities for everyone. Nice play structures for kids including a splash-pad and a forest play structure! Great thing to do for families or even just to go solo!",
          "I went there expecting to see some exotic animals. What I got was mostly ordinary aquariums with grey fishes that swim in the saint laurent river right next to the aquarium du Quebec. Enterance was not cheap and I was disappointed. There are some seal in a tiny outside pool.",
          "I highly recommend this aquarium for anyone traveling with youngsters. The aquarium is more like a campus with tons of outdoor wildlife, as well as indoor animal exhibits. Additionally, there is a playground with obstacle course and play/splash fountains. If you go in the",
          "The aquarium is laid out 60% inside and 40% inside. The exhibits are generally well kept with the exception of the polar bears, walruses and seals pools. Those pools were rusted and extremely cramped. They have a decent variety of aquatic animals but there is not much to do if",
          "What a fun place to spend 1/2 your day near Quebec City. We started off with the seal show and had such a blast watching the presentation. They are such super smart animals. It was all in french but you could understand what was going on and the connection between the trainer",
          "We were at the gate at 9am and had time to do the main aquarium building before the seal show. A quick break and check out the polar bears and it was time for the walrus show. We all loved it and learned a lot.",
          "Wonderfull place for family ,very clean and lot too see like jellyfish,see horses etc. Nice fun show",
          "I loved everything about the experience! It was fun and made me feel like a kid again! The interactive animation with the pirates before each show of either the walrus or ses was silly but also enjoyable and put a smile on everyone's fave regardless of your age!",
          "My wife and i enjoy going to Aquariums and this is a good medium sized collection, Excellent seahorse and jelly fish display. The best Fresh water and Atlantic salt water, didn't know what a Wolf Fish or Atlantic Haddock looked like. Modern facilities with focus on kids and",
          "for the price of admission you have a lot to see. there is a playground as well nice park to walk around . there is 3 levels and from the bottum level you feel like you are inside the aquarium",
          "This is a wonderful aquarium, park, and zoo. It is in a relaxed natural environment overlooking the river. We loved the opportunity to see animals both indoors and outdoors. It is a very child-friendly place with playgrounds and numerous picnic spots. We especially loved the",
          "Although it was pouring rain when we visited, we still had so much fun. The cashier told us that it was 50% indoor, and 40% outdoor, or vice versa. If you want to enjoy it plenty, make sure the weather is nice. You can touch sting rays, see polar bears, see lions and more.",
          "It was very hot when we visited and all the aquariums on the lower floor were wet because of humidity. So you couldn't see much. And the building with the jellyfish had the same problem. Overall its a very nice place for kids. We've been there several times by now. And will be",
          "Great (small) aquarium for the family! Price was right, took us about 3 hours to visit all. Great polar bear exhibit! Jelly fish exhibit rivals (Boston) New England Aquarium.",
          "The Quebec Tourism board suggested visiting the aquarium if it rained. The inside was amazing. The jelly fish display was amazing. They have a rare blue lobster and they have stations where you can touch sting rays, sea cucumbers and star fish. Beautiful. There were a spot where",
          "Number one, it has the Polar Bears! Need I say more, well it also has a giant Octopus. It's a fairly sized theme park. And wait, it also has a splash area for the kids. In the main building's 3 floors it has different kinds of fishes, reptiles and sea-horses. You can feel",
          "Bring good walking shoes. There is plenty to see and lots of interactive attractions. Favorite was the walrus attraction. The gift shop was small. If it is raining the facility does sell ponchos. Prices are acceptable and there is free parking.",
          "probably one of my favourite aquarium! animals seem to have enough space (only the ice-bear looka sad) and there is an amazing jelly fish exposition!",
          "Quebec hosts a very nice aquarium, but you have to go in a car, taxi or hotel shuttle - at least we did from the Fairmont. It is worth the ride and have your taxi driver take the scenic route. It costs a little more, but is worth it. The aquarium has a good amount to see we got",
          "We make a point of going to the aquarium where ever we go....so we have been to a lot. This one was just ok. For me it was more of an aquarium/zoo. They did a great job featuring local fish in the aquariums but if you are looking for the bright vibrant salt water fish you",
          "I would note the following things to see: Very good aquariums with jellyfishes, seahorses; polar bears; seals (with a show); various aquariums with ecosystems from Quebec and other parts of the world... and playgrounds for children.",
          "Aquarium had lots for children, probably more geared to children, but we always enjoy seeing marine life at aquariums that we visit. And especially for the adults we located the jelly fish exhibit, AMAZING ! Also to see the Polar Bears there were 2 of the, could really see",
          "We really liked the aquarium, especially the outside area, and the underwater diving feeling aquarium. The kids loved the playground area. Its worth visiting at least once:)",
          "Was a nice visit to the aquarium. Was our first time at the aquarium. ... Will return again when we go to Quebec..",
          "My son and I were completely disappointed by this aquarium. It is very small and run down. Totally not worth the entrance fee and cab fare! Took us only an hour to see everything and be ready to go. Skip this one.",
          "This was a pleasant visit and glad we went. Mostly outside, with animals such as seals and polar bears. The exhibits inside were nice, mostly species associated with Canada. This was not the best aquarium we have ever visited, but it was nice.",
          "We spent the afternoon at the aquarium which was 60% inside tour, 40% outside. The cost was about 20$ each for me and my wife. Took us about 2.5 hrs to navigate the groups and all indoor activities. The aquarium for highlights has polar bears, walrus, seal's, and a whole section",
          "Had been wanting to go to the aquarium for some time with my daughter. It isn't a big installation but still quite a nice aquarium. The price is a little high to get in but then again to support good staff and the comfort of these animals it is worth the spending. I loved the",
          "The aquarium was close to our hotel so one afternoon with time to spare, we decided to go. I can't recall the amount paid to get in but it seemed fairly significant for two adults. The jellyfish were neat to see. While we were there a children's attraction with \"pirates\" were",
          "We visited on a very cold wintery day, but it was totally worth it. Not only did we get to watch one of the polar bears play with its toys for a good half hour or more, but the jellyfish and seahorse displays were outstanding! If we ever return to Quebec, we would definitely",
          "Let me begin by saying that it is very expensive to get into the aquarium. It cost my wife and $42. I'm very torn on what to say about the place. The place was very interesting and gave you a good introduction worth of information about every creature they have there.",
          "Visited the aquarium upon recommendation of hotel staff. This was basically last on our agenda. Easily accessible area and ample parking space. Ticket staff were friendly and even suggested we take advantage of group rates and the AAA discount. We were not expecting to see much",
          "Not recommended for kids in the winter, Kids complained about all the walking outdoors to get from place to place especially in freezing weather. Not satisfied with value for money $60 for 2 adults and 1 child. Walrus, seals, and polar bears were amazing, ocean colorful fish",
          "This is a run down \"attraction\" with not much to see. Shows were outdoors in the cold, and in French only. The tanks inside were a bit dirty and dingy looking and there was not a very impressive diversity of marine life. The plaques told the name of the fish, but not many fun",
          "You should visit it ,especially if you have kids. We really liked the wide range of animals and a lot of jelly fish expositions!",
          "My kids loved this aquarium. We have been to several others and this was probably one of the simpler, lower tech ones but it was much more fun. Good selection of fish even if the aquarium is on the smaller side. Nice outdoor playground, nice view of the St. Lawrence and the",
          "Wow! There is so much to see! From the beautiful dance of the gellyfish to the funny walrus, you will have a great time! You can take all the time you want to look at all the exibitions and you can even touch some fishes! Outside, the view of the bridges is also nice. Would",
          "The Aquarium is organizing Halloween-themed nights in October and we stopped there last Friday to visit. There was A TON of people in line to purchase their tickets, so make sure to buy them online or prepare to wait at leat 1.5-2 hours. Once inside, we were walking",
          "We stopped in for a visit on our way to Quebec City for a weekend stay. A few highlights: walruses are huge and very impressive, seals look like big playful swimming dogs of the seas, and the jelly fish exhibitions are really something else! Petting the Rays is also something to",
          "Sure there are better aquariums, but for someone who has lived in Canada for 22 years, it is still the first time I saw polar bears, walruses, seals up close and arctic foxes, and I was thrilled! The place has a lovely setting by a river and is nicely landscaped. It is an old",
          "Not the biggest attraction, but the space is well thought out, the shows are scheduled to allow you to see them all, there is a small park for the kids to run in and wonderful pick nick area with a great walking trail from which you can see the St-Laurent river. We have been",
          "This place is great but when I visited the aquarium there wasn't much attractions going on... it was a rainy day so all the exterior activities ( the best) were closed..",
          "Both kid and adult friendly this Aquarium is awesome! It may not be the largest place but it offers a lot to do such as: Interacting with animals (Petting starfish, stingrays, and sea cucumbers..), a variety of marine life to gawk at, and the opportunity to watch the polar",
          "This wasn\u2019t a huge place, but we enjoyed it. The facility makes good use of space and has quite a few animals. The highlights were definitely the seal and walrus shows, which were well done, but were presented primarily in French with only a smattering of English. For the",
          "Location was great just off the highways. There were less attractions than I was expecting, actually I bit disappointed in not seeing as many varieties of marine species. However, the tanks were highlighted well, and loved the glass tunnel underneath the tanks. The \"petting\"",

          "Far more than just an aquarium, this park includes gardens and large animal exhibits (polar bear, arctic fox, walrus, etc.) as well as a large play area and restaurant. Parking is free. Numerous aquariums contain freshwater and seawater fish and animals. The largest one can",

          "The best thing about this aquarium is the walruses. I'd never seen them in a aquarium before and my family and I spent a lot of time watching them when we visited. The polar bear, seal, and arctic fox exhibits were also very cool. The aquarium is big enough to spend a day in but",
          "We visit aquariums every chance we can, and this one did not disappoint. The walruses were particularly interesting as were the variety of seals. There was just enough information to read, without it being too much or too discouraging. I thought it would be a particularly",
          "It was our first time in an aquarium. Plenty of fishes of all kinds and colours. But i liked the colourful jelly fish pond. The colour was coming from light ,but it made a very nice environment. We went during the winter and there was mild snow fall that day. So the outside",

          "My Friend dragged me to this place which I really didn't enjoy at all. If you don't have any kids, I strongly recommend not to go because paying $20 for each adult is TOTALLY not WORTH. This place basically has two polar bears, few seals, some common fresh water fish and marine",
          "We took our two grandchildren to the Quebec Aquarium and we all loved it. It is easy to find, has free parking and offers lots of fun things to see and do for kids and grown ups. The displays are well presented and packed with information. It is a great way to spend a day",
          "Our family (two adults, 3 children--7, 5, 2) enjoyed the aquarium a lot. The first thing I'll point out is that when my husband went to pay admission he told the woman 2 adults, 2 children (our 2 y.o. was free) and she charged him the per person amount, rather than the family",
          "This aquarium has a decent selection of river, lake and ocean fishes and wildlife in easy to view tanks. The signage could be a bit easier to match the fish in the tank with the signs to figure out which you're looking at. We only saw the harbour seals show but it was",
          "Me and my gf had fun at this place. We got to take alot of nice pictures and we also got to see alot of cool creatures from the sea. I wouldn't spend more than a few hours here. It's a good place to visit once but I wouldn't go back.",
          "What a great place to take the kids. The Aquarium grounds are small, but are well designed with winding paths, which make it very easy to walk around. Even when it's busy, it's easy to get around and see everything. All the animals were active when we visited, and there was",
          "The aquarium is easily located right by the bridges. Pleasantly surprised at the amount of animals and fishes that we were able to observe. The shows with the sea lion were really good. Entry price is reasonable considering you can easily spend 3 hours or more in this",
          "On the recommendation of our hotel\u2019s concierge desk, I spent a full Friday enjoying this aquarium with my eight-year old niece. We arrived in the spacious and free parking lot just after the venue opened, at 10 AM, and left literally as it was closing at 4 PM, so we certainly",
          "Ok so they don't have any penguins, but they do have a lot more. This is different to other aquariums I've been to, (it has most things you'd expect - fish etc) it has space, lots of it. Young children can get pretty bored walking around inside large buildings - not the case",
          "I've been to Quebec City many many times, but this was the first time I decided to go to the Aquarium (having kids will do that!) I should have gone before (even without the kids!) This is a great aquarium. I've never seen polar bears and walrus so close up. The shows were good",
          "This aquarium is great for children. The exhibits and staff are well orientated to the needs and abilities of visiting children. This is one of the most family friendly attractions I've seen outside of the US. The animals are enjoyable, we viewed the seal performance twice",
          "I went to the aquarium this weekend, it was not a good experience.The pools for the outdoor exhibits were not clean and had algae in them. The space provided for the animals seemed inadequate. The inside tanks were poorly lit and had a brown algae growing inside them so you had",
          "Although the jelly fish exhibit is spectacular I can't say anything else positive. Sad polar bears pacing....",
          "I went to Quebec on a business trip and had a day spare. It had snowed quite a bit so there weren't many options for us. My colleague was particularly excited about visiting the aquarium and I just joined him along. Turns out I got more excited than him once we entered! The",
          "We spent a very enjoyable couple of hours at the aquarium with our 2 young children (7 & 5 Yrs Old). If they were a bit older, we could likely have spent another hour, as there was a seal show coming up later. The polar bears were a real highlight. One of them only walked",
          "We were tourists staying in the center of Quebec, so visiting the Aquarium required a 15-minute taxi ride each way. However, even though some of the outdoor attractions and restaurants were still closed for winter in mid-April, we appreciated what was open to see. The indoor",

          "I don't really like fish, but I was wowed, with the selection of marine life indoors and the polar bears and the Walrus show outdoors. I enjoyed the jellyfish tanks the most, very decorative and relaxing to look at. You can pet the sting rays, and even have lunch on the sight.",
          "We went on Semaine de Relache to visit the Aquarium of Quebec.....it wasnt as good as many aquariums we have visited, maybe becuase its all snowed and cold and you can't really enjoy the attractions at -24C LOL inside displays are small and cramped but beautiful and its always",
          "My husband and I have visited many different aquariums across the world and we were very impressed by the Aquarium du Quebec. A short drive from the city, the site has plenty of free parking and was not hard to find. The most impressive exhibits were definitely the walruses,",
          "This place is pretty cool if you're up to seeing more than just fish. They have a bunch of outdoor animals as well. The most impressive part of this was the jellyfish walls!! They were so mesmerizing you honestly could just stay there all day watching them. Great experience !!",
          "We went here for the light show over the holidays. We did not expect to see any animals as it was nighttime. To our surprise, we were able to see several, including polar bears. There was also a slide and a bounce house for children.",
          "We visited the Aquarium on December 30th 2013 during very cold -18c. weather. The place had lots to offer and was worth the trip that we took with our two boys aged 10 and 14. Some of the attractions are outdoors so best to visit when it is not this cold, as it is currently.",
          "All 3 generations of our family enjoyed this excursion. The highlights of our visit were the manta ray touch tank, the jellyfish exhibit, the polar bears, & the walruses. The jellyfish exhibit was fantastic, and we have seen lesser exhibits of this type in large cities, so",
          "We spent a few hours at the aquarium with our teenaged boys. We all enjoyed this little aquarium quite a bit. It is always interesting to see jelly fish and the way they have set up that part of the aquarium is very interesting. I loved seeing the polar bears and we were able",
          "My husband and I went to the aquarium to check it out, just for something to do. Maybe it was because of the time of year, but it was a ghost town inside there... The animals had decent enclosures but they seemed a little dirty and unkempt... The polar bears just looked sad.",
          "I was initially concerned that this aquarium would be too small to be worth our time, but I'm glad I was wrong. The exhibits are very well designed and maintained. My kids loved every minute of it! I come from a town with a large aquarium, but I don't normally get to see seals,",
          "We really enjoyed the aquarium, particularly the seahorses and jellyfish. The audio in that exhibit really added to it and very few aquariums showcase such a range of these two specimens. We were lucky enough to go at feeding time mid-afternoon and saw the walruses and seals",
          "It is a good time for kids and adults. Take the whole day I arrived very late and i didnt see most of the place love the animals show. Will be back",
          "This is a must. There's just so much you and your kids can learn at this place. Species from all over the world. Don't miss the opportunity to touch the rays, I mean, if you're not allergic to shrimp! See the schedule for the show with the seals, and encourage your kids to take",
          "A good place for relaxation and for learn more about life and the respect for animals! Ideal place to bring children and learn them about that life, the underwater life and much more... We saw a good spectacle with walruses and seals... Maybe people expect more, but I think",
          "I visited this place four years ago. This time I traveled with my two young kids (aged 3 1/2 and 1 1/2). I noticed that they added the park whereas the exhibition section is largely unchanged. But this is exactly what I expected. I choose this place because of my younger kids,",
          "We went with my teenage children and overall they enjoyed the place but for me there were some highlights but most of the place was average. The jelly fish exhibit was really neat and interesting and worth a visit, The Walrus show was fun but the seal show was average. We",

          "This has few fish but great jellyfish rooms, and terrific playgrounds for children as it is an Indoor/outdoor experience designed for elementary aged children. For adults, definitely pass it up. or families with small children, you can spend the day here as the kids have lots",
          "Like others who have commented, I was saddened and shocked by the condition of this tourist attraction. It appeared that the grounds were more maintained than these poor animals and fish. The polar bears are living in deplorable conditions. I watched one bang its head and body",
          "This is our third aquarium visit on our two week trip (NE Aquarium and the Oceanarium in Maine also) and this one was pretty good. The price was excellent and by far the best was the walruses. Get there at 9:15 to see them feeding and training them. That was a real treat. The",
          "I had expected more since I had heard good things about the aquarium but was disappointed. The polar bear enclosure was very sad. The one bear we saw seemed distressed and it's surroundings were depressing. There were two small owl enclosures, one with two dead trees. It's",

          "The polar bear enclosure is horrific. I cannot believe that in this day and age people would be so cruel as to confine an animal as large and grand as a polar bear in such a tiny and unnatural space. One of the bears clearly is suffering from severe anxiety. I watched him",
          "This aquarium was fantastic. The walrus and seal shows were fun. The display aquariums inside were amazing for the sheer variety of species, and sizes. The jellyfish collections were stunning especially with the changing LED light colors and ambient music in the background.",
          "It may be because I live near Baltimore and have seen an amazing aquarium that I was quite disappointed with this one. The polar bears need much bigger pools. Since my child is a teenager, all of the playground extras were irrelevant for us. Several of the exhibits indoors",

          "I visited the Quebec City Aquarium today with my two children, aged 6 and 8.5. The aquarium was interesting, but nothing spectular. We have seen similar displays elsewhere, and so while certain fish (sea horses and jellyfish) caught our attention, we quickly moved through the",

          "There is lots to see. It did not take us long to go through - maybe 2 hours when we had planned a 4 hour stay. I would think that in the summer 4 hours would be more reasonable given the splash park for the kids and you could pack a lunch. The children most enjoyed the outdoor",
          "I didn't know it existed until recently, and will now talk about it for years to come. My kids, 2 boys aged 2 and 4, absolutely loved it. There were so many things to see, from the walrus, to the polar bears, to the harp seals, the tigers and the beautiful colourful fish. We",

          "Even on a rainy day we had a most wonderful time! All the shows were wonderful and the outside display of the walrus, seals and polar bears were great. The food area had a great (nutritional) selection, the staff was nice, and there was a good balance of what you would expect",
          "Enjoyed a rainy morning at the Aquarium. There are two main sections - the first housing a collection of fish in a multi-storey complex and the other (outdoors) housing walruses, seals and two polar bears. Eddie the polar bear was extremely social, coming right up to the glass",

          "We spent about 3 hours here and enjoyed the show, in English and French. We saw quite the walrus show and also saw seals, many fish, jelly fish (a real neat exhibit that is brand new!!) and of course the Polar Bears! Very family oriented and lots to see and do!!",

          "Cons (yes, first): Only after we bought the expensive tickets did they tell us there was only an hour to go to closing. Very little English (yes, I know it's Quebec). Pros: Nice Walrus show, nice polar bears, very friendly staff. My girls loved it. Recommend: go no later",
          "The polar bear, walrus and seal shows were great. They were about 15 minutes but 90% in french which I don't understand. They trainers invited any English only speaking folks to ask them questions after the show which was helpful. There were artic foxes there too and they",

Interactive stuff is fun (touch annemonies and some very freindly stingrays) Walruses are awesome and the arctic foxes are adroable. Jellyfish under color changing LEDs is really mesmorizing. Worth it just for that. 10/10. Will be back again.",

          "Great place for kids, surprisingly big aquarium. It's been recently renovated and very enjoyable place to spend a day. No good food options and pretty busy during summer time. If weather is nice - it can serve as park, kids of all ages going to like it and I would go more than once, well done.",
          "Most beautiful aquarium I've ever seen",

At the time of my visit, the polar bear exhibit was under reconstruction, so I was unable to see that portion.",

          "Decent aquarium, best part is the jellyfish display where the lighting colors change in the tank.  The polar bear exhibit is being remodeled so didn't see that.  Small aquarium compared to the Baltimore or Atlanta aquariums.  But if you love to visit them, make the time while in Quebec.",

I came the afternoon after Labor day and all the restaurants were closed and they were clearly in maintenance mode. I don't know why they were even open.",
          "The polar bear exhibit was closed while we were there but otherwise it was a nice day spent at the aquarium. Great place to spend if it's a rainy day. Lots of hands on activities and a little park for kids. I loved their jellyfish exhibit, a really cool set up to it :)",
          "an interesting place, should go in early to watch the seals feed",
          "Something for everyone, great space for kids to visit and play. Aside from the shows and aquarium, there is a playground and splash pad. Lots of running space and we'll thought for toddlers. Bring your own lunch, food there is pricey and lack of choice.",
          "A family favorite, water games are a bit lacking but the parc is well setup (just lacking shade) and the view of the bridges and St-Lawrence river is AMAZING. The animals never disappoint and there is enough to do inside that even if it is really hot or cold out you will be fulfilled by what is indoors.",

There were a lot of species in display and interesting facts to go along with it. The place was relatively clean. Didn't feel too bad about the poor animals who were in captivity.",
          "Great place to bring children and learn about the St Lawrence River. There were a few exhibits that were closed that detracted from the experience. There are a lot of outdoor exhibits, bring sunscreen and water on hot days as shade is limited.",

          "Really nice place. Really good species collection and really well presented. The underwater tunel is amazing.\n\nIts both outside and inside and right by the river so if you go during the winter dress warm especially if you bring kids.\n\nIts also a sanctuary so you know the admission fee is for a good cause.",
          "Great experience with kids of ANY age. It is the perfect size for a 2 hour experience and so reasonably priced. Highly recommend. Note, I was not aware a portion of it was outside and not dressed appropriately. So if you are going in the dead of winter like I did, dress for outdoor exhibition.",
          "Absolutely love it! My kids had a lots of fun!!",
          "Awesome place to leave your kids in awe! Discovery, outdoor playground, diverse activities, great animations and passionate people (never have starfishs been described with such love!). And the yearly pass (daily pass is 20.50$ and yearly is 50$) is a true incentive for locals to just go there for an afternoon.",

          "Lovely aquarium. The jellyfish room was amazing. It was cold so we didn't do much of the outdoor activities. We loved the Arctic Fox!!!",
          "Excellent place !! Kids had fun looking at the beautiful and colorful jelly fish. Great place for family. A must visit in Quebec!",
          "At first, I doubt it would be a good idea to visit the Aquarium in winter, but it is good to. Only the exterior may be a little more challenging because of the cold weather, but everybody could get much fun. The activities are as usual educative and nice to do.",
          "Nice place for a day with the kids. As a tourist attraction I would skip it.",
          "Beautiful areas to visit with many kinds of fish and animals. Easily cramped in certain areas and not easy to see all the tanks wen theres alot of people",
          "All the animals looked depressed, the jellyfish looked cool. Habitats were way too small",
          "Everything one could ask for in an Aquarium.   Well laid out, and a lot to see.  The kids were happy with all there was to offer.",
          "Fun place to enjoy and learn about life underwater. Interact with sea creatures like starfish and stingray. See polar bears and arctic foxes outside. Enjoy the glowing jelly fish. Good place for a family outing",
          "Our kids loved the experience. The outdoor gardens, climbing ropes and playground in combination with the touching stations for the fish and stingrays were amazing.",
          "We went for the Festilumieres, the aquarium website showed something very different than what we encountered. The only way I can explain it is, when you drive around at Christmas time looking at houses decorated. Except that's for free and \u2026",
          "Fun spot for the kids. Enough interesting displays. A little sad for the seals/walrus. Was close to 40 degrees when we went in July. Polar bear display was under construction so we missed out on that.",
          "Was an ok experience wish there was sharks and wales also i was very excited to see polar bears but it was closed for renovation wish i knew that before hand",
          "We liked it- especially Boris the Walrus the Jellyfish and all the fish in the large aquarium, as well. They are making a wonderful new Polar Bear habitat- twice the size as it was; however, I think Boris and his mate need a larger tank, too.",
          "Good place for a family outing, well structured for kids of all ages, convenient for picnics. A few land lubbers as well as marine animals. The jellyfish exhibit is really nifty.",
          "Well laid out and good exhibits. The polar bear habitat was being updated and I would have liked the whole place to be bigger but still good value",
          "Fun for the family and not over priced in my opinion.  Take about 2 hours to do fully with a 10m/o but at that age I'm not getting any questions so with a 5+ y/o i would say 4 hours so you can take in the 'meet the animals'",
          "Enjoyed the time in aquarium. Rainy day did not ruin the fun.",
          "It was super fun! There were some very pretty and cool sea creatures. Unfortunately the polar bears were out when I was there so I didnt see them, but there are different pavilions with different kinds of animals and I really liked the deep \u2026",
          "This place was really cool. I had a great time seeing many things that I don't think we'll ever see again. The people were really friendly and it was very reasonably priced. The one thing I didn't like about this place was that they don't have any huge animals like sharks and whales. They do have walruses though.",
          "Good place to go with family. Lots of fish, including aquarium tunnel. Great place for pictures, and we really enjoyed the playgrounds with activities.",
          "Well done....lots to see and the jelly fish exhibit was really nice.",
          "Wasnt as cool as I thought it would be, but it was pretty heckin fun. I liked the deep sea part best of all. And they had pretty fish, and seals.",
          "Not a very well run attraction. Many of the animals looked sick, or about to die. Very little staff around, so not a lot of information, other than the sparse signage. Also, it's pretty small, we did the entire property in about 1.5 hrs.",
          "Place is good, but don't really think it's worth the pay.",
          "It is a generally loud environment when filled to the maximum. It's a nice family outing. It could be improved by being extended with more exhibit.",
          "Beautiful location, plenty of activities for children. Rest area and play grounds. Variety of food options for different taste budget.",
          "This place was really cool, got to touch a stingray.  The Jellyfish exhibit was also really neat.  There's lots of fun stuff for the kids.",
          "Very nice experience we've had. That day it was about 10 celcius but no matter what they were outside feeding the walruses and explaining the visitor lots of different things about walruses. Very interesting and a nice variety of fish and other sea animals.",
          "Place was too crowded. The tunnel sucked. The animals looked sad :( Cool jellyfishies tho.",
          "Lots of fun, doesn't fill the whole day for adults (likely would with children), but a great half-day!",
          "Even though we got there late it was fun for my daughter which we got to see some of the animals but that also give us an opportunity to go back and enjoy it more especially with the views at the look out points.\ud83d\udc4d",
          "Great place to bring the family if you're visiting Quebec! Several outdoor exhibits to see seals, walruses, polar bears, and arctic foxes. They also have a fabulous jellyfish exhibit and a touch pool for the rays",
          "A wonderful experience, friendly staff. It was awesome!!! I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone",
          "Excellent for familly outings. Fun for everyone at a good price. Food is good. The jelly fish exhibit is beyond nice.",
          "Amazing place. A must see",
          "Although not as big as expected, it is a nice aquarium should take about 2 - 2 1/2 hours to go through all the exhibits.",
          "Nice aquarium with lots of animals. They have a Halloween event every year that\u2019s fun to attend as well.",
          "Wow! Great place for family, kids, and friends!!",
          "The touch areas are really awesome. Lots of English information for out of town travellers",
          "Great place. Easy walking around. Able to get up close.",
          "Its a smaller aquarium, but what they have is done really well.  Its in a natural park setting which is different and better than most other aquariums",
          "Such sn amazing place!",
          "Could've been better. Parking was full and too much people for the space",
          "Nice place with many creatures. A lot information about St Laurence river.",
          "This place is fantastic. My son couldn't get enough of the jelly fish and petting the manta rays. A great place for any visitor in town. We were only disappointed we weren't able to see the polar bears as the enclosure was being renovated, nothing on the website mentioned it.",
          "a nice place to visit during summer as there is a lot of outdoor activities. during winter the outdoor activities are limited but still a good place to be. my 2 years old daughter loved it.",
          "Great spot to enjoy with the family, especially if you have little kids.",
          "Great place for outtings with family and friends my kids totally adored theyre visit going back for sure",
          "Loved the Aquarium du Quebec!  Wish the polar bear exhibit was open, but they are under renovation.",
          "Nice place to go with your entire family. Lots of things to watch and learn.",
          "This was a five star experience. Great shows throughout the day. Lots of different displays and interactive areas. The jellyfish display was particularly awesome. We had no kids and spent 4 hours here. With kids this could easily be an entire day.",
          "The kids will love it. And of you love animals you'll have a great time too.",
          "Fantastic place! It's a shame the polar bears weren't there when I went, but it was still amazing. The artic foxes, the walrus and giant octopus take your breath away.",
          "We visited on a rainy day and they warned us that the park is 40% outside. Despite the drizzle it was an enjoyable experience. The value was good for a family of five.  Active areas are available outside for children to blow off steam. Parking was free which was a really nice surprise.  The animals appeared active and healthy.",
          "A bit pricy for the amount of animals. But the place is really nice, the animals look well taken care of. Overall good experience.",
          "Has a wide variety of fish, including many salt water fish and fresh water fish. Though it gets pretty busy, I think it's worth going once or twice!",
          "Was able to see all the aquarium and had a good time. Lots of great displays and information. Entrainment for a wide array of ages.",
          "We visited during the Ontario March break and spent almost 5 hours enjoying all the exhibits.  We spent over 1 hour with the stingrays and were amazed over and over again by all the amazing sights to see.  Because it was Ontario March break there were no crowds or lines.",
          "They have owls too. Would be great if they had an entire reptile section. Kids had a blast.",
          "Not bad but the one in Montreal is way better. You will spend there no more than 1.5 hours without kids.",
          "Small aquarium but still fun to visit. I've been to the Toronto aquarium, Vancouver aquarium. This one is the smallest by far. But I still have a good time seeing the seals show and the polar bear. There's a nice picnic area for the family outside. Plan this visit on a nice weather, plenty of stuff needs walking and sitting outside.",
          "Great for all ages, also very educational and intresting especially the interactive activities.",
          "I don\u2019t recommend to go there. It\u2019s such a wasting time and money. They have to consider the entrance fee. I\u2019m so disappointed",
          "The exhibits look rundown and dirty. I felt sorry for the poor creatures instead of marveling at their beauty. The artic foxes in particular looked sickly.",
          "Wonderful! It's a good place to go with all the family",
          "Great Aquarium, especially that they let you touch multiple animals",
          "For me the walrus and jellyfish were the best. We are spoiled with larger aquariums in Monterey and San Francisco.",
          "Small but very well priced.  Toddler definitely approved.",
          "Fun indoor place to be especially when it is raining. Love the outdoor exhibits especially the white arctic foxes",
          "Fun place to visit. Lots of fish, jellyfish and other aquatic life to see. Also has an outdoor  play area for kids.",
          "Lovely excursion for the family! Many interactive things for all ages.",
          "I went here this past fall with my wife and kiddo.  We had a great time, the exhibits we're very interesting, andathere was plenty to do to easily fill a half day of exploring. We went on a weekday and it was not crowded at all so we were \u2026",
          "Love it beautifull but thw polar bear area was in renovation",
          "Wow! This place is soo cool. There is an outdoor trails with seals and walrus etc..and 2 indoor pavilions housing fish, rays, jellyfish etc.. There us even a glass tunnel through an aquarium. Amazing! Kids loved it. They got to touch the Rays. There is food onsite so you won't go hungry. Totally recommended!",
          "Staff is super nice, inexpensive, so much to see and do, perfect for families!",
          "Very interesting! Make sure you get there st least 2 hours before closing time to see everything.",
          "The light show in the evening over Christmas was good fun, as was the outside wildlife ! We fell in love with the pola bear playing with his snow shovel. The inside aquarium we found below average, but all in all wouldn't have missed it. \u2026",
          "It's pretty fun aquarium to be in. I've been to Quebec city multiple times and it's pretty fun every damn time I really enjoy myself",
          "Very cool aquarium. Kids loved going there and seeing everything.  The sting ray pond was exciting for them and they had fun touching them.  The best part was watching the sea lions for kids, they were thrilled just to watch them swim \u2026",
          "Nice place to gang out with kids. During summer, there is a park where they can play as well. Seeing the polar bears swim under water level, through window, is very impressive for young children. The walrus show is also very funny.",
          "Amazing place with lots of fun activities!",
          "Went their by chance.. a good time to spend out with family.. especially the gelly aquarium is awesome.. really want to see the lighted gelly fishes ones more..\ud83e\udd70",
          "Different locations on site and a nice playground and water park for the kids to wine down after the visit. Kids practically slept all the way home.",
          "One of the best places to visit and have fun time with family in Quebec!",
          "Very nice place! YOU CAN TOUCH THINGS! full of surprises 10/10 will go back.\nBe sure to go when it's nice outside, though.",
          "It is not a must do thing for first time Qu\u00e9bec visitors, but a nice place to kill time. Small, but interesting.",
          "Great place for family.   Well laid out.",
          "Very nice and would encourage anyone visiting Quebec, this is a must to see.",
          "Great experience for the whole family. Loved touching the rays and starfish!",
          "We loved touching the starfish, enemane, and Ray's!",
          "It's was great just didn't get the chance to see the bears",
          "You can be a keeper for a day.  The most amazing experience, Daila does this cute dance. But all the mammals have their personalities.  Do this once in a lifetime experience.",
          "Loved the place the kids had so much fun I will be back",
          "As parents of 2 kids below the age of 8, and coming from Ontario, we were looking forward to this visit. It so happened that it was a gloomy, rainy day in June that we went. The best thing to see was the jelly fish exhibit which is right \u2026",
          "Loved the variety of animals on display and thought there was a good amount of information posted to learn! Very educational and a fun way to spend a couple hours.",
          "Great place for a quick tour and the price is about right for what we can experience and see.",
          "I really liked the jellyfish exhibit in the aquarium. It was mesmerizing. The polar bear show was good as well although there wasn\u2019t an English version of the show when I went there. There are a lot of aquatic animals.",
          "Fantastic aquarium and a very decent price. A perfect place to spend a couple hours.",
          "Great little aquarium - perfect for some family fun. Staff are very friendly, helpful & knowledgeable. Well laid out with both indoor & outdoor exhibits. Lots of interactive experiences as well. The summer sand sculptures were a nice addition too. Excellent value for the cost.",
          "It was very nice. It's not too long however there are a few outdoor animals to see.",
          "I went there for the evening light show. I felt there weren't enough led lights. Some were not turned on...maybe they were burnt out? On a positive note, there were bouncy castles (excellent activity for kids to stay warm), lamp warmer, fire pits and a lil live concert.",
          "Such a nice experience!!!! The best was the seal show! Can\u2019t wait to take my brother!",
          "Good day outing and nice place to take the kids.",
          "Amazing experience",
          "We went on a rainy day, thinking it would be all indoors, so we didn\u2019t get to enjoy all of the outdoor areas and shops as much as we would have on a sunny day.  The cashier did let us know that 40% of the exhibits were outdoors, so I will \u2026",
          "Very nice aquarium. Well maintained and educational. Be forewarned that the exhibitions are narrated primarily in French so if you are not fluent you will miss a lot of what is being said. That said it is still very worthwhile.",
          "Beautiful, but can be cramped in some places and very loud because it's very popular. Still a lot of fun!",
          "This place is great! I especially love the jellyfish room. It was very well set up. There was a place where you could pet the rays and another way you could touch the starfish. Along with outdoor programs.",
          "Best part was the jellyfish and the stingrays \ud83d\ude01",
          "A nice little aquarium. Jelly fish were mesmerizing.\n\nThey allow you to touch some of their star fish on one of the floors. Also, they have \"meet our animals\" at some points in a day. Plan your trip including these hours. Particularly those arctic foxes, seals, polar bears and walruses would be enjoyable.",
          "Great times with a family crowd as there is lots to be learned. Those that appreciate sea life will love their extensive displays of jellyfish species and an amazing treat was they have nautilus and leafy sea dragons. Loved petting the rays \u2026",
          "It's smaller than the ones I've seen.  Well maintained and the animals look happy and well kept",
          "Really loved the deep sea Aquarium, great experience touching the rays.",
          "Beautiful outdoor and indoor setting, good experience for the whole family, with presentations and hands on experiences",
          "Very happy we had a chance to stop by, nice aquarium.  Easy to get to with a mix of indoor and outdoor sections.",
          "Wonderful aquarium with a great variety of wildlife, big and small. Not too big, so the whole family can cover it in an afternoon no problem. Good, if simple, meal options present, both indoor and out. One opportunity for improvement is to post a \"Quiet, please\" sign by the jellyfish.",
          "We came in July and found it to be a very, very busy place. Many people with kids and strollers. It was hard to get around on the inside and was quite small. The outdoor exhibits are good and it's a great place to take kids! We got through the whole thing in roughly 2 hours.",
          "It's small but great. Nice space for kids.",
          "Nice place. Good value for the $",
          "Terrible, very small hardly nothing to see, not clean and lots of dead fish floating in the tank. In and out in 20 minutes.",
          "Everything they said were going to be there was there. Went during winter festival and got to see all the winter animals. Was a great experience for kids of all ages and even adults.",
          "Don't forget that a good portion is outdoors, dress accordingly.",
          "Awesome for the kids and family",
          "Small aquarium with just a few animal attractions. Large tank with both fresh and salt water fishes show casing the fish from around the area. What I can add is that if you are looking to see the seals, walrus, and polar bear shows, plan to \u2026",
          "I visit the aquarium on the winter time and it is still a nice place to go with family and friend. The animals are very cool.",
          "The jellyfish tanks were amazing! A lot of activities for kids.",
          "The jelly fish building is so beautiful.",
          "Small aquarium with less animals to look at. We enjoyed our chance to look at polar bears & walrus. The aquarium needs cleaning. You cant really see the fishes and other animals as the glasses are not clean. A walk inside the jelly fish aquarium is good. We felt the animals needed more space than what they are in.",
          "Nice place, a lot of activities are outside so be prepared to bring a coat and gloves and umbrella in case of rain. The fish tanks were nice and it is a nice stop on your way out or in to Quebec city. It was nice to be able to interact with some of the marine life such as touch starfish and rays. It however is smaller than expected.",
          "It is like the low budget version of Toronto Aquarium.",
          "We loved this place, you can go underneath the aquarium as well as touch the starfishes by you hands...",
          "The Aquarium is very nice. It's very kid-friendly, but not boring for adults! The Tunnel, under the \"Ocean\" is just long enough, to be amazed, but not get claustrophobic. There are 2 areas, where one can touch, fish, seastars, crabs and small sharks. It is a bit on the pricey side, but I think it was well worth it!",
          "Affordable family fun. Just big enough to fill your day. There is also a splash pad and picnic area. Gift shop has reasonable prices.",
          "Great spot although many of the species are hard to spot in the winter. Also the interior could use a good cleaning.",
          "It was expensive and not very good. I wouldn't recommend.",
          "Really great, especially for young kids, but interesting for adults as well. While Quebec city is great for adults, a lot of the most interesting sites are not really exciting for children, and it's difficult to get a stroller around. The \u2026",
          "Absolutely loved our visit. Reasonably priced compared to other Aquarium adventures.",
          "Really good.place for kids but go during summer for more attractions. Price was reasonable",
          "Good aquarium but was surprised to see real live polar bears living outside. This is not their climate :/ they looked bored in their small enclosure. Where is the SPCA?",
          "Affordable and nice circuit",
          "Assistant there are very knowledgeable on theirs subjects and species diverse enough to spent 3hrs inside. Visitors can also remain outside all day long",
          "The aquarium included mammals as well, which was something unique about this place in my opinion. The jellyfish were my favorite! Very fun activity to do in Quebec!",
          "This place was okay.  No Polar Bears when I was there.  Good for kids.",
          "Good place to come with kids! L",
          "Good good fun for the whole family",
          "Nice aquarium! Three separate buildings to visit.",
          "Good for kids, lacks animations and interactivity with sea mammals. Some animals should not be there (polar bear for example) laying down at 40 degrees in the summer. Pricing acceptable",
          "That's a really sad place in my opinion... Too many fish per tank and the wild animal seemed really sad and crowed in the swimming pool...\nMoreover the outside decoration,aybe because of the long winter, was completely dry and dead.",
          "The outdoor animal exhibits were amazing.  Seals. Walrus, and polar bears.  Be sure to attend the polar bear show.   It was great.   Inside was abit tired and the walk through tunnel was so short, I'm not sure tunnel accurately describes it.  However the touch area was super ending with very active stingrays touch pool.",
          "Sea animals natural sight.  Amazing specially for kids. You might miss couple of shows if you visit in winter. But it was still ok.",
          "Lovely staff and the animals are adorable, I come for down under and it was a really nice change of pace. The tickets are well priced costing me and my friend (15 years old) about $11 each",
          "A fascinating place for young and old",
          "It's a nice aquarium, but it's small. It'll take 2-3 hrs if that to see the place, that's if you watch some shows. They do have some BBQ place to eat, but I didn't get a chance to eat there. The day we went, it started raining",
          "It was fun to see the seals, sea lions and polar bear. However, watching the main marine museum made me feel a bit disappointed like something is lacking.. Probably because the aquarium I have seen is too good in South Asian countries, or \u2026",
          "Had a fun time here. About 40% is outside so dress warm",
          "Love this place. The jellyfish area is my favourite. I only wished I lived closer.",
          "Nice place.  Small park but lots to do.  Good for younger kids",
          "Amazing displays and clean",
          "Very nice experience we've had. That day it was about 10 celcius but no matter what they were outside feeding the walruses and explaining the visitor lots of different things about walruses. Very interesting and a nice variety of fish and other sea animals.",
          "Went in the winter. Yes, the aquarium is a bit on the small side, but everyone there is wonderfull and the fish are put beautifully on display. Every habitat was expertly put together and all the animals were healty and active. Special \u2026",
          "Incredible place, such a beautiful fish they have, they seem to be happy over here! Recommended it (:",
          "Disappointing, over priced for cost of admission.\n\nThe so called \"ocean tunnel\" is a mere ~20 feet, L-shaped passage. All in all, if you want open space to let your monster kids run around, this is it.\n\nOtherwise, don't go. Won't miss much.",
          "There's a lot to see.. good place for all specially for kids... only downside price i'd said is a bit to much.. anyway that's my personal opinion",
          "I was expecting a bit more. But now that I think about it that was a bit too much to expect. It was a cool place though.",
          "Dont like animals locked up but other than that it was okay",
          "We had a great visit here with our granddaughter. Large enough for variety and small enough to see everything.",
          "Must see if you're in quebec! The pictures say it all",
          "This aquarium was reviewed to be a nice place to go with a family. When I visited I was extremely unpleased. They have animals that are being treated very poorly in almost every exhibit I saw.The area for the polar bears is on the side of a \u2026",
          "was nice but i wasnt expecting so much to visit outside and it was really cold",
          "Really nice! A heads up that several very cool exhibits are outside, so be sure to dress appropriately",
          "Very nice place. We had a lovely experience. The staff is friendly.",
          "very cool good for kids",
          "After reading some of the negative reviews I had my thoughts but was I wrong.  It was awesome.  My 2 year old loved to see all the fishes, polar bears and all other animals and creatures that they have.  We went on one of the hottest day of \u2026",
          "A nice place to spend some time. Clean and with lots of outdoor activities and exhibits to see.",
          "Beautiful exhibits, interesting even in winter. Can get pretty packed but overall a nice experience.",
          "This Aquarium came with a high rating, but in my opinion this place is very, very overpriced. Most of the indoor exhibits of the marine life are what you would find in other aquariums. The only things which were good were the outdoor ones, \u2026",
          "Great place to visit. Dress warm if visiting in the winter time!",
          "Very nice attraction and outside view of the St-Laurent",
          "Fun and moderatly priced. I visited Quebec city and loved this side activity.",
          "A little bite sad, I guess this summer will be better, I also notice that the area are way to small for the animal :/ hope there some upgrade soon",
          "Good place to visit but there are not enough washrooms here",
          "The aquarium du Quebec is a fair bit smaller than the Aquarium in Toronto we've been to both but a number of different exhibits the sea lions were my favorite while visiting the aquarium in Quebec you also get to go through four or five different buildings with various exhibits the little sea horses were especially interesting",
          "Size is perfect for a few hours of fun. Sea horses and jelly fish were main attractions for our kids. The jungle trail was a big hit with small kids, better than their park.",
          "My boyfriend went and visited Quebec for my birthday the aquarium was amazing we had alot of fun and even thought it was cold it was nice to see the animals outside also",
          "It's a pretty cool aquarium. I like that it's not just indoors but, you get to see the bigger animals like polar bears and seals outside. It was very crowded when I went so, going through the main tunnel of fish was a little annoying. Other than that, it was pretty cool!",
          "Quite good aquarium, with interesting location next to the bridge (good view and view point, nice place to take a photo). Good collection of jellyfishes, but aquarium is quite little I wouldn't say there are too much to see. And I was a bit disappointed how they keep polar bears..",
          "Great experience, wasn't expecting the insect festival, so that was a plus. Tried to get a season pass, but due to price changes I'll have to wait till another day.",
          "Nice aquarium. Worth visiting.",
          "Ist ok but not for long drive just for that do something else at same day  people nice there",
          "It\u2019s must  to visit once though most of glasses are old and not well maintain they need to upgrade \n\nNew side is far better with tunnel very small though \nIf you happen to reach at time of any tourist bus no\nPlace there \n\nWe love Jelly Fish \u2026",
          "Nice place for families!!",
          "Nice variety beautiful setting",
          "My kids had a wonderful time here.  It was walking distance from our hotel and the prices were reasonable.  The outdoor playcentre is a highlight, especially the ropes course that extends through an area with lots of shade.  The views and \u2026",
          "Great time with my 20 months old",
          "Only got to see the outside light show as part of the Winter carnival.   But looks nicely at up for the kids.",
          "Just like any other aquarium but 60% inside and 40% outside. Very nice place",
          "I know this place is typically for kids and families,  but I said what the heck always wanted to visit an aquarium. The pictures I posted was the only highlight of my trip. Why? Because the rest was very distasteful. I am talking about the \u2026",
          "Loved the jellyfish exhibits and how they have all sorts of interactive activities. The grounds themselves look great. My only complaint were some of the habitats for the animals seemed too small to me.",
          "Animals seemed well taken care of for the most part. I saw one blatantly ill fish the entire visit, which is pretty good considering he was in the most populated tank on site. The staff are friendly and the exhibits interesting.",
          "Loved the scale and landscaping.  Felt safe and family friendly.  My son could've pet the Manta rays for days.  Best touch tank ever.",
          "This is a great aquarium. The layout of the place is amazing. Some of the animals are inside and some are outside.\n\nIt's really family friendly. Shows are fun and informative.",
          "This is a nice aquarium. It has several buildings with a nice park experience to walk around. The exhibits are good and if you go slow and read everything and spend some time at each tank you can make a day of it. Having been to other \u2026",
          "nice but too small!",
          "Very nice be prepared to walk",
          "Truest a unique experience. Wish we would have had more time. Plan for at least 5-6 full hours to really take your time. See the exhibits and shows and have a great family experience.",
          "Had a great time\nKids will enjoy a lot",
          "It has nice selection of fishes, however smaller than Toronto aquarium.",
          "Nice place to visit. Summer would be more fun to visit.",
          "Great experience. Friendly staff. Outdoor and indoor exhibit. My kids age 12-17 really enjoyed it.  Staff were able to speak English to help us with our questions",
          "Jellyfish exhibit was amazing. Being able to see walruses and arctic foxes up close was great but walruses seemed confined. Very crowded on a Sunday.",
          "I really enjoyed going here, it is definitely one of those tourist points you have to visit at least once. They give you a different experience for every area of the aquarium, but definitely some of the best are the starfish and rays \u2026",
          "This is a really nice place to go if you're an animal lover. You can see they take really good care of them. Bring your kids they'll be amazed. There's a lot to see. \n\nEverytime I go there I'm glad and I will never get bored to go there. \u2026",
          "Visited in the fall with boyfriend and his parents. We enjoyed ourselves but next time I would prefer to visit in the summer as there is a fair amount of walking outdoors between attractions.",
          "Being able to touch the rays was great experience. Overall great place to observe and learn about various sea animals.",
          "Beautiful place! My favorite was the jellyfish area.",
          "Cool place. Tons of stuff to see, easy to move around. Did it in an afternoon!",
          "Beautiful fish inside but felt bad for the walrus he kept crying for his mate",
          "Was hoping to see more aquatic animals",
          "Do not go! I'll try to share the terrible experience I had. \n1st of all: they advertise the polar bear exibition but they aren't there and won't be for the next year. \n2nd. They don't tell you there are no polar beara, you just find out \u2026",
          "Great family activity. A winner every time!",
          "Really nice aquarium, is about 50% outside so dress for the weather.",
          "You should come and see this amazing creatures! There is no doubt, a super place to spend time with family!",
          "A great experience with so many exhibits. The jellyfish are beautiful! Staff is really friendly and knowledgeable, everything is kept really clean, terrific place to bring the kids.",
          "Amazing place.",
          "The aquarium was wonderful! So many interesting animals to see, both underwater and over. If you get the chance, donate to their ray conservation fund, because they let you feed the rays, which I call puppies of the sea! So cute! I think \u2026",
          "Amazing place!!! $67.27 for a family of 4. Free parking. Allows you to bring in your own food and drinks!! Highly recommend the place.",
          "Great for adults and children alike",
          "Nice place for a day out for kids.",
          "Very special unique animals but the facilities conditions are not appropriated for them ( too small )",
          "Very fun activity for kids and families",
          "Not worth $20/person. We arrived at the aquarium at 9:30, thinking they were open at 9 since it says so online. Turns out the aquarium opens only at 10. We went through every single exhibit in 30 minutes, and showed up at the seal exhibit \u2026",
          "Very beautiful, enough parking, comparing to Vancouver\u2019s and Toronto\u2019s aquarium this one is definitely a little smaller.",
          "The stingray exhibit was much worth this entry fee.",
          "Nice \nThey have a few things that you won't see anywhere but they don't have too much things",
          "I enjoyed this little Aquarium/Zoo! Great way to spend a few hours visiting with the polar bears to the jelly fish! They even have a little sea dragon!",
          "I really liked visiting the Aquarium! Free parking and fairly quick ticket sale/ entrance (vs Toronto one). I found that going through inside exbihition was a bit uncomfortable- it was pretty tight on space, so I felt very rushed and missed \u2026",
          "Beautiful - make sure you dress warmly if visiting during the winter",
          "Overall a nice place, not as big as I thought it was but pretty fun overall",
          "Nice little family outing for the morning, good for 2-3 hours (depending on your food requirements). More of a zoo and less of an aquarium than I had anticipated, but very cool little outdoor adventures scattered throughout for the kids. \u2026",
          "Great place! Love that it's outside as well as in!",
          "We went one afternoon.  Great layout. Easy to access. Fun. Kids liked. We Ubered out and cabbed back. Great for kids.",
          "It was a rainy day when I took my almost 2 year old daughter but the jelly fish and sea horses tank made for it. We were allowed to touch the sea cucumber, the sting rays and the anemones. Really friendly happy staff. I have never seen such \u2026",
          "We enjoyed our visit to this Aquarium very much. There is plenty to see with lots of outdoor habitats for the larger animals. The polar bears were very active swimming around and rubbing up against the glass right next to us. We arrived \u2026",
          "Go here. It is a unique experience that you will have as a lasting memory of your visit to Quebec City. Unlike many aquarium's this is a place that has about half of the exhibits outdoors. This is very important to know if you're planning a \u2026",
          "Fun to go with family",
          "If you have time to go, go. It was totally worth it.",
          "Amazing place",
          "Very beautiful. Staff was great. And the show was amazing and fun",
          "It was worth the price of admission. Note that you also did not have to pay for parking like some other events. The aquarium group ds were clean and the bonus was to see the sand carvings.\n\nThere was of course the fish and there was a open pond where you could tou h the Ray's.  Not the 12 foot kind. That was cool.",
          "We had an amazing experience at this aquarium! My daughter loved the animals especially the polar bears, walrus', and getting to touch the sting rays. The whole family had fun!! We be going back if we decide to visit Quebec City again!!",
          "Separate indoor and outdoor exhibits, the larger more interesting ones being outdoors, dress accordingly or you can miss out.\nFree parking",
          "To be honest - not the best aquarium. Nothing special really.",
          "Fun for the family big selection of fish to see",
          "Great place to visit with the kids but adults can enjoy it a well. The aquarium is split in three pavilions and the outside training areas. Also the staff is bilingual.\nThe jellyfish display was beautiful. There's a 3 story fish tank, which \u2026",
          "Kids swim for free in the sensory tank...if they are quick.",
          "Very nice place to visit. We really liked the experience.",
          "Worth the visit. Specially for families / visiting with kids. Several different sections covering different groups of aquatic creatures. Shows on pre-set times which are quite entertaining. I mean why not? Animals are always cute.",
          "Small place but great to keep kids busy. Bring swimwear for kids and/or adult you can cool off under sprinkles.",
          "We all just loved it. Perfect place to spend some time with your family and kids",
          "Although jellyfish house was very good the tunnel was bit short and disappointing but mostly my issues us with keeping polar bears in pens. It's an okay size but wouldn't say a good size. Just be cold in winter for them but been high 30s this summer. It's an alright aquarium but been to better",
          "Oh boy... pretty bad... it literally took my family and I one hour & a half to do the whole park. That\u2019s including play time at the park. \nThere were no shows going on, no life, just regular jelly fish & regular fish. It actually looks like the place is going to shut down. The only highlight was the polar bear.",
          "Been there for the night lights. Its nice but bring warm clothes",
          "Fish, great even in the cold weather",
          "Its good but i found it a little bit expensive, cause we have been in other for the same money and they are nicer",
          "My child and wife enjoyed it, small but nice aquarium where you can even have a pint of beer :)",
          "It was a nice place with lots of cool stuff to see! From plankton to walruses and polar bears. The layout was a good mix of indoor pavilions and outdoor sections.",
          "Passionate employees, very informing",
          "Good but not wow",
          "Fun attraction, a little spread out, but the loaner wagons for kids was great! The splash pad is a great thing to cool down on hot days, wish we would have had more time to see and do more.",
          "Beautiful exhibits and lovely grounds",
          "Great aquarium fishes from the Arctic to the Amazon",
          "Very good place. Will visit again.",
          "One of the must-see places in Quebec City. However, in order to see the polar bears, avoid visiting the aquarium when it's too warm outside.",
          "Fun! Mix of exterior and interior exhibits. Fun on a  nice day. The seals are amazing to watch. Try and find the zookeepers and follow them as they feed the animals. Entertainment for 3-4 hours.",
          "I liked this aquarium,beautiful fish,and tons of more animals.Though it would be five star if the place was less crowded.But really nice place to visit with your family if you want to go to a aquarium.",
          "This place is garbage, everywhere smells so bad. I don\u2019t think they do any cleaning around not even for animals.",
          "Our 2 year-old twins loved their first experience! Remember that they have a small water park (several sprays), so remember to pack swimming suits and towels!",
          "Awesome spot, walrus show was very entertaining. Kids loved it.",
          "We were cold and couldn't think of anything else to do so decided to go it's pretty cool nothing extraordinary but the kids will enjoy it. I did get to see a polar bear which was awesome. Follow me on Instagram for more travel tips faraliciousb",
          "Great experience, loved being able to touch some of the animals. Its not very big but everything is really nice.",
          "You have to walk outside so if weather isn't great you should dress accordingly, also the layout left us missing out on a lot. It was much smaller than we expected, especially for the price.",
          "The seal show was the showstopper. \nAmazing jellyfishes.",
          "Very good for kids and adults too. Don't miss out the shows with the aquatic mammals",
          "Bit hard to do in bad weather...exhibits and staff are great...good educational content for aqua life and Polar bears...arctic foxes...",
          "Smaller than i expected but nice",
          "Lots of interesting displays and inexpensive",
          "Really enjoyed it",
          "The inside aquarium was intriguing, and the outdoor designed swamp was fun, but the big mammal exhibits we're far too small for their size and the food area was very dirty. Outdoor exhibits in serious need of improvement",
          "Awesome place, a must go if you are visiting Quebec City",
          "Great place for kids with nice activities outside as well. You can easily spend the day there.",
          "This is a relatively basic aquarium but there are a few pretty interesting exhibits - I enjoyed the jellyfish and seahorse exhibits and info. Unfortunately the animal enclosures for the larger animals - polar bears and walruses - were on the small side.",
          "Great aquarium!  Worth the visit!",
          "We enjoyed are visit and kids loved it.",
          "Great spot for a few hours",
          "This place is Super Wow! We visited in late November and shared the whole place with maybe 10 - 15 other families. Fewer show times than in summer but there were no line ups and we were able to spend as much time as we wanted with each \u2026",
          "Polar bears were a must see, magnificent animal! Also definitely gotta check out the jellyfish, really cool!",
          "Loved this place",
          "The jellyfish exhibit was huge & beautiful, never knew there were so many different kinds! The staff are super friendly and eager to explain everything.",
          "Not many kinds of fish and marine lives , few washrooms compared to the visitors.",
          "nice place to take the family",
          "Great place to visit ..",
          "Very nice, a visit in winter.  Visited both inside pavillions and the outside animals, plus had lunch, took about 5h30...   \nNice displays. But make certain that you check ahead to see what will be openned, the polar bear enclosure will be \u2026",
          "Nice day trip on a rainy day - lots of activities for young kids",
          "good, not too big not too small. good price for family",
          "I really liked seeing the fish and other animals. The place is very well kept and had many different spots to visit. There were also presentations of the animal they had in the aquarium like seals, polar bears. It was nice to see them \u2026",
          "Very inspiring place but requires maintenance - some educational displays not working or incomplete, some fish seemed to be in rather poor conditions (eyes missing, fins damaged - maybe it's natural but it looks sad). And as a foreigner who \u2026",
          "I could spend all day in the jellyfish room.  Try and go during a feeding time, it's well worth it!",
          "Great place for everyone. Fun and educational",
          "If you enjoy the obvious suffering of creatures in poorly conceived and maintained enclosures then this place is for you. Free parking. Everything else is a disgrace.",
          "Decent amount of sea life and some reptiles and amphibians. Some shows available. Worth a stop if you're in this area.",
          "Lot of people during the summer. Lot of child activities. Sometimes there is special expositions. The yearly pass is a good value.",
          "The polar bears aren't there. Other than that it was smaller than expected only took 1h15 to see it all.",
          "Old and run down. Kids were sad to see the animals kept in what appears to be dirty conditions. The Jelly fish display was neat and brought it up a star",
          "Had visited the aquarium about 20 years ago and wow, has it changed! Will need to go back again during the winter!",
          "I loved it. It was just great. Y'all should really go",
          "Pretty lights",
          "I love this place! It's a shame that it was pouring rain the day that we went because 40% of the exhibit is outside. We stayed for 2 hours, but if the weather had been nicer, we would have stayed all day. The polar bears and the walruses \u2026",
          "It's critical that you call ahead in the summer and find out when the school kids will be there. The aquarium was overrun on the day we were there. Exhibits were fine. The outdoor exercise area was a huge hit with the kids in our group. You can bring in your own food and drinks in a cooler.",
          "Zoos are educational but sad at the same time. It was nice to see the animals moving around though and playing with their toys. The polar bears were the highlight. You can touch the sting-rays and make a donation to feed them a little fish. \u2026",
          "Love it. I really hope the larger animals have somewhere else to go though after hours.",
          "We visited the Aquarium of Quebec lot of fun",
          "Small, with a couple of nice exhibits. Not worth the drive we took after seeing the Toronto aquarium or Boston. Children were not impressed and whole family was quite bored!",
          "Wonderful place to entertain the kids on your Qu\u00e9bec trip. My personal favorites: the foxes and the underwater tunnel. Don't miss the coffee shop at the entrance of the acuatic part.",
          "nice place to visit.  we had good time",
          "It's a cool place to spend weekend",
          "Pretty neat place. Love the jelly fish display. The polar bears were active and the silver foxes were adorable!",
          "It was bigger than I expected. Lots to see outside. hopefully will be back in the summer.",
          "Lots of fun for the family. Enjoyed the polar bears and the kids loved petting the stingrays.",
          "Affordable price for a family of 4 and you can barrow strollers and wagons for no charge. Lots of species of fish. It has different buildings so ideal for all weather's.",
          "The aquarium is well designed and informative about its exhibits. Great place for families and individuals with reasonably priced tickets & passes, a cafe, washrooms, and wi-fi. There is also a space where you can touch the manta rays!",
          "Owl was not here in October, very sad :( walrus was great though!",
          "Great aquarium experience for the young and old alike! Make sure you hoot at Stewart.... He'll hoot back!",
          "Great fun! Spotless, well maintained. Signs of construction, and growth. We will be back again!",
          "General aquarium. A little bit on the small side compared to other aquariums I've visited, but each building is separate and made to be like a public park, which was nice to walk around. The admission prices were also quite fair and inexpensive. Good place to take kids for a couple hours.",
          "Nice place to hang out for the day. The jellyfish area was the best.",
          "Small aquarium. Some exhibits were empty. Not as clean as other aquariums I've visited. Nice day with the kids.",
          "Great time would definitely do it if you haven\u2019t everything in French ( we are in Quebec) but still enjoyable",
          "Excellent nursing room",
          "Great experience. Girls loved petty the sting Ray's the best.",
          "Kid friendly. Good food.",
          "Cute little aquarium",
          "It is amazing...",
          "Good venue for small kids. Sea horses and petting the rays were our highlights. As others have noted, you will spend a good deal of time outside, so be ready for that if you go in the winter. Signage could be better on the grounds. ",
          "Lots of fun for the kids. Admission is very reasonably priced!",
          "Great visit!",
          "Beautiful place, lots of interesting things to see and good value for the price. Easy to get  to and free parking.",
          "The was amazing",
          "We had a great time visiting from Windsor, ontario!! A great way to spend the day",
          "Fun. Saw fishes that I have never seen in my life",
          "Good place but walk way under water is small.",
          "Perfect locarion to bring your family to see fishes, polar bear and other sea creatures.",
          "Awesome place!!!  Much bigger than what I expected, lots of different activities for the family.  You can spend 4 to 5 hours here without even noticing it.  Interactive displays make for even more fun.  Bonus: cheap activity for the family",
          "Great place to bring the whole family, some of the indoor aquariums are kinda tight if it's as busy as it was for us.",
          "nice medium sized aquarium\nentrance fee is fare\nthey have a nice picnic/play area for children",
          "Drove down from Ottawa.  Had a great time!  Not a big place but still worth the visit.",
          "I liked it in general, but it lacks in shows, variety and gastronomy. I will not visit again.",
          "Fun place to visit with a wide variety of things to see. The kids really enjoyed the tunnel! Things to improve: \n1. The information panels don't always include the native range of certain species.\n2. The coffee is AWFUL! \nMy son wanted to \u2026",
          "Unfortunately I was very underwhelmed at the aquarium. Admission was very high, over $20.00 for an adult. However the jellyfish area was incredible.",
          "Alot of things to look at",
          "A beautifully presented Aquarium is just the start to this attraction.  It also has lots of outdoor features including polar bears, a huge seal habitat, lots of walking trails, splash pad, and an activity challenge trail.  Beautiful view along the St Lawrence River too.  Do not miss it!",
          "Not too big ..... but good enough for one visit",
          "The inside was nice but the outside sucks, don't recommend that you take your kids in the winter time, I find it will be a waste of money.",
          "I liked the outdoor part more than the indoor aquarium. don't miss the feeding shows happening. Indoor aquarium is a small compared to other aquariums. The kids can interact with some animals. I like it in general.",
          "Not super large but very satisfying. They have dual carts to take the smaller kids much faster than using your own stroller. Walruses, polar bears, sea lions, jellyfishes and even a blue macaw. If you are into touching animals, hit the stingrays' pond! ",
          "Really cool! My girlfriend surprised me here while we were in Quebec city and We had such a blast! The polar bears and artic foxes were mesmerizing! Excellent jellyfish exhibition and you can also touch the sting rays as well! Highly recommended for all age groups!",
          "Looked small at first but had a blast and loved the outdoor animal parts too.",
          "Perfect day with the family specially for the little ones, they had the best fun ever...",
          "Great place to visit with kids! We spent 3 amazing hours.",
          "Great place to go with kids.",
          "Really cool place to see",
          "It is a very nice place to visit and spend a weekend lot of stuff to do inside and outside",
          "Smaller then expected. Easy to walk around. The mammals were pacing around their cages made me think that keeping them in an enclosure was a inhumane situation.",
          "Little bit small. This aquarium is amazing the touch tanks were excellent and the exhibits were well kept.",
          "Friendly attentive staff make this little gem even better. Plan 3 to 4 hours to see everything including the shows, which include seals, walruses and polar bears.  Great jellyfish exhibition too. The grounds are very well kept and we're the icing on the cake. ",
          "Nice aquariums. Amazing seal show. They have a tunnel in the water which is REALLY short but looks amazing. Great to spend all day with family and friends",
          "Excellent family destination. You can bring your own food, visit the premises, attend shows with walruses, polar bears and seals. Great playground for the kids... a must when visiting Quebec City !",
          "There were hardly anyone here when we came (in the winter), but I imagine there to be more people in the summer? The aquarium is fairly large, and kind of strike me as a small zoo more. First time seeing foxes in an aquarium, but definitely the highlight.",
          "Great place to visit!",
          "We loved this aquarium",
          "The facilities and enclosures are old and need some improvements, but they have a great collection from freshwater and saltwater environments.",
          "Amazing place",
          "A nice place for your kids",
          "I'm sorry to give a 3 star cause when you had went to Toronto Aquarium. You will find this one in Quebec is too small and not much to see.... \ud83d\ude13",
          "It was cool, not the best but still legit.",
          "Nice variety of sea creatures to see all year round. Better in the summer though for outdoor barbeques and other activities.",
          "Nice aquarium. 2 hours can cover everything. Must see the jellyfish.",

          "Place was mobbed with children that I was constantly almost stepping on literally, and like water they would flood and fill in all spaces. They were cute though and hilarious as well.\n\nThe tunnel under the tank was difficult to see as you \u2026",
          "I actually would prefer to the Aquarium de Quebec 3.5 stars but since that option isn't available bump it up to 4 for friendly staff. Important to note is that it's an indoor and outdoor place, more like a Marine World type place than just \u2026",
          "Fine, but shorter than expected.",
          "Lots of great exhibits and lots to do for all ages. Definitely watch the shows. We watched one with seals, and another with polar bears. One thing to note - most of this facility is outdoors, with a few of the buildings having exhibits that \u2026",
          "It's not that big, but still has enough to spend a day there",
          "Was a little disappointed; it's pretty small but well-maintained. Food and drinks are at a premium, as is the theme for most tourist sites, but not overly so. Overall a good trip, but not particularly one I'll remember.",

          "Lovely day out. Very child friendly",

I joined two different tours (\u00ab This is our Story \u00bb and \u00ab History of Quebec \u00bb) and both were amazing.",
          "We thought this was a museum for adults but it was really geared toward small children. Plus half the exhibit space was special exhibits that were paid for separately so I don\u2019t really know what we were paying for. All in all it was pretty boring.",

          "This museum is a must for us on every visit. They do a great job of providing something of interest for the whole family. Exhibits are well-organized, interactive usually, and a manageable size. Food is good in the cafeteria (a bit expensive, like all tourist spots). The",
          "Many thought provoking exhibits that were mostly well design. The history of Quebec was the exception with a difficult lay out and gaps in the timeline (little mention of the events of the british conquest) To me this lies in the same class as things like the Peabody Essex",
          "This museum is well you your time and $. We were told two hours would be plenty, but it is not nearly enough. The Canadian History exhibits are great and extremely well done. We especially enjoyed the Native Peoples exhibit. The 'Head in the Clouds' exhibit, which is there now",

          "The permanent exhibit on the First Nations is really informative, beautiful and a bit sad, too. We saw a fascinating exhibit on poison called Venom. Nice places to eat and have a coffee.",
          "We enjoyed the museum and barely scratched the surface in 2.5 hours here. Older kids will love the lab in the basement. The venom exhibit was top notch. Highly recommended!",

          "This was a great guided tour of the exhibit on poison. The French tour I was on had only 3 other people so it was almost private. I learned a lot about Darwin and Dinosaurs as well as the evolution of toxins and poisons. Isabelle made the tour very dynamic and she really knew",

          "lots to see and enjoy - for grown ups and kids alike. I happened to love the First Nation part in particular since we have been to the Canadian High Arctic and learned a lot about them and their plight -past and present. Exhibits change so inquire what is being offered before",
          "I went to the museum to learn about the history of Quebec, and it was very informative, but a bit dry, for me. I enjoyed much more the temporary exhibits (photography, fashion and an exhibit about perception). I also very much enjoyed the \"First Nation\" exhibit.",

They covered everything from the traditional way of life and how they live",

          "The mix of new and old objects in the \"Secrets Uncovered\" exhibition was unexpected, some of the objects have a little video explaining how they were used, for example the snowmobile with propeller. The \"2000-Year-Old Double\" exhibition was also great, but ends May 12th. I found",
          "This museum got a lot of hype from family and we were kind of underwhelmed. Very much appreciated the First Nations exhibit and how involved the indigenous groups were, but it was a lot of the same throughout. The Quebec history exhibit also was very long and not very dynamic. I",

          "We go to the museum a couple of times per year. Always worth the time. The permanent exhibits are very interesting and the last one we saw on London was just great(it was interactive as well which was an added bonus). If visiting the city and time permitting (give yourself a",
          "I visited this museum on April 5, 2019. I visited 2 exhibitions: Secrets Uncovered and People of Qu\u00e9bec: Then and Now. Both exhibitions were excellent & very well done. It was a great learning experience. In terms of Secrets Uncovered you have the opportunity to see many items",
          "I am not huge into museums that are not art museums, however I found this one to be fascinating! It told a wonderful story of how Quebec came about, and included many artifacts from throughout its history. The museum didn't spare any details about its treatment of the native",

          "Throughout our travels we have been spoiled by visiting some excellent museums. This museum unfortunately is not one of them, the displays are static and not very engaging, thus more indicative of older museums than newer museums. Many of the displays are repetitive and some",
          "Good place to spend few hous. Each hall presents something different, like Canada History and what I most liked: First Nation and totens ( sacred object, or symbol that serves as an emblem of a tribe). When I have been there it was free entrance - 2015.",
          "Always a good way to spend a few hours away from the cold of winter or summer rains. The exhibits are interesting and present great stories or experiences that stick with you. This winter's London exhibit was informative and helped you get a feel for how the city has changed in",

          "This museum presents a number of permanent exhibits as well as some topical exhibitions, which are very well presnted and cleverly curated. The space is well layed out and easy to access and find your way around. Most components are across two levels. You will learn a lot about",
          "Spent several hours touring the museum, including a one hour tour with Lisa-Marie. She was knowledgeable & shared so many fascinating facts about Quebec\u2019s history. The special exhibit about London was also interesting with a good mix of history, music, art & fashion.",
          "A unique look at Canadian culture. We visited during the Christmas holiday so there were many children of all ages there. In the main lobby there was a terrific live singing show for the kids, but was certainly enjoyed by everyone. We enjoyed the varied exhibits and are glad we",

          "Some of the items were very interesting. The way the exhibition is set up is a bit un organized. Did not care for the England part. They did have a great activity arranged for the children. There was Alice in Wonderland singing group and stage. That was very well done.",
          "Every time I go to this museum, I'm amazed at the exhibits. The price for the four of us was very good and included the London Calling exhibit. That we were there when the Christmas Market was on was a total bonus. We enjoyed the scavenger hunt exhibit and the history of",

          "My last visit was mainly for the London Calling exhibition, which is on until March 10, 2019. It turned out even better than I imagined, cleverly showcasing the creativity of London from post-war period to today. The expected famous names in music and design are presented but",

          "We went to this museum because it was only a few blocks from our hotel and we happen to walk by it. The \"Observe\" exhibit was lots of fun, the \"2000 year old me\" had an interesting premise, but was lacked diversity. Because it is close to the holidays, there were vendors in",
          "Lots of exhibits and displays charting the interesting history of Quebec City and surrounding area. Well worth a visit any time your in Quebec.",
          "Although you can take both English and French tours you can just walk through and visit on your own. But plan on taking a long time if you really want to get the flavor of the place. It's full of interesting historical displays.",

          "To call this a museum of social history might seem little boring - let's say it is a wonderful repository of artefacts telling the story of Quebec's people and their history. It's set in the old lower town and the design of the building itself is very clever - from the street it",
          "I loved this museum. So many different areas of Canadian/Quebec history, including the Indigenous people, French Canadian Culture, and Quebecois language. There were great videos about the Indigenous people and also a great video about the Quebecois language, which is a must",

          "If you want to understand the history of Quebec go here. It is beautifully designed and encourages you to slowly absorb all the information you can. We were so transfixed by the indigenous people section we didn't hear the announcement they were closing. Our only disappointment",
          "We spent about 4 and a half hours here, and covered pretty well everything - which was a LOT. The special \"London Calling\" exhibit was really interesting, and the permanent exhibit of Quebec - Then and Now was very informative. The \"Observe\" rooms (interactive/clue-driven)",

          "As a history teacher, I enjoyed learn8ng more about Canadian history. I learned that the French Canadians refer to the Outcome of the French and 8ndian War as the Conquest. But beyond that there was much more. I highly recommend a visit to this museum.",

          "We came to Quebec in summer and winter. We didn't come to the museum in summer, but did in winter when we were looking for something to do inside. it met our needs well, but I wouldn't say it's the top thing to do in Quebec. It was pretty pricey, too.",
          "Went specially to catch up on some Canadian history. All the info was there but at times a little confused with the time line presentation Overall very interesting and certainly worth a visit to get up to speed",

          "Love those portions of the museum that tell Quebec's history, both in the 1600s and 1700s as well as its more contemporary culture (20th Century and current). A section on mostly ordinary objects offers a good look at Quebec's recent history and growth as a artistic and",
          "The Aboriginal exhibits were educational, descriptive and interesting to learn more about the culture, and current state, of North America\u2019s first inhabitants. The \u201cworld of emotions\u201d exhibit was thought-provoking, but, to us, laid it in a way that was hard to follow the flow",
          "We came here expecting to stay for around an hour but we ended up getting kicked out at 5 because we didn't want to leave. Extremely interesting insight into the history of Qu\u00e9bec from its discovery to modern day and even the future. The permanent exhibitions are excellent, full",
          "I liked several of the exhibits, especially that of first nations people, but the special \"London Calling\" was a waste. The audio tour via iPhone told you nothing. The augmented reality was likewise meaningless. But it's easy to navigate, has a nice cafe and gift shop.",

          "Visited this museum with my family of four, including kids 7 and 11, as part of a Canada vacation recently. I was a bit anxious on how well the kids would enjoy it. Before the trip, when the kids heard the name of the museum, they both BOOED (or went EWWW) because it sounded",
          "We didn't leave ourselves nearly enough time to explore this excellent museum. I can't comment on the London Calling part because we didn't both with that. We were just interested in learning more about Quebec and we did - about the indigenous people; about the development of",

          "We really enjoyed the history of Quebec and Native sections. Learned a great deal and definitely a must in the city.",
          "I spent over 3 hours in the Aboriginal people exhibit and could have stayed longer. This is a sensitive and impressive presentation of the aboriginal peoples of Qu\u00e9bec and their history. There is much to appreciate and to learn. Excellent all round and even better with the",

          "Although it has visiting exhibits from elsewhere, the main focus of this museum is on the history of Quebec City. In that regard, it was a bit disappointing, but its exhibits of early Quebec were really good. It tends to be a bit colonialist, and has some work to do on",
          "I went to La Musee specifically to see their exhibit on First People of Canada. Very interesting and informative. I have a special interest in Inuit sculpture and was delighted too see all the various artifacts of this culture. The exhibit was huge! I am so very glad I had this",
          "I was so incredibly impressed that this prestigious and somewhat stuffy history museum has an entire floor devoted to a children's play area. It has fun and ornate costumes for children and their parents to dress in, as well as a large play area with a slide and other fun make",

          "The Musee has turned into an annual tradition. London Calling this year was a great intro to everything London. Always something new to see, they offer tours that provide a nice overview and they have a new app that has an interesting augmented reality feature. Be sure to check",
          "I have never been made to feel as unwelcome with children as I was at this museum. Visited with two boys, 4.5 years and 23 months. In the first exhibit (ici Londres) a guide shouted at them for touching something even though there were no signs saying do not touch. She made it",
          "I really enjoyed the London exhibit. I arrived early when they opened and still had a line to enter. They had a waking tour which I should have done to get more out of it but I just looked around on my own. It was so hot out that many people likely had the same idea I had to",

          "We really enjoyed the museum as it has a series of temporary exhibits that kept it fresh and unique. We spent about 2 hours here. Some of the exhibits were just fun and quirky, while others were more traditional, which kept our interest.",
          "I visited last week with a school group and we were there for the reenactment session. I found it to be humorous, interesting, information filled, and kept the interest of the teens as well as the adults. I'd definitely visit again and would make time to see more of the museum.",

          "I really enjoyed this museum on a snowy afternoon in February 2018. My interactions with staff were positive. There are interactive elements in most exhibitions. I was here on a Wednesday from around noon until about 4:30, and that includes a coffee break in the cafe. For me, 4",

          "Stopped by on a recent trip to Quebec. While the museum does offer a chance to learn more about Quebec and Canada's history in general, it also explores the human experience, albeit with a Candian slant. I loved the exhibit on the brain, and don't miss The Dress of Nations. I",

          "We spent a couple hours at the Musee and though we only took in two exhibits, we were both educated and entertained. The Quebec history seemed like a natural place to start and we followed that with the Brain exhibit. We especially enjoyed the hands on activities in the",

          "The building itself initially captures your attention, but it is the standard of exhibits which impressed me, I particularly liked the history of Quebec from early times up to date. Many interesting incidents I hadn\u2019t heard of before. Also appreciated the Inuit art and history",

          "We thought this museum would have been amazing but the weather outside was so gorgeous that we decided not to spend as much time here. There seemed to be little that interested us when we were there so we spent our time outside instead.",

          "As someone who loves wandering museums, I was very disappointed by this museum's policy of having many of their exhibits off-limits to those who were not being led by a guide. This policy denies patrons the ability to spend as much or as little time exploring what is of interest",
          "There is something for everyone here. It's a beautiful space and was not crowded when we went. There did not seem to be a lot of material here. It was a quick walk through and was interesting. It was not expensive so if you are looking for something to do, it's not a waste",

          "I thought the museum was very interesting, with so much information that we didn't have time to do everything in one day.  What we did see was very informative about Canada history with its original people from the past.  I'm from the UK and was visiting Canada for Christmas and new year  ..",
          "A cool place to check out. I only went inside the lobby area, very nice, seating available, but a bit pricey. The next time I go, I will pay to go inside. Outside, up the stairs, there is a large seating area with very cool artwork. And very quiet, hardly anyone was there. A great place to check out the sights from up above.",
          "The special exhibit on curiosities of the natural world was great. The special exhibit on venom was also good. The best room, fabulous for kids, was Observe. Optical illusions, move by touch, move by sound, etc. The service in the cafeteria was slow, but the tomato soup was great. I definitely recommend this museum.",
          "Awesome museum. The permanent exposition is quite remarkable (for kids and adults). The other expositions are amazing and interesting. Worth the visit.",
          "Fantastic museum.  It is far better than I thought it would be.  The special exhibits are worth the extra money. We easily spent 4 hrs here",
          "Great museum! The exhibit with the history of Quebec was awesome and likely my favourite. Venenum and Curiosities was great as well and had a fair amount to showcase. I found the collections and artifacts to be small, but it is a smaller \u2026",
          "Great bilingual location! I only speak English and I could understand everything there. They have kiosks and a service desk to buy your tickets to give you options. Lots of interactive, informational and engaging exhibits and shows. I've \u2026",
          "We came by cruise ship and this was only a block away. So we stopped in...and stayed the whole afternoon. It was great! From the 'soft shell\" photos (people wrapped in their entire wardrobe) to the aboriginals' stories, wonderful.",
          "Nice overview of Quebec City history combined with a meaningful and well done view of native history in the region.  The extra exhibits we're great at the time of our visit.",
          "Good museum for those that want to understand history of Quebec.  Excellent docent tours.",
          "Interesting collection of exhibitions. I saw one ones on the development of Quebec, First Nations, and Toxins. The layout was not well indicated so working out where the entrance to each exhibition was located was a mystery tour. \u2026",
          "Great museum. Affordable (special price for students as well). When I went there was an exposition about poisons, it was really interesting. The permanent ones are great as well. Would go again",
          "Great museum, Affordable. Interesting collection of exhibitions. It is very big, One of the great museum of the city. The staff is friendly and professional. The museum is beautiful, such a great place for kids and adults.",
          "Such a lovely place. It is very big, and some of the expositions aren't as interesting, but the temporary ones were great! Furthermore, the architecture and design of the place is incredible.",
          "The Museum of Civilization is an excellent QC museum. \n\nThey have excellent exhibits on french history, culture, and the indigenous peoples of Quebec. \n\nIn the past they have had incredible exhibits such as virtual reality tours of the \u2026",

          "Really loved this museum. Went to the Herge exhibit. Really fun.",
          "Rude, militant and unfriendly museum guards. Mediocre hodgepodge exhibits, overpriced. Conveniently situated in the heart of tourist area within spitting distance from docking cruise ships. \n\nOn 25 August 2019 my family and I visited the \u2026",
          "Not very many exhibits. Overall relatively disappointing. \n\nAlso two exhibits film you, in one case the footage is on a screen even after you\u2019ve left. In another case you have no idea you\u2019re being filmed the entire time and see the footage \u2026",
          "One of the finest and most interesting museums that I have ever been to. You could easily spend all day at this Museum. I contacted the TV show Mysteries at the Museum to do a show on one of the exhibits. If you like museums then you'll love this Museum it is exceptional!",
          "Very cool history and culture museum. Makes you think.",
          "My husband and I visited this museum on our recent trip to Quebec City. It\u2019s an easy visit (not too large) with interesting exhibits to go through. The My 2000 Year Old Double was especially good. I also loved the exhibit on the native \u2026",
          "A good place where you can know about how quebec evolved as a city and how the lives of ancient qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was. \n\nA nice digital media museum which tells more about latest advanced technologies, social media trends and AI robotics. \n\nThere \u2026",
          "We were really disappointed. The exhibition about the aboriginal nations was decent. All the rest was just waste of time. There are some exhibitions which are not included in the regular entry fee which is frustrating. Too much of commerce and luck of creativity",
          "Very entertaining and not boring at all. It\u2019s a great activity to do while visiting Quebec City for people of any ages!",
          "One of the great museum of Quebec city. There is always many very good exhibitions.  The staff is friendly and professional. The place is well maintained and constantly renewing. It's particularly sweet during summer where you can eat \u2026",
          "Great family museum. Very interesting exhibits.",
          "The exihibits were good but there was a kids show in the entrance atrium which was unbearably loud and distracting.   The noise traveled to nearby exhibits. These kids shows should be done away from the visiting public who just want to see \u2026",
          "I cannot recommend this museum enough to people visiting Quebec from out of town. It truly had an amazing variety of exhibits and the cost of admission was beyond worth it, as someone from Washington DC who has access to so many free \u2026",
          "I'm a history enthusiast and I was in this place for 2.5hrs. You will be able to experience fun and you will learn so much! My favorite part is the History of Poison.",
          "Lots of great exhibits at the museum, I really liked the First Nations room, one of my favorites.  A very nice walk from upper Quebec down to the museum, it took  us about 15 mins.. I would visit again, so much to see with  just 1 visit.",
          "Great experience! Really enjoyed the two exhibitions we visited: \"Head in the Cloud\" and \"Observer\"!",
          "Very informative and eclectic.  We took advantage of two of the tours, the history of Quebec and an explanation of the experience of the indigenous peoples.   I was impressed with the depth and impartiality of the explanations.  A great museum.",
          "Varied and not too expensive. The poison and venom exhibition was amazing, very cleverly done - our 3year old even enjoyed it\n I realise the exhibitions will change out but from the high quality of our experience I can only recommend it.",
          "Very interesting museum with a lot to see and learn.  Everything from pre historic to modern times.  Well laid out exhibits and lots of interactive stuff for the kids.",
          "Great place to learn about the history of the area. Great cafe as well.",

          "Very dynamic museum, lots of things going on, and very kid friendly.",
          "In visiting this museum it will give you a history of Quebec City. Lots of artifacts from all generations displayed well. Cost is ok & 22 dollars for 31 and older to enter the full tour of the museum or $17 dollars for the half tour. I found visiting the natural creatures of the world was worth the extra couple of dollars.",
          "Nice quality exhibits at reasonable prices. But my favorite part was the staffer who walked me in a side door when I asked about handicap access for my broken foot.  That's service!",
          "What a wonderful museum !!! Be prepare to have a great day ! Perfect with the family !!",
          "Wonderful experience loved the exhibition First Nations & Inuit in the 21st Century.Spent three & a half hours in the Museum and was totally absorbing. Recommend taking the tour with the Guide through the \"People of Quebec Then & Now\".Brillant understaning of the development from the beginning to current day.",
          "Top-rate in every possible way.",
          "Cant really compare to the museums in Ottawa. Their exhibit on data and technology played like a public service announcement warning people of the dangers of technology. Overall seemed almost a hodge podge collection of things.",
          "It was raining so we decided to walk to the museum and were glad we did. We spent four hours at the museum and found all the exhibits very interesting. This is a museum for all ages. Young children would enjoy the area on evolution and we \u2026",

          "Totally worth a stop (or a big chunk of your day) when visiting Quebec City.  Our kids (8 and 10) loved it and we learned a lot as a family. The indigenous exhibit was especially informative.",
          "Very enjoyable and easily done in a morning or afternoon. I enjoyed the indigenous and poisonous animals/plants sections best.",
          "Wonderful place to learn about the history of Quebec. Nice gift shop too.",
          "The museum is really good, you can come with all family there, it's very interesting place your kids can learn about a lot of things because the animators are ready for explaim the activities or things and also they can made a little play for best understand. This place is 100% recommend",
          "Great museum, had only two hours and needed two more because of the extra exhibits we bought.  Well done, entertaining, worth the entrance fee.",
          "I love museums, and this one rates high on the list! We saw the two special exhibits, Venom and Curiosities, as well as the regular exhibits. I found them to be really well laid out, with great information and exceptional artwork. The upper \u2026",
          "Interesting, definitely something you and the family should do together. Really only thought the animal side of the lobby level was good. Everything else I think was filler",
          "The museum is absolutely beautiful. I am sad we did not get to explore more. We were only there for a shot time, to see the body cage of Marie Josephte Corriveau. Glad we did get to explore a little. Highly recommend when visiting Quebec city.",

          "Beautifully designed and modern. Good facilities and acceptable admission price.",
          "Great Museum but take time to look and enjoy it within old Quebec City. The First Nations exhibit as well done. Great things for kids to do there and the courtyard is nice place to have a cup of tea.",
          "An interesting building occupied by a museum that thinks that it is very important.  I enjoyed the history of Quebec exhibits, but the \"similar faces\" and \"rebuilding of London\" exhibits were a lot of highly curated \"so what?\" Zzzzzz. \u2026",
          "This a fun museum with unique and interesting exibits. The cafe was also really nice",
          "Very interesting collection of historical artifacts from over the ages.\n\nTells a very compelling story of Quebec's history.\n\nWas interesting and revealing when you find gadgets you used growing up show up in a museum that one is growing \u2026",
          "Extremely well done exhibits. Many are interactive or have intriguing media elements. Knowledgeable staff are located throughout.",
          "It's an interesting museum about native Americans and Quebec history but I think that name is a bit misleading. I was actually expecting to see more about the history of civilization but it was more a history of Quebec. It's worth seeing it \u2026",
          "Just a wonderful place, highly customizable for any kind of event. Had to go there for multiple events and I am always amazed by the staff work in it.\n\nThe exhibits I had the chance to visit was lovely and instructive, I highly recommend.",

          "Well laid out, beautifully displayed and interesting. This is a user friendly meseum.",
          "Without buying a ticket with exhibition, there are practically 2 major halls to attend, 1 hour overall. Most of the halls were either under construction or accessible for extra pay",
          "Didnt go in. The neighborhood is enjoyable too.",
          "Very large. Lots to see. Made me want to learn more about Quebec history. Check it out, but make sure you have several hours.",
          "We were very fortunate to catch two exhibits on loan from the London museum of natural history.",

          "An amazing place.. great for culture and keeping the brain working",

          "Very educational and fun for everyone.",
          "A small museum, but the permanent exhibition provides very detailed walkthrough about the history of Qu\u00e9bec and Canada. It's a must-see in Qu\u00e9bec city.",
          "It's excelent for the visitors!!",
          "If you're 31 years and older stay away from this museum, because they really discriminate against you for being old by making you pay more due to your age. Young adults aged between 18-30 are the ones you have most of the money. They do \u2026",
          "Really interesting museum, ask at the entrance for a guided tour (which is free), makes the museum more captivating.",

          "Took the family and had a fun time. Got the regular tickets, I would recommend the more expensive tickets to anyone else.",
          "We really enjoyed all the exhibits, but the First Nations exhibit was particularly exceptional. The museum was focused on stretching the meaning of Art and definining identity. Great experience!",
          "Great exhibits! I love first Nations exhibit. It was so interesting. I learned so much.",
          "Lots of great exhibits, I think this museum is definitely worth seeing and worth the entrance fee. However I wish that the exhibits had arrows or signs directing you the right way to experience the exhibits chronologically. Went through an exhibit backwards and it was a bit silly!",
          "Must go on Free Sundays (if you're resident). Lovely and informative exhibitions. Very helpful staff.",
          "Interesting variety, history of Quebec, First Nations exhibit . Many audio visual displays, a person could spend a lot of time and learn a lot.",
          "It's an interesting museum, and the sections I could visit were well curated, but has 3 drawbacks from my perspective: \n1. Large school groups make concentration (and simply moving round) a bit difficult \n2. Half the museum is only \u2026",
          "Vast collection, could easily have spent a full day here. My favourite by far was the interactive key challenge- great fun to complete and to watch others interact with the exhibits. The psychological elements were as fascinating as the challenge itself- exploring the area to the fullest leads to interesting revelations!",

          "Pretty fun place! I learnt a ton!",

          "Wonderful exhibits! We toured on a rush but I found the diversity of exhibits to be quite impressive.",
          "Very fortunate to briefly visit at the end of a cruise. The staff was extremely helpful. The museum was equipped with some of the latest technology, allowing the use of your phone for self-guided tours. Two hours would be enough for a good overview; more time for a better appreciation of the exhibits.",
          "The current exhibition has Darwin\u2019s manuscript for On the Origin of Species! And the Indigenous exhibit is absolutely stunning as well.",
          "Nice and interactive for kids. Clean and specious exhibits. If you go for a specific exhibit call before as not all are always open. Staff was friendly and informative.",

          "Decent museum with some interesting exhibitions. I liked the one about the history of Quebec. Takes 3-4 hours to see. Good value for money. Good for a Rainy afternoon to pass the time.",
          "Beautiful and interesting place, one of the best i've Ever seen, the information about the first nations is very interesting because is the point of view from the indigenous of Canad\u00e1, who since the Arrival of the britains until now where \u2026",

          "You are only allowed to see approximately half of the museum unless you pay the higher price and it is not like it is for a special exhibit.   Okay place but it leaves a lot to be desired.",
          "Kind of disappointing as not much of the collection is on display. Lots of flash and shiny hardware but short on museum content.",
          "This is actually a great museum. Very accessible, the exhibitions are so well-done in that they are very easy to look at, to interact with. It's very close to the old city and the port which is great for visits. The currenr exhibition on \u2026",

          "A good variety of exhibits- loved the Poison exhibit",
          "Very interesting to see how Canada was established as a nation. And how the aborigines were treated. We did not see all the rooms. We also liked the section where you can use your senses to find keys. Funny and entertaining.",

          "Great displays and tours on the history of Quebec.",
          "If you like art, this is a great place to visit in Montreal. Lots of paintings and masterpieces of Salvador Dali, Monet etc. You can even touch some of this art and feel the time of the epoque when it was made. The place has to be quiet, don\u2019t talk too loud and respect other visitors. A gallery of modern art, just blown my mind",
          "Beautiful display of art and history.",
          "Seemed very modern while still covering an enormous amount of history.",
          "A good museum for the whole family.  We went for the \"London Calling\" exhibit which was \"OK\".  But we explored most of the other parts of the museum which I found very interesting with a lot of different types of items to look at.  We also as a family really enjoyed some of the interactive exhibits which were quite fun.",

          "Had a blast at this museum. Highly recommend!",
          "The level of diversity, information and unique exhibits make this a must see. We learned so much about the area, its history and the rich history of the first Nations. The interactive exhibits and areas provide a nice challange",
          "Really enjoyed this place. They have great expositions in there but I particularly enjoyed the one of Quebec City where it shows the development of the city from it's early beginning to it's current status. Definitely recommend this if you are around.",

          "This is a great place for kids as well as adults. There was an Observer exhibit that had rooms such as a cellar that was completely dark with padded walls and mysterious sounds to keep you a little worried. \n\nThe special Herge exhibit had wonderful pencil drawings that brought the characters top life. \n\nThe cafe was good too.

          "Worth a quick walk through, but better to visit  other attractions and local events. If you like history museums, than this will be worth your rime.",
          "Exciting exhibts. Per usual however some content about indigenous folks minimized the experiences ofvresidential schools. I am writing the museum about these concerns.",
          "The museum has some nice exhibits and some really great First Nation/Native North American/Aboriginal and Quebec history exhibits. Please allow plenty of time (at least four hours, more if crowded) for viewing the exhibits.",
          "It's OK, but you can skip it if you don't have time.",

          "Many things to see, a lot of information.",
          "Great for children. But not so much for adults. Most of the exhibits are geared towards small children. The main exhibit on the people of Quebec quickly loses its theme and becomes hodgepodge of random items. We have traveled a lot and gone \u2026",

It is located in the neighbourhood of Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec\u2013Cap-Blanc\u2013colline Parlementaire in the borough of La Cit\u00e9-Limoilou, near Place Royale and its Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church. Its main street is the Rue du Petit-Champlain at the foot of Cap Diamant. It is claimed that it's the oldest commercial district in North America.In French it is referred to as a quartier (neighbourhood) although it is not an official one recognized by the City. It is named after Samuel de Champlain, who founded Quebec City in 1608.\n\n\n== Attractions ==\n\n\n=== Rue du Petit-Champlain mural ===\nThe mural painted on the side of the house  102 rue du Petit-Champlain (currently owned by Coop\u00e9rative des artisans et commer\u00e7ants du quartier Petit Champlain) is a trompe-l'\u0153il measuring 100m2 (900 ft2). It represents the history of the district, the bombardments of 1759, the landslides, and the fires which have occurred in the district.\n\n\n=== Breakneck Stairs ===\nThe Breakneck Stairs or Breakneck Steps (French: Escalier casse-cou), Quebec City's oldest stairway, were built in 1635. Originally called escalier Champlain \"Champlain Stairs\", escalier du Qu\u00eateux \"Beggars' Stairs\", or escalier de la Basse-Ville \"Lower Town Stairs\", they were given their current name in the mid-19th century, because of their steepness. The stairs  have been restored several times, including an 1889 renovation by Charles Baillarg\u00e9.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site",

          "This was our favourite part of Old Qu\u00e9bec. Cobblestone laneways and quaint shops and caf\u00e9s. It can get very busy though and our little tip would be to get there early in the morning before it is packed with tourists. Doubly so if you want to take photos on the Escalier",

However the clothing and shoes boutiques were pretty expensive. Which I guess is reasonable as its a prime tourist location. But I",

          "This is a really lovely area to wander around. Although there are some run of the mill tourist shops, there are also some quality goods for sale. We really enjoyed our time here but recommend going just as the shops are opening in the morning as it gets uncomfortably busy",

          "No place like this, well worth the visit. Suggest starting at the top and working your way down, as it is easier than all the stairs heading back up! Was super crowded one day but it didn't matter, still plenty of room in the shops and restaurants. A great place to take a",
          "This is a magnificent gem among historic North American cities. Dating back to the early 1600's many of the original buildings are in tact and, as you walk along the narrow cobblestone streets you could easily be in Europe. The large area inside the old city walls is adorned",

        "wiki": "The Old Quebec Funicular (French: Funiculaire du Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec) is a funicular railway in the Old Quebec neighbourhood of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. It links the Haute-Ville (Upper Town) to the Basse-Ville (Lower Town), which includes such sites as the colonial-era Notre Dame des Victoires church, the historic Petit Champlain district, the port, and the Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation (Museum of Civilization). Climbing at a 45-degree angle, the railway covers a total distance of 64 metres (210 ft). \n\n\n== History ==\nThe funicular opened on November 17, 1879, and originally used the water ballast system of propulsion. The line was converted to electrical operation in 1907. On July 2, 1945, a major fire destroyed the structure, necessitating a rebuild that was completed in 1946. Since then, major renovations have taken place in 1978 and 1998. In 2004 it celebrated 125 years of operating.In October 1996, Briton Helen Tombs was killed when the cable snapped and the emergency brake failed to stop the cabin before it crashed into the lower station.   As a result of this fatal crash, the funicular was closed and entirely revamped with modern technology. It reopened in 1998, technically as an inclined elevator, since both cabins are independent.  The funicular has the following technical parameters:\nLength: 64 metres (210 ft)\nHeight: 59 metres (194 ft)\nCars: 2\nConfiguration: Double track\nTraction: Electricity\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of funicular railways\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial web site of the funicular (in English)",

          "The best waumy to get between the lower twin and the upper town. Amazing way to get photos. And it's only a toonie!!!",
          "The elevator is small and crowded. It is hard to reach while you have a kid stroller. The view is OK but you do not have to go this way.",
          "Try to imagine getting from lower to upper city without it! It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s practical, it\u2019s an important part of Quebec City!",
          "Used the funicular regularly. Quick and easy. Have to pay cash for each trip - there are no daily/weekly tickets. Never had to wait long. Great views across the river.",
          "We probably should\u2019ve gone up instead of down but it was fun to watch out the window and see the pretty little streets of Petit Champlain as you descend",
          "We rode the funicular up after walking down... so quick but so fun! The kids LOVED it (and so did we!)!!!",
          "The Old Quebec Funicular is mana from heaven if you want to return to the upper art of the city after sightseeing around the historic streets and sights and the waterfront. Coming down the steps at the beginning of the day's travel is fun and you get to see stuff as you descend",
          "...especially when minus 20c out!! Nice smooth ride back up the really, really, really big hill!! Great view from the car and funny staff!!!",
          "Great view of old lower Quebec and of the St Lawrence river. Quick ride up/down. Way easier than climbing stairs esp when minus 20. $3.50 ride well worth the price",
          "We stepped in from out of the cold and paid for our tickets. We didn\u2019t have to wait too long (standing under a very warm heater which was just superb after being out in the cold) for the funicular to make its way back up. A short ride down with magnificent views of the river.",
          "Great expedient way to go from upper to lower Old Quebec in below 9 degree weather. Also got me to cafe smith in no time!",
          "Funiculars are fun. This one is spectacular at best. Freezing cold but worth seeing the stunning scenery of snow covered peaks and valleys. Dress really warm.",
          "What a beautiful view and quick way to get from the Chateau Frontenac to the lower city. We went at night to enjoy the lights and it was a pleasant walk around the lower city even if all the stores were not open.",
          "The funicular was a fun way to travel up and down the hill in the old city. It was a smooth ride and economical.",
          "The funicular is the best way to get up and down the hill to the Chateau to Vieux Champlain. $3.50 each way, super quick and the lines move fast.",
          "My 25 year old twin sons had never been on a Funicular and thought we were going to die - until it started and they realized how gentle it is and what a great view you get from being inside one. Glad they had it available.",
          "This is worth the cost of $3.50 CAD per person to experience it. The views of the town and St. Lawrence river are great as is the experience. We got to ride it at least 10 times during our week long stay. There is a small shop where the tickets are sold which has some cute",
          "Would recommend the trip at $3:50 per person (as of Jan 2020). You could walk down the steps and take the funicular back up",
          "It was raining and snowing the days we were there. So glad that there's an option. It's CAD$3.50 per adult one way for a 2 minute ride down. It's not cheap but still better than climbing down the staircase on bad weather.",
          "Fun feature of the area offering a great view. A very short ride between the upper and lower towns, most convenient in winter.",
          "It\u2019s a convenient 15 second ride to the top if you don\u2019t feel like walking uphill, but they don\u2019t accept credit/debit cards and it can get expensive if you are a large party or if you ride it to the top every day (it costs 3.50 Canadian dollars per person per ride).",
          "It\u2019s good to have done it once. The view isn\u2019t that great but it\u2019s fun to go one way just to have the experience. It\u2019s $3.50 per person one way (cash only but there is an ATM inside of you need cash).",
          "Don't cheap out! This is a must for going UP the hill at a minimum. Both ways during winter when the roads and sidewalks can be slippery. Worth every penny and what better way to land at the doorstep of the inimitable Chateau Frontenac.",
          "This is great way to get back up the cliff. It a $3.50 ride per person but after a long walk down it's nice to have a easier way back up. Especially in winter. And you can't beat the view of the St. Lawrence River. It's a great ride. Give it a shot",
          "$3.50 gets you a ride up or down with a great view of the St. Lawrence. The walk up is steep, sontake the Funicular up, and walk down.",
          "This Old Quebec Funicular allows you to to get up and down from the Lower City (Basse Ville) to the Upper City (Haute Ville), instead of cclimbing or descending stairs. It's nice for kids and helps people who have difficulty walking. I personally prefer the stairs...",
          "We were told to give this a whirl while in Quebec. I guess it saved some walking but was overpriced for the 5 minute ride down an angle like elevator. I couldn\u2019t even get a picture because the people wouldn\u2019t let us near the window on front looking over water. It\u2019s kinda",
          "Not really much to review here. But it\u2019s definitely an easier way to get from the top of the hill right into the heart of Quartier Petite Champlain and would say anybody who has trouble walking this would be excellent.",
          "Easiest way to get from the lower to the upper part of old Quebec. You can use Canadian or US but if using US, they will give your change in Canadian so best to have correct amount.",
          "$3.50 for a very short ride. Recommend that you take it back up but make sure you don\u2019t miss the last one!",
          "Easy and quick way to get up from the lower town - $3.50 per person cash only. Gives you a nice view of the lower town and Harbour area.",
          "Open all year round and at $3.50 per person, per ride. An excellent way to travel to the older part of town.",
          "Only 3.50 Canadian per person down and same price up. Cash only (American is accepted). Worth every penny when it\u2019s -4C outside!",
          "We were able to ride once but the rest of the time it was closed with no explanation. Within the hours of operation!",
          "A quick ride up and down to the Petit Champlain to admire the stores and have breakfast at a local place.",
          "So, the primary driver for us to try the Funiculaire is that my knees are not my greatest asset - so it seemed like a nifty way to safe some wear and tear. I did not anticipate how much fun it would be! The views during the ride up are amazing! And in the evening, after",
          "We rode this from lower to upper town during a snow storm. They were just about to close so I\u2019m glad they waited for us to pull money out from the atm on site. I would have died trying to get back up top. The winds were crazy!",
          "The Breakneck Stairs are steep! The hill back up is steep! If you are not fit, older, have a disability are had a long day the Funicular is brilliant. :-)",
          "This Funicular ride is expensive for a short time. Credit cards are not accepted. Only cash in the form of Canadian dollars or US dollars is accepted. If one doesn\u2019t have Canadian dollars, then one need to pay the same amount in US dollars(with no conversion factor), making it",
          "When in Quebec City did use this service to get from lower to upper city. After already doing 40 flights of stairs my legs had had enough.",
          "Getting down the hill is easy, but this is the best way to get from the lower area to the upper. We rode it up twice: first time there was no wait at all, second time we waited about 10-15 minutes for our turn. Well worth it, especially if your mobility is limited.",
          "Sorry for the title, but I just had to!! :-) My husband and I used the funicular every day to get from our hotel in 'lower town' to the 'upper town' area. I had hurt my leg and couldn't possibly take the stairs. Quick, easy and inexpensive.",
          "Beats walking up the stairs! There is a great view of the fleuve as you go to upper Quebec. Friendly staff as well.",
          "Cool experience to see panoramic views of Quebec. However, the ride is a little anticlimactic. I was glad I did it once, but would probably never do it again.",
          "The only sensible way to get from lower Quebec to upper Quebec on foot. You CAN take the stairs nearby if you insist...or go all the way around through the old city, toward the railway station and then come up to the top. But why? We went DOWN that way, and then came back up",
          "We used this funicular several times during or short stay in Quebec. The views as you travel up and or down are fabulous",
          "we went back up on the funicular to the top ...too many glasses of wine below.very old system and creaky but funny well worth it",
          "We took the steps from the terrasse Dufferin down to the lower town - le petit Champlain, but they are slippery after a light snow. After exploring the shops and galleries we took the funiculaire up the hill. $3.50 each direction. Cash only. Runs all the time throughout the day.",
          "Yes, you can walk the many steps to the lower part of the old city from the high part of the city (where the Frontenac is located). Or you can take a fun short ride on the Funicular, or Funiculaire. We were new to the area, so we weren't sure what to expect. But we're so glad we",
          "You won\u2019t have any problem walking down the steps to the lower section, but this fun tram ride will be appreciated when you need to go back up. Quick and fun!",
          "It was pouring rain and we had never taken it. It was really fun although a short right. You might as well do it once! Beautiful way to see the city at night.",
          "The funicular joins the lower part of the old city to the high part of the old city. You can walk up and down if you wish but make sure you have good knees. We found everything in Quebec City a bit expensive and this is not an exception. Nice view from the cars as well.",
          "Located by the Fairmont Frontenac, this funicular will take you to the prettiest street in Quebec. When you see Christmas photos with snow and lights on a pretty street, this where you will find it. Staff aren\u2019t particularly warm and fizzy and $3.50:for the 20 second one way",
          "The Funicular is a must do, simply because it is almost another institution for transport between the upper and lower town. If people have an issue with fatigue, it is also located at the base of the Terrace Dufferin. The folks who work there have it down to clockwork. There was",
          "we were in Old Quebec and sight seeing by the Frontenac. Noticed this ride and thought we would try it. The view was amazing and it dumped us into a great area with shops and restaurants at the bottom. We roaqd it back up later to more shops, restaurants and hotels.",
          "The first time I'd ever encountered a funicular was in France! How awesome it is, after a day of walking hills, to just ride up the side of a huge hill that would normally take enough stairs to choke a horse! Well spent $3.50 I say!",
          "Quebec is an amazing city. So beautiful you will want to stay a lot more. This funicular gets you an impressive view.",
          "The charge of $3.5 per person for a single trip up to Terrasse Dufferin from Lower Town should be regarded as time saving for tourists in order to cover up more visit spots with the limited time available in town. Just a few minutes for the ride apart from queuing time during",
          "It was certainly a quick and easy way to get to the top of the old town of Quebec City. The fare is $3.50 Canadian and I personally feel the price should include a return trip back down.",
          "Funicular is inexpensive and easy way to go from Upper Town Old Quebec to Lower Town (and back). Entrance is short walk from park in front of Chateau Frontenac. Arrives in Quartier Petit Champlain, very charming shopping and dining area. Also near Place Royale and Museum of",
          "The 3.50 CAD fee to ride the equivalent of 6-8 flights of stairs in a few minutes can be a welcomed blessing in hilly Quebec--call ahead if expecting to use as it is sometimes under repair--small gift shop at base in Old City. Check hours of operation, too.",
          "A fun little way to go up or down to the Old Town. At $3.50 it's a deal. Walk down the steps to see shops and food choices, stroll the Old Town and ride up.",
          "A quick ride on the funicular from the petit Champlain district back up to the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac area is a nice rest if your feet are tired from walking about. Also a view of the area from above.",
          "This is an inexpensive way to get to the lower part of Quebec City without having to take the stairs. The staff was pleasant and helpful and spoke English. If you get in the front of the car, you can take lovely photos or video of the waterfront as you travel the steep incline.",
          "We were enchanted with the vista from the Funicular in Old Quebec. Yes, it's a short ride, and yes it costs $3.50 and you need cash... and there's often a wait.. But really? You can spend $3.50 on a coffee or a bag of chips.. We thought it was the best deal in town. Fabulous",
          "The ride on the funicular is a convenient way to reach Upper Quebec at the top of the cliff, but it is expensive. The fare up or down is $3.50 which is paid before entering the car. The agent gives change. If you are not in a rush, walk down the flight of stairs beside the",
          "We intended to ride the funicular from the Lower Town to the Upper Town instead of climbing stairs but were disappointed that the operation is cash only. We used only our credit cards in Canada without any problem except for this one.",
          "We caught the funicular to go up to the high town, finding we could easily walk back down. Needless to say, there are lovely views from the top, and the Chateau is not to be missed!!",
          "Good deal for $3.50 easy way to avoid the uphill walk and get some good views! Easy to find near the Frontenac.",
          "It's a fun experience and it saves you from trying to hike the stairs. We used it to go down and then walked up elsewhere. A nice memory.",
          ". . . when you can ride, enjoy the river panorama and save energy all at the same time, at a quite reasonable cost. It allowed us to visit both Upper and Lower Town on foot, without climbing the steep hills. Way to go!",
          "After a terrific dinner (and a few glasses of wine) at Bistro Sous Le Forte we realized there is no way we were going to walk up all those stairs to the Upper Town to get back to our hotel. So we took the Funicular. Not expensive ($3.50 per person), and a quick ride up.",
          "Why kill yourself climbing the winding streets to get to the Upper City, when you can take the tram, and then when you're through walk down the shop-lined streets to the Lower City",
          "By the end of the day, we were bushed. So we took this short trip up and back a while later. It is very expensive for a couple of minute ride - $3.50 Canadian one way. The worst part is that if you only have U.S. dollars, you can use them but at par. With the exchange rate",
          "Apart from being the easiest way from the lower town to the upper town and vice versa, the funicular offers a couple of great photo opportunities but you need to be quick. The kids will love it.",
          "A super way to get from upper town to place royale and the ferry quickly! Loved it! You don\u2019t have to wait long at all and nice views during the short ride !",
          "Great time clean and modest in price easy to access on both levels and the wait is not that long for the experience and the view.",
          "Visiting Quebec City has part of a cruise ship tour. The finicular is certainly better than walking down or up the hill.",
          "Instead of all those stairs take the outside elevator to the Champlain Square. It offers a different view and experience.",
          "This funicular connects the upper and lower part of Quebec town. Gives you lovely view of the lower old Quebec city, the river and the port!",
          "Just a quick ride up to the upper level of city. Cost $3.50 was a bit much, but it is a piece of history being around for over 125 years.",
          "It's not everyday you get to ride a funicular. It's great. A bit pricey but well worth it if it's raining, snowing or ya just don't feel like walking the zillion steps to get to your restaurant! Very steep! Whee!",
          "During our visit we explored the upper area of old Quebec and took the funicular down to the lovely petite champlain area. There is a small fee for the ride but well worth it to visit each area. The walk up or down the hill is a very steep incline. The cars are good sized and",
          "For most of those observed walking around the lowere town of Old Quebec City, this is a true blessing. You usually work your way down through the town looking a various buildings and sites. When you get all the way down, the way up on your own two feet is not an attractive",
          "Good service and friendly quick staff. But its an elevator with a view. A very good view, and quite inexpensive. Worth saving the climb? For my bad knees yes. But 15-20 minutes of walking will get you up. Cheers",
          "this was quite the leg saver up and down the the major hills- the elevation changes are several hundred feet in a very short distance- we made the trek up and down over several days then tried this- for $3.50 canadian it was definitely worth it!",
          "My husband and I are able bodied but going up the stairs was a challenge - which we did once. On the second day of our visit, we opted to take the Funiculare down and up. At $3.50 ($2.62 US) one way it was expensive for a 30 second ride. If you are able bodied, skip it!",
          "$3_50 for one way but is well worth it if you can\u2019t face the steps and hill. Queue goes down quite quickly and you are soon at the top. Note there are still some, maybe 12, steps at the top to exit the station",
          "The funicular is the easiest and fastest way to get from Haute-Ville (Upper Town) to Basse-Ville (Lower Town). The main entrance of the funicular is located in the historic House Louis Jolliet, 16 Petit-Champlain Street, in Basse-Ville. The entrance in Haute-Ville is in front of",
          "If you are above, this beats walking down and up the stairs. A little costly ($3.50 CAD each way), but less stress on my knees is worth it.",
          "A direct link between Dufferin Terrace and Quartier Petit-Champlain, Place-Royale and the Old Port. The main entrance of the funicular is in Louis Jolliet House, located at 16 rue Petit-Champlain. The upper level entrance is on Dufferin Terrace near the Fairmont Le Ch\u00e2teau",
          "We rode the funicular both down to Petit Champlain and back up again. However, we realized after reaching the bottom that if we had walked a short distance past the entrance at the top, there were stairs leading down to the vicinity of Place Royale. It was an interesting and",
          "To go to the top of the cliffs overlooking old town, the Funicular is the way to go, particularly if strenuous steps are not for you. It is a quick ride that lets you off at Chateau Frontenac. The cost is $3.50 cdn. About $2.50 US. Cash only. The walk down is too bad and it",
          "The funicular is a fun way to go from the bottom of the city up to the upper part, if you have had a day of walking it is a very welcome way back up to the top or vis versa.",
          "Although hiking up multiple steps is a great work out...you HAVE to try the funicular at least once! Fun, short little $3 ride up the hill...while enjoying views of the river and water front!",
          "Had to use this as we had 2 suitcases to carry the top. Best time to use is early morning as it gets a queue very fast during the day",
          "If you dont want to take stairs then use the funicular to go up or down in Old Q. Realize it is $3.50 each direction each time and it lasts maybe 45seconds...just sayin..",
          "It is all good fun and a fast way to get up and down in Quebec city from the height to the bottom where the water is. If you have time and strength it is well worth taking a tour and gong through by foot and steps. If you are pressed for time or not up to lots of steps this is",
          "Great way to get from the upper heights of the Old Quebec to the Quartier Petit Champlain at the water level. My wife and I are elderly and steps are a real challenge for us. The funicular was a most convenient and quick way to get up and down the heights. The open views from",
          "Good connection between the upper and lower Quebec City sites. I suggest taking it up higher points of interests and walk down the the streets to the lower city.",
          "In addition to the funicular, the stairs and streets also make their way gradually down to Old Town. The price is moderate, the wait is not long, and the ride up goes quickly. At the top, the Hotel Frontenac and all the activity is only a short walk away. Riding the funicular",
          "We had walked around Quebec City most of the day enjoying the \"old country\" style homes, fantastic stores and restaurants. Our afternoon was spent in the lower city by the river. We were facing a long, long walk up a steep stairway to the upper city when we came upon the Old",
          "This takes you rapidly from the upper to lower are of the city. Cheap way to save on a steep climb. At the foot of the funicular are a wide range of small shopd and restaurants.",
          "It\u2019s a long way up but for 2.25$ it is well worth the ride up. If you take the ferry like we did it\u2019s easy peassy....on a clear day you can see everything!",
          "If you are in Quebec in the Old Town lower area and you need to get up to the Old Town upper area and tired of walking stairs, the Quebec Funicular is the answer. The cost is $3.50 (Canadian or $2.65 US) per person for the ride to the top stopping near the Chateau Frontenac.",
          "Properly priced and a relief on a warm day. Great view quiet smooth and not too fast. Got great shots and no coronary.",
          "If you want to get from the old lower town and up to the old high town then the Funicular is for you. It costs $3.50 Canadian for a one way trip but really the only way to do it is going up. The walk down is easy and you can stop at bars along the way and that is very appealing.",
          "Three hour bus tour to the countryside. Meet at the Museum of Civilization. Tour is available once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Peter, our tour guide was informative and personable. Stops at a winery, cidery and chocolate factory. It was a welcomed break from",
          "Enjoyed the ride up after having done the walk..just another way to be amazed by the view..to think of this in the winter would be amazing..the summer view of the Saint Lawrence with the cruise ships at port was beautiful",
          "Great location....right on the Dufferin Terrace and easy way to go down to the Place Royal and Lower Town. $3.50 each way.",
          "Last time we were here it was not working and the path down is very steep. Spectacular view of the shops and the old port.",
          "One way ticket USD (no exchange rate given) is $3,50 per person. While there may be a line for tickets, the wait was quick and before you know it, you are on the Funicular and on your way! Great views on your way!",
          "Walking up and/or down between lower and upper Old Quebec City can be very tiring and difficult if it's chilly and windy. Need to be in fairly good condition to walk from very bottom to the top. However, the funicular can get you there in less than 5 minutes. Plus, the views",

          "Lovely view of the harbour and city, much better then climbing back up the stairs. You have to pay $3.50 no seniors discount. Depending on how busy it is, it may take 5 minutes wait to get on. The ride itself is only 2 or 3 minutes to the top. You can also take it down.",
          "Date of Visit: Saturday, June 22nd, 2019 This little ride up the hill to Chateau Frontenac is a great little trip The cost is $3.50 and they only take cash. Do no get in line if you do not have cash. There is an ATM in the building, but it will be rather annoying to be",
          "Great way to travel from lower to upper Old Quebec. Offers great views of the city. About 3$ a person to ride, cash only! Quick ride up to the top",
          "If you cannot do alot of stairs and I mean over 400 must use this to go to the shops by the water. I walked rather then pay $3.80. I felt it was a bit pricey for a ride lasting 2 minutes",
          "I really wanted to take this but my husband hesitated saying it would take too long. However we walked up, paid our minimal amount and loaded on the car. We were up the hill in no time. Very nice experience. Do it at least once!",
          "Decided to take the stairs to lower town. Following a great afternoon of sightseeing it was gratifying to know we had a ride up to the top. $7.00 per couple, money well spent.",
          "A great way to quickly go from the lower to the upper town without tedious steps or very steep inclines. There can be a queue at the busiest times, but generally it is just a question of waiting for it to come up or down as appropriate.",
          "This short \"cable car\" links Quarter Petit Champlain, a famous area known for its old shops and cobbled stones roads with the top. It is just a short ride instead of walking up the stairs. Will save your knees. The view of the St Lawrence River on the way up is nice. For this",
          "THANK YOU to the American couple who gave their funicular tickets to me and my daughter. (I guess they were in a hurry and couldn't wait out the line.) The ride down to the lower level streets was great. To get back up to the higher level, the funicular is a MUST--unless you",
          "Quick way to get up & down from Upper Town to Lower Town Old Quebec City..at the cost of $3.50 each way..",
          "What a great way to see the city! Quick and smooth! Beautiful!!! Totally worth the money! The lines were long in the afternoon to get back down, but they handled it with no problems!",
          "If you want to save some stairs or just want a great view, it only costs $3.50 Canadian (about $2.75 American) to take this ride between upper old town by the Frontenac and lower old town. You can see for miles. I suggest taking it at night once and during the day another time",
          "I mean, its a short ride waht can you say? The attendant was friendly and told us some stories to entertain us while we waited. Good views.",
          "I hate these things, but this was actually pleasant- and the only way to really get down to the Lower Old city-- plus fun view of the harbor as you go",
          "It's pretty cheap and a fun little thing to do - also helps save the legs from the hills if you get a tired.",
          "The Quebec funicular is an elevator between Le Petit Champlain (the older, lower city) and Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac on the bluff of Old Quebec. It gives a panoramic view of the St Lawrence River as well as Levis, the city across the river. It\u2019s part of the Old Quebec experience.",
          "Yep the funicular saves you a very long walk (walk down not bad but walk up a killer). It connects the upper area to the lower quarter which is 1700\u2019s is structure and authenticity. Shops are lovely walk around the area a true treasure",
          "For $3.50 CA, save your time and energy to walk around each area rather than torturing yourself walking up stairs or steep hills.",
          "We went from the Lower City to the Upper City via the Old Quebec Funicular. You can see everything from this glass cable car. If you have a stroller or small children that can\u2019t navigate the large number of steps or a disability that keeps you from going up or down the steps,",
          "If you need some respite from walking uphill the funicular is the best method of going from the lower to the upper part of Quebec City. At $3.00 it's a bargain.",
          "Always different to find a funicular in the middle of a city but it\u2019s a fun way to short cut the walk up to the chateau Frontenac. However at C$3.50 per ride a bit pricey.",
          "Wanted to go from the lower to the upper city in Quebec. The stairs were much too high and we decided to take the Funicular. Great experience and we will definitely ride the Funicular when we visit Quebec again.",
          "Take time to explore the cobbled areas of old Quebec. The UNESCO site has quaint shops / wall art / views etc before taking the Funicular up to Dufferin Terrace for some spectacular views. The Citadelle and Plains of Abraham are only a short walk away and then you are quite",
          "We took the Funicular several times to get from the lower street to the Place d'Arme. Didn't mind paying $3.50 CA for the trip.",
          "The funicular is very convenient to go from the upper city to the lower city. The views are quite spectacular.",
          "Definitely worth the visit, so quaint and beautiful. Wear comfortable shoes as the roads are cobblestone.",
          "Ride up and down the Funicular for 3.50 $ CDN. It sure saves on your legs. I don\u2019t think I could have walked up and down that hill.",
          "Who doesn't like an elevator ride up the side of a mountain. We saved doing this particular activity until we were too tired to deal with the walk from the water back up to our hotel. Was worth every penny. Please note that you need to pay in cash.",
          "I think we paid around $3.50 for a ride down to Old Town from the Chateau Frontenac. It was at night, and wasn't a big sight or anything - just a means of saving our legs from walking down. We caught it back up later that evening. I think it closes around 10:30pm, so make sure",
          "It is definitely not a top tourist attraction and we only used it for the first time (3rd time visit here) to save some time going up to upper town. CAD $3/person and cash only (ATM machine there but be aware of extra fees). Overpriced gift shop also at the base. I will not",
          "So after a long day of walking around old Quebec City if you want to just take this cart up they charge you $3.50 one way which ends up letting you out at Chateau de Frontenac",
          "What a great way to finish your exploration of the lower city. You do so much walking and instead of climbing stairs back up, we used this as our transportation up. What a great view of the lower city and the port. The ride is smooth. Definitely worth the $3.50 for the view.",
          "If you are worn out and want to avoid a lot of stairs take this \u201cenclosed escalator\u201d. It isn\u2019t really an attraction but more of a leg saver. It costs $3.50 whether cad or usd money, so if you have Canadian money use it.",
          "We where tired because we walked for hours in the old city so we decided to take the ride to go up town. It was a $3.50 well spent.",
          "We enjoyed the ride down the Funicular as we could overlook the area of Old Quebec and get a taste of what was to come. Very pleasant",
          "It's easy to find from the upper level. A little harder to find when you're ready to go back up. You need cash (no credit cards), and they will make change. The trip is fast. The cars are not too large, holding about 10 people at a time. They have two cars, going up and back, so",
          "I should have researched before our visit. We enjoyed Quebec City so much, it is beautiful, but the attendant at the top of the funicular definitely was not part of the pleasant experience. We paid in US money and rather than give us the difference, my husband saw him slip",
          "There is a lot of walking around Old Quebec City, the funicular is worth the $3.50 to get you up to Dufferin Terrace to see the panoramic views of the St. Lawrence and Haute-Ville.",
          "Superb value for money but make sure you have cash. Good views on the way up and the queue goes down very quickly as many people can fit in at the same time. A must on a hot day or if you have mobility issues.",
          "This is a quick way to get up and down in Quebec it\u2019s $3.50 each way and allows for great views looking out into the river.",
          "What a fantastic way to get down to Port Royal! Loved the views and not too long a wait. Highly recommend!",
          "Great way to get to the Lower Town, only $3.50 CAN per person, cash only. Great views, quick ride. Definitely worth experiencing at least once.",
          "Their are literally hundreds of stairs going down from the area around the Fairmont Le Chateau Frontenac down to the many shops and restaurants in the \"low town\". I would recommend walking down the stairs and riding the Funicular back to the upper level. It is a very brief but",
          "Saved a bit a of steep walking, interesting feature of Old Quebec. Good for kids. I wouldn't wait in a long line to do this.",
          "Walking down to Lower Town was manageable but walking back up was not a choice. The Funiculaire was great for going back up to the Terrace Dufferin. Lovely view too.",
          "Had enough stairs for the day so we took the quick trip up! Perfect way to get back up to the Upper Town!",
          "We took the funicular to avoid the stairs down to the Lower Old Town. It\u2019s not a bad price and a quick way down. Once at the bottom we realized the stairs didn\u2019t look that bad. Nevertheless, we took the funicular back up too! If you\u2019re going up or down early in the day, you can",
          "walk down from the upper city and then take in the lower city. Then use the funicular to save your knees from the 200 steps back up. it is fun.",
          "This is a good choice to avoid climbing the steep streets between the upper and the lower part of the city. Only short waiting lines.",
          "I had been climbing stairs (and enjoying it) all around Quebec City, but on my last day I decided to try the Funicular. It was fun! I went mid- afternoon and there wasn\u2019t a line. I just waited for it to return from above with two other tourists. We got on and it could be a",
          "The Old Quebec Funicular, which is an incline in English, is the perfect way to go to the upper and lower street levels in Old Quebec City. It is inexpensive ($3.50) but be advised that they only take cash. You do not want to miss all that is available in the lower streets.",
          "We took it after our tour ended in lower town. There was a line but it moved quickly. Not that hard to walk up but a nice option",
          "A quick and easy way to get between upper and lower old Quebec. We took the trip down and walked the stairs back up as there was a huge line to go up.",
          "You need to ride this specially on the way up. The view is fantastic and you\u2019d save some time instead of walking",
          "Save your legs, and use this funicular,afterpending time in the lower part of old Quebec., where you will go back in time with old buidings",
          "Quick easy way to get upto the top of the old city. Only $3.50 which is reasonable. Fab views to be had once up there. Take the ride up then wander down at your leisure",
          "Quebec City is very hilly so, if you are tired, use the Funicular! It\u2019s a short trip but worth the cost. And it is great to visit the lower area of the city.",
          "Used this to save the legs back up the hill. Well worth the 3.5 dollar cost as it is a steep climb back up to the Chateaux Frontenac. The car going down was always empty. Top tip walk down ride back up",
          "Our hotel was at the top stop. We mostly walked up and down but toward the end of hour stay, $7CN for both of us was well spent! On the day we left to board the Caribbean Princess, they were happy to let us head down with our roll-a-boards. Made the trip to the ship a 10 minute",
          "We walked down to the old town, however, once we finished walking around it was fun to take the cable car back to the top. Its a steep hill to walk back up. its Only $3.50 per person and a bit of a wait, however, its worth it as it will save you half hr and you'll get a short",
          "After you experience all that town has to offer and eat and drink you will gladly spend the $3 to ride to the top. It offers nice views and is pretty quick. Great to take advantage of if you are staying at The Fairmont.",
          "We enjoyed the ride and the conveince of getting to the top without having to take the stairs- Great view",
          "It was well worth it to not have to climb those hills. Great views and a neat experience. My sixteen year old got a kick out of it.",
          "Great way to get to upper or lower town. Definitely a tourist attraction, but was fast and efficient way to concur the hill.",
          "Walk down, enjoy the lower town and take the funiculaire back up. Worth the cost every time and a great view!",
          "We haven't used the funicular in the past because we prefer to get the exercise from walking, but decided to take advantage of it during this visit. It's fun, inexpensive and offers great views.",
          "We were staying at the Frontenac and wanted to visit the old city. The funicular was right outside as part of the boardwalk. It ran frequently and no car was overcrowded. I have a wheeled walker and they accommodated me by letting me on first and then using an elevator to go up",
          "For $3.50 you don\u2019t have to walk up the hill again. The ride is very short; very warm inside as there are no windows it was 85 degrees",
          "This is a fun ride to take if you want to avoid lots of stairs. It\u2019s only a few dollars, and the view going down is lovely. Of course, it\u2019s more practical to use going up, to avoid all the stair climbing. I think it\u2019s worth doing at least once while you are in old Quebec.",
          "We took the Funicular because we thought it would be fun and it wasn\u2019t too expensive ($3.50 Canadian). It was just hot and crowded. But it did let us avoid a bunch of steps!",
          "Prices are good. Ride is short but efficient. Staff are friendly. The biggest problem with the funicular is that there isn't any air conditioning. With the sun beating down the little cars get quite hot...add to that 12-14 people and it's sweltering. Thankfully both \"stations\"",
          "Is it worth taking? Yes it is on the way up when you are tired. It costs $3.50 per adult so reasonable and it only takes a minute. However, it is quite hot right now and the funicular is like sitting in a hot car with the windows rolled up and no air movement for the",
          "Quick and saved the walk up the stairs. An experience with a beautiful view. Queues were short and disabled accommodated.",
          "If you are walking between the Upper and Lower city, you basically have two choices - ride the Funicular effortlessly, or hike the suicide stairs.",
          "Why walk around and up when a 2-minute elevator ride can take you there. The ride is short but the views are pretty special. I recommend going up by funicular and come down by road and steps so you can enjoy both experiences. $3.50/one way is definitely worth the experience.",
          "A quick way to the top, inexpensive, crowds are moved quickly, and the views are spectacular! Treat yourself to a ride up!",
          "This trip is well worth the money, particularly on an extremely hot day. For those scared of heights, just close your eyes, it is a relatively short trip! It also provides an opportunity for some great shots of the lower end of the city and waterfront area. It is not air",
          "Great little funicular. $3.50 per person. On a hot day it is a lifesaver. Runs from the Frontenac's promenade down to Petit Champlain. It is a great trip for kids.",
          "I think it's dum to take this down since the walk or stairs is not bad. But I would suggest taking it back up. The walk up hill or the stairs up hill is tough. My wife was pretty tired after the stairs. Price for people was like 15 CN I think.",
          "Yes it\u2019s a very short ride but suggest you take it up and walk back as it will save you an uphill walk and provide you with a nice view. It\u2019s a must for kids and seniors.",
          "Easiest way to get to lower area of city. Only 3.5$ and well worth the short trip. Moves quickly up and down. Busy but wait was short. Worth the money.",
          "If you\u2019ve never ridden a funicular, definitely give this a run. There has been a funicular here since the late 1800s, but this is a newer version. It\u2019s still fun to climb up the steep hillside in this manner. Some will complain about the price, but it\u2019s a couple bucks to take a",
          "We enjoyed the funicular and it was necessary since weather was very hot. One way is 3.50 per person. Each car holds ~ 16. 2 minutes ride and the two cars go every 2-3 minutes! Got some great photos. Upper Town is several steps down to funicular but Lower Town is flat. The most",
          "This was a ridiculous venture to ride a very slow cable car for $3.50. It is a steep but short slope and in the future as we are able-bodied, would never do again. If you have a stroller or are physically impaired clearly this is a must to get to old town. Otherwise skip.",
          "If you're wanting to get from Upper Town to Lower Town, the funicular might be a good idea, especially if you want to avoid climbing the many stairs. You also get good view of the St. Lawrence, and of Levis. Not inexpensive for the short ride, but probably worth the",
          "It is a nice experience for the view and considering the fact that it is the only one working in America\u2019s.",
          "The funicular is a very short ride from Old Quebec to Upper as a change from the 312 steps. $3.75 one way in 2019.",
          "Quick connection to upper and lower town. Cost $3.50 per person per trip. It is not air conditioned, so expect it to be uncomfortable on a hot day! Queues can be long at certain times of day, so expect to wait a bit.",
          "Not worth taking down to Old Town, but can save you from a tough walk up (depending on your athleticism). Cash required. Staff was just thereto do a job. Not \"fun\" and the views are ok. More for function or for the kids to experience something new.Not a must-see attraction.",
          "The name.. doesn't tell it all. Something called \"Funicular\" I expected (maybe ignorantly) to be a \"Fun\" ride. That's not what this is/was. That's not to say it wasn't great though. We had planned to explore this on our recent trip if for no other reason than to be able to",
          "It is affordable. Good for those who have kids or Elderly or are pregnant if they\u2019re too tired to take the stairs. Adults pay around 7 CAD each while kids below a certain feet(maybe 3\u20195 ft) are free.",
          "A life saver for someone that is too tired to walk up to Upper Quebec. The ride is less than one minute therefore we cannot see or enjoy much from this spectacular city view from the top .",
          "Price for this travel about less for 1 min is 3$50 . Better going walk with stairs for 5-7 min to the hotel.",
          "Didn't use it ourselves, but it is very popular and would certainly take the hard work out of seeing the most hilly city I have ever visited.",
          "Nice to do, just use it to go up, there is a small cost involved. The view is nice and the way it is managed is good, no waiting when we where there.",
          "Short ride \u2014 cash only \u2014 1:1 exchange-rate rip-off of when the official rate was 76 cents Canadian to a US dollar. But they\u2019re the only such game in town.",
          "The funicular is very handy to take up from lower town. We rode it about three times (down once and used Breakneck stairs down once, and up twice). We were going to have a late dinner in the lower town, and I had to go inside at the top level just to find hour of closing.",
          "With the tricky icy and snowy walkways, the funicular was a great choice to negotiate the hill. Super convenient and a good deal. As well as historical.",
          "I think the company needs to invest in some people people - cause this is not their calling. The guy at the bottom was the worst cause he didn\u2019t explain clearly to the people in front of us who were not French and his tone was borderline agressive. And unnecessarily annoyed. I",
          "We walked up the hill of steps from lower town to upper town. We always used the Funicular to return - bring cash as they do not accept checks or credit cards.",
          "This leads you from lower parts of old town Quebec city to close to Notre Dame cathedral of Quebec. Very nice view from the top",
          "The family was so excited and wanted to experience the funicular ride. I think it was C$3.50 per person and though it is a short ride, it was different for everyone. Kids would definitely love this.",
          "Easy up/down to old city; steps are brutal!!; small area with lots of nice shops and restaurants/coffee shops; well worth the visit",
          "We took this as a fun little \"to do\" after returning from Levi. The funicular is efficient, and not expensive. This is excellent for anyone who has a hard time walking any distance and/or uphill.",
          "Only drawback was after a late dinner in the lower city, the funicular was closed! It's a steep treck back and not for the faint of heart...or call and Uber!",
          "A fun ride to avoid the many steps to the upper city iin Quebec, $3.50 Canadian for one way. Take it up to get the views then Walk down....",
          "It is certainly easier to take the funicular than to walk. But it is also fun to see the views and to experience the steep drop.",
          "Avoids hill climbing for C$ 3.50 per person. Takes less than 2 minutes. Smooth and scenic. Each car holds only about 20 people, so a wait is possible if busy. They don\u2019t take credit cards. All I had was USD and was elated when I got the same back in change.",
          "If you\u2019re in a hurry, or need the transportation, it is interesting. Starts in the historical location of Jolliet\u2019s house. The line moves fairly fast, but we\u2019ve been here for days, and it\u2019s quicker to just walk up the street or the nearby terrace of stairs.",
          "Loved this quick ride back to our hotel, the Chateau Frontenac ... the lines can get long but generally move quickly. It's an easy way to get back up that steep hill! Cost was $3.50.",
          "Best way between upper and lower city. Worth the price. Sometimes a line so plan on that. They only take cash.",
          "My wife and I rode the Old Qu\u00e9bec Funiculaire after visiting the Lower Town of Old Qu\u00e9bec. Originally we walked down from the upper town to take the cruise on the Louis Jolliet. On the way back, we were a little tired and we really wanted to ride the Funiculaire. It was a",
          "Lots of lines during busy tourist season but convenient to travel to the upper and lower sections of the Old City.",
          "This is very simply a unique thing in the world. There are a few other cities that have this kind of lift but not many. You get some great views of the city and it gives you a chance to avoid the stairs. Certainly you don\u2019t need to take this up the hill every time you are",
          "Its good trip way up as it saves a lot of your time and energy. Its fun short ride up but it accepts only cash, so be prepared",
          "just a short ride to the top. You can walk but on a hot day you will prefer to pay C$3.50 pp in cash (no credit cards); it's an energy saver since it's 210 feet to the top. Walk down, if you like. It's doable. Probably don't want to tackle this in a wheel chair. Enjoy the view",
          "When you are tired from walking up and down all the hills and stairs in old Quebec this funicular is a fun way to avoid stairs especially going up.",
          "Did not want to exhaust my little legs first thing in the morning so took the ferry from Levis and the funicular up the hill to the Frontenac and a day out in old Quebec City. Mechanically it was in good condition and obviously upgraded regularly. The ride was smooth on tires",
          "Nice way to make it from the bottom of the hill to the attractions on top. It is $3.50 cash only and the lines can be lengthy but I found it moves fairly quick. In the several trips we made we took the funicular up and stairs on the return as they are a simple descent.",
          "Took this up several years ago. Lines seem long but go quickly. Having taken steps down both then and now, am so glad QC maintains this treasure that is TOTALLY worth the price!!!",
          "Just a warning that although they will take US dollars, they will not give you the going rate. Make sure to withdraw some Canadian $$ at a bank before you descend the stairs, especially if you have some members of your group who could have trouble climbing the hill, and need to",
          "Affordable (3.5CAN), convenient, and a great way to see areial views of the city. There are a LOT of stairs to climb to get up and down to the lower city, which is a great way to work off a shake from the Chic Shack (a must do!) but it's great to have an alternative at the end",
          "The Funiculaire was built in 1879 and is still going strong. We saw strollers onboard when we rode it. It is a must for those too tired to walk the stairs and steep sloped roads back up to uppertown! During the heatwave in the first week of July 2019 it was a Godsend!",
          "This cable car ride connects the Dufferin Terrace with lower town for those not up to going up the steep stairs. The ride costs 3$ and it open as early as 730 am and closes at 1030pm.",
          "This was a fun little ride. Lines are long but moved fast and beat the heck out of going up and down the steep steps.",
          "$3.50 Canadian (each way) for a very short ride in a very hot little cable car. They prefer cash, but may take a credit card if you buy something else (e.g., water, souvenir). This is essentially a convenience, not a great ride in itself.",
          "It was a rather tame experience considering the little distance it had to travel but a short panoramic view of the mighty St Lawrence river was worth the ride .",
          "Expensive ride, for seconds only. Young strong people can do this walk in 5 minutes. No air conditioning during the ride. Felt like they are economizing on the tourist\u2019s expense.",
          "We did not partake of the adventure but took the steps. It looked too steep for me but people were in line for the experience",
          "best way to get from lower city to upper....don't forget to turn around for the view. Not expensive either.",
          "I've been on a few funicular rides over recent years including in Budapest (Castle Hill); Los Angeles; Ba Na Hills of Da Nang, Vietnam; Saint-Jean funicular in Lyon, France; and more. Although I.ve been on a few, I found it exciting, the views great, and certaily better than",
          "For C$3.50, this is a good deal to get from the lower to upper town sections, and you get a nice view along the way. We used it on a busy Saturday, and yet there was not much of a wait.",
          "ok view, 3.50 and not really a ride. it's an elevator with a view. Hot inside and stuffy. but if you have issues w/stairs = great",
          "This is a great way to get from upper and lower town. It is a little expensive - $3.50 per person, one way but it was worth it when you have have arthritic knees and stairs are painful. Cash only though.",
          "this railway is hidden away just look like a shop at the bottom but easy to find at the top its a bit pricey but saves the climb",
          "For $3.50, take a quick ride to connect upper & lower town in Old Quebec. It is stuffy on a hot day but a leg saver and a nice view.",
          "My wife had knee surgery a year ago and hence, we took the Funicular to get from Upper Town to Lower Town and back. The most is $ 3.50 per person each way. The whole thing takes about 1 minute but saves you from a lot of stairs",
          "We took a quick ride $3.50 per person down the side of the wall. It is cash only, so make sure you have money. It is also per ride - no return ticket.",
          "Interesting ride up the hill to the Frontenac. We did not ride down. If you have a thing with heights, it may bother you as there are clear windows for the view. I don\u2019t recall the cost, but if you\u2019ve seen the height of the old city from the lower part, you would definitely",
          "Excellent way to travel to the original part of the city. I had as much fun watching the kids ooh and ahh. Well worth the 3,50$",
          "Definitely worth paying for this to get to the top. Very cheap and saves the steps. Man at till was a bit gruff, could have at least smiled at my attempts to speak in french",
          "It wouldn\u2019t have been too bad walking from upper to lower Quebec but for $3.50 riding the Funicular was worth the experience.",
          "Fun, quick, efficient and much easier on the legs than all those stairs. Located near the Place d'Armes and tour transportation, it links the Haute-Ville to the Basse-Ville. You have to try it at least once.",
          "Our friends insisted on going on this windowed \u201c elevator\u201d and we were glad we did. Costing $3:50 pp, the short ride offers some beautiful views across the water taking you into the bottom streets filled with character and charm. I would certainly advise using it if you have",
          "We used this during our trip to Q C. Loved the convenience and step saving on the hills. Worth the cost for sure.",
          "Great for viewing the city and sea below. Also can walk about to see the Citadelle and Frontenac. $3.50 CAN. Can walk down the hill for exercise and save some cash!",
          "It's inexpensive and saves steps to the upper town. Well worth the price and yo0u get added benefit of photo opportunities.",
          "Well it was either pay to ride this to upper old Quebec or climb 300 steps. So I guess it was worththe money and they only take Cash!",
          "It\u2019s a short ride but well worth it! Just to experience Old Quebec City and it\u2019s European charm! Cost was $3 Canadian each way. We went down then took stairs back up.",
          "This funicular railway runs from the old town down to a very tourist oriented street at the bottom of the hill",
          "We walked the hills and all the steps but a couple of times we needed to get to the top faster. Requiring cash in this day is a bit crazy.",
          "Easy way to get from one part of old Quebec to another part, rather than taking the stairs. Great fun and reasonably priced",
          "This small ride up the hill is an open vehicle surrounded with glass. Its cost to go up and it cost to go down. Its good for people with a walking handicap. For us, we took it up since the first day there, it wasn't open. So we found our way down through Old City and outside the",
          "Fun way to travel. The funicular was a great way to get back and fourth between upper and lower Quebec",
          "Although we used the steep steps several times to get to the upper areas of Quebec City, it was fun to ride the Old Quebec Funicular at least once. A short ride, but great views and a must for those with mobility problems.",
          "The funicular takes you up or down a very big hill. It\u2019s walkable, but ride it at least once for the view. Cash only.",
          "I'm scared of heights but braved the Funicular several times and the breathtaking views were well worth the experience.",
          "Old Quebec is hilly! My legs are old and get tired more easily than they used to! Voila, a funicular, which takes you up (or down) for a reasonable price. It\u2019s also a fun ride.",
          "It is $3.50 and they accept cash only, you can also take stairs to go to lower town if have ability to walk",
          "For those weary travelers who don't have the energy to walk up the 1,000 stairs, this transportation is perfect for you. While riding this from either the top to bottom or bottom to top, you will get a great view of the lower city and the St. Lawrence river. The ride is very",
          "My friend & I wanted to go to the Lower part of Quebec City & she suggested to go down there via the Funicular. I said what is it & she just said come on you will be amazed! We brought 2 tickets for $3.50 each & then suddenly the man told us to open the door & step into the",
          "While on a visit to Old Quebec, one should never miss the spectacular view from the upper city of the gushing St Lawrence River below or a walk through the lower part of the city. This area, with typical old French narrow streets and shops gives you the real feel of Old Quebec.",
          "It only takes about one minute to get from the upper and lower towns using the funicular. It is very efficient and easy to use. Keep in mind they no longer accept credit card so it\u2019s all cash. It\u2019s $3.50 per person for a one way ride.",
          "This was a wonderful option after walking around old Quebec for a few hours. You can ride it up or down, or both ways to get to the shops below. Only $3.50 but well worth it!",
          "Saves a lot of time getting from lower town to upper town and vice versa as the trip is less than a minute and relatively inexpensive at $3.50 a trip",
          "It was $3.50 to go up the ride. Something to do once. It was neat. There is a little gift shop as well. Saves walking up the hills all the time.",
          "I've never seen anything like this before and it is awesome. My feet were killing me from so much walking so we took this instead of the stairs.. Make this part of your excursion.",
          "We rode the funicular both up and down. If you have never ridden one or want to avoid the steps - just to do it. We are early enough in the season where there was no wait. The ride is very short but it avoids the walk and provides an interesting view.",
          "Took this ride yesterday from Petit Champlain amd brings you right at Chateau Frontenac. $3 ride will save you lots of steps. Very beautiful views as well.",
          "Being at the top of a cliff or at the bottom of one wanting to get to the other makes the Funicular only good if it's operating. Walking down is one thing walking up for me impossible but the walkways were closed as well!!! Get a grip Quebec close one or the other not both.",
          "A great way to quickly get to le Petit Champlain from the area of the Chateau. Cost was a little pricey ($7.00 per person each way), but the view was great.",
          "We were on a walking tour which included the funicular. I hate heights and was dreading it. Thankfully, our guide stopped to say something just before we went in. While we waited, one car stopped halfway up and it was closed. We took the steps. Disaster averted.",
          "This is great if you are handicapped but otherwise it's cheaper and more fun to take the Breakneck Steps between the upper and lower town areas of old Quebec City.",
          "Short ride and kind of pricey given that it\u2019s just a minute and you can also walk up for free, but it\u2019s good to do once. Good views.",
          "If you are going up - face away from the hill so that you get a view of the river. It is a short ride but interesting and costs about $3.50 per person.",
          "This was a convenient way to get up & down the hill. They only take cash. The view was great. There no restrooms and there are still some stairs to navigate. It was clean and fast.",
          "You have to ride this funicular as it part of the history of the town. There are reasonable views and it takes less that three minutes. The walk uphill is not that bad but you may want to take this at the end of a long day !!",
          "The original Funicular was replaced long ago by this glass-enclosed version but it's still an excellent and inexpensive way to get to or from the lower town. You also get a fantastic aerial view. Note that the Funiculars closes in icy weather. When it does, you're forced to",
          "I think this is something fun for first time visitors. Or if the hilly walk to/from the Frontenac is too strenuous. Very cool.",
          "Great way to get up and down quickly. Did this several times while we were in Quebec City. Not expensive either.",
          "It is an overpriced elevator that brings you down the hill. No need to pay just go down the hill. It is not that bad. They do not accept credit cards and I did not have cash so I was forced to walk. I saved some money! I recommend paying to go up if you have knee or hip",
          "We stayed in the Lower City, so used the funicular several times to go up the hill while sightseeing. No lines when we were there.",
          "It was cool to take the Funicular, we rode it a few times. You can walk, but in the cold it was just easier. The operators were nice enough, the price is a little steep for what it is. But if it's your first time in Quebec it is worth doing.",
          "Touristy but certainly one way to travel from the lower city to the upper city. Not many of these funiculars are left so that gives it a bit of nostalgia which to me was enough reason to ride.",
          "Something to experience at least once! $3.25 one way, but after walking g around all day, it was better than the stairs!",
          "Short ride from lower town to upper town...less than five minutes. If you can't walk up steps then this is the way to go; however, it is quite easy to walk up \"breakneck stairs\". We did it once for the experience...but once was enough.",
          "easy way to get down the cliff to the riverside history. clean and dry and inexpensive.wave to the tourists below.",
          "The Funicular saves wear and tear on your legs as instead of walking up or down a very steep street to get to the river level from the boardwalk could be an adventure on a cold icy day. The funicular is not free and charges about 3 dollars one way. Try it once just to say you",
          "We were here for business, but the funiculaire made the trip fun. Much better than the hundreds of steps for an older couple. Kind of touristy but found good restaurants. Funiculaire was easy to navigate.",
          "It is quite possible to walk between the lower and upper parts of old Quebec. However, the funicular is convenient and barrier free for those using wheelchairs or pushing prams. It is also safer as the slope of the streets in places is quite steep. This funicular ride is",
          "Super fun and quick visit. Jump on the awesome thing and have your phone ready for the coolest Instagram video you\u2019ll get in all Quebec. I believe it was $3.50 per person - they only take cash but were able to take $USD. Super fun.",
          "We were a group with three small kids and two strollers wanting to descend. You enter a closed area and you need to descend by stairs or take the elevator. I entered the area and was waiting for the rest of the group when the operator yelled at me that I could not be there, I",
          "What kind of a big city attraction only takes cash? Ridiculous. The views are great but it\u2019s a quick ride up.",
          "Oh my goodness, after walking (trudging, really) through snow all over the Lower City, the idea of hiking up the steep hills through the snow to return to our hotel was appalling. The Funicular saved the day (and our marriage!). Very reasonably priced and transported us to the",
          "The employee was friendly and helpful. It waa especially appreciayted that he spoke English so well and willingly. We went in one direction then found the historic staircase",
          "The last time I was in Quebec I was disappointed the the funicular was not running, so I was excited to find it operational this time I don\u2019t think it would be worth the ride down other than in the dead of winter but it is a reasonably priced experience to avoid the breakneck",
          "During the winter this is the easiest way to travel between upper and lower old town. Stairs can be very slippery. Cost is very reasonable. And it is convenient.",
          "Very convenient specially if you are looking at visiting the low part of the city with kids or older people. It helps avoid a painful climb up the hill. The inconvenient part is that I was paying for the group and... they only take cash... Not very convenient for tourists or",
          "I was overly excited to finally ride the Old Quebec Funicular. Such a unique piece of history. Funiculaire du Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec was built by a fellow named William Griffith in 1879. The dual-car railroad is 210 feet long and travels at a 45-degree angle, ultimately depositing",
          "On a very cold , snowy, icy day, the funicular made a trip down to Petit Champlain or up to Old Quebec a much less tricky proposition. Such a quick and efficient process and a quick trip. Very friendly staff. Cool views either direction.",
          "If you\u2019re traveling to and from Petit-Champlain this means of getting back and forth was definitely easy on the knees and offers beautiful views.",
          "You have to ride the Funicular! We rode down to the Old City and the view was spectacular! Even if you just ride it down and back, worth the money!",
          "An excellent connection between the upper and lower towns. Great views and reasonably priced. Might consider implementing a daily pass for visitors.",
          "Quick trip down to Petit Champlain (or more importantly back up!). Cost is $3.50 each way. Only takes about 2 minutes but saves you some pretty steep stairs.",
          "Gotta try it! The line doesn\u2019t take too long to experience a one-of-a-kind steam-punk-type ride, even if a bit pricey.",
          "I\u2019ve never encountered such rudeness as we did from the ticket sellers on each end. Cash only, even if you want to purchase an expensive hat. Costs $3.50 per person. Just take the stairs unless you\u2019re injured or at a fall risk. The view is actually better from the stairs.",
          "Short ride saves quite a climb up steps. Great view of the city and river. Reasonable price $3.50 per person.",
          "This was something I missed last time I came to Quebec city! I think it's a fun experience that's handy and offers an incredible view!",
          "Took the binocular several times to go from the lower city to the upper city. It is efficient and reasonably priced. We walked down each time and rode it back up. The walk down, however is very steep and treacherous because in Quebec City, they pretty much do not shovel the",
          "We enjoyed this view of Lower Town/Petit Champlain, but thought $3.50 CND per person was a bit pricey for what it was. Word to the wise: don't be like us, take the Casse-Cou steps DOWN and the Funicular UP...",
          "We took this ride to get warm briefly and avoid the ice on the walkway but it was a nice ride with views",
          "Love Finiculaires and this one was fantastic and probably injury preventing in the snow slippery weather at the time. A long ride, steep gradient and the views of the housing against the cliff walls was unusual then the spectacular views of the frozen St. Lawrence River",
          "Totally worth the $3 to avoid walking up or down the icy streets. The views from the funicular are stunning, especially the river flowing down.",
          "Large lines await this wild and adventurous ride up the steep hillside but the lines move fast. Just hold on and enjoy the view!",
          "We enjoyed taking the funicular specially on the cold day we visited Quebec City. It was nice and relaxing with some pretty nice views of Old Quebec.",
          "It might not be nice to say, only the crazy ones will want to walk up, but on a cold and windy day, it may very well be the truth! The line pours out the building at the base, but it really does move exceedingly fast so do not let that fool you. Some of the best views are the",
          "Excellent views on the trip, moves quickly without lurching, not that scary (I have a strong fear of heights).",
          "This is a fun if not slightly unnerving ride for those who are afraid of elevators or heights. The views are awesome, and it is worth it in the winter to save you a potentially slippery walk to lower town or an exerting hike up in any season.",
          "I have a couple of health issues that make doing that many stairs a problem. And just staring at a bunch of stairs is probably not the most beautiful way of looking at the city so the finish killer is actually fantastic works really well and is easy to navigate.",
          "You can save yourself many steps by taking the Funicular. There was never a line, and you are quickly in the Upper Town while enjoying a fantastic view. I took the stairs up only once in my 5 day visit to QC and down a couple of times. I would say you should do the stairs at",
          "After climbing down, then up the previous day, this was the way to go. There was no line, it was not expensive, and it was very quick. Similar to the inclines in Pittsburgh, but a much smoother ride.",
          "It's only a 2 minute trip, but it's a nice experience and view for $3.50 each way. There is shopping on the street below.",
          "Nice view but short ride. You save over 150 steps or the climb in the step streets. Really inexpensive.",
          "great short cut with fab views while walking thru to differant levels of the city...can take good photos",
          "We took the funicular (French Canadian translation of the Pittsburghese \u201cincline\u201d) from our hotel (Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac) down to see Quartier du Petit Champlain. Fun ride that takes 3 min or so, and well worth it to see the sites at the top or bottom!!",
          "I would give this a 5 if they offered a family or daily pass! It\u2019s not too expensive but once we found it we were spoiled and spent a lot there. The view is beautiful especially with the streets lit up for the holidays. Never had a line so it\u2019s a quick easy ride to the",
          "The Funicular provides a unique way to access the lower part of town. Little kids might get a kick out of it but you won't miss much if you choose to walk",
          "It was well worth taking the funicular in both directions as it was so quick and easy, with no queues, and great value. In addition, it was tipping with rain, so rapid transport was appreciated. Great views from the top, and quaint cobbled streets with interesting shops at",
          "7$ for a 30 second ride for 2 adults ... what more can be said ? Old Quebec is a giant tourist trap .",
          "Nice to ride back up from the river level to upper city. Funicular was not air conditioned when we were there so it was stuffy but it is a short ride.",
          "Well worth the price, particularly if you are in the lower city and want to avoid a very steep climb. Plus the view is great.",
          "We took the funicular from the plaza outside of the Frontenac down to the rue Champlain. The cost was 7 CAD for 2 people. We should have taken the ride up as the climb up the road and stairs was a workout! The street itself was decorated for the holidays and the stores sold",
          "We loved the history, but winter makes it difficult to experience everything. The original art & craft shops were exciting & unusual. The xmas decorations delighted everyone and really put us in the holiday spirit. I would love to go back in the summer as well . Bring your",
          "Definitely different. Great ride with beautiful views. Pricing is ok. A must see! Whole family can ride together.",
          "We used this to get down to the Old City from the Hotel. It a lot easier than walking Down and back Up. And nice view of the Water .",
          "We stayed in lower QC and spent our first 1.5 days there then to9k a food tour which brought us up to a different world ....7.00 ro8ntrip great views short lines so it makes for a nice day ....",
          "I have to say, the price was a bit much but it's definitely a fun thing to do! I do wish we had taken it go up instead of down! LOL!!!",
          "If you are tired this mode of transport gets you up or down the Quebec City cliff between upper town and lower town, but it's not that far a walk around either, if you want to save the money.",
          "We stumbled upon the Funicular when exploring around the Chateau Frontenac. My Mom had heard of it and wanted to give it a try. We timed it just right and there was no wait and for a pretty low cost ($3.50 I believe), it took us right down to Petit-Champlain, which is lovely. It",
          "Nice way to go up to the Frontenac and skip the hill. Nice view on the ride up. Take you to top of the hill.",
          "Not worth the $3.50 at least on the down ride! It\u2019s barely a 30 second ride hardly enough time to get pictures and the man selling tickets is particularly rude. (Well at least on Saturday 15 December he was!)",
          "I can think of three funiculars from around the world that I have had the pleasure of riding. The first one was in Greece on the island of Santorini. A fabulous ride down the hill from Thera. The second one was in Spain above Monserrat. A beautiful, spacious coach above the",
          "What an unusual ride to the Petite Champlain... great views and cheap tickets. Will definitely ride again.",
          "We took the Funicular from outside the Chateau Frontenac to the Old town below, great view of the pretty Christmas lights on the way down the hill.",
          "The diffrent streets full of history, the colorful building paintings displaying the life of the old quebecoise, the cul the sac short street with its truly quebecoise meals, the umbrellas covering the street sky, the small shops with a large variety of goods, the nice",
          "I used this to go from upper to lower section. It was CAD $7 or so one way. It was great because the stairs were a bit icy and I had a minor knee injury. Had a nice view.",
          "Great way to traverse between upper and lower town when icy and cold. Great view. Reasonable fee for convenience and experience",
          "It's really a unique attraction in Quebec- a must do for the views and the experience of riding a funicular. It's $3.50 each way per person. Connects the lower town to the upper town. In the lower town it lets off right in the middle of the shopping area. In the upper town",
          "It was too brief a ride for the cost. You just get going at it somewhat ends. The good point is the view of the St. Lawrence River, but it's brief. It does save on the legs for the walk up could be hard on the knees. The walk down was picturesque, and not bad, depending on",
          "very short and charges $3 per person. Take this if you are going up to the top of the hill. There is steps you can take down.",
          "Definately a must. You can walk up and down of course but the Funicular is so much easier and much more fun with kids.",
          "The $3CAD 60 second trip was our first. If you need the help getting up or down the incline it is a great convenience. Otherwise take the steps for the same ride. The cashier did not want to accept a credit card and wanted cash exchanged at $1USD for $1CAD. (Heck I'd like that",
          "A great way to go up or down, plus you get great views f the city and the river below. The people are a lot of fun too.",
          "The funicular is a great way to get from the bottom of Old City Quebec to the top with a great view. Even if you were like us and wanted exercise walking the city. At least one ride is a must!",
          "$3.50CA for a short little ride up or town the city wall. Nice views at night and to be able to say we did it.",
          "This is a very quick way to get to the upper town from the lower without killing yourself on the steep roads. It's not very expensive and has a senior rate.",
          "After trekking all around lower town with three kids, it was nice to ride back up on a motorized car. It saved our tired legs from all of the stairs back up. The man at the bottom tried to give us the best deal possible with our littlest one, which we appreciated. He was just",
          "Have an interesting view when you go up (or down) the escarpment on the funicular. Not only is the view good, but to walk from the top to the bottom and reverse is a lot of stairs which you can skip for just a few dollars.",
          "after about 5 trips up the crazy stairs from petit champlain, the funicular was a welcome reprieve. i wouldn't call it a must do but certainly a gift -ha! have cash on hand",
          "This is a short ride that my wife and I wanted to try for the experience. We took it going down so our knees were happy about that. We did walk back up though.",
          "Less than 2 minute ride up the hill but thing that struck me was everyone taking pictures up the hill and yet if you looked out the back window the view was amazing!",
          "The steps in Quebec City are brutal!! My wife and I chose to walk down, but take the Funicular back up. Excellent views after dark!!",
          "We walked down the many stairs that go from upper old Quebec City to lower Quebec City but enjoyed taking the Funicular back to upper Quebec City. The price was $3.50 Canadian. Very fun to use.",
          "We used the Funicular to rise to the Frontenac Hotel level of the city and it was worth the expense.",
          "We took the funicular from lower town to upper town, mostly to for the experience. It's a short ride with a nice view as you clim higher.",
          "Great place to go plus you avoid the steep steps or steep hill walking up. The views are ok from here but it's something to experience if you come to Quebec City. For 3.50$ Canadian it's pretty reasonable. If you are with people who have trouble walking you can walk down to",
          "I love a these funny little railways, this one fitted the bill, after a lovely couple of hours in the lower town, what better way to get up above than this, can\u2019t remember exactly how much it cost, but inexpensive for a little joy!",
          "This isn't a very long ride but it can come in handy if you don't feel like walking back to the top after sightseeing/shopping in the lower town.",
          "Quick, clean, convenient, inexpensive. So glad they were there. If a person cannot walk up the hills, they can easily use the funicular and not miss out on anything. And it will not break the bank.",
          "Can you walk from the upper to lower town? Yes, you can. But how many times in life do you get to take a funicular? It\u2019s a smooth, slow ride but helps when you are tired or if you just want to do something different. Don\u2019t be too put off by a long looking line - it goes pretty",
          "Funiculars are always a fun little ride to get from the top to bottom or vice versa or round-trip. This does not disappoint. The view from the top is right next to the Fairmont Le Chateau Frontenac. There are statues at the top, and amazing view of the St. Lawrence river and",
          "It was cheap and fun, but very quick. I was excited to enjoy a ride up, but it is really only about 30 seconds. We are glad we did it for the experience, but I was excited to be in it longer. But again, it was $12 Canadian dollars for our family of four, so $8-$10 bucks. We",
          "You can walk up and down some steps or you can pay $3.50 to be taken one way up or down in less than 30 seconds. It\u2019s windows are glass so you can see out but other than that it is just a glorified lift (elevator) get over it. There are a great many period Attractions here so",
          "If you have any trouble with steps, take the funicular and save your steps for walking around town. Going down isn't so bad.",
          "Change is given in US if you pay in US$. Very short ride but eliminates the walk to the top, which isn't bad if you take your time.",
          "This was a fun little addition to the trip, it provides a great view and the shops at the bottom are beautiful to explore.",
          "Learning the history of the area is eye opening. It is worth the time to walk down one of the side streets and visit the shops on the lower level, then take the Funicular up to the hotel",
          "The Funicular isn't the most exciting adventure but it surely gets you from here to there quickly and easily. And of course you have to try it as it is one of the things Old Quebec is famous for. So try it - you'll like it!",
          "It is only a short ride...$2 would be a better price, then I would have gone both ways. $3.50 is toooo much for a one way trip. Tourist trap I think.",
          "The Old Quebec Funicular is a unique way of making the trip between the Upper and Lower portions of Old Quebec. It\u2019s a cable car system that feels like an elevator on an incline. The two booths act as a counterbalance, so as one ascends the cliff, the other descends. They\u2019re",

          "This is a fun way to get up and down between upper and lower town. You'll get a great view of the St. Lawrence River and the town of Levis on the other side.",
          "With the four of us getting out-a-walking at 8 AM we did not see that many people on the streets, but by the time we returned to the ship at 1:30 PM, the streets below and above the old walled city, were quite noticeably active with tourist / residence enjoying the day. We took",
          "When you first see the funiculaire, it appears longer and more fearful than it really is. However, that being said, it is still a beautiful adventure. Looking ahead at the St. Lawrence, especially when there is activity on the river, is just magnificent. This is a must in Quebec",
          "At my age...going down a very long stair case from Chateau Frontenac to Quartier Petit Champlain is not so bad; getting back up is a whole other story! The Funicular is reasonably priced and is a scenic and somewhat unique way to get up and down the cliff.",
          "It is an efficient way to go back up from petite champlain. The breakneck stairs are cute but not a big deal to go up and down esp when it is crowded. The view is simple ok of the town below.",
          "Fun different kind of transport to take you up to chateau Frontenac from the lower shops. Wasn\u2019t busy end of September",
          "The walk to the lower city is very pleasant but the thought of the climb back up is not - so take this easy ans efficient way. For just a few dollars this is definitely the way to go back up to the Chateau Frontenac. Queues are managed very efficiently but try to avoid a day",
          "We walked down for shopping in lower town and rode the train up. Great fun with a reasonable price. Go for it",
          "Its not a place to visit but rather a transportation that will bring you from upper to lower Old Quebec. If travelling during winter. I suggest to check if they open because I think they are closed during winter times.",
          "Cost one way is 3.50$ and makes the trip very quick, esp. If you were on a walking town. Not wheelchair accessible. Line was long on the weekend.",
          "The funicular is really good if you have a stroller or physical disability that makes steps difficult, as steps are a huge part of Old Quebec. The trip is short, the views are nothing special (you can see the same thing elsewhere). At least it is not expensive for what it is-",
          "Walk down and spare yourself the hike back up (or vice versa) for $3.50 Canadian. Likely not a better deal in the city (except maybe the ferry across the river to Levis.",

          "Although Old Quebec is very walkable, and this is our prefered way to get around, there are hills, and the Funicular is great to cut out some of the walking time when traveling with young children or people with mobility issues. It is also just a fun thing to do and the children",
          "Be sure to read the history of this historic conveyance. It is the perfect way to get to/from the Old city to the Terrace Dufferin. Costs a bit for the short ride but it's a lifesaver after a long day of walking.",
          "Save you legs and take this up to the upper levels by the hotel and restaurants. Great views from the Funicular and at the top. You can always walk down but it is worth it to take this up.",
          "It\u2019s sure as easy to skip the stairs but we should walk- but it was raining..... so there you go. Expensive at 3.50 for about a minute,but they do smile when taking your money.",
          "The stairs are off to the side, so the first time in Quebec we thought we had to do the Funicular. it is worth doing, but I recommend taking it on the way back up instead, as you need to pay for it.",
          "Talk about a gold mine. Every time we walked past the entrance to the Old Quebec Funicular, there was a line up. Admission for one adult is $3.50 CDN, CASH ONLY. The staff are so efficient and professional, it's like watching a mint print money. Only faster. The ride up barely",
          "Had to give this a try. Fascinating how it works. View is good from the upper part. Give it a try. Fee is for a one way trip. We took it down and walked all around the lower part and kept walking g to the upper part. Can't get lost!",
          "We took the funicular once during our recent 3-day stay in Quebec City. The price has gone up to $3.50, but it is still a worthwhile trip up the hill. Great views!",
          "There can be a line but it moves quickly. You get a pretty view if you look out the back of the car, it is a short ride.",
          "Loved the idea of this to go up and down to visit petit chamberlain area. Easy access and 3.50 each way. Not to bad since it saves on the legs . I did both walking up/ down and the funicular up/ down. If money is an issue easy to walk down stairs and much harder to walk up. So",
          "It\u2019s a very quick ride on the funicular but it\u2019s not expensive and it\u2019s good fun. The views are good and you can always walk back down!",
          "No big deal Kids would love it It takes you from the water front up to the plaza by the fairmont hotel Great view of the area from the plaza",
          "I would say a must-do in Old Quebec City. Nice view, simple ride. Inexpensive. An easy way to make it too the top.",
          "Only a little ride and not for people with height issues. Costs as much as the entire bus trip in but..",
          "We did this just for fun and because we were tired. At $3.50 a person to get down to the river, I'd rather have taken a cab. It does land you in the charming but touristy waterfront nearer the river.",
          "Our hotel reception recommended taking the funicular down to the shops and restaurants of old town Quebec. It was $7 for two adults one way bus fun thing to experience. Very easy to take the alternative route back by climbing the breakneck steps. Not nearly as bad as they sound",
          "I can't believe how much they gouge people for this very short ride ... $7.50. Much better to walk down, or even back up if you are able.",
          "It goes up. It goes down. It costs $3.50. But everybody wants to ride it ... it's a traditional thing :)",
          "The Funicular is easy access to either the lower or upper city of Quebec. Cost is 3.50 Canadian for one way. Takes about 2 minutes for the ride.",
          "A great way to get from the Lower to the Upper City, but not awfully scenic - and since that's not the point, who cares about the scenery here when there is so much else to see?",
          "Took it in the day and at night. Sometimes the lines get really long. A bit scary but a really cool experience.",
          "It\u2019s a short distance ride, but it was fun with a beautiful view of the waterfront. If you are afraid of heights it\u2019s ok, not too scary",
          "Going to Lower town was a great trip..and the funicular is the only way to go..for older folk. The shops are quaint, expensive..but the lunch at the \"Rabbit Restaurant\"..not the real name..but means that...was so much fun...and the dessert was fantastic..service great!",
          "We enjoyed the views from the glassed-in, well-priced travel box. Each carriage is quite small but they travel frequently - the funicular is a cost-effective and efficient transport, especially if you're en route to a meeting or a tour. The views are the best part, of course -",
          "Save some time and walking uphill to get to the Fairmont from the lower quarter. Only lasts a minute or less with a nice view.",
          "If you really need to avoid the climb, take this for $3 each, but the m=nearby stairs are easy and there are places to rest. It is not too high, maybe like climbing 5-6 stories.",
          "Kind of a different type of elevator the cool part was you can see the whole town at the bottom where the water is as you're going down. Kids love it also since it's all glass. Seemed pretty safe to me.",
          "Fun experience to get down to Old Quebec. It was closed for maintenance when we were ready to go back up so we walked which was fine too.",
          "This thing drives me up the wall!!! If you want to skip the stairs hop on the funicular for a quick trip up or down the cliff. $3,50 per rider per trip",
          "Great way to get from upper to lower towns and very reasonable price. It is busy at times, but worth the queue.",
          "When in Quebec...you have to experience the Funicular! It's $3.50 for adults, but well worth it! It saves the long walk up...especially for an old guy like me! It lands near the Chateau Frontenac...which is a cool place to tour!",
          "It got us to the upper town quite nicely. They didn\u2019t take credit. We only had American as we had just gotten in. So he charged us the same amount in American as Canadian.",
          "Quick little trip down if you dont feel like your knees can take steps. Reminded me of Angels Flite in LA",
          "The funicular is a fun way to go the top of the city and is an inexpensive transportation method. The alternative is a long hill (which is a good cardio workout)",
          "We used the funicular as a way to get down from the upper part of the city. It is very quick and easy as well as reasonably priced. Gives a brief but nice view of the harbor.",

          "It would have been impossible for one in our group to climb all the stairs to reach Upper Town in Quebec City. So the Funicular made a visit to all of the historical areas of Quebec City Possible. The view while in the moving car and at the top is beautiful and we took a few",
          "$3.50 each way. It\u2019s a very short ride to take you either down to the lower city or up to the upper city. It\u2019s like an elevator on an incline. It would have provided wonderful views through the glass windows but we were the last ones in so our view were the people in front",
          "The funicular is a cable car like device that allows folks on the Old City Center to reach the bottom rather than navigate the steep winding sidewalk. Our tour guide mentioned it. So we decided to go down to the ship that way. Upon reaching the ticket desk we saw signs of $3.50",
          "is helpful when you don't want to do the walk up to the terraze dufferin .but the walk will do as well.",
          "The Funiculair comes in handy when leaving Petit Champlain area and avoiding the alternate way up which is a fairly extensive set up stairs back up the 'Terrace' (promenade area). $3.50 each way solo or in a group and if your watching your tourist budget best to walk down, then",
          "This was a typical funicular to get from the lower area to a higher area. A very quick trip with good views.",

          "Easy way to get to the top of the city or vice versa. Non- Threatening incline and a very short ride. Costs about 3.50 Canadian one way. If you are in a hurry or bad weather then take the Funicular. If you have the stamina and like to walk & exercise then climb the streets or",
          "Title says it all. When you\u2019ve tired of all the hills and stairs, funicular sure is worth the price.",
          "We spent the day walking around the City in hot, humid weather. The Funicular was a very welcome way to get back up from the lower part of town.",
          "Easy to ride. Short lines. People friendly. A great alternative to walking up the hill. Drops you off on top at the Fairmont.",
          "This is a great way to get from the waterfront area up to the older, more picturesque, part of town. Though at $3.50 USD, the price seems a bit steep, it sure saves a tough trek up the hill. Once on top, the walk back down is quite pleasant.",
          "Trip is quick and provides an option for travellers who have difficulty with stairs/inclines/declines. Did find it expensive for the length of the ride.",
          "So you pay $3 for a one way ticket down a hill when there are steps. I guess if you\u2019re elderly, disabled, or lazy I get it but there are steps otherwise that are free and you can see just as much in my opinion. Don\u2019t forget the fact they catch you at both ends with souvenirs.",
          "Very short trip up a steep incline to save walking up 200 steps and keeps your partner smiling. At $3.50 +tax its Worth it at the end of the day. Short queues meen your at the top in minutes.",

          "After walking around up top we took the steps down to the waterfront and the cobbled streets. Pleasant enough area and this is an ideal way to save the legs getting back up. Probably the best $3.50 spent in a while. Try and be the last one to board the coach to get the best",
          "Lovely view from the cable car. Easy way to get up the hill. It was closed one day, so we had to climb so many steps and then a hill to get up the cliff to be able to walk to our hotel. So much easier using the Funicular.",
          "Walk down to this brautiful area and enjoy all the quaint little cobbled streets - you will think you are in a little French village. Then to round off the experience take the funicular back up again. Quick and easy. Well worth the couple of dollars it will cost you",
          "Take this ride up the hill, save your lungs and get an amazing view of the town below and the water :)",
          "It's cheap enough that you feel like it's worth it to not climb stairs. About $3.50 per person. If it had been day time, we probably would have ridden up and then climbed down. No line when we went about 9 pm.",
          "The St Lawrence bluffs restrict travel routes between the upper and lower towns. Visitors can drive around the east end, hike up a few hundred stairs, or take the funicular... a cross between a small trolley and an elevator. Conveniently located, it's a fun way to conquer the",

          "To go from lower Quebec to the upper part you can walk some steps or instead travel by the Funicular, its always busy but the queue moves quickly and you get a nice view as you travel the slope, well worth the visit.",
          "This is simply a convenience, not an attraction. It is sort of whimsical in the sense of Charlie and the Glass Elevator. Other than that the views are the same you see once you get to the boardwalk in front of the Frontenac. You can clearly see this is a lift between the upper",
          "Price for the trip had gone up 50% to that quoted in our 2018 guide book. A short journey which was very necessary to get to the top after a couple of hours walking tour of the city in temperatures of over 30c.",

          "A gentle elevator ride from the base of Old Quebec village to the Dufferin Terrace and the Chateaux Frontenac. Take it for the ride and not as a mode of transport. A bit pricey.",
          "Lovely street, usually very busy during the day, but quite magical at night!",
          "Excellent choice if you want to go up faster from Petit Champlain to Dufferin Terrase. Stunning views to the Old Port and just $4.00 per person",
          "Convenient way to climb the hill quickly. Give it a go!",
          "Views are great and well worth the $3.50 CAD for one way or many trips! Not many of these around so it was fun to do! Take the stairs also as those are very beautiful as well. It was snowing but still pretty view:)",
          "It's useful, that's about it. Costs as much as any other form of public transit in town.",
          "If you have difficulty with stairs and sharp inclines or your just tired out this is a great way to help you see and experience all of Vieux Quebec. If you don't, it's a $3.50 elevator ride. I took it once just to experience this piece of history. Keep in mind, there may be line ups for it.",
          "This is a really magnificent place to visit ! I loved it so much ! Enjoy walking around this old town and enjoy the magnificent view !",
          "Unique elevator on rails. Saves climbing a lot of stairs.",
          "Does the job. A-B in under a minute for a fair fee. Didn't experience any wait time.",
          "Ready to use. Great time saver when travelling old Quebec on foot.",
          "should be fun and nice if me and my girlfriend could ride on it after 10 mins waiting on lines...when we finally got to cashier table, gentleman said \"cash only\" and pointed us the sign on the table...ahhhh~~~ we didn't have any cash on us \u2026",
          "I want to buy all the fine China of little price. They are beautiful!",
          "Good experience.  Enjoyed the Old City.  Lovely people.  A real sense of living history.",
          "Nice view from that elevator ride and keeps you away from getting too tired of street elevated walk.",
          "Loved visiting Old Quebec.  Lot of walking but so much to see and do.  The atmosphere is incredible.",
          "Took 140-150 stairs down to lower Quebec city. With lots of walking around  \"Rue Petit Champlainin\" and Ferry to L\u00e9vis, funiculaire was a great help getting back to Dufferin Terrace. Stay close to the door if you want to get a view of the height and Lawrence river. They only accept cash and kids under certain height are free!!",
          "Great views,  loved the old city streets, many cafes, lots of historic sites.",
          "A very short ride, but worth the view, a great way to get up and down the city quickly.",
          "#1. Saved an awful ascent via stairs.\n#2. Not a long wait.\n#3. Not terribly expensive (3.5 CDN$, but bring cash)\n#4. Kind of a neat view.",
          "Very busy, but service was excellent!  They moved the line along quickly!",
          "$3.50 one way for a ride, a ride that takes about 20 seconds. Absolutely ridiculous, take the stairs, save mine and walk past all the beautiful shops instad.",
          "Wild hobby.  Great people...  Certainly will be back Quebec.",
          "Totally not worth the money.  Nice view, but a rip off. The stairs are so much easier.",
          "Rude cashier and ready to cheat you.  Took us currency without giving me an exchange rate. And then shrugs his shoulder.  Makes a snide comment \"tell that to your president\". For someone who makes 100% of his income from tourists.. That's just arrogant.",
          "Beautiful place. Busy with happy tourists and even happier and friendly locals",
          "Beautiful views. Easier than stairs.",
          "Beautiful, interesting & fun area.\nMany things to see & do.",
          "Perfect option if you do not do not want to walk those steep streets!",
          "This place is so beautiful \u2764\ufe0f there is so much to see",
          "Every bit of those place is very beautiful and so wonderful.",
          "Old Quebec!!! Loved it. Be prepared to walk a lot, climb 5 sets of long stairs, but also expect to be awed with the views from up top. Stores have unique things but are expensive. Even restaurants are expensive....probably due to the tourist nature of the area.",
          "Very fun! A must do in QC",
          "We took it up the hill after a loooong walk, so definitely enjoyed the ride up, the view of the old city from above and also their gift shop and a nice chat with an attendant. I think I forgot my water bottle there, and tried calling multiple times with zero success, so if you need to reach them over the phone - forget it!:))",
          "Fun, quick, efficient and much easier on the legs than all those stairs. Located near the Place d'Armes and tour transportation, it links the Haute-Ville to the Basse-Ville. You have to try it at least once. Our friends insisted on going on \u2026",
          "Quick trip to the top. Make sure you take cash with you.",
          "The area you reach by funicular is just amazing, but the funicular itself is a bit expensive & they accept cash only!!",
          "So amazing.. love this place.",
          "More like a train on a downward ramp..short 2 mins ride down to the rue du petit champlain.",
          "Am elevator. That you pay to use.\n\nUsed it to go up and walked down. Knowing how short the walk is, I wouldn't pay to use it again.",
          "Not worth the price, too hot, very short ride.  If able bodied, just skip it.",
          "A great way to get from Petit Champlain up to Chateau Frontenac.  You can get there by stairs as well, but in the cold, and with the ice, this can be a nice break (and it's a steep walk back up!).  Ride is quick, but lines are quick and flow smoothly.  Costs $, so I wouldn't take it every time, but worth it at least once.",
          "A must do activity when visiting Quebec City",
          "I mean... you can walk if you want, climbing stairs like a loser, but you're better off taking this dealie.",
          "Wowww I loved this ride . Definitely worth it .",
          "Have used it many many times to go up and down over the years.\n\nLast year they accepted CCs, this year Cash only, unless you buy something in the store then you can pay by card for everything.\n\nPrice has gone up very steeply in the last 4-5 \u2026",
          "Reminded me of the funiculaire in Bergin, Norway and in Montmartre, Paris France. Enjoy the view!",
          "The only cash only place in 5 days of Canada. Only working cash point is miles away",
          "Who wants to climb this cliff?  Not me... especially with all the purchases from all the kewl shops. What a fun way to go up and down by the Chateau Frontenac. $3.50 per ride. Plus you can purchase Knick knacks while you wait for your ride. I bought an awesome \u201cCanada\u201d drink holder.",
          "Great place to stay and visit. There is a lot of history.",
          "Great place to stroll, lots of shops and restaurants to choose from.",
          "Quick way to the top",
          "This is an almost 130 years old funicular, the only one of its kind in America. It is plenty steep at 45 degrees (world\u2019s steepest is 47 degrees and in Switzerland). The cost is low, $3.50, and the view is great and most importantly saves \u2026",
          "Pricey for what you get....kids liked it, but no chance we'd go again.",
          "Wonderful. Too bad it was raining all day :'(",
          "A fun short ride with a good view over the city. They do take credit cards, although they didn't seem thrilled about it. Technically you can take a stroller on it, but getting in and out of the building to go up is fairly difficult. Cheap little bit of fun, and good for kids.",
          "Nice location for a walk along the waterfront. Good store selection in the area",
          "A fast, friendly and efficient mode of getting from the upper town to the lower and vice versa. It's a quick ride of less than one minute, but for the mere $3 fare, one can see travel in this historic mode of conveyance and save oneself a great deal of time and energy climbing up the hill to the upper town.",
          "It's a beautiful ride we can see the full view of the place around us cost $3 for each trip up and down. I went twice its worth trying it. Very busy street and awesome tourist spot to take alot beautiful pictures. Lovely place must go!!!! \u2026",
          "It's an excellent place to view the city of Quebec in motion.",
          "Short and quick. One way tickets sold.",
          "Nice view while going up and down. Only cash is accepted.",
          "Worth the price! Spectacular view and you skip all the stairs :-) It's a short trip so have your camera ready.",
          "Its nice to use it, but you may enjoy more the walking. Great panorama views!",
          "Life savior when you are tired and cold",
          "Takes you where you need to go, Petite Champlain. 7$/person to go both ways. Okay, kinda touristy.",
          "Worth the $3.50 for the novelty and to skip the stairs (again). A bit busy but expected. Is cash only.",
          "Wish we had picked the ride up the hill over the ride down\ud83d\ude02",
          "Interesting place and many restaurants there",
          "Amazing experience..Never miss it!",
          "Only 3 dollars was for sure a pleasant surprise. After walking up and down hills all day this was an amazing ride. Super fast, the view was nice, we left right away when we got there and didn't have to ride with strangers. Totally worth it.",
          "Not much to say.  It is what it is.",
          "Absolutely wonderful place to visit",
          "This place is magical, a must visit",
          "Take the stairs if you\u2019re able.",
          "Great days out in old Quebec City are well worth it. Great Restaurants too",
          "The best",
          "Only $3.50.  Worth the experience if you have never rode one.  Very helpful of you are unable to walk long distances",
          "Beautiful view. Worth the price",
          "Overpriced. Have to be a dollar or two, but 3.50 for each passenger for a 20 seconds ride is ridiculous. Take the stairs you'll be up in 5 minutes only. Must be free for handicapped people but looks you cannot even reach it.",
          "The ride itself self is very short but with a nice view of the river. It brings u from the top to the bottom area of old port. It\u2019s definitely an easier way to get to the top from the bottom because we walked from bottom to the top and it\u2019s quite tiring. Only $3 so reasonable price and very handy.",
          "nice view going up or down",
          "Opportunity to easily access downtown for older and disabled ppl? NOT! Fire your operator! Incredibly rude and discriminating!",
          "It's inexpensive and you get a cute little ride with a gorgeous view. Totally worth it and doesn't take up a whole lot of time. The lineup moves quickly.",
          "Really bad client service. MOT RECOMMENDED WITH YOUNGER KIDS.  I went there with a double stroller which fits perfectly everywhere. The man in the booth told me I had to fold it inside which was ok for me if that would let more people in. \u2026",
          "Short elevator ride up and prices are very decent.",
          "After touring the city, great way to get back up top.",
          "I usually take the stairs but after my brain surgery it was an obligation to take it. Really useful, the man selling our tickets was nice and funny. It's nice to look over St-Lawrence river from there. Not too expensive",
          "Those streets ,views and that elevator down the streets is eye catching.",
          "The view is nice and it isn't expensive. A nice ride up instead of the stairs.",
          "A scenic and quick way to avoid the stairs between Dufferin Terrace and the lower city. $3.50 one way. We did it once for the experience and convenience.",
          "3.50$ per person for a quick ride to see Quebec old city.",
          "Great view and so much easier than waking up the stairs \ud83d\ude00",
          "Eye pleasing mechanical masterpiece.",
          "Great experience of an inclined railway. Round trip tickets cannot be taken but need to be taken at individual stations. For those with strollers or on wheel chair this offers a good ride down to the market however we had to scale a few stairs to reach the station. It also offers spectacular views.",
          "A very short ride, but pretty cheap so it's ok.   If you start from below, you don't see anything for the first 1/4, which makes you dissapointed...  Until you go past the first level of roofs (rooves?) And see everything.  That's quite nice.  \nI suggest going to old town walking the strairs down, but take the funiculaire back up.",
          "Great place! It only last a couple of minutes. You should be really excited about takaing it, other way you will think it's expensive or that you've wasted time",
          "Price, not bad. After so much walking, the Funiculaire offered respite. See it in the background?",
          "Great way to climb the hill without sweating. 3 bucks each way. Brings you up to Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac and everything else that's up there.",
          "Interesting way to get around!",
          "Expensive",
          "For the 1 minute you are in there, it's a bit expensive.   But it saves the walk up the stairs.  If you are capable of taking the stairs down, it's nice to take this back up.",
          "Not very pleasant experience. Big line-up for a roughly 20 second ride. Waiting erea is hot, inside of escalator is boiling. The casher looked mad, not friendly at all. Save yourself money and time, take the stairs.",
          "Nice ride offering a unique perspective the Petit Champlain district",
          "Peace full place.",
          "The ride isn't necessary because the hill isn't insurmountable but it's a nice way to come back down the hill after a day checking out the top.  We missed it on the way up because the entrance isn't totally obvious - it looks like a gift shop on the promenade below with some signage above for the Funiculaire.",
          "I thought this would be a little more grand, or exciting, or something than it was. Still the funiculaire is in a beautiful part of the city, and it is well worth walking around the area.",
          "Amazing place to visit in Quebec!",
          "Great views. If you are near the door, the full size glass without interruption may be scary for some.\n\nThere were no lines at the times we used it. The fare is reasonable and worth the convenience.",
          "Inexpensive, beautiful view, and short line-up! $3.50 per person for a one-way trip.",
          "Great when you don't want to go up to the top of the hill by the stairs. I walked around old Quebec for a few hours and up and down those stairs several times already. By the time I needed to go back to the hotel, I was dreading the stairs. \u2026",
          "Easy to ride and give a nice view of St.Kaweence river. Bad news is the price is just raised to 3.50 CAD. On July 4th 2018 The day before July 3rd 2018 I rode the price was only 3 CAD! The price changes on me!",
          "Love this place !",
          "Fun but short ride...not to be missed",
          "The OLDER MAN with white hair at the gift shop register is rude and should look for another job.He has no business in customer service made me feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed on my very first visit to Quebec.",
          "Easy ride from Lower Old Quebec to Upper Old Quebec $3.50 per person one way",
          "Nice service",
          "I took this because I thought this was the only way down to rue petit champagne but you can easily walk down there haha. It is 3$ per person one way and it takes 60 seconds. Don't waste your money.",
          "Very nice, super clean, great view. Canadiens are so friendly they even let me ride the elevator with my German Shepherd.  Great place",
          "The kids loved it. It was fun and served it's purpose. Great option for people who are too tired to climb back up the hills and stairs after an evening of shopping.",
          "Clearly the easy way to get back up the hill after shopping on Rue du Petit Champlain.  It would be nice if it were a bit more affordable, but the view is great and the climb is long.",
          "I love this simple ride ... it\u2019s wonderful.",
          "Cute ride. Wasn't too fast. It's just like an outdoor elevator, haha. The views through the glass over the water was very nice though.",
          "Haven't been since '76 still a beautiful spot.",
          "A short ride up to the castle if you don't feel like walking.",
          "It's a fun and fast way to reach the top, especially in the winter when it's -30C. The ride is very short but the view is beautiful!",
          "Ok to visit once in lifetime!",
          "Beatiful view and reasonable price for a shortcut.",
          "Neat, historic ride up the hill. $3 is way is a fair price. Waits were not too long either. Can get hot inside but it's a short trip.",
          "Worth the trip but always a queue.",
          "While visiting Quebec we were sure to visit the funiculaire. Rides are one way, and they have gift shops at both the top and bottom terminals.",
          "This is a must visit when you visit Quebec! Particularly if you are staying at the bottom of the hill, unless you like giant hills and stairs! The cost is $3, and you have to pay for each use up or down. It's a fun little way to get up and down the hill and it holds a bit of history as well.",
          "Cool experience for $3. Very short ride but saves you from walking up those stairs. Good for stroller and wheelchair. ",
          "A must in Quebec City.",
          "Didn't have to walk back up the giant hill. We put in 28000 steps and it saved a bunch more so we weren't tired and could explore more. $5 isn't much for two people to ride and it is fairly quick. Has a nice view as well.",
          "Great way to get down and back from the lower part of Quebec city. It cost $3/person each way. Alternatively you can take the stairs.",
          "Kinda fun., good way to get from bottom of Quebec city to the top and back again",
          "Funiculaire du Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec is more decorative than useful because people just have to go down a small staircase which is on the left to reach the Quartier Petit Champlain, but it is still very nice to see.",
          "Useful if you're  tired.",
          "Cheap short trip up to the upper city and boardwalk.  Something you should do at least once. Obviously $2.50 better spent going up than down.  Steps up are right around the corner from it.  View can be nice if you are one of the people \u2026",
          "Much easier than walking up all the hills and stairs, though you do pay for the privilege. Would recommend using it to get from the bottom of Quebec City to the top, but then walk down if you can. ",
          "Good form of transportation.",
          "Good ambience.",
          "Old Quebec enjoy",
          "Taking a walk is better than taking the cabinet.",
          "A must do in Quebec City.  Especially after a full day of waking.  Fun ride.",
          "Loved this ride! What a feat to build this transportation method. Definitely worth the price especially for the way up!",
          "A little pricey given it is $3 each way per person but it is a fun ride and the quickest way from the lower level to the hotels level.",
          "The price of a one way trip is CAD 3.50, cash only",
          "Saved a lot of climbing for $3.50",
          "A little pricey for a minute ride to the top but worth it after a bottle of wine in the great restaurants!",
          "10 seconds! It doesn't worth it. You can enjoy the view as long as you want without using this foniculare!",
          "Great ride albeit brief. Saved a lot of steps up the hill. Was a reasonable price...a tooney I think...and we didn't have to wait long. The employee in the shop at the bottom was very very friendly and efficient. He seemed to know what he \u2026",
          "Warm and useful.",
          "Wouldn't visit Quebec city without a ride on funiculaire. What a fantastic view!",
          "Even though we can walk down to the old town , we still try to cable....Great experiences.",
          "Historic and attractive",
          "A great way to get up the hill in Quebec.",
          "20 second ride for $3.  If you are physically able to do the hike from lower town to upper town of old Quebec, you can skip it.  ",
          "Excellent",
          "Cheap, easy way to get up the hill so you can save your energy for walking and exploring once you're up there.  Just be aware that when cruise ships are in port, the line for this attraction will be VERRRRRY long.",
          "Breathtaking view",
          "I walked up from the river area to get to old Quebec not knowing there was a better way.  Using this on the way back down saved a LOT of energy and time.  It also ends at the bottom with another nice shopping/eating area.",
          "Very handy and fast. It's right where it needs to be tho could be a little less expensive considering it's very short. ",
          "Good view. Going up is a better option than coming down because coming down on foot is easier.",
          "Worth the $3.50! No walking back up the stairs, plus a great view!",
          "Great place with a cool view of the St. Lawrence and the building. Can be a bit busy so try to visit at off peak hours",
          "Very nice",
          "The only way up after a long day of exploring the old city.",
          "Handy to use to get back to the top",
          "Pretty neat!",
          "A really interesting activity. Great fun for all the family.",
          "What? That's a public attraction? It's a 20m vertical elevator, that you can ride for 3$. Or you can just go around and walk up the hill instead.",
          "Very reasonable price and worth every penny to avoid the steep streets and steps!",
          "Funny ride",
          "Efficient fast way to get up and down the cliffs. Worth doing once. Enjoyed the walk down the break neck stairs or Rue De la Montagne better.",
          "Spectacular view!",
          "Nice view, but a bit expensive for the ride.",
          "3.5$ per trip, cool experience.",
          "Heart of Quebec",
          "For our lyng about 2$ you get the most historic mini ride. The view is breathtaking and not to mention after a day of walking around its great to be carried back up!",
          "Spectacular and very beautiful",
          "Magnificent! Stunning rooms and building with the kindest and most thoughtful hosts. Located a short walk from so much St.John culture. I wish I could move in! ",
          "Wonderful way to get down to La petite Champlain district of old Quebec City.",
          "138 years old historic cableway for lower to upper Quebec town. Reasonable Cost 3 cad one way.",
          "Pricey. Fun to take at least once, and sometimes the convenience is worth it. Not great for strollers due to staircase at top entrance",
          "Very expensive. Pay for it if you're unable to climb stairs. It's just a way of transportation.",
          "Excellent service very nice",
          "Amazing view from the city!",
          "It's the same price to go down as to go up, but at least going down there tend to not be any queues! It's far more touristy at the bottom than at the top. A fun but short ride.",
          "Such a beautiful place. We really enjoy the ti.e been there. ",
          "Quick ride up to the top. Reasonable price. ",
          "CA$3 for a 50 second ride is a bit much. The view is nice though.",
          "Gives a great view over old Quebec and saves a trip on the stairs. It's a unique to Quebec see it once experience. ",
          "Cool attraction, but it's a little pricy ($3 per adult).",
          "The price should be for 2 trips. Not worth going down. If your super tired perhaps take it up, but I actually enjoyed the walk up as there are shops on the way up. ",
          "It was a neat part of our adventure, It was not worth the $12 to ride it one way and I wouldn't do it again. It was over priced,  not air conditioned and had a hot sweaty smell going on in it.",
          "Quebec city is a must visit for everyone. Only 3 hours ride from Montreal. Super charming European little village in north America",
          "Great view on the St-Laurent and Levis! With the Chateau Frontenac in the back, you'll have a great trip picture!",
          "Definitely the best way to travel between upper and lower QC. We had some spectacular views as well! ",
          "Do not be intimidated by the line, it moves quickly and is a unique way to get up a steep hill. ",
          "The funicular ride isn't long or anything out of ordinary but it takes you to the most magical parts of Quebec and just to experience was worthwhile.  it costs around $2 each way and we rode it down to old Quebec but wished we rode it up instead to avoid hiking up the stairs.  ",
          "Nice setup... eases the climb to terrace dufferin and is reasonable priced",
          "I love it",
          "Great for kids and if you want to quickly get back up the hill.",

        "wiki": "Quebec City ( (listen) or ; French: Ville de Qu\u00e9bec, Western Abnaki: Kephek), officially Qu\u00e9bec ([keb\u025bk] (listen)), is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec. As of July 2016 the city had a population of 531,902, and the metropolitan area had a population of 800,296. It is the eleventh largest city and the seventh largest metropolitan area in Canada.\nThe Algonquian people had originally named the area K\u00e9bec, an Algonquin word meaning \"where the river narrows\", because the Saint Lawrence River narrows proximate to the promontory of Quebec and its Cape Diamant. Explorer Samuel de Champlain founded a French settlement here in 1608, and adopted the Algonquin name. Quebec City is one of the oldest European cities in North America. The ramparts surrounding Old Quebec (Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec) are the only fortified city walls remaining in the Americas north of Mexico. This area was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985 as the \"Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec\".The city's landmarks include the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac hotel that dominates the skyline and the Citadelle of Quebec, an intact fortress that forms the centrepiece of the ramparts surrounding the old city and includes a secondary royal residence. The National Assembly of Quebec (provincial legislature), the Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec (National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec), and the Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation (Museum of Civilization) are found within or near Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n\n== Name and usage ==\n\nAccording to the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, and the Geographical Names Board of Canada, the names of Canadian cities and towns have only one official form. Thus, Qu\u00e9bec is officially spelled with an accented \u00e9 in both Canadian English and French.In English, the city and the province are officially distinguished by the fact that the province does not have an accented \u00e9 and the city does. Informally, however, the accent is usually omitted in common usage, so the unofficial form \"Quebec City\" is used to distinguish the city from the province. In French, the names of provinces are gendered nouns and the names of cities are not, so the city and the province are already distinguished by the presence or absence of a definite article in front of the name. For example, the concept of \"in Quebec\" is expressed as \"\u00e0 Qu\u00e9bec\" for the city and \"au Qu\u00e9bec\" for the province.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== French Regime (1500s\u20131763) ===\nQuebec City is one of the oldest European settlements in North America and the only fortified city north of Mexico whose walls still exist. While many of the major cities in Latin America date from the 16th century, among cities in Canada and the U.S., few were created earlier than Quebec City (St. John's, Harbour Grace, Port Royal, St. Augustine, Santa Fe, Jamestown, and Tadoussac). \n\nIt is home to the earliest known French settlement in North America, Fort Charlesbourg-Royal, established in 1541 by explorer Jacques Cartier with some 400 persons but abandoned less than a year later due to the hostility of the natives and the harsh winter. The fort was at the mouth of the Rivi\u00e8re du Cap Rouge, in the suburban former town of Cap-Rouge (which merged into Quebec City in 2002).\nQuebec was founded by Samuel de Champlain, a French explorer and diplomat, on 3 July 1608, and at the site of a long abandoned St. Lawrence Iroquoian settlement called Stadacona. Champlain, also called \"The Father of New France\", served as its administrator for the rest of his life.\nThe name \"Canada\" refers to this settlement. Although the Acadian settlement at Port-Royal was established three years earlier, Quebec came to be known as the cradle of North America's Francophone population. The place seemed favourable to the establishment of a permanent colony.\n\nThe population of the settlement remained small for decades. In 1629 it was captured by English privateers, led by David Kirke, during the Anglo-French War. Samuel de Champlain argued that the English seizing of the lands was illegal as the war had already ended, and worked to have the lands returned to France. As part of the ongoing negotiations of their exit from the Anglo-French War, in 1632 the English king Charles agreed to return the lands in exchange for Louis XIII paying his wife's dowry. These terms were signed into law with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. The lands in Quebec and Acadia were returned to the French Company of One Hundred Associates.In 1665, there were 550 people in 70 houses living in the city. One-quarter of the people were members of religious orders: secular priests, Jesuits, Ursulines nuns and the order running the local hospital, Hotel-Dieu.\nQuebec was the headquarters of many raids against New England during the four French and Indian Wars. In 1690 the city was attacked by the English, but was successfully defended. In the last of the conflicts, the French and Indian War (Seven Years' War), Quebec was captured by the British in 1759 and held until the end of the war in 1763. In that time many battles and sieges took place: the Battle of Beauport, a French victory (31 July 1759); the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, in which British troops under General James Wolfe defeated the French General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm on 13 September 1759 and shortly thereafter took the city after a short siege. A French counter attack saw a French victory at the Battle of Sainte-Foy (28 April 1760) but the subsequent second Siege of Quebec the following month however saw a final British victory.\nFrance ceded New France, including the city, to Britain in 1763.At the end of French rule in 1763, forests, villages, fields and pastures surrounded the town of 8,000 inhabitants. The town distinguished itself by its monumental architecture, fortifications, and affluent homes of masonry and shacks in the suburbs of Saint-Jean and Saint-Roch. Despite its urbanity and its status as capital, Quebec City remained a small colonial city with close ties to its rural surroundings. Nearby inhabitants traded their farm surpluses and firewood for imported goods from France at the two city markets.\n\n\n=== Modern history (1763\u2013present) ===\n\nDuring the American Revolution, revolutionary troops from the southern colonies assaulted the British garrison in an attempt to 'liberate' Quebec City, in a conflict now known as the Battle of Quebec (1775). The defeat of the revolutionaries from the south put an end to the hopes that the peoples of Quebec would rise and join the American Revolution so that Canada would join the Continental Congress and become part of the original United States of America along with the other British colonies of continental North America. In effect, the battle's outcome was the split of British North America into two distinct political entities.\nThe city itself was not attacked during the War of 1812, when the United States again attempted to annex Canadian lands. Amid fears of another American attack on Quebec City, construction of the Citadelle of Quebec began in 1820. The Americans did not attack Canada after the War of 1812, but the Citadelle continued to house a large British garrison until 1871. It is still in use by the military and is also a tourist attraction.\nUntil the late 18th century Qu\u00e9bec was the most populous city in present-day Canada. As of the census of 1790, Montreal surpassed it with 18,000 inhabitants, but Quebec (pop. 14,000) remained the administrative capital of New France. It was then made the capital of Lower Canada by the Constitutional Act of 1791. From 1841 to 1867, the capital of the Province of Canada rotated between Kingston, Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa and Quebec City (from 1852 to 1856 and from 1859 to 1866).\nBefore the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, the only French-speaking officer training school was the Quebec City School of Military Instruction, founded in 1864. The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867. In 1868, The School of Artillery was formed in Montreal.\n\nThe Quebec Conference on Canadian Confederation was held in the city in 1864. In 1867, Queen Victoria chose Ottawa as the definite capital of the Dominion of Canada, while Quebec City was confirmed as the capital of the newly created province of Quebec.\nDuring World War II, two conferences were held in Quebec City. The First Quebec Conference was held in 1943 with Franklin D. Roosevelt (President of the United States), Winston Churchill (Prime Minister of the United Kingdom), William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister of Canada's) and T. V. Soong (minister of foreign affairs of China). The Second Quebec Conference was held in 1944, and was attended by Churchill and Roosevelt. They took place in the buildings of the Citadelle and at the nearby Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac. A large part of the D-Day landing plans were made during those meetings.\nUntil 2002, Quebec was a mostly urbanized city and its territory coterminous with today's borough of La Cit\u00e9-Limoilou. The Government of Quebec then mandated a municipal reorganization in the province, and many suburbs of the north shore of the Saint-Lawrence were merged into Quebec City, taking the form of boroughs. In 2008 the city celebrated its 400th anniversary and was gifted funds for festivities and construction projects by provincial and federal governments, as well as public artwork by various entities, including foreign countries.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nQuebec City was built on the north bank of the Saint Lawrence River, where it narrows and meets the mouth of the Saint-Charles River. Old Quebec is located on top and at the foot of Cap-Diamant, which is on the eastern edge of a plateau called the promontory of Quebec (Quebec hill). Because of this topographic feature, the oldest and most urbanized borough of La Cit\u00e9-Limoilou can be divided into upper and lower town. North of the hill, the Saint Lawrence Lowlands is flat and has rich, arable soil. Past this valley, the Laurentian Mountains lies to the north of the city but its foothills are within the municipal limits.\nThe Plains of Abraham are located on the southeastern extremity of the plateau, where high stone walls were integrated during colonial days. On the northern foot of the promontory, the lower town neighbourhoods of Saint-Roch and Saint-Sauveur (fr), traditionally working class, are separated from uptown's Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Saint-Sacrement (fr) by a woody area attested as Coteau Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve.\nThe area was affected by the 1925 Charlevoix\u2013Kamouraska earthquake.\nThe administrative region in which it is situated is officially referred to as Capitale-Nationale, and the term \"national capital\" is used to refer to Quebec City itself at the provincial level.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nThe climate of Quebec City is classified as humid continental (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfb).Quebec City experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are warm and occasionally hot, with periods of hotter temperatures which compounded with the high humidity, create a high heat index that belies the average high of 22\u201325 \u00b0C (72\u201377 \u00b0F) and lows of 11\u201313 \u00b0C (52\u201355 \u00b0F). Winters are cold, windy and snowy with average high temperatures \u22125 to \u22128 \u00b0C (23 to 18 \u00b0F) and lows \u221213 to \u221218 \u00b0C (9 to 0 \u00b0F). Spring and fall, although short, bring chilly to warm temperatures. Late heat waves as well as \"Indian summers\" are a common occurrence.On average, Quebec City receives 1,190 millimetres (46.85 in) of precipitation, of which 899 millimetres (35.39 in) is rain and 303 millimetres (11.93 in) is the melt from 316 centimetres (124.4 in) of snowfall per annum. The city experiences around 1,916 hours of bright sunshine annually or 41.5% of possible sunshine, with summer being the sunniest, but also slightly the wettest season. During winter, snow generally stays on the ground from the end of November till mid-April.\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Quebec City was 36.1 \u00b0C (97 \u00b0F) on 17 July 1953. The coldest temperature ever recorded was \u221236.7 \u00b0C (\u221234 \u00b0F) on 10 January 1890 and 14 January 2015.\n\n\n== Cityscape ==\n\n\n=== Architecture ===\n\nMuch of the city's notable traditional architecture is located in Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec (Old Quebec), within and below the fortifications. This area has a distinct European feel with its stone buildings and winding streets lined with shops and restaurants. Porte St-Louis and Porte St-Jean are the main gates through the walls from the modern section of downtown; the Kent Gate was a gift to the province from Queen Victoria and the foundation stone was laid by the Queen's daughter, Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne, on 11 June 1879. West of the walls are the Parliament Hill area, and to the south the Plains of Abraham.\nThe upper and lower town are linked by numerous stairs such as the Escalier \u00ab casse-cou \u00bb (literally \"neck-breaking\" steps) or the Old Quebec Funicular on the historic Petit Champlain street where many small boutiques are found, not far Notre-Dame-des-Victoires church and Mus\u00e9e de la Civilisation.\n\nAlong with concrete high-rises such as \u00c9difice Marie-Guyart and Le Concorde on parliament hill (see List of tallest buildings in Quebec City), the city's skyline is dominated by the massive Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac hotel, perched on top of Cap-Diamant. It was designed by architect Bruce Price, as one of a series of \"ch\u00e2teau\" style hotels built for the Canadian Pacific Railway company. The railway company sought to encourage luxury tourism and bring wealthy travellers to its trains.\nAlongside the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac is the Terrasse Dufferin, a walkway along the edge of the cliff, offering views of the Saint Lawrence River. The terrace leads toward the nearby Plains of Abraham, site of the battle in which the British took Quebec from France, and the Citadelle of Quebec, a Canadian Forces installation and the federal vice-regal secondary residence. The Parliament Building, the meeting place of the Parliament of Quebec, is also near the Citadelle.\nNear the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac is Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec Cathedral, mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec. It is the first church in the New World to be raised to a basilica and is the primatial church of Canada. There are 37 National Historic Sites of Canada in Quebec City and its enclaves.\n\n\n=== Parks ===\nOne of the most notable is The Battlefields Park, which is home to 50 historical artillery pieces and the Plains of Abraham. The park offers views of the St. Lawrence River and has multiple historical structures and statues like the Joan of Arc on Horseback and a couple of  Martello Towers. Historically this was the site of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759), a decisive British victory in the Seven Years' War which ended French rule in what would become Canada, and the later Battle of Quebec (1775) during the American Revolutionary War, where the British were able to hold onto its last stronghold in the Northern extent of its North American territory.\nOther large and centrally located parks are Parc Victoria, Parc Maizerets and Cartier-Br\u00e9beuf National Historic Site.\nQuebec City's largest park is the Parc Chauveau (fr), which is crossed by the suburban section of the city-wide Saint-Charles River and is thus also part of the 31 kilometres (19 mi) long Saint-Charles River's linear park. At Chauveau, activities such as canoeing, fishing and cross-country skiing are offered depending on the season, in addition to an interior soccer stadium. Among others, there is also the beach of Beauport Bay, as well as the Marais du Nord (north-end marsh land).\nQuebec is the only large city in Canada along with Halifax lacking a public greenhouse. Nonetheless, outside areas known for their public gardens or landscaping include:\nThe linear park named Promenade Samuel-De Champlain (fr) that stretches 4.6 kilometres (2.9 mi) alongside the Saint Lawrence River, from Pierre Laporte Bridge to Sillery's east-end. Its bicycle and pedestrian paths then continues all the way to Old Quebec and then along the Saint-Charles River. Just like the beach at Beauport Bay, the construction of the Promenade was funded by provincial and federal governments to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Quebec City in 2008.\nParc du Bois-de-Coulonge (fr), slightly west of the Plains of Abraham in Sillery, and known for its natural landscaping as well as traditional gardens, such as those surrounding the historical Villa Bagatelle (fr). The historical significance of the park also lies in the former presence of the viceregal Government House of Quebec (1845\u20131966).\nThe Domaine de Maizerets, where are found an arboretum and an observation tower, not far from the Saint Lawrence River and Beauport Bay.\nDomaine Cataraqui (fr) in Sillery.\nThe Roger-Van den Hende Botanical Garden (fr) of Laval University.\n\n\n=== Boroughs and neighbourhoods ===\n\nOn 1 January 2002, the 12 former towns of Sainte-Foy, Beauport, Charlesbourg, Sillery, Loretteville, Val-B\u00e9lair, Cap-Rouge, Saint-\u00c9mile, Vanier, L'Ancienne-Lorette, Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures and Lac-Saint-Charles were annexed by Quebec City. This was one of several municipal mergers which took place across Quebec on that date. Following a demerger referendum, L'Ancienne-Lorette and Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures were reconstituted as separate municipalities on 1 January 2006, but the other former municipalities remain part of Quebec City. On 1 November 2009, Quebec City re-organized its boroughs, reducing the number from 8 to 6.Quebec City's six boroughs (French: arrondissements) are further divided into 35 neighbourhoods (French: quartiers). In most cases, the name of the latter remained the same as the historical town (French: ville) or parish municipality it replaced. Neighbourhoods each elect their own council, whose powers rest in public consultations.\nCompared to many other cities in North America, there is less variation between average household incomes between the neighbourhoods. However, some disparities exist. The southwest former cities of Sillery, Cap-Rouge and Sainte-Foy are considered to be the wealthiest, along with some parts of Montcalm and Old Quebec.The city's traditional working-class areas are found in the lower town below Old Quebec (Saint-Sauveur and Saint-Roch) and directly across the Saint-Charles River to the north (Vanier and Limoilou). However, parts of Limoilou, Saint-Sauveur and particularly Saint-Roch have seen gentrification in the last 20 years, attracting young professionals and the construction of new offices and condos.Northern sections (Loretteville, Val-B\u00e9lair) and eastern sections (Beauport, Charlesbourg) are mostly a mix of middle-class residential suburbs with industrial pockets.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAccording to Statistics Canada, there were 531,902 people residing in Quebec City proper in 2016, and 800,296 people in the metropolitan area. Of the former total, 48.2% were male and 51.8% were female. Children under five accounted for approximately 4.7% of the resident population of Quebec City. This compares with 5.2% in the province of Quebec, and 5.6% for Canada overall.\nIn 2016, 20.6% of the resident population in Quebec City was of retirement age (65 and over for males and females) compared with 16.9% in Canada. The median age is 43.3 years of age compared to 41.2 years of age for Canada as a whole. In the five years between 2011 and 2016, the population of Quebec City grew by 3%.In 2016, 6.4% of Quebec City residents reported visible minority status, a relatively low figure for a large city; the national average was 22.3%. The largest visible minority group were Black Canadians, who formed 2.4% of the population. Quebec City also has a lower percentage of aboriginal Canadians (3.4%) than the national average of 6.2%.\n\n\n=== Language ===\nThe great majority of city residents are native French speakers. The English-speaking community peaked in relative terms during the 1860s, when 40% of Quebec City's residents were Anglophone. Today, native Anglophones make up only 1.5% of the population of both the city and its metropolitan area. However, the summer tourist season and the Quebec Winter Carnival attract significant numbers of Anglophone (as well as Francophone) visitors, and English can often be heard in areas frequented by tourists.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, 94.6% of Quebec City's population spoke French as their mother tongue.  In addition, more than a third of city residents reported speaking both French and English.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nMost jobs in Quebec City are concentrated in public administration, defence, services, commerce, transport and tourism. As the provincial capital, the city benefits from being a regional administrative and services centre: apropos, the provincial government is the largest employer in the city, employing 27,900 people as of 2007. CHUQ (the local hospital network) is the city's largest institutional employer, with more than 10,000 employees in 2007. The unemployment rate in June 2018 was 3.8%, below the national average (6.0%) and the second lowest of Canada's 34 largest cities, behind Peterborough (2.7%).Around 10% of jobs are in manufacturing. Principal products include pulp and paper, processed food, metal/wood items, chemicals, electronics and electrical equipment, and printed materials. The city hosts the headquarters of a variety of prominent companies, including: fashion retailer La Maison Simons, engineering firms BPR and Norda Stelo; Cominar real estate investment trust; Industrial Alliance, La Capitale, Promutuel, SSQ Financial Group, and Union Canadienne in the insurance sector; Beenox, Gearbox Software,  Frima Studio, Sarbakan and Ubisoft in the computer games industry; AeternaZentaris and DiagnoCure in pharmaceuticals; Amalgame, Cossette and Vision 7 in marketing and advertising; Institut National d'Optique (INO), EXFO, OptoSecurity in technology. It is also the domicile of the sole manufactory of the cigarette maker Rothmans, Benson & Hedges.\n\n\n=== Business districts ===\n\nWhile the traditional central business districts and their large office buildings are found on Parliament Hill (especially for provincial administration) and just below in Saint-Roch (nowadays notable for IT and the video game industry), a newer one has emerged in the Boulevard Laurier (fr) area of Sainte-Foy, where a number of accounting and law firms have moved since the 2000s. Other suburban places identified by the City for their potential are the Lebourgneuf area for private offices, as well as Estimauville Street where the Government of Canada already has many civil servants and where several city officials are expected to move in the 2020s.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nQuebec City is known for its Winter Carnival, its summer music festival and its Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day celebrations.\nThe Jardin zoologique du Qu\u00e9bec, now closed, reopened in 2002 after extensive repairs before ultimately shuttering in 2006. It featured 750 specimens of 300 different species of animals. The zoo specialized in winged fauna and garden themes, but also featured several species of mammals. While it emphasized Quebec's indigenous fauna, one of its main attractions was the Indo-Australian greenhouse, featuring fauna and flora from regions surrounding the Indian Ocean.Parc Aquarium du Qu\u00e9bec, which reopened in 2002 on a site overlooking the Saint Lawrence River, features more than 10,000 specimens of mammals, reptiles, fish and other aquatic fauna of North America and the Arctic. Polar bears and various species of seals of the Arctic sector and the \"Large Ocean\", a large basin offering visitors a view from underneath, make up part of the aquarium's main attractions.\nQu\u00e9bec City has a number of historic sites, art galleries and museums, including Citadelle of Quebec, Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec, Ursulines of Quebec, and Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation.\n\nOther tourist attractions include Montmorency Falls, and, just outside the city limits, the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr\u00e9, the Mont-Sainte-Anne ski resort, and the Ice Hotel.\n\n\n=== Sports ===\nQuebec City has hosted a number of recent sporting events, as well as being shortlisted for the 2002 Winter Olympics city selection. The Special Olympics Canada National Winter Games was held in the city from 26 February to 1 March 2008. Quebec City co-hosted with Halifax, Nova Scotia, the 2008 IIHF World Championship. Regular sporting events held in the city include the Coupe Banque Nationale, a Women's Tennis Association tournament; Crashed Ice, an extreme downhill skating race; Quebec City International Pee-Wee Tournament, a minor hockey tournament; and the Tour de Qu\u00e9bec International cycling stage race. In December 2011, Quebec City hosted the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final at the Pavillon de la Jeunesse at ExpoCit\u00e9.\n\nThe city currently has two professional teams. The Dynamo de Qu\u00e9bec a professional soccer club which competes in the Premi\u00e8re ligue de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec and the Capitales de Qu\u00e9bec, which plays in the Frontier League in downtown's Canac stadium. The team was established in 1999, and originally played in the Northern League. It has seven league titles, won in 2006, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2017. A professional basketball team, the Quebec Kebs, played in National Basketball League of Canada in 2011 but folded before the 2012 season.\nThe city had a professional ice hockey team, the Quebec Nordiques, which played in the World Hockey Association (WHA) from 1972 to 1979 and the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1979 to 1995, maintaining a strong rivalry with the Montreal Canadiens. Due to a disadvantageous exchange rate with respect to the US dollar, the team moved to Denver, Colorado, in 1995, becoming the Colorado Avalanche. A lower-tier team, the Quebec Rafales, played in the professional International Hockey League from 1996 to 1998.\n\nThe Videotron Centre was built with the hope of getting an NHL franchise (relocation or expansion) in Quebec City. The project was funded regardless of whether an NHL team arrives. It is also hoped that the arena can help Quebec City win a future Winter Olympics games bid. It has now replaced the Colis\u00e9e Pepsi as the main multifunctional arena in Quebec City.\nOther teams include the Quebec Remparts in major junior hockey (QMJHL), Universit\u00e9 Laval varsity team Rouge & Or, the Quebec City Monarks, and Quebec City Rebelles of La Ligue de Football de Qu\u00e9bec; the Alouettes de Charlesbourg of the Ligue de Baseball Junior \u00c9lite du Qu\u00e9bec; the women's hockey team Quebec Phoenix of the Canadian Women's Hockey League; and soccer club Quebec Arsenal of the W-League.\nQuebec City holds the COOP FIS Cross-Country World Cup. This is a ski event that welcomes the best of that sport.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nSince the 1970s, centre-right parties such as Union Nationale, Cr\u00e9dit social, Conservative Party of Canada (CPC), Action d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec and Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec (CAQ) have been more popular in the Quebec City region than elsewhere in the province. After the federal election of 2006, six of the ten conservative ridings of the province were found in its metropolitan area (where the CPC garnered 39% of the vote, against 25% at the provincial scale) and in the city proper, the CPC won three of the four seats that existed at that time (the riding of Quebec went to the Bloc). Along with the city's lesser support for Quebec sovereignty, this led political pundits to speculate about a \"Quebec City mystery\".Various lines of thought were offered, including the popularity of the talk radio stations CHOI and FM93 expressing fiscally conservative and non-politically correct opinions. Over the years, this genre has been qualified by its detractors as radio poubelle (fr) (\"trash radio\") and hosts like Jeff Fillion and Andr\u00e9 Arthur likened to shock jocks. Also, compared to the rest of the province, people of the area may favor harsher criminal sentences, and lower-class households may share political views more in line with those earning more. The reasons for this remain unclear. Another researcher put forward the historical factors that led to Montreal surpassing Quebec as the metropolis of British North America in the early 19th century. According to this theory, its permanent status of \"second city\" (albeit the capital) engendered feelings of \"repressed jealousy\".The \"mystery\" was relativized following the 2011 federal election. All five ridings within the city were won by the leftist New Democratic Party, in the so-called \"orange wave\" that temporarily swept the province. Nonetheless, five of the six seats won by the Conservatives in the province were found in the greater Quebec City area. At the 2018 provincial election, the leftist party Qu\u00e9bec solidaire managed to win two districts, Taschereau and Jean-Lesage, the most densely populated in town, but the centre-right CAQ, as it swept the province, won six of the nine districts encompassing the city, and 15 of the 18 in the administratives regions of Capitale-Nationale and Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches (south shore of the city).\n\n\n=== Municipal government ===\n\nQuebec City is governed by a mayor\u2013council government, which includes the 21 single-member districts of the legislative Quebec City Council and the separately elected mayor. The councilors are elected by first-past-the-post voting while the mayor is elected by the city at-large. Both usually belong to political parties and are elected at the same time every 4 years. The mayor is an ex officio member of the council but is not its president and has no vote. The current one is R\u00e9gis Labeaume, first elected in 2007.\nEach of the city's six boroughs has a council composed of 3 to 5 of the aforementioned councillors, depending on the size of its population. It has jurisdiction with matters such as local road maintenance, leisure, waste collection, and small grants for community projects and others, but cannot tax or borrow money. The boroughs are further divided into 35 neighbourhoods, which also have councils devoted to public consultations, each led by 11 citizens. Their geographical limits may be distinct from those of the city's 21 electoral districts, and councillors also sit at their neighbourhood councils as non-voting ex officio members.\n\n\n==== Public safety ====\nThe city is protected by Service de police de la Ville de Qu\u00e9bec and Service de protection contre les incendies de Qu\u00e9bec (fire dept.) The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Quebec City has one of the lowest crime rates in Canada, with 3,193 per 100,000 persons in 2017, only behind Toronto's CMA (3,115). Exceptionally, no homicide (defined as a criminal death, deliberate or not) was reported in 2007. Still, eight homicides occurred the following year.On 29 January 2017, a university student shot and killed six people with another 17 injured in a mass shooting at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre. Even after accounting for this event, the CMA of Quebec had the second lowest Crime Severity Index in the country in 2017, at 48.5, after that of Barrie (45.3). For the year 2017, the number of reported incidents investigated as hate crimes by the city police increased from 57 to 71, and for those specifically targeting Muslims from 21 to 42. The overall rate of reported hate crimes was thus 7.1 per 100,000 population \u2014 higher than the national average (3.9) and in Montreal (4.7) but lower than rates in Hamilton, Ottawa and Thunder Bay.There were two first-degree murders in 2018, seven in 2017 (six of which were due to the mosque shooting), one in 2016, two in 2015 and three in 2014.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nThe Universit\u00e9 Laval (Laval University) is in the southwestern part of the city, in the borough of Sainte-Foy, except for its school of architecture, which is at the \"Vieux-S\u00e9minaire\" building in Old Quebec.\nThe Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec system administrative headquarters and some of its specialized schools (\u00c9cole nationale d'administration publique, Institut national de la recherche scientifique and T\u00e9l\u00e9-universit\u00e9) are in the Saint-Roch neighbourhood.\nCEGEPs of Quebec city are Coll\u00e8ge Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier-Garneau, C\u00e9gep Limoilou, C\u00e9gep de Sainte-Foy and Champlain College St. Lawrence, as well as private and specialized post-secondary institutions such as Campus Notre-Dame-de-Foy, Coll\u00e8ge M\u00e9rici, Coll\u00e8ge Bart, Coll\u00e8ge CDI, Coll\u00e8ge O'Sullivan and Coll\u00e8ge Multihexa.\nThree school boards, including Commission scolaire de la Capitale, operate secular francophone schools, and Central Quebec School Board operates the few existing anglophone ones. Until 1998 Commission des \u00e9coles catholiques de Qu\u00e9bec operated public Catholic schools of all languages.\nQuebec City has the oldest educational institution for women in North America, led by the Ursulines of Quebec, which is now a private elementary school.\n\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n\n=== Transportation ===\n\n\n==== Roads ====\nTwo bridges (the Quebec Bridge and Pierre Laporte Bridge) and a ferry service connect the city with L\u00e9vis and its suburbs along the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River. The Orleans Island Bridge links Quebec City with pastoral Orleans Island.\n\nQuebec City is an important hub in the province's autoroute system, as well as boasting one of the highest \"expressway lane kilometres per 1000 persons\" in the country (1.10 km), behind Calgary (1.74), Hamilton (1.61) and Edmonton (1.24). Autoroute 40 connects the region with Montreal and Ottawa to the west and Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupr\u00e9 and the Charlevoix region to the east. Autoroute 20 parallels the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, linking Quebec City with Montreal and Toronto to the west and Rivi\u00e8re-du-Loup, Rimouski, and the Maritime Provinces to the east. Autoroute 73 provides a north-south link through the metropolitan area, linking it with Saint-Georges, the Beauce region, and Maine to the south and Saguenay and the Lac-Saint-Jean region to the north.\nWithin the metropolitan region, Autoroutes 40, 73, and several spur routes link the city centre with its suburbs.\nAutoroute 573 (Autoroute Henri-IV) connects the city with CFB Valcartier. Autoroute 740 (Autoroute Robert-Bourassa) serves as a north-south inner belt. Autoroute 440 comprises two separate autoroutes to the west and east of the urban core. Originally meant to be connected by a tunnel under the city centre, the two sections are separated by a 6 km (3.7 mi) gap. There are no current plans to connect them. The western section (Autoroute Charest) connects Autoroutes 40 and 73 with Boulevard Charest (a main east-west avenue) while the eastern section (Autoroute Dufferin-Montmorency) links the city centre with Beauport and Montmorency Falls.\n\n\n==== Public transport ====\n\nThe R\u00e9seau de transport de la Capitale (RTC) is responsible for public transport in the region. The RTC operates a fleet of buses and has recently implemented articulated buses. The RTC is studying the return of a tramway system to help ease overcrowding on its busiest lines as well as attract new users to public transit. The two billion dollar revitalization project needs approval from higher levels of government since the city does not have the financial resources to fund such an ambitious project on its own.\nRail transport is operated by Via Rail at the Gare du Palais ('Palace Station'). The station is the eastern terminus of the railway's main Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. An inter-city bus station, with connections to the provincial long-distance bus network, is adjacent to the train station, and hosts, among others, the services of Greyhound Canada and Orleans Express.\n\n\n==== Air and sea ====\nQuebec City is served by Jean Lesage International Airport (YQB), located at the city's western edge, 11 miles from the city centre.\nThe Port of Quebec is a major port on the St. Lawrence with facilities in the first, fifth and sixth boroughs.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Partner cities ==\nQuebec City is mainly twinned with :\n\n Bordeaux\n CalgaryIt has formal agreements with other cities although they are not active anymore as of 2012. These include Saint Petersburg, Guanajuato City, Hu\u1ebf and Li\u00e8ge and Namur in francophone Belgium.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of regional county municipalities and equivalent territories in Quebec\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nOfficial website of Qu\u00e9bec City Tourism\nFocus on Geography Series, 2016 Census \u2014 Census subdivision of Qu\u00e9bec City from Statistics Canada\nCBC Digital Archives \u2014 CBC Television Special: Preserving Quebec City (1976)\nCBC Digital Archives \u2014 Quebec City: 400 Years of History",

          "We found ourselves walking through this area by accident but it\u2019s really interesting. There are lots of unusual galleries and many antique shops. The old town is signposted so you won\u2019t get lost if you wander in here.",
          "When the Hop On/Hop Off tour bus driver announced that we were in historic Place Royale, Casey and I knew we had to come back. Which we did, after walking through the old Train Station and the March\u00e9 du Vieux Port. After a long, leisurely walk, we found ourselves navigating the",
          "Enjoyed a visit for the Elton John farewell concert this past weekend.The perfect venue for us as we love the Old world charm in the port area of Quebec City. Foodies paradise! That and the incredible history of the City from its founding in the early 1600's right through to the",
          "Nothing special, not much to do beside building watching and maybe a beer... too expansive shops in the area.",
          "A lot of innovative art galleries, some are very unique. Walk on street \"Sault-au-Matelot\" for more art galleries and nice restaurants and shops. Look at the exterior metal stairs on the buildings. Watch for ice falling in winter, so avoid walking too close to the buildings.",
          "We visited for the day on a cruise. The immediate port area is a lovely park. You can easily walk to shops and restaurants. You can also walk to a \"farmers\" type market. So nice that the city has a beautiful port area that is convenient to so much.",
          "If you enjoy art shops and strolling leisurely, this is the place for you. Very relaxed atmosphere once lunch time passes. Restaurants fill quickly.",
          "We came down one evening to see the fireworks on the river near the traverse (ferry). It is one of the most beautiful part of the city and is worth seeing.",
          "At the bottom of the Petit Champlain tourist area, with some stores and restaurants, and especially the ferry terminal to L\u00e9vis, which is very busy, particularly during rush hour in the morning and late afternoon. Some very old restored buildings in the area.",
          "Walk along both St-Pierre and St- Paul to the end cross the street over toward the embarcadero and enter the old market! You will not be disappointed. The market has everything from fresh produce, sausages, cheese, fruit, jams, wines, pies, quiche and more!!! The prices are",
          "Lots of cool little cafes, antique shops, art shops- HIGHLY recommend going here- fun to walk around- shop or just people watch ..",
          "We enjoyed strolling through the narrow streets of the Old Port in both the daytime and evening hours. There are lots of shops, cafes and restaurants to explore. I recommend going when the tour buses leave in the afternoon:evening, as the area can get too crowded to enjoy. It is",
          "Cafes, antique stores,B&Bs the market, Pointe a Carcy Naval Reserve and the stroll without end. Quite simply this is a stroller's never ending pleasure",
          "Not as spectacular or as much to see as we\u2019d imagined, we preferred the Lower town, but nonetheless there were lots of marquees erected with stalls inside selling everything from wood carvings, jewellery, art, and our favourite one, the farmers market, with a huge choice of",
          "A must-see - not must-buy lol some great artisan work and beautiful overall, but it's definitely pricey just on account of where it's located",
          "There was an outdoor concert, a few little eateries, some monuments with an interesting history, and a naval museum. Unfortunately, we didn't get to go IN the museum, because we were too late in the day. So, we merely pushed on through.",
          "A scenic area of the Lower City which is rich in areas of interest. Hard to imagine that this was the area where the old port used to be, since it is nowhere near where the port is now.",
          "We spent quite a bit of time walking along the port and people watching. Very busy on a Sunday and very quiet on a Monday. Cafe du Monde is along here.",
          "This is a super place to wander along and enjoy the atmosphere. The houses were festooned with flowers when I was there- very attractive.",
          "If you sent photos home telling people you were in France or Germany, your friends and family might believe you. Quant little shops, outdoor bars and restaurants, made for great memories in Quebec City.",
          "Lovely and very clean area to walk around. Restaurants abound. You can see the international cruise ships sailing out from this port. Unfortunately, we inquired about some of the tour ferries (dinner cruises) and the girl at the booking counter was not very friendly nor could",
          "The Old Port is always a fun time. Lots to see and people watching is great. The Frontenac is a great way to while away some time....Watching the waterways ....and the ferry ... fun times. The funicular is a bit scary for those who don't like heights but it's a short ride!",
          "Very pretty area. Worth going down and taking a walk. See the Saint Lawrence River. Would be nice to see in the winter too",
          "Beautiful port area and was fortunate to be able to take a 4 hour boat trip along the St. Lawrence Seaway for business fun. Excellent meal, view and including dancing too. Great way to spend an evening.",
          "The Old Port section is truly meant to be enjoyed slowly. Meander through the cobblestone streets and enjoy the sights, sounds, and smells. The history and the view make a winning combination.",
          "The area, the city, the people are all lovely. Quaint streets, beautiful architecture, clean, and safe.",
          "This is the number one attraction for most visitors to Quebec and should absolutely be on your to do list. Lots of small and quaint shops with mass produces as well as local artisan merchandise as souvenirs.",
          "This area is on the lower city (of course... the port) but the area was ok, but the best attractions are on the higher portion of the city so be ready for some hills. It also has a few bristros and restaurants that might be more active on summer time.",
          "We walked over here from the market. Maybe it was because it was a rainy day, but I didn\u2019t see the significance of the area. There were a couple of historic buildings, but other than that, it was an area we could have missed and not been disappointed.",
          "Not too far from the Gare du Plais, the Point-a-carcy is a wonderful walkway that affords one great views to the Saint Charles and Saint Lawrence Rivers and the Basin Louise. I would imagine that it is very busy in the summer with the visits of a large number of ships and",
          "Fun to stroll, browse, sit at a cafe, just wander around. Everyone speaks English but fun to practice one's French as well.",

          "Many of the Antique shops are there,also many Art Galeries. Terraces where breakfast is often served outside when weather permits.",
          "I loved walking along the cobbled streets, window shopping and admiring the architecture. Visiting the old port is like stepping back in history.",
          "The Old Port is an area with lots of shops restaurants and the like. I assume put together for people off cruise boats and other tourists. You pass thru it on your way to the sights in the Old Town and there are some museums and other non shops you can check out.",
          "Nice scenery- great shops to walk around and see. No places to eat. Merchandise over priced. Not much to buy. Reading Market in PA has a better selection. This is just a port turned market. Worth seeing but just your average port.",
          "Great shopping. Everything you can imagine. Good prices. Good eating. Even has a Christmas Store! The buildings are amazing. Just like walking the streets in Europe.",
          "We loved walking around this area. There are many charming shops and quaint, small restaurants. You have to walk down a steep hill from the upper town. We especially loved looking in the many, interesting art galleries.",
          "Lovely area, cobblestones etc. Unfortunately as we were visiting at the end of the season many places were closed. Those that were open made their shops and restaurants look lovely from outside with flowers and lights etc",
          "1) lots of antique stores and galleries 2) cool breakfast \"greasy spoon\" in the area 3) farmers market, indoor, at the old port by the water with loads of \"squeeky cheeze\" Enjoy",
          "Well the tourists for a start!!!! But then without us where would they be. Loved wandering the streets around here and finding a good spot for lunch. Can't recall its name but the french onion soup looked amazing.",
          "First of all. Quebec city is my favourite city in Canada. And the Old port is my favourite part of the city. U could spend there hrs. Small place, but so many things to see. I didn't want to leave this place. Many shops and restaurants.",
          "Beautiful old city, Saint-Malo (Brittany, France) style, with old stoned houses. Beautiful pictures to take at all time of the day, all time of the year, even under deep quebecer winter. In summer, take time to listen the street artists and singers, celebration of the New France",
          "Very nice for a stroll in a sunny day, grab a bite or a drink, great for nightlife as well. Bring comphy shoes",
          "So many lovely old buildings here and a wonderful atmosphere - and to think it was all nearly demolished! Plenty of history, an amazing mural, some lovely cafes, and the river only a short walk away.",
          "Rue Saint Pierre and Rue Saint Paul were lovely to walk down as we headed towards the market. These streets had many galleries which was a nice change from the many souvenir shops in the lower town. We visited the market mid-afternoon and it was quiet by then so I suggest going",
          "I ate at a small cafe. The waitress was warm, welcoming, and patient with my French. I enjoyed authentic Quebec food, homestyle.",
          "This area is full of small cafes, artisan shops and ofcourse the tourist stuff. It has been restored and pretty easy to walk around. Be warned some of the area is cobbled.",
          "Best place we had seen on our entire cruise trip of the East coast of Canada. Old Quebec, close to the pier where cruise ships dock. Incredible, clean, historical, so many things I could say. I have been to Europe, and old Quebec does not disappoint. You feel like you are in",
          "After taking the funicular from Chateau Frontenac to lower town, we discovered the quaint streets with amazing historical buildings, art galleries, restaurants, unique shops and museums. Then, we continue towards the old port to check out the market \u201cmarche\u2019 du Vieux port\u201d. This",
          "We had done the old town to death but wanted to eat at the lovely restaurant Initiale down by the port so went down outside the ramparts. We are so glad we did as it is a very attractive area. Small cobbled streets, pretty shops and restaurants. You can go down to it or back up",
          "This part of Old Qu\u00e9bec houses an excellent farmer\u2019s market (worth a visit) and the cruise liner terminal. It is a pleasant place to stroll. At its most northern point is the train/bus station which is an impressive looking building built in the old style.",
          "Wandered around this area after docking in port and found a lot of quaint shops. Lots of restaurants in the area also. Just another part of the city that is a must explore.",
          "Walked around these streets with interesting old building but maybe a few too many souvenir shops but I guess it's how it survives.",
          "When in Quebec City - one HAS to take the walking tour if able to walk at a moderate pace. The Old Port is great for people-watching and shopping. The information one gleans on the walking tour and the history is aMAAAzing! The sights and food are of course phenomenal but I had",
          "The Old Port is located in the Lower Town of Q.C. and we spent four or more hours walking and enjoying the art galleries, boutiques and lovely French Bistros.",
          "This is a romantic and quiet part of Old Quebec leading to Place Royale. I would say it starts behind the Musee de Civilisation (by rue Cote de la Montagne) and extends to Place Royale near Notre Dame Des Victoires (Habitation)--not far to walk from the Traverse ferry terminal",
          "The tree lined roads of the old port are beautiful and full of little shops bars and cafes. It is a must visit if you visit Quebec",

          "No much to be seen, it's nice but only if you have spare time. The market is ok, but no the best. They have good prices if you want some souvenirs",
          "Lots of anitque shops, art galeries and restaurants. Partially blocked by a parking lot which is not good city planning in my opinion",
          "Lovely, uncrowded and quaint, away from the T shirt and souvenir shops and the crowds in the upper part city. Cute antique shops and a lovely store with hand made lamps. The food market is worth going to, with everything one could want - meats, fish, and very fresh fruits and",
          "We enjoyed walking through the Old Port and would have liked to have more time to spend in the museums. Some nice open air artwork as well as galleries, shops, restaurants, etc.",
          "The port area is quite extensive. The museum of civilisation and the Nautical museum are either in it or close and bot are worth a visit. We were there when the Tall Ships Race 2017 was on with many visitors and crew it was hopping. The crowd management was a bit heavy handed",
          "We simply loved Quebec City. Put on your walking shoes and be prepared to walk. Beauty and history at every turn. A must see in Quebec.",
          "So much has changed in past 5 years old port is not what it once was Just a parking place for boats of the filth. And the tourists who need a change from their hotdogs. Most old places from 20 yrs ago in the past 5 yrs are sold and land is being monopolized by corps building",
          "Lovely place to walk, enjoy the architecture, and just walk. Very pleasant and good for all ages. Definitely, a must!",

          "We stayed in the old port and it was lovely. We had great views and enjoyed wandering around. There are so many places to eat its difficult to choose.",
          "We visited this area while waiting for the nearby Musee de Civilization to open. Lots of wonderful shops and a wide range of interesting restaurants. Wish we had more time to enjoy this area more in depth.",
          "We preferred wandering around Upper & Lower Town, but we did still enjoy strolling around Old Port. It is much less busy then the other areas so it is a nice place to head to when tired of the crowds. The area offers many nice restaurants and stores as well as a wonderful",
          "We spent an afternoon at the Old Port and enjoyed the different things to see - but mostly enjoyed the people watching as it is a big draw for tourists. A very enjoyable walk!",
          "The various levels of government, federal, provincial and municipal have done a superb job creating and restoring this whole area. So lovely to walk the entire promenade and gaze at the st Lawrence and the ships and sailboats there. A very lively spot with live music and",
          "There are many street art exhibits along the pathway in the Old Port. Not as many people walk down there, so it is a little less crowded. Still many restaurants and things to do and see. The boats and St Laurent are beautiful.",

          "The old harbour area is worthwhile ion its own but during the tall ship regatta it gave an extra dimension. You could visit any of the large sailing ships, a super experience in itself",
          "The whole city is old but this was where everything entered the city. Plenty of history and magnificent old building. You can't do QC without walking through this area to really understand the culture of the city. Can you tell I just love this city!",
          "On the edge of Old Quebec, with some of the city\u2019s oldest buildings. Near the Farmer\u2019s Market and the train station. We enjoyed the old stone buildings and cobble stone streets. Lots of choices for shopping, dining, or just sitting with a beverage and people watching. We",
          "Old Port is just STUNNING. It was my absolute favourite part of our trip to Quebec City. The antique shops are beautiful, the art studios are packed full of beautiful work. This is a wonderful place to sit on a bench and people watch. It is a clean area and the trees provide a",
          "The museum was a great walk, attracted us to a new part of town on this day. Architecture a delight. Timed it to dodge the occasional downpours during our 8 days.",
          "We walked down here, steep walk in places, to visit antique shops and the Cafe Felin( the town's only cat cafe if you like cats).Worth the walk or take a cab if walking is a bit of a challenge.",

          "Just a great place to spend an afternoon wandering around. Great place for families if the weather is nice.",
          "We viewed this as an extension of Old Quebec and an alternative to get to St. Jean. Populated with antique shops and restaurants, it was enjoyable and another chance to explore more of Old Quebec",

          "This is right off of Lower Town, and this is the place where all of the tour boats dock. If you're feeling a bit claustrophobic from wandering the narrow streets of Lower Town, the Old Port is just a few moments away, and it has some great views of the St. Lawrence River and",
          "We walked around this area and found lots of antique shops as well as some art stores and other shops. Great little area to do some window shopping and stop for a bite to eat in a place that is a little less busy as the areas closer to the main attractions of old Quebec City.",
          "We had a great time strolling through the various booths of the Old Port Market. Food, wine, art, clothes, nick-knacks---you name it. We were there in December, it is was a good location to get in a decent walk, but it was then fun to get out of the chill and try various apple",

          "We stayed in the Old Port area and we liked that it was quiet and easily accessible from the highway. There are many restaurants and art galleries in the area. There was also a farmers market nearby that was worth a look. It was a 10 minute walk to Old Quebec so its close by",
          "We stayed here for a long weekend visit to Quebec. It is a pleasant area, quieter than the bustling old city at the top of the hill, but with dining and galleries, a museum, and good for walking. It's within walking distance of the old city up the hill, and we had no trouble",
          "The Old port is worth walking through and seeking out stores and galleries that are unique. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of artist galleries which were quiet and had a wide variety of artist mediums represented.",
          "There's nothing portish looking of the original old port. On a walking tour we learned that the old port was east out of the Place Royal down the Rue de la Place. The boats docked at the end of this street. It was on this street that the men would meet the women who came to the",

          "This area is on the port side (obviously) of the old town and has been transformed into a 'cultural' district with plenty of galleries to visit. Walking around is a pleasure as the architecture is really interesting and there is lots to see.",
          "When visiting the lower Old Town area of Quebec there is so much to see that this area adjoining the St. Lawrence River and docks could easily be missed. But take the extra few blocks to walk down and be rewarded with more \"quaintness\" and some restaurants that are more known to",
          "Decided to add to our Fitbit steps and stairs! Walked down the stairs and were rewarded with a panorama of streets, walkways and water views all the way down. Lots of fun places to snoop around. Interesting places to shop, eat, observe. The wall murals are fabulous. Unique",
          "A fun shopping and sightseeing place with lots and lots of tourists from all over the world. Lots of restaurants, too, but didn't try any. Just being part of that whole thing is fun. The best prices of tourist trinkets at the corner store at the bottom of the Funiculair",

          "We stayed on the edge of old Quebec City (2 minute walk) and found this area to be very inviting. There are plenty of restaurants and shops and old buildings to see. It's very convenient how many of the restaurants are close to each other. We took the bus tour (jump on and off",

          "This was so reminiscent of small French villages. Narrow cobblestone streets, small shops to explore, lovely buildings, and lovely people. All the snootiness for which the Quebecois are accused is absent here. Perhaps it has something to do with the tens of thousands of tourists",

          "This was a fun place. I recommend going early in the day because there was a farmer's market of sorts that closed in the early evening. We did not get there until late in the day on the day we were leaving so we only got to enjoy it for a short time.",

          "We truly enjoyed the Farmers' Market for the variety of berries, oils, seafood, teas, etc. Most items were something you would take home to prepare, though. Didn't see much for eating (lunch) on the spot. That day there was also an art fair next door (3 big tents) - not sure how",

          "The eateries directly at the 'Old Port' seemed to present a skosh better value. The most interesting tidbit we learned on the walking tour that included this piece of QC was that orphan women from Europe were sent over to Canada to help 'settle' the province and that QC's port,",
          "I loved it. There was so much history. The buildings are gorgeous and the people very friendly. We walked down and took the finicular back up. There are little tourist stores, some lovely art stores, many restaurants and little squares. Very worthwhile.",

          "Been here twice in the past 18 months as part of cruise stop. Cruise terminal well kept and extremely handy to see Old town, but Old Port itself and the covered market really did not warrant more than an hour. A short walk towards Lower town will yield more for your sight seeing",
          "Visited for Xmas and although wasn't the white xmas we had hoped for, the Old Port was quaint, characteristic and a lovely place to visit. We stayed within the walls so we were close to it all. You only really need 2-3 days tops though as it's quite small. A ferry across to",
          "We discovered the covered market at the Old Port quite by chance and were very pleased we did. So much amazing food, produce, wines and ciders, and wonderful little gift ideas. It's a pity the market isn't better promoted and sign-posted around Old Quebec.",

          "We thought we were going to a real marketplace, with a farmer's market, lots of eating choices and interesting local crafts. However, we were disappointed. There were food vendors, but primarily cider and ice wines, maple confections and smoked meats. It was OK but not great.",

          "There are definitely cities with more beautiful ports, but the old port has some unique sites. The Open Market is a trip in itself, with tons of fresh produce, dairy, wines, chocolates, flowers, syrup, and even a cafeteria. I didn't feel like a tourist here, altho some might",
          "This is nice place to see and buy some local produce and enjoy a quick snack beside the Old Port area and Marina. Parking is free for the first 60 minutes, if you buy or eat something and keep your receipt for presentation at the parking exit kiosk.",
          "The two outstanding features of the old port, for me ,were the Market ( open every day ) with fresh produce and Canadian products,i.e., maple syrup, cheese, and some fruit wines ( tomato and blueberry !!) ; and the Bunge silos which become the Image Mill at 10:15 every night.",
          "The old port area is a nice area to walk around, now mostly filled with shops selling antiques or art galleries. The market is small, but very friendly selling lovely fresh produce.",
          "That pretty much says it all. You can forget about breakfast and/or lunch at the tourist traps on the hill...buy some of the amazing fresh fruits + vegetables and try NOT to buy more cheeses and cured meats than you can eat (I dare you!) They're all excellent.",
          "Our favorite part of the Old Port is the market. Great place to find local specialties as well as to experience the sights, smells of flowers, fresh vegetables, cheeses, meats and fish. We always buy maple syrup there which makes a great gift. Also great place to buy picnic",
          "A nice market selling wines, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, fish, etc. A little touristy and not like open air markets in some cities. Some good deals to be had. Worth visiting if you're down by the river",

          "I'm titling this based on the streets - the businesses are overpriced and somewhat limited on souvenirs and other items, but it is still a great walking and photo experience. Taking the Fanicular from lower town to upper town will set you back a couple of dollars and is worth",
          "I can't explain how utter beautiful the Old Port was. Well I guess I could and I'll try. The restaurants, shops, and apartments are just so ethereal and rustic. You feel like you're transported to another time with the brick buildings and brick roads. Walking up and down",
          "great place to stroll around!! have beer - chill & shop!! walking around gave you a nice feel for the quaintness of Quebec city!!!",
          "We started our day at the March\u00e9 eating croissants and strawberries for breakfast. There was a pedestrian-friendly walking/biking path along the river and port than lead to the quaint streets of St. Pierre with trinket shops and exclusive art galleries and dress shops. Along the",

          "Easy to get to on foot and is a good place to visit to see how Quebec looked before if became bigger and more modern. The St Lawrence is also on view from here and that is by far the biggest river I have ever seen. Impressive.",
          "Quite a nice place,but i think compaired to the old city directly opposite it is missing some flair and also some bars or similar stuuf to rest and have a snack. But as it is just a few steps away from the old city everyone should make this little walk to have a view over this",
          "Nice and relaxing atmosphere. The old Via Rail building is so beautiful. The streets close by are worth of visiting. very close to Quartier Petit-Champlain.",
          "Loved the old buildings. Again full of shops, none of them were restored to museum quality, there were few plaques to tell the visitor about significant buildings and the history of the place.",

          "The old port has nothing old about it and is replaced by modern cranes, buildings and warehouses just like any other port in the world",
          "Local vendors bring their special foods to this market. A very charming gathering place with lots of great Quebec souvenirs and food!",
          "The port area has many shops and cafes that can be easily reached by walking. Also, there is a Marche de Vieux Port, country market, where you can buy cheese, bread, sausages, fish, fruit, ice cider, paintings and many other things - its lots of fun.",

          "The port is nothing spectacular in itself, but the area around the port has many small shops and caf\u00e9s that you can enjoy. Just be careful not to buy anything of value close to the port, because that's where all the merchants jack up the prices, knowing that stupid tourists are",
          "There is an excellent market in the Vieux Port - and the nic ething is that it is (reasonably) walkable!! Vendors come in from teh surrounding areas and offer everything from produce and meats, to baked goods, wines, maple everything, spices, cheese etc etc etc.......",
          "Lovely to wander the old streets and enjoy the history of the place. Take a good guide book to help you know what you are seeing.",

        "wiki": "The Montmorency Falls (French: Chute Montmorency) is a large waterfall on the Montmorency River in Quebec, Canada.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe falls are located on the boundary between the borough of Beauport, and Boischatel, about 12 km (7.5 mi) from the heart of old Quebec City. The area surrounding the falls is protected within the Montmorency Falls Park (French: Parc de la Chute-Montmorency). The falls are at the mouth of the Montmorency River where it drops over the cliff shore into the Saint Lawrence River, opposite the western end of the \u00cele d'Orleans. The waterfalls are 83 m (272') tall, a full 30 m (99') higher than Niagara Falls.\n\n\n== Access and tourism ==\nThere are staircases that allow visitors to view the falls from several different perspectives. A suspension bridge over the crest of the falls provides access to both sides of the park.  There is also an aerial tram (Funitel) that carries passengers between the base and the top of the falls. In the summer the park hosts an international fireworks competition with the falls as a backdrop.During summer months, the falls give off a yellow glow due to high iron content in the waterbed.The Ice Hotel was located at Montmorency Falls for its first year.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe Falls were the site of a key scene between the lead actors in the 1947 film Whispering City, which was filmed on location.In his poem \"Sleep and Poetry\" (1816), John Keats says that human life is \"a poor Indian's sleep / While his boat hastens to the monstrous steep / Of Montmorency.\" Recreational sleighing on the frozen falls is recorded in Letitia Elizabeth Landon's poem The Montmorency Waterfall and Cone of 1835.\n\nThe Falls appeared during the finale of The Amazing Race Canada 5 in 2017 and were the site of the episode's first task in which competitors scaled a cargo net suspended over the Falls.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nCanyon Sainte-Anne\nCharlevoix tourist train\nList of Waterfalls\nS\u00e9paq\n\n\n== References ==\nR\u00e9seau S\u00e9paq, Parc de la Chute-Montmorency Historic Site brochure, 2003.\n\n\n== External links ==\nVivre Au Canada.tv: Montmorency Falls during summer\n \"Montmorency, Falls of\" .

          "We went on Boxing Day and it was packed! Took forever just to get into the parking lot. Not sure how it is on other days. But once there it felt crowded but not overwhelming. It is gorgeous with the water flowing through the ice. We walked around for awhile and across the",
          "Everything you would like to do (the scenic walkway, the hike, the zipline) is closed in winter due to safety reason. Which is 100% acceptable. What is not acceptable is that they still charge you full price admission ($8 with tax) for an attraction that is 95% closed, and don't",
          "We visited the Montmorency Falls on a City and Countryside tour from Quebec City. There was lots of snow, but this didn't spoil our enjoyment at all - in fact, it seemed to make it all the more special. In February, the place wasn't crowded at all, but the falls were a joy to",
          "Very beautiful. I have never seen a frozen waterfall before. . We took the gondola to the top of the falls. You can also drive to the top if you don\u2019t want to pay for the ride up. We wanted to have a drink and enjoy the view but there was nothing open up there. Does not take",
          "Excellent side trip when in Quebec City. Beautiful falls, not crowded. Great photos at base of falls, lovely views at top as well",
          "This a well worth a visit as the falls are very impressive. It is very popular though and we queued for quite a while to get into a parking lot. There are lots of trails in the park and you can also zipline if you're brave enough.",
          "Traveled by bus which was easy to use. Coffee shop not open at the top, but we went on the cable car to the bottom where there was an open cafe and gift shop. Lovely views, great walks, spectacular falls.",
          "Even visiting on the coldest day of the year (-30 C with windchill), it was an awesome experience. Tram ride and view from the suspension bridge are truly memorable. We can't wait to return when the ice melts!",
          "Worth a visit if you have the time in Quebec City. I would spend a few hours there and get a view of the waterfall from a number of different vantage points. The volume of water the pours over the falls is incredible. Get up close and hear how loud the waterfall is, I fount that",
          "My wife and I visited the falls when we were in QC for our anniversary weekend last year. It was very picturesque and worth the short drive out there from the old part of QC. Very enjoyable.",
          "I took bus 800 to the Falls. You better get a daypass for the public transportation. It is only CAD. 8,50. The bus will take you in about 15 mins close to the falls. From the busstop it is approx. a 10 mins walk to the bridge & waterfall. Even in wintertime it is worth the trip!",
          "I have been in this park , both in the summer and in the winter , the walk on the bridge is worth a million dollar to me , and the view in the winter is magnificent. I strongly recommend this place",

          "Montmorency Falls is beautiful and an unbelievable sight to see. Unlike Niagara Falls you can walk close to the falls and definitely get wet. Walk up the many stairs to stand on the bridge atop the Falls, or take a Cable car and ride across. A perfect photo to remember - have",

          "We recently visited the falls. They were frozen and it was very foggy out. We could barely see anything, which was disappointing. For us, it was not worth the visit. Although I am sure there is much more to see in the warmer months. If you go in the winter to visit like we did,",
          "We have seen these falls from a tour boat but it is more fun to take the city bus to the last stop, and after a short walk you\u2019ll have a fabulous view of the falls.",
          "This place was awesome, i got in here early and in a cold day, so I have the park for myself and just a few people. You need to go, is very easy to get there, you can use the bus from the center of Quebec City, just for 3.5 CAD and you come and go.",
          "Lovely waterfall, bet it would be fun to zipline over. Can be very icy/windy, hard to access all the steep stairs in winter. The cable car is a very short ride pretty far off to the side of the falls. The building at the top has a gift shop, bathrooms, and some type of food",
          "The cable car ride and subsequent walks out on walkways and stairs atop the falls is all very pretty (we went in winter and the scenery was particularly lovely). Yes it's a little pricey (parking + cable car combined) and the attached museum is kind of uninspiring, but you're",

          "I wasn\u2019t planning on visiting the falls but since I was in the area I\u2019m glad I did. A nice area with walking trails and places to relax. I found a nice spot upstream from the falls where I could relax and read a book in he sun.",

          "Boasting taller falls than Niagara, these falls are worth the stop. If you are a resident of Quebec there is a rebated price so bring some ID. Pros: The falls are beautiful even in the wintertime. With a 6$ entry fee if you go in by foot (3$ if you are a Quebec resident) you",
          "Montmorency waterfall, 7 km east of Quebec City, is the most famous waterfall in the province of Quebac. The waterfall is in a park (Parc de la Chute Montmorency) surrounding the waterfall. A suspended bridge passes over the river, above the waterfall, and there is a cable car",
          "Incredible experience! Even though we went on an extremely cold day it was awesome to see them in the winter. The falls are taller than Niagara and the views from above are breathtaking looking down. The suspension bridge is cool too and you can walk around the entire complex to",
          "Where the busses drop off is a 10 minute walk from where you have to enter, which makes 0 sense. Park entry is fine but the cable car was a bit steep for 2 minutes($14). I was so impressed with QC and Jacques-Cartier earlier in my trip that I found this fall sort of, eh. It\u2019s",
          "There is nothing more beautiful than natures true beauty. The falls are well maintained (area around) and offer visitors the chance to experience the raw beauty and power of mother nature. It takes a small amount of walking and effort to get to the bridge over the falls but",
          "We went on December 22, the falls were half frozen, the sites were beautiful. I have seen it in summer but winter is a whole another experience! You feel like you are in the artic North. The st Lawrence river had mammoth sized ice floating in it. We parked up top next to",
          "No matter its winter or summer, worth going place. If you are going in winters just pack yourself according to weather..",
          "great view, get to stand on a bridge directly over the falls, cool photo opportunity, close to the famous church",
          "This waterfall was part of a 4 hour bus trip out of Old City Quebec. Short ride out and a scenic walk to the falls. In winter it\u2019s beautiful with all the icicles hanging from the rocks. The suspension bridge is great over the falls but not for the faint hearted when windy.\ud83e\udd76",
          "Please get there early or buy tickets in advance. Lines can be long and the walk up the stairs is not fun with kids if you don\u2019t want to wait an hour or two for the lift. Nice picnic areas on the top\u2014as well as a restaurant that apparently doesn\u2019t serve to the general public..",
          "The falls are magnificent. The board walk view is beautiful and a nice easy walk. there are two ways to get to the bottom of the falls to see the best view. One is the stairs which is a long way down but there are several scenic view places to take pictures and a break if",

          "Beautiful area to really enjoy. A must see as it is close to Quebec and just so different my with a beautiful view!",
          "Stopped here for an afternoon trip and I am sure glad we did. Being winter, everything was covered with snow and the falls were slightly frozen and it was breathtaking. No fee was charged since it was winter which was nice, but there were still a decent amount of people up there",
          "This is a nice thing to do while you're in the area. We ate hot dogs and burgers and a \"Food cart\" type place right outside near the falls. Then we walked across the suspension bridge. I do recommend it. Zip lining is available, though we did not do that.",
          "Was recommended this place from friends and went to visit it, it is a beautiful place to see with some activities available to do, I did not do the zip line but it looked a lot of fun, I went around the waterfall and the park, beautiful autumn scenery, took the stairs down to",
          "Enjoyed seeing the falls. Arrived a week too late for the cable car. Wish the barriers were made of a see-through material.",
          "There were mounds of ice along the trail to get to the falls which made for quite dangerous walking. It was also windy and very cold (I am a skier) From the bridge you can see the top of the falls but no spot could you appreciate the entire falls-there appeared to be a platform",
          "Welcome center was closed for the season, so we drove to the top. Lots of parking access and lots of people, Short walk to the Falls so we walked across the 'sky bridge' which provided excellent views of the Falls as well as the local area. Nice and easy walk to the Falls",
          "May be larger than Niagara Falls but is not as imposing...there is a lot of history here though it is worth at least a half hour stop. I would recommend in either winter or summer got the false themselves but more is open in the summer",
          "Visiting this park offers flabbergasting views of the Montmorency Falls from different angles. The best way to visit the inside of this park is by initially taking the aerial tramway from the bottom to the top. One can then see the falls on the right hand side. After reaching",

          "First thing to say is to go there before the month of October. Everything seems to close down for the season at the end of September.. The falls are still open for around $8.00 or so admission. Parking on top is scarce because it is a suburb area. If you look you can find",

          "This attraction must be visited if in Quebec. It is only 6 mile outside Quebec, a short taxi ride, but is definitely worth seeing. You can either take a cable car to the top of the falls or stroll to the bottom and see the falls in their magnificent splendour.",
          "Monmorency Falls are only a short drive from Quebec City (7 miles). Drive up to the top and walk across a footbridge right over the falls! Then walk down the winding stairs on the other side for amazing views of the Falls.",
          "The sight of the waterfalls as it cascades onto the St. Lawrence River is a beauty to behold. There is a good trail to do a short hike. Unfortunately, the trail down was closed for repairs, so you could only take the cable car up and down the place.",
          "My wife and I travelled from historic Quebec City to the Chute-Montmorency in about 15-20 minutes. We had recently visited Niagara Falls and although this attraction could not compete with Niagara from a volume and sheer size standpoint it was stunningly gorgeous in its own",

          "About a half hour out of Quebec City, fairly large waterfall. Suspension bridge over the falls, and walkways to observation points at the sides. Pay to park, and pay if you want to ride a gondola to the bottom. There is also a zip line across the falls, kind of annoying as the",

          "We were in Quebec City for several days and decide to visit the falls. The charged is $20 per vehicle with 2 people. Not a bad price considering there are many trails. Gorgeous paths to walk and bridge including many lookouts to see the falls up close. It was beautiful and",
          "While driving from Quebec to Montreal, we stopped along the park (across the falls) to view them from a distance. Just lovely. We saw a suspension bridge (but my fear of heights kept me at a distance). Beautiful majestic falls, worth the visit. There are walking trails to view",
          "A must do while in Quebec, taller than Niagara Falls (having seen both Falls, Niagara is still more impressive) but Montmorency Falls are spectacular, there are several options for walks around the falls, plenty of food options, and toilet on the outside of the restaurant as you",
          "We went as part of a tour. Pay the extra fee and take the cable car to the suspension bridge, the view from up there is worth it, as well as exploring the top of the falls. There was also a gift shop/dining up there, but we did not have time to go in. If you just look at the",
          "This was our second visit to Montmorency falls and it was much better than the first. On our first visit the boardwalk along the river was closed so we only got to see then from a distance. The boardwalk is a lovely walk along the river to a viewing area right at the falls. You",
          "We stopped in at Parc de la Chute Montmorency on our way to Quebec City from Charlevoix. It was a very nice place to visit, even in late fall. We got there at the same time a tour group, but there weren't too many other people there anyway. We had originally planned to do the",
          "We had great weather for our visit. It was in the mid 20*c and fall colours were beautiful. We took the tram to the top of the falls from the parking lot at the base. The visitor centre at the top had lots to see and the views from the various lookout areas were stunning.",
          "Spectacular sight. We got a to see it as part of a bus tour of Quebec and the surrounding area. You can walk up to and around the Falls. Beautiful scenery. The falls is right next to the Basilica of St Anne. Gorgeous architecture and engineering. A great stop to see 2",
          "Went to the Falls on a cold rainy snowy day but was still stunned by the sheer size of the Falls and the ability to explore from lookotu points, bridges n stairs leading all the way from the top to the bottom. Excellent opportunity for tons of spectacular photographs.",
          "About 30 minutes outside of Old Quebec City and right alongside the highway. Beautiful waterfall and nice hiking trail up to the base of the falls.",
          "Such majesty in the falls. We went mid afternoon and there was no crowd. Loved looking down on the water as it fell. Walking over the bridge is pretty cool.",
          "Tip: Drive to the Manoir House unless you just want to ride the cable car! This site is a beautiful natural site. And the views are breath-taking. If you're the adventurous sort you can ride the zip line. Be ready to get your exercise walking to and across the suspension bridge",
          "such a great experience. too bad they closed the zip line for the3 season. the cable car ride was good as well",
          "The beauty of Mother Nature cannot be overstated. The Parc is nicer on the high side. Not sure why they have to charge for the use of the gondolas if one already has paid for the parking. There was a lot of work going on when we visited, so probably would look nicer on a sunny",
          "This waterfall is just a short drive outside of old Quebec and well worth the trip! We walked along the trail to get closer to the mesmerizing waterfall and see the view from the base. We did not do the cable car to the top, but drove up to see the view from the bridge at the",
          "I visited in September. It was a little chilly, but I really enjoyed the walk up the stairs and the view from the falls. Nice little insta photo-up moment, wasn't too crowded that time of year. If you're expecting something big and flashy, this isn't it, but if it at all appeals",
          "We were so lucky with gorgeous weather. We had a Uber driver take us to the falls from the center of town and it was about a 15 minute drive. So worth it!",
          "We took a tour to these falls and they seem very overrated. The falls were large but the walkway and man-made structures around it detracted from the beauty. I was very disappointed with this tour. The gift shop was small.",
          "We accessed the Falls by taking the city bus from the train station. Very inexpensive. The bus costs less than $5, (access at one of the shops in the train station) and we arrived at the top of the Falls. There are cupolas from which to take pics, a zip-line that crosses the",
          "I have yet to see the falls from the over head viewing bridge or take the cable cars. Since I live in QC, I'm sure eventually I will.",
          "Amazing sight , watching the power of nature. A must visit if you're in the Quebec City area. Snacks and coffees available in the shop at the bottom of the Falls",
          "The waterfall itself is not great if compared to Niagara or Iguassu, but everything is so well arranged that it is worth visiting. The tourist reception center, the cable car and the \u201cbridge over troubled waters\u201d will enchant the visitors.",
          "A stunning view of the Ile d\u2019Orleans from atop the Montmorency falls. A must see and do if you\u2019re visiting the Beaupre coast.",
          "Thoroughly enjoyable trip. With the stairs, tram, zip line, bridge over the top - you can see these impressive falls from all angles. Also you have some trails for a decent hike as well.",
          "We thought the waterfalls were good but somehow the experience misses something, we drove and parked at the top $20 for 2 people and the car. The house is a bit chaotic with too few facilities. The opposite side of the fall looked like a slag heap and part of 5ge walk way was",
          "This is the place to be in Quebec city. I hired a bike and cycled there. The view was incredible. You walk up a steep staircase or take the cable car.",
          "Great park. Lots of parking. Lots of trails to walk. Beautiful scenery. Bring good walking shoes. Nice staircase going to the bottom with lots of opportunities for good pictures",
          "Very cool to see where the beginning of the Appalachian Trail is. these falls are magnificent, especially at night. Loud, too! Two types of rock here, granite and something less hard.",
          "Very nice spot and walk / park on the falls. A must do when it is sunny as you can look at l\u2019\u00eele d\u2019Orleans and Quebec City.",
          "Waterfalls are amazing but there is something about this one that doesn't deliver. Disappointing for such a great natural phenomenea",
          "Visited here on a bike tour. Just about 9 miles from Quebec City to make you feel like you are in the wilderness. Ride the cable car up and explore the falls from several different viewpoints especially the bridge over the top of the falls. You will get spectacular photographs",
          "I visited in August and this experience was more amazing than I expected! We took the cable car up to the waterfall and then walked across the bridge over the falls. The view was awesome! We had lunch at the restaurant at the top of the falls and sat outside overlooking the",
          "Part of our full day tour with ToursByLocals. Impressive park and waterfall. Great lunch at the top.",
          "It's a waterfall, with a bridge at the top, a boardwalk and viewing platform, and stairs to the bottom. For an extra cost there is a zip-line across the falls or an aerial tram between the bottom and the top of cliff. While it is really nice to see \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t cost more to",
          "Hi I'm curently working as a tourguide in Quebec City and leading once or twice a group to that place. And I have to say it is quite nice to see to walk over the bridge and after to the bottom of the waterfall. The thing what darkens my experience is the fact that you have to",
          "We search it on the GPS and reach to the base car park. There you will buy the cable car tickets, if you do not want to take the cable car, there is another car park at the top of the hill. But it is suggested to have it as you can have another angle for the scenery. Can have a",
          "We don\u2019t get to see this type of beauty often. But we took the gondola up from the lower parking area. It is nice but has a price that is fine but not necessary as you can park up top. The fall is breath taking and really allows for a moment of Zen. Hopefully the weather is",
          "The parc in itself is nice, but the waterfall is quite disappointing, not really spectacular, the water color is brownish and the concrete structure below the fall is ugly. Not a big fan...",
          "We stopped on part of an all day tour of Quebec and area.... the falls were beautiful! A short stroll through the park to the bridge to see the falls was an easy walk. Also a nice view of the river from the elevation of the Manor.",
          "We stopped, after hours, to see the falls, on our way to the St. Anne de Beaupre Basilica. If you miss getting to this attraction during opening hours, you can easily see the falls from the grounds of the Parc de la Chute-Montmorency, and even from the highway.",
          "Seen from the bridge above, the patio-style terrace below, at cost gondola ride or from the multi-flight stair system make this is a not-to-be missed site near the city (transportation required).",
          "The park is well worth a visit. we did the zip wire which was an amazing experience and also got the cable car down to the base of the falls where we got some great pictures.",
          "visited the falls as part of a tour and were impressed by the view. Walked the path from the visitor center to the bridge over the falls. Views from above the falls were amazing. Was an easy walk along a pathor the more scenic route included many stairs where the views were",
          "It's a very pretty, pretty easy walk, to, and over a suspension bridge. You can walk down to the bottom of the falls or observe from above. There's a cable car down as well. A very lovely way to spend an hour or so.",
          "We visited the falls n a recent trip to Quebec City, while on a bus tour. We also paid to ride the trolley up to the top. The view was nice but not great. You can however walk across the top of the falls if you are up on top. One option if you have a car is to park at the top",
          "We had such a good time at this lovely park. When we first decided to go, we had not planned to ride the cable car. However, when we arrived, we changed our minds. We are so glad we did. Although there were a number of people ahead of us in line, we were assured by the",
          "We visited in early October. First, we rode the cable car to the top of the falls, which are spectacular! (Only later did we realize that you can drive behind the falls and avoid taking, and paying for, the cable car ride). As it was early October, the fall foliage was in",
          "Took the 800 bus from QC out to the park. Climbed down the steps, crossed the falls, enjoyed walking in the woods followed by lunch at the Manoir. Beautiful spot!",
          "The falls were very impressive and very well maintained. We top the cable car to the top and then walked across the bridge for the view.",
          "I've been to here several times and enjoyed the ride all the time. Especially during the summer season, you need to book in advance.",
          "Don\u2019t bother. It\u2019s a waterfall, nothing spectacular, and if you drive the main costal road you can see it from there, instead of paying 8 dollars to see it close up. They are making a fortune for something that is not impressive. What would be impressive if they harnessed the",
          "Montmorency Falls was everything that had already been written about it and MORE. We visited on Sunday, Oct. 13th, right at the peak of the fall colors. Early morning sun was not the best, but the weather soon changed to warmer air temps and sunny skies. I had the company of my",
          "Rode here on an ebike from old Quebec with echo sports rentals. Great easy ride. Gondola ride up and walk over the falls to the old trenches of The 1700s was well laid out and wide for tourists. Fall colours were going off and the view is great!",
          "From the beginning of our arrival at the falls to the end of our visit, we had a wonderful experience. The parking was convenient and close to the entrance. The gondola ride to the top was smooth and provided a beautiful view of the falls. There were immaculately kept grounds",

          "This is an impressive waterfall with its sheer height and volume. But \"beautiful\" is better suited for other waterfalls like Iguazu Falls in Brazil. Nonetheless, since the waterfall is only 15 minutes by car from Quebec City, it is well worth the visit. The cable car that",
          "The Montmorency Falls are located some 15 km east of Quebec City. The falls are over 80 m in height. An easy walk brings one to a bridge above the falls. There are 2 access areas to the falls:one from the highway, at the base of the falls, and one up the hill. Both are",
          "When in Quebec City, these waterfalls are a must. You can pay for parking at the main entrance and walk along the river to the base of the Falls. Keep your receipt as proff of payment when you go to the next level to walk the bridge. There is a gondola ride to the very top. In",
          "After seeing the High Town, Plains of Abraham and the Parliament building, our tour took us to the falls which are picturesque, but we didnt have time to go to the bottom as the queues were quite large, so we walked over the bridge instead.",
          "The falls are amazing! We took a bike tour which went to the falls and back from Old town Quebec City. The views from on top are breath taking.",
          "Rode bike path from Quebec City to falls, took cable car, walked over bridge, took in the view, and rode bikes back to City. Interesting history, interesting views.",
          "A long walk from the bus drop off and about 1/2 hour ride from Old Quebec on that bus ($3.50 one way). Yes, a high falls but not much beauty in the surroundings. Industrial blight fills the picture from a few overlooks. Not worth the time and effort.",
          "I thought the waterfalls were beautiful. They would have been even better on a nice weather day. I was disappointed that the walkway to the falls was closed due to construction since this was the activity I had planned on doing. I think it is worth a quick stop but didn't",
          "Ok first of all I live near Niagara Falls. Enough said. The falls here are beautiful but do not have the volume of NF> However, you have optional activities like thezip line and all kinds of hikes and you have a restaurant if you choose. We decided to get brave , get",
          "We initially booked for a saturday but it was raining and they had to restrict the maximum weight allowed so we couldn't go (I need to diet!). no website tells you this, but they adjust the maximum weight in case of rain. The staff happily offered for us to come back the next",
          "But the park is average and while it\u2019s worth a visit it can be a quick one to see the falls and move on. It\u2019s taller than Niagara Falls but not nearly as magnificent.",
          "We came through here as part of a tour on the train to the Charlevoix Valley. So we only had time to view the falls at a distance through a large chain link fence. Not very nice! This place needs time to explore on the bridge over the falls that is reachable by a gondola, or",
          "Incredible views! Would strongly recommend getting there early before the crowds come. Bruh a camera to snap plenty of pictures!",
          "On a recent visit to Quebec City, we are glad that we made this roughly 30 minute drive to visit the Montmorency Falls. It was a nice complement to the time we spent in Old Quebec. It's always impressive to see major water falls, and this one did not disappoint. We did walk",
          "See it from the ground across the river, see it from the gondola, see it from above on the bridge, see it from a walkway below, etc. Yes it is just a waterfall, but an impressive one due to its height not width. But the options of how to see it varies widely. I'm sorry we didn't",
          "Don't get there after 4pm as the service at the ticket counter and staff is pretty poor. The Falls aren't that spectacular. We didn't get to go on the gondola because our tour was running late. We got to see the falls from the gondola grounds. The bus driver redeemed himself",
          "This was a highly anticipated destination for us and the tour was great. The bikes were in great shape and our guide Emily was enthusiastic and made it very enjoyable. Would highly recommend.",
          "Compared to Niagara Falls which is just so touristy and commercialized these falls are remarkably uncommercialized and walking the bridge over the falls quite lovely. My husband did the zipline and found it tremendous fun. This is just a pretty park area as well and we were",
          "We had a wonderful visit. Lots of walking but worth it. We enjoyed all the activity with the tourists. Rainbows, springs, zip lining, and great restaurant on site.",
          "Amazing Falls. You get to climb up right beside the falls and view them really close. Walking across the top was exciting. Watching the people zip lining across the falls was amazing. Never took the tram. I goes nowhere near the falls. Nice grounds and beautiful setting.",
          "The Falls are very impressive. Not as wide as Niagara Falls, but higher. There are opponents for zip lining and taking a cable car. I only had about an hour in my schedule, so sadly, I didn't get to do either of those, but it was a lovely fall day and I am glad I didn't miss",
          "Montmorency Falls, a quick drive from Quebec City is well worth it. A Tram ride to the top of the Falls allows a nice view from the suspension bridge. There are lovely paths to walk on, and there are ample spaces and places for children to play.",
          "Just a short drive out of town will give this amazing view over the St. Lawrence river. A cable car to the top of the falls with a bridge over the water is a must with a walk down the other side to give a greta photo opportunity of the falls itself. Watch those brave enough to",
          "We took coach bus to the Parc. I would have liked to ride my bike, the trails looked wonderful to bike on. The guided tour was booked through the Red bus tours. They gave us about an hour to explore on your own. We went on a weekday which probably helped with the crowd. We were",
          "Ok. It not exactly Niagara, but a nice waterfall. Took the cable car to the top. The suspension bridge over the falls is cool. Climbed down and back up the stairs, which gave multiple photo ops. 500 steps each way but worth it. The park also offers great views of Quebec City",
          "We chose the option of viewing the falls from the bottom, a brisk walk from the building that also hosts the train station. It's possible to get close enough to enjoy a cooling mist on a hot day. There is a wooden stairway that leads to the top, but we chose not to use it. Some",
          "We stopped here and took a walk on the bridge over the falls. The bridge walk was a little daunting for both my wife and myself as there is some give in the bridge as large groups pass over it. I am sure that it is 100% safe, bit just a bit intimidating for those of us who do",

          "Falls are an easy ride from Quebec City. Parking, admission and ride to the top were more expensive than expected. Stairs are being repaired so the cable car is necessary if you want to see the view from the top. Fall had a large volume of water and was white all the way",
          "The Montmorency Fall is higher than Niagara and 15 minute away from Quebec city is amazing. Take your car and park near the cable car booth. Walk up to the top and the experience is wonderful!",
          "Enjoyed the hike around this waterfall and at a certain time on a sunny day you can see a beautiful rainbow at the base of the falls. There is a nice restaurant here and a lift if you don't want to take the stairs. Saw quite a few people zip-lining the short run in front of",
          "You could fill in a whole day I\u2019m sure we had half a day and probably cut ourselves short- we used the HoHo bus which sort of restricts when you can go/leave but is probably the cheapest way - I wanted to have a crack at the zip line but time and \u2018counter instructions\u2019 didn\u2019t",
          "After I went all the way down, I decided to cross over the bridge, to the other side, when I saw the double rainbow! It was amazing!",
          "Worth a visit- unique and impressive. Don't take cable car (no need if you're driving) - absurdly expensive",
          "About 7km outside the old city walls, is a pretty falls with hikes to the upper and lower area. A suspension bridge over the falls allows for some interesting views of the city. There is also a hotel and cafe at the top of the cable car ride (for a fee).",
          "Not quite as impressive as Niagara Falls, but a nice scenic view. You can walk over the bridge to take photos and it wasn't too crowded as some reviewers suggested.",
          "A couple of weeks ago, I visited the Chutte Montmorency. Since we last came here in May, 2019, there has been a gate that was placed near the McDonalds north of there. The price is still fair and worth it. We took a walk down the stairs and took some pictures. You won't regret",
          "The stairways were closed and the cable cars crowded which limited our ability to view the falls. It is interesting but not very special",
          "Was a rainy day but would be really crowded in hot weather. Bus stopped t foot of falls for photo/toilet stop then up to the top. Had time to walk to the zip wire where views are good and then over the top of the bridge. Plenty of walks to do if it\u2019s a fine day when at least",
          "Toured falls on rainy day. Wanted to walk up falls but pathway was under construction so you had to take the gondola up. Were very disappointed that they didn\u2019t let you know that you could drive up to the top and not take the gondola. After spending and admission fee to get in",
          "We hoped to witness some fall foliage from Quebec City to Montreal at the end of our long weekend in the area. After a good rain and much cooler temperatures we lucked out at this wonderful destination only 35 minutes from Levis where we stayed in Quebec City. The frustration",

          "We were in Quebec at the end of a cruise and headed straight to these falls having seen them as we entered Quebec on our ship. Excellent Uber trip and not disappointed. Weather was terrific and made the trip all the more enjoyable. An absolute must, even if you have only a short",
          "Montmorency Falls was one of main high lights of our girls weekend in Quebec City. It was a walk in nature and we chose the Zip Line experience over the Falls. Very reasonably priced and for sure the best view and rush you\u2019ll ever get. I would do again in a heartbeat. We had",
          "Must see during Quebec trip! Easy walk over the falls and possibilty to Zipline over it. Can be very crowded in the afternoon",
          "Spend an hour and see it all. It is worth the 15 minute cab ride. Don\u2019t go on a multi hour tour. Beautiful park especially during the color in the fall. The waterfall is impressive. If you like a work out then try the stairs. Have the cab drop you off and pick you up at",
          "Just a few minutes from Downtown Quebec the park is a gem. Take the cable car up the cliff to start the panoramic walking tour at the Manor. We had lunch at the Manor and it was lovely. Follow the footpath along the top of the cliff to the suspended bridge, which affords a",
          "We visited here after collecting our hire car en route to La Malabai. We spent an enjoyable couple of hours. We took the cable car which gave good views of the falls and walked over the suspension bridge that spans the falls. The views were great. The zip wire looked great fun!",
          "Great to visit! Nice opportunity to see Quebec\u2019s great outdoors........... went down until we got a little soaked :-)",
          "Since there were 4 of us, the combined fare on the 800 bus was a bit less than what we paid Uber. We were dropped off just outside. A short walk brought us to the right, the furnicular station, and on the left, the restaurant/gift shop/info building. We grabbed maps and headed",
          "Absolutely amazing. Unfortunately too fast. Deal is great in that you get link to video of your ride that you can download and there is no extra charge. You do have to walk towards start again to return zipline equipment.",
          "Very nice park and beautiful waterfall. Staff very helpful and courteous. Worth the cost. We took rideshare car to site, but if planning visit without tour company, know may be difficult getting rideshare back. We ended up taking taxi which was called by guest services, but",
          "These falls are taller than Niagara. There is a suspension bridge to cross the falls and hike around the area. Well worth the time and cost.",
          "We rode the bus from Place d'Arms to get there. It is not a very long bus ride but a great view of the city from the top. We took the cable car up and walked around the top and down the stairs to the base. It was raining but it didn't make a difference to us. We enjoyed",
          "The water was thundering off the waterfall as there had been so much rain. There is a bridge over the top so that you can see the force of the water. Very busy place. Although it seemed a lot to pay to go and see it it was worth the money.",
          "We visited on an \"off and on\" rainy day, wanting to get some outdoor activity in spite of it. It's touted as being almost 100' taller than Niagara but not as wide. We initially parked at the bottom and realized the footpath to the stairs where you can walk up to the top was",

          "Even though none of our group speaks French, due to the kindness of Quebec folk, we were able to get directions to the falls via city bus (only CAD3.50 each way) and a straight shot from town on the 800 bus. It was an uncrowded Sunday, so it was a relatively quick trip. This",
          "In the Fall the colors are magnificent especially when juxtaposed to these beautiful falls. We traveled from the west side of the city on bus 800. At C$8.75 each for seniors this was a cheap way to get there to see this site. If it\u2019s raining you can still see it but bring rain",
          "The waterfall is gorgeous. It was a rainy, drizzly morning for our visit, but we thoroughly enjoyed walking the lower portion up to the Falls. The suspended bridge over the falls is WOW. It's a must do. We loved it.",
          "Walk-in to the park is $8 per person. It is an easy walk to the suspension bridge overlooking the falls. Some stairs required. The sky tram is $17 per person each way. We just did the walk and avoided the tram. There is a small gift shop in the Kent House and a very small",
          "Recent rain meant a great fall of water, was surprised to hear it is a longer fall than Niagara. Worth the visit. The thrill seekers can take a zip line but a pleasant boardwalk for everyone.",

          "This park is quite pretty with lots of things to explore. We took the gondola up which gives you a great view of the waterfall. You can also hike up on a trail fairly close to the waterfall. Up top there is a restaurant and several short hiking trails. Walk across the",
          "The falls are well worth a visit if you\u2019re in the area. We looked into the various trips/excursions, which all seemed pricey and included other stops we weren\u2019t interested in, so we opted for the public bus. It drops you at the top where the cafe and hotel are, so no need for",
          "We got the 800 public bus (3.50 each way) which drops you directly outside the park. Entrance fee to the park is 8 and it's a short walk up to the waterfall. It is extra for Zipline and cable car, but isn't necessary to make the trip. Nice views of the waterfall from above and",
          "This place is beautiful, but you will probably spend 2-4 hours here depending on your group size and activity choices. We took the cable car up to the top, then walked across the suspension bridge to the zipline. On the way, we stopped at viewpoints for pictures. We went on the",

          "Recommended to visit these spectacular waterfalls and get out of the city into the countryside. We enjoyed seeing the beginning of Fall colours in the leaves. Had a warm sunny day. We spent most of the day there. To get there we just caught the public bus No. 800 from outside",
          "They charge you 4$ for parking + 8$ gor entrance/person. This alloes you for a 10 minutes walk to the base of the waterfall, after you have parked and enter the park, you realise you have to pay again for the cable car... We have taken cable cars for less then half the price,",
          "Well worth the drive or bus tour to see these falls. The cable car ride to the top has awesome views of the falls. There is a zip line across the falls, the cost of this was $27.00 Canadian, about $21 is US $. The manor at the top was lovely also. The stairs are currently",
          "Stunning views of falls taller than Niagara! The bridge across the top is a bit daunting for those with vertigo, but spectacular. Lots of room for walking & exploring around the falls, and pictures from the cable car are encouraged. Wonderful afternoon!",

          "Stunning falls with a rainbow at the end. It is $8 per person to take the cable car up to the suspension bridge. The bridge gives an extraordinary view above the falls. There is a restaurant located at the top.",
          "Not Niagara but really impressive with a well designed park to get around. It includes a huge flight of stairs you can go down to get wet and view the falls from below and get exercise climbing back up again. The suspension bridge over the top is a nice touch and the more",

          "Costs CA$20 for admission for 2 people. If you want cable car ride, it's additional cost. I believe you have to hike up to the bridge above the falls. Being that it was raining, we didn't want to walk. So basically you can actually see the falls while driving up Route 138",

          "I really only went to do the zip line so I can\u2019t speak for the rest of the park. This is less than 10 miles outside Old Quebec and a great side trip for the lovely views and the adventure of doing the zip line over the waterfalls. It\u2019s affordable as well.",

          "Always a fun place to visit. Normally we ride bikes ou along a well defined bike path from lower Old Quebec. This time we drove out. Always fun, if the tram waiting lines aren't too long, to go up to the top have, lunch at the restaurant, and then walk ovr the various look",

I thought it would be scary since it\u2019s literally over a waterfall, but it goes at such a nice speed and you really get to experience the view of the magnificent waterfall. There\u2019s two zip lines at once, so you can go with friends. It\u2019s $27, I wished",

          "This is so worth it! Drove to the Falls from Montreal for a day trip and really enjoyed it. My teens did the zip line and they loved it especially the free video. Such a beautiful spot! The walk up the steps is not easy but doable! Definitely worth the visit and the admissions.",
          "Visited with family. Very pretty. We walked up the stairs, which is quite the walk, but I recommend. Not as amazing as Niagara Falls, but if in the area, worth the visit.",
          "We took a shuttle bus to the falls from the street in front of Chateau Frontenac. This service was very convenient. Arriving at falls around 11:00 we encountered massive traffic jam caused by private vehicles entering the parking lot. Once we arrived at the visitor center, we",

          "If you\u2019re going to Quebec City, it\u2019s well worth making the short trip outside of town to see these falls. They\u2019re quite beautiful and you can view them from multiple different angles , including zip line (which I recommend! Great fun!). I climbed down the 400+ stairs to get",
          "Nice experience. We crossed the bridges (fantastic view) and walked all the way down to the water and back up. Great places to take pictures in a relaxed mode.",
          "Two of our family members tried this activity. Our pre-purchased tickets were for 11am but we were allowed to do it when we arrived @10:15. It was great fun.",
          "This park has a beautiful view of the Montmorency Falls. If you\u2019re driving yourself, arrive early, before 9am, to beat the tour bus crowds. The walk to the suspension bridge is short and easy. You can continue across the bridge to a lot of stairs to get to the bottom of the",
          "We came here as part of a very nice bike tour. It was great to have a guide and learn about local history along the way. Only regret is that we would have liked to spend more time at the falls and check out some of the hiking trails. There is a pretty good gift shop.",
          "We have been twice. The first time from the bottom of the falls and the second time from the top of the falls. I like it from the top more as the path to walk there have awesome views and shady. I didn't cross the bridge but my bf did. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "It\u2019s a very beautiful and relaxing view I recommend going. It rained while we were there so we experienced two different feelings. It was amazing as all family members can enjoy. I saw couple of babies with their family and my 3years old also enjoyed it. So don\u2019t worry if you",
          "You have several options when visiting the park. You can drive to the top and see the falls from the bridge crossing the falls. There is also a nice restaurant for lunch If you enter from below, you can either take the cable car up to the top or do the stairs. We did the",
          "We didn't go to the top, but were able to get great views and photos from the viewing area across the train tracks outside of the visitor center and skyway entrance. It only costs the price of parking the car to see. It is no Niagara Falls, but it would be fun to zipline across.",
          "North of Quebec City are the Montmorency Falls (99 feet higher than Niagara Falls, but without the power). For hundreds of years people have been awed by their majesty. Speaking of majesty, two and a half centuries ago the kingdoms of England and France fought a battle here",
          "What a great spot to spend a summer afternoon. Climbed the steps to the top and enjoyed the park and orchards. Many spots for viewing the waterfall and taking photos. Was a bit crowded but is worth the trip. Wear comfortable shoes. Bring a few dollars to get a slushee or ice",
          "Very interesting Falls. They are higher than Niagra Falls, but are right visible from a distance and from the freeway passing by. One can go upto the falls by stairs or cable car. And then get to walk on top of the falls. Just bear in mind - we parked at the base (paid parking",
          "Get there early before the crowds arrive via the buses. There are two parts to the park, the lower walks that offer great views at ground level and allow you to stand in the mist. You can climb up 35 flights of stairs for a view of the falls. You can also take a cable car to",
          "We decided to cycle to the park and we were so glad we did. The cycle ride took a leisurely 45 minutes on a flat easy to follow cycle path. We pre booked the zip wire and headed straight there. Worth getting to park about an hour before because there was a little wait for the",
          "We took the local bus from Old Quebec to Montmorency Falls which was super easy and cheap. You don't need to pay extra on a tour. Being the dead of winter, the place was covered in snow and ice and was magical. Stairs made for fun slides! The falls were partially frozen but",
          "The Montmorency Falls (or Chutes) is a magnificent waterfall and park. If you are able, there are steps to the top where you can walk across the Falls on a bridge. They also have a tram car ride to the top, and zip-lining across the top. There is a snack shop at the bottom and",
          "This was definitely something that every family must encounter. The many steps to the top gives ample time to have conversations and there are landings to take a break and have a laugh while taking in the view. The highlight is crossing the bridge over the falls and watching",
          "A beautiful waterfalls. Wear good walking shoes to really enjoy the falls. You can take a gondola, or walk or cross over it using a zip line",
          "We used the funicular up and walked down which was recommended on this site and we concur! We were there early and had no line for the funicular but later morning, it looked like a long wait.",
          "It is what it is. A cable car bringing you up or down from the top of bottom. If you have small children as I did it is beneficial, all older kids can walk the whole thing for the most part. It was great to see though, and the kids loved it even with a 15 minute down pour.",
          "Loved our afternoon here. Walked around the falls and back up in the cable car I would highly recommend it.",
          "I used a tour to get there, booked from the information center, which has a departure every hour from the old town center. the chute itself is OK (nothing to compare to the Niagara Falls of course) and i took the telepheric one way (had to queue for 45 min though) and used the",

          "Our group of 5 visited here for the mprning before joining the cruise we were due to embark. Well worth a visit nice walks. Stunning Waterfall. Beware its a long way down the steps and the queue for the cable car up gets long. Tip if you park at the top drive down to the bottom",
          "...because if you don't you either get trampled by all the masses of tourists or you'll have to wait quite a while for the cable car if you choose not to walk up to the top. After all the falls are very impressive and definetely worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful views and great attraction Good service for the cable car The zip line is fabulous for an adrenaline rush!",
          "Visited the falls during a dry period. Guide said it was only at about 1/3 of its normal flow. I can only imagine how much water that much be. The day we visited it was massive!",
          "Cable car or 500 steps to the top of the falls and bridge spanning the falls. Zip line for the adventurous across the front of the falls. Walkway from entrance to base of falls and stairs to top of falls. Great view.",
          "We spent a couple of hours here. Parked at the bottom of the falls.(The lot at the top was full) and walked up the wooden stair case to the top. The view at the bottom was by far the best. So if you are limited for time do the bottom and skip the top.",
          "Gorgeous view of waterfalls, suggest to take a look from below and than either drive up to the falls or take a cable car and walk the suspension bridge. We did not do zip line, but it looks great. Walking up the falls using the steps or hiking sounds even better. Great park",
          "The Employees make you feel welcome and safe . The price of the Zip line was very affordable and the Video which they take for you is Free , yes I said Free ! Best of all is the View of the Falls and feeling the cool mist as you Zip by at approximately 50 miles an hour.I loved",
          "We booked a trip with Cyclo Bikes to ride to the falls. It was a fairly easy trip. The falls are gorgeous and a very popular attraction.",
          "Unless you climb down or wade below the falls it only takes maximum of an hour. It is easily viewed from the bridge",
          "After you've been eating, drinking, and shopping your way through Quebec City the waterfall may be just what you need. The trip is quick out of the city and takes you to another land completely. The vibe is very chill and relaxed around the water. There are places where you",
          "These falls are great at 272' . You can enter 3 ways 2 from either side up top and one from below. Best is the bottom or right side facing the falls as it has a great staircase down to a huge platform at the bottom in the mist. This is a must see when in Quebec city. Only",
          "It was a great trip! Buying the tickets online prior to arriving was great and saved us time. The earlier you go the less you wait in line for the cable car. The falls are beautiful and the children even walked in a little at falls. We brought a picnic basket and there was a",
          "The zip line that goes by the falls is relatively cheap at around $20.00 USD and the park has several cameras set up. When you go for a run, the park gives you a ticket to download a free video. The video cuts between each leg and angle giving you a very well edited view of",
          "Super busy, lots of tourists. Didn\u2019t stay long. It was cool, but we moved on. For honestly a better waterfall experience, I would recommend the one in L\u00e9vis.",
          "The climb up the stairs is long and steep; about 475 steps, but we thought well worth it. Great view from the top. But one thing; don`t climb unless you are in good physical condition. Like I said, long and steep but there are benches on the way up.",
          "Took the bus out to the falls, walked down the stairs and rode the gondola back up. Beautiful falls, swarming with people, many of whom stopped in the middle of the stairs and pathways taking selfies. Was a very hot day, so to avoid passing out from heatstroke we waited the 45",
          "If you have a couple of days in Quebec then it\u2019s worth visiting these Falls. We looked at the different options for getting there & back and for a family of 4 it worked out best value to use a taxi - about $35 each way. It also meant we got there early, so avoided the long",
          "Great half day trip , only 10-15 minutes from downtown Quebec. We took the cable car to the top, walked across the bridge and down the stairs. It took us a leisurely 1.5 hour if that, with lots of stopping for pictures.",
          "Accessed by the bike trail, this was a great way to spend a morning. At the time we were not able to take the tram to the top but many people were doing just that.",
          "We enjoyed the views from the cable car but, for the money, I recommend parking at the top near the Manoir to walk the area and enjoy the suspension bridge. We visited at dusk and found the crowds to be quite light. We did not take the stairs but would definitely try that next",
          "This was great! Scary, and fun at the same time - the guides were all really nice and helpful. So worth the price and you get a free video of your zip to pull off their website and share!",
          "it was my second time zip lining..the first was during my visit to a mall in Edmonton a few years back. But this was the real deal!! You zip down, feel the breeze, see the falls right in front...wow..what an experience. Getting there - we bough the tickets and parking ticket",
          "My husband and I had been to Quebec City many times but this last trip we had a rental car. It was worth the drive to the Parc de la Chute-Montmorency. The walk was wonderful and the sun was shining. It was busy however that didn't take away from our overall positive experience",
          "If they gave this waterfall a little love it would be worth going. Maybe I'm jaded because I just left Niagara Falls. But it's disappointing.",
          "Take the cable car up and walk down the stairs they have. It's awesome just walking on top of the falls and feeling the sound and power just under your feet. Loved it.",
          "We visited the falls and although there was an hour wait for the gondola, we still enjoyed the views and photo opps. We decided quickly not to stand in line for the cable car because of the crowds, but it didn\u2019t ruin our trip, as we could see a lot from the ground. You can also",
          "Great place to visit and you can do in less than 2 hours. Steps are tough but don\u2019t have to do them.",
          "This is a must if you go to Quebec City it's a short distance away- Take the gondola and then at the top go over the bridge and down to the bottom- This makes it a lot easier - Great views from the top- If you have someone that can not get around well - You can drive around to",
          "This waterfall is easily accessible, whether you walk down and around the landing area, and take the funicular back up to your starting point (which we did) or do it the other way round. If you're brave enough, there's also a zip line across!",
          "We parked at the top (only because that's where our sat nav took us), walked across the bridge and ended up wandering down all the wooden steps, across another bridge and back up via the cable car. It's definitely worth going to although it could do with some investment as it",
          "If you visit Quebec City then Montmorency is well worth a visit. The falls are impressive and the grounds and trails make for a nice morning or afternoon outing.",
          "Best advice I can give - go early. We got there shortly after 10 am and were able to walk right in the cable car and ride up. The views were beautiful and walking was pleasant. As we left around 11:30, the line for the ride up was long and snaked outside. Great photo ops!!!",
          "Montmorency fall is very beautiful no matter where you are. You can take pics either at the distance, stand right in front or above it crossing the suspension bridge. To get up to the bridge you can either take a round trip cable car for about $14.50CAD/ pp or hiking up lots",
          "Nice park and views. the cable care workers were on strike so just the falls area was open. They have a big walk to the top but only for someone in decent shape. You can use your ticket and drive to the upper park with bridge across.",
          "We went to the park but line up for tickets was so long, it extended to outside of the building. We decided to just walk around and were able to be as close to the waterfall as possible - we were soaked from the mist! Very peaceful and relaxing atmosphere!",
          "I wouldn\u2019t recommend coming here if you only have a few days in town. We went on a Sunday and it was so crowded. Long lines. Niagara Falls much better. Glad I saw it. We stayed at bottom due to very long lines for gondola Too many stairs for me to climb to top.",
          "The views are amazing, the park is beautiful, but it is crowded. We got there before 10am and barely had to wait for the cable car to the top and the stairs weren\u2019t that crowded. Once we left, however, the lines were very long and the stairs were packed.",
          "We parked up at the North East end entrance where you pay to get in, I believe it was American $10, not bad and it supports the park,...many people we noticed were parking outside the park and walking in, not the hassle we wanted to have to worry about. If you park up on top of",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to this lovely waterfall. We started with a walk across the suspension bridge, then hiked through the small forested area to reach the stairs leading down to the lower level. It's fun to watch the zip-liners zoom across in front of the falls as",
          "We stopped here after spending a day at Ile d \u2018Orleans as it was on the way back to Quebec. The waterfalls are nothing to write home about, especially if you\u2019ve been to places like Yellowstone and Niagara Falls. Yes, it is about 100 feet higher than Niagra Falls, but",
          "There was no problem accepting our prepaid reservation from TripAdvisor. It saved us time in line. The park was beautiful. Everyone was friendly and the zip line was exhilarating. Highly recommend. When you are done, take a drive around Isle d\u2019Orleans.",
          "Higher than Niagra Falls, this is a beautiful sight with easy access from the highway. You can take a cable car to the top, walk up (and/or) down 473 steps, zip line across the falls, or take a rugged hike up and around to the falls. There is also a suspension bridge across the",
          "This is about 20 minutes outside of old Quebec and a must do when visiting the area! We had our Uber drop us off at the parking lot at the top of the falls, where we then took the cable car down, with stunning scenic views. After that, we did the climb up many stairs back to the",
          "Loved this waterfall hike. We actually did a biking tour to the falls and took the gondola up. There is a parking lot near the top though that allows you to get to the top of the falls without the gondola. The waterfalls are higher than Niagra falls but not as wide or as much",
          "The Montmorency Falls are spectacular. Park at the top the North side less congested The gondola down gives a great view of the falls and the city of Quebec looking west You need to have some stamina to climb the stairs back up and enjoy the suspension bridge on to of the Falls",
          "I am soo happy I did this Zipline. We didn\u2019t make a reservation so we had to wait about 45 minutes for our turn which was fine. The cost was affordable at @$30 per person. Such a beautiful view. You don\u2019t get sprinkled from the falls because you are so high up but I wouldn\u2019t",
          "We booked a round trip bus ticket from Old Quebec to Montmorency Falls which cost about $20 per person. We stayed there for about 3 hours, which was sufficient for us to see everything we wanted. When you arrive (late morning for us) - it is very busy in the terminal. If",
          "You can drive, you can take a bus tour. These falls are impressive, Some stalwart youngsters take the LONG stairs up to the top. We recommend the cable car up and back, great views. You can walk across the suspension bridge across the top of the falls.(not scary and I hate",
          "The falls are visible from the highway. But you can ride the lift if you get a park ticket. Also zip line is available for those wanting to hike up 100,000 steps (not sure how many but it looked like a long way). However the zip line did look worth the hike!",
          "Beautiful waterfall. Easy to get to, not expensive. Long walk up to falls but worth it. Great for pictures",
          "Visited this site again after several years. It is a natural beauty for sure, but is diminished by efforts to commercialize it. For example there is a large in-your-face closed in foot bridge spanning across the entire brink of the falls from one side to the other\u2014it really",

          "Fun place. The bridge over the falls was pretty cool. Nice trail to get some food or slushies. Fun to watch the zip liners go across the falls",
          "This was definitely on the list of things to see in Quebec and it didn\u2019t disappoint. At first we parked up at the top. Then walked a bit spent time on the bridge then watched the zip liners. We wanted to go to the bottom but we didn\u2019t want to take all the stairs cause it was in",
          "We spent half a day exploring the waterfall and park - it was a great day! The kids loved exploring the area and adults were awed by the waterfall. It\u2019s a perfect half-day outing made more comfortable with food options and clean restrooms in the park!",
          "We took a bike tour to the site. Nice waterfall but not majestic like Niagara Falls- even though this one is higher. Fun cable car to top, walk across a very crowded bridge then took the 400+stairs down. Go in the morning before crowds get crazy.",
          "Great place to get your steps in for the day. Great views from the suspension bridge and from the stairs going down to the bottom of the falls. It can get crowded as you can only go two-wide on the stairs (one going down and one up). They also have a zip line (very reasonably",
          "We drove from Montreal to MONTMORENCY FALLS via Trois Rivieres... we had SUCH a GREAT time! We took the cable car to the top , admiring the birds eye view of the falls , as well as the walkway on the rocks .. we then walked on the suspension bridge across the massive falls",
          "I\u2019ve been to the falls before, prior to the advent of the cable car and when it was much less crowded. Going again I would skip the cable car ride, would park near the Manior and walk across the bridge and go the other side of the falls. It was really too crowded this weekend to",
          "Very pretty but scary when your are on the bridge. If you are physically limited I would skip going up or down the stairs, you can use the cable cars although there is still a little walking. Not to busy where you wait forever. You can zip line over the falls.",

          "Visited early to take advantage of good light for photos of the falls and to avoid crowds. Walked up stairs to falls, across the bridge and down paths other side. Also took advantage of the trails away from the falls and walked down to the river banks. You can walk close to the",
          "We spent about a half day at the park and took the cable car down, walked up the stairs (about 25 floors according to fitbit), and walked across the bridge above the falls. We also spent some time just relaxing in the park after walking up the stairs. So, I've been to Niagara",
          "We pretty much spent the whole day here. We had two family members do the zip line which was great (about $25 each). We also paid for the round trip gondola ride as it was a really hot day and those stairs down the mountain looked completely exposed. At the bottom we walked out",
          "We went in the late afternoon when it was a bit cooler and walked up the steps. Highly recommend if you are reasonably fit! I felt a huge sense of accomplishment when I got to the top and stood on the center of the bridge above the falls. I also saved the $12 or however much",
          "This is a special place. The amount of water flowing over is enormous. The sound is surprising. You can get quite close underneath. We were getting damp from the spray. If you feel the need, there is a climbing option and also a flying fox. Don\u2019t bother with the top. You can",
          "We stopped by the falls leaving Quebec to go to Montreal, even though it was a little out of the way. We took advice of other travelers and parked behind the McDonald's, walked across the bridge and onto the path leading to the falls. We had a great view. We were able to walk",
          "Montmorency falls is beautiful, of decent size and the proximity to the city is very good and also one can easily get there quickly. The view to the river is breathtaking. But the hype of taller than Niagara Falls made me think of Niagara, where I used to live and it is nowhere",
          "Beautiful park, friendly staff. The gondola ride was so lovely, views beautiful. Bathrooms kept clean, lots of food and drink stations. Lovely artworks in the park and the gardens were beautiful.",
          "This is worth the trip from old Quebec and can be reached on public transport. It\u2019s accessible on foot and the cable car isn\u2019t necessary if you don\u2019t mind the climb!",
          "The falls were beautiful. My 15 year old daughter zip lined across and it was amazing! The downside was that the zip line was the ONLY thing my 12 year old son wanted to do on our whole trip, and when we got there, he couldn't do it because although the website said he had to",
          "This was a really nice visit to a beautiful waterfall! There are several parking lots - I parked in the one at 2490 Ave Royale (closest to the restaurant) as the other one off Rue Montmorency was full by the time I got there at 11:30am on a Monday. It cost about 12 and change",
          "There are two paid parking areas for the Montmorency Falls (north and south end). But did you know you can save a pretty penny by parking outside the park? It's nice to support the park but the price tag may be a bit much for some so just park somewhere outside the park in the",

          "We decided not to purchase the cable car but instead take the staircase, which we did not regret! The view to the waterfall is amazing and as the water amount was huge, we got socked - perfect for a hot day. Once on the top, we walked across the bridge. We had our own lunch, so",

          "We came here primarily to do the zipline, which was really fun. Plus you can download a free video of yourself or show off your adventure on social media. But there is so much more to this park than just the zipline, lots of hiking/walking areas, the gondola, rock climbing, etc.",
          "A friend of ours last minute told us about this beautiful spot. We decided to go for a few hours on our Quebec vacation. We were 3 families with children aged 3-11 traveling together. It cost $12.50 Canadian per vehicle to park which I was told is free during the winter months",
          "Beautiful park. Hike around the falls as well as off the beaten track on some of the other trails. Nice place to spend a day.",
          "this is a great fall to visit, you can walk through stairs ( 469 stairs ) or get the cable car ( around 15 canadian $ ). it has a very beautiful view from the top and an exciting zipline, you can do cliff-climbing also you must not miss this experience",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed this park. It is close to old Quebec. The falls are small but pretty and on a hot day cool you off when you walk nearby. There is a cable car to take you from the top to the bottom of the falls. Then you can walk on a promenade to the bottom of the falls",
          "I would highly recommend the falls but not taking the cable car I would walk next time to the top the views are amazing",
          "This is a wonderful stop for everyone. The falls are impressive! The paths are easy and well maintained and the gondola is quick and nice. Take the stairs down if you want to see rainbows.",
          "Well worth a visit to this waterfall which is taller than Niagara but less wide. We enjoyed walking above the falls and got some amazing photos as we descended by the steps.",
          "We drove to the park today to see the waterfalls. Unfortunately, or fortunately the cable car workers were on strike for additional wages. No problem we\u2019re used to hiking up and down stuff. Remember to take some water. We climbed the stairways to the top and walked across",
          "We were very fortunate to have an incredible weather day with loads of sun and a great breeze. The falls are amazing and a lovely site. They almost sneak up on you as you near the location. The gondola was not available, but it was still a very nice visit.",
          "Peaceful, majestic, impressive--well worth a visit. Good for families, nice trails, friendly staff. Choice of foods in snack bar need to be more vegetarian-friendly, though.",
          "Only a short distance from the city and a must see. Fantastic waterfall and a long climb down, and back again of course, to the bottom of the falls. Well worth the effort. Cable car if you would prefer and the zip-lining all add to a great day out. Lovely park area surrounds it",
          "I would highly recommend going to see these falls. We have visited Quebec City many times and didn't take the time to see the attraction. I'm so happy we did. The restaurant at the top was charming- very limited boring menu selection( burgers, poutine, fish and chips) but worth",

          "Lovely! The Montmorency falls are gorgeous. What a view! Easily accessed from the parking lot there is a viewing point. For the more adventurous ones you can climb up to a viewing platform. You can also take the cable car and ride to the \u2026",
          "What a great day my daughter get the zip line right across the falls",
          "Wonderul family place to be in. Enjoyed the zipline. Not alot of places to eat from. Best advised to carry your own snacks to enjoy the place best. There is no entrance fee. Parking can be cumbersome if you dont plan ahead.",
          "This place was ok. They claim 1.5x Niagra falls. This seems smaller. They charge $6.00 while niagra is free. This is just ok and over hyped.",
          "This is usually a busy spot but don\u2019t let that deter you. The views of the waterfall are amazing and totally worth the crowds. There is even a zip line that you can pay to use to get up close to the falls, and I believe it only costs either $25 or $35 per person for it. Be ready for lots of stairs!!",
          "My best practice spot!",
          "800 bus from just outside the train station takes you to the falls, it\u2019s the last stop so you can\u2019t go wrong. To get a ticket for the bus, if you don\u2019t have the correct money, go to the convenience store across from the Orl\u00e9ans express \u2026",
          "Partly iced up and beautiful in the rain.  We saw it from the suspension bridge and from the bottom of the fall as it flows on to the river.",
          "Beautiful place to visit, the entrance fee is cheap and the place is worth it.",
          "The view is amazing.. one of the best place to visit in Quebec province.. the overbridge and stairs to get down the falls are stunning..",
          "Nice place to have a relaxing and fun moment with friends and family. You can ride a bike, run or just walk around the park and enjoy the place. If you like adventure, take a ride on zip-line.",
          "Definitely not Niagara Falls like I read somewhere. This has its own beauty and breath taking views. A lot of the falls was still frozen solid. The walk up to the falls is awesome and getting on the bridge to see the falls under you was \u2026",
          "Beautiful view of a huge waterfall. Super cool in winter.",
          "It's a waterfall. We have one at home much like it. Charming old resort building that I may have enjoyed more if I weren't part of the hordes of tourists from cruise ships.",
          "This is where the trolley service is. Good connectivity with public transport. Ample parking space available.",
          "I visited the park and the waterfall at night. Not like during the day, it was free to enter and the view of the waterfall was very nice. I enjoyed visiting there.",
          "Beautiful short walk even during the winter. Some of the facilities aren\u2019t open during winter, like the zip line, but it\u2019s still a beautiful park with amazing views.",
          "An amazing natural wonder ... that we had no idea even existed.  We were in Quebec city and did a quick google search one morning only to find this attraction less than an hour out of town.  We thought at worst we'd get to explore la belle \u2026",
          "The current pinpointed location of this waterfall park on Google Maps is at the cable car station. This is one way to visit the waterfall. The cable car takes you up to Montmorency Manor, where you will do some light hiking to reach the \u2026",
          "If you\u2019re in the Quebec City area then this is a must visit. At 33 m higher than Niagara Falls it is a good example of a cataract falls. We parked at the the top and walked around then we drove to the bottom and went up to the base of the falls it was a great day with great views all around. Enjoy!",
          "Best falls viewing from the adjacent suspension bridge with Wooden floor, There a was an amazing and  beautiful hill top viewing spot. \nLiked the Cable car , it's slow in moving to hilltop but an excellent 270 degree viewing.",
          "Beautiful spot to stop and go for a walk, the falls are amazing!  Take a lunch and picnic or for just a couple hours of strolling around the grounds, much of it is stroller friendly, if you have small children you may want to be more \u2026",
          "Great place with an amazing view. Very close to the city and easy to reach by bus or car.",
          "Wow!  Amazing falls, and they have a cool way to go around the whole falls to include steep steps (we went down), a suspension bridge and a car lift.   The stairs can be a bit scary for those afraid of heights.  If you want to get wet at \u2026",
          "This is way smaller and much less spectacular than Niagara falls, but has its own charm. If you plan to use stairs on a side of waterfall to go up, prepare to quite heavy exercise. We recommend to pack a bug spray. There is also zip line, and short aerial tramway",
          "I've visited this place 4 times now and never get tired of it. The falls are absolutely amazing and so powerful. We've always parked in the base lot then taken the cable car ride up which is really fun. Then walking across the bridge to get \u2026",
          "Beautiful falls with beautiful views from above and below. Nice gift shop and restaurant",
          "Great thing to do.... easy bus trip!",
          "Very large waterfall, the bridge and trail allow you to see it from all angles. A must see in Quebec city!",
          "nice place to stop and visit",
          "Great park! Enjoyable for kids and adults. Lots of natural space and places to picnic",
          "I absolutely loved hiking and zip lining here, it's such a beautiful place and the people who work here are such wonderful staff. Amazing",
          "Very nice and easy to find the perfect place for you and your family and friends to do things.",
          "Nice scenic park. We walked up/down the stairs....great leg workout. The falls are beautiful. The suspension bridge does get quite crowded. They really should do something about the lack of restrooms. The day we visited, the restroom at the \u2026",
          "Naturally beautiful winter and summer both times.",
          "The falls are amazing and worth getting up close. Try the zip line for an added thrill",
          "Clean and beautiful visit. Make sure you\u2019re wearing good shoes if you want to go up or down the stairs.. the zip line is cool there!",
          "Great place to spend a few hours and only 40 mins on the bus. There is also a marked trail along the river which is worth visiting.",
          "Beautiful place if you visit Quebec. Not expensive and really quick. I had a great time there during the summer. They say it's even better in winter",
          "Amazing falls ..views from hanging bridge right above and also the concrete area down below which can be reached via 440+ stairs or a long stroll from parking lot across the river. The zipline zooming across the falls is an added attraction",
          "Very beutiful. The waterfall was amazing, and the walkway at the top offered views of both the falls and St. Lawrence river. There was a long paved pathway that winds from the top of the falls, over the waterfall, and down the surrounding \u2026",
          "Simply beautiful.  A must see in Quebec.",
          "The falls might be slightly far away for some and secluded from Quebec City. If you want to travel with kids, they might look forward to it. But if you are 20- 30 would be better to avoid. Might even skip if you are going there for photography",
          "When visiting qubec city, visiting the falls should be way down on your priority list. You cannot really see the falls from the bridge and the wait for cable car is longg! If you have time and want to do a Zipline, then consider going",
          "You have to try the zip-line jump! It will make totally worth the visit for the great view and adrenaline over the waterfall.",
          "Loved it very much.  Such an amazing experience to be able to explore this natural beauty.",
          "Very nice park and waterfalls area. Love the fact that it's dog friendly and the dogs are able to ride the cable car.  Great way to spend a day enjoying the view and the walk along the park.",
          "Beautiful scenery and very well laid out. The visitors centre is laid out very well with a shop and snack bar, the toilets are clean. A lovely day out.",
          "Definitely worth the short drive/transit/bike ride out to there falls, if you're in the area. The stairs may look intimidating but there are lots of places to stop and rest - and take photos. The views from the top are great and there are trails to walk through the park.",
          "Loved traveling to this serene place during the cold winter. Less tourists but worth a visit...",
          "Nice gift shop and park area entrance into spectacular Montmorency Falls!",
          "We had a wonderful time. This place  was so beautiful and breathtaking. The falls are a truly awesome. So glad we came!",
          "The falls here are amazing. They are soo vibrant and awesome. When going down the 20 stories to reach the fall, you can feel the wind and mist coming down from the falls. You can get really wet, so remember a coat. :)",
          "Good place to visit and have a beatiful view of the bridge to the Island of Orleans",
          "A short 15 min Uber ride from the Old City.  Well worth it!",
          "Great place! Its gorgeous, even in winter.",
          "1 hour is more than enough to see this beautiful spot. I suggest anyone visiting Quebec city to go there!",
          "Pricy to park and the take the gondola up, but nice for tourist. Kids enjoyed.",
          "Amazing place,  you park outside and you do not have to pay the entrance to see the waterfalls",
          "Amazing waterfall in Quebec province. You have 2 options to see this waterfall, from top or bottom which you need to take 2 different roads to get to them, both options are free of charge but you need to pay for the parking which I belive \u2026",
          "Good food, a variety of different appetizer, good service. It's a busy place.",
          "It's beautiful! When it is surreal to sit right opposite to it and see how magnificent it is!! Must see if u r in Quebec.",
          "Impressive waterfall very close to Quebec City. The views are stunning. Ideal location for a quick escape from the urban heat.",
          "Very beautiful. Lots of tourists. Would recommend going in the morning. Clean park",
          "What a wonderful place with a wonderful view as well. The power of this waterfall is just insane.\n\nI pretty like the fact that you can get really near from the waterfall to feels it securely and there's also observation stairs and funitel which make the experience more magical.",
          "Beautiful place to walk. Many people go there.",
          "Beautiful place and well organized. They have other activities like the cable car, zip line and also the train station right there if you want to have a tour.",
          "One of the most iconic place around Quebec City. Very beautiful places. Lot of mosquitoes at the end of spring and beginning of summer. The waterfall is majestuous and the view is amazing.",
          "A must visit spot when in Quebec. We were there on 12/28/2019. There were a huge line to get into the park, but it was worth it.",
          "Nice big falls in winter. Shame about the view at the bottom.",
          "Impressive falls. A little busy with your groups. Cross the bridge and descend/ascend the 478 steps for the best view of the falls from the bottom.",
          "Great hike with the family,. And amazing experience with the kids. Beautiful place to visit in Quebec City.  Highly recommend.",
          "Very scenic place.",
          "Beautiful parc to visit when you are in Qc city. It's a must!",
          "Well kept up. The zip line looked fun. Lots of public places to have picnics. Our Uber driver offered to drive us to the top so we wouldn't have to pay for the ride up.",
          "Nice fall and nice walk.  It was pretty with lots plants and flowers.",
          "Absolute gorgeous views and the walk was so fun",
          "Was it really beautiful place to go and visit glad we made the stop definitely worth the time and the cost to go up to see the falls",
          "It's a nice place to visit and enjoy the snow in winter.",
          "Gorgeous falls!\nDrive up to the mountains, park in free street parking and walk to falls area(10mins, easy walk)..you will find small water fall formation on your way when walking.\nThen, reach the falls and take pictures from view points \u2026",
          "Nice place to park for a trip to the falls. They have a gift shop and restrooms.",
          "Nice place to visit with family. Entrance fees were $30 for the parking.",
          "This waterfall is gorgeous! Things you should know before visiting: \nThere are 2 parking lots; one at the bottom of the falls another at the top.\nI suggest the parking at the top because with the current renovations taking place, only the \u2026",
          "We arrived at the Montmorency park at 7pm and the parking was open for free after-hours access (parking fee is 12.5$ during normal open hours). So we visited both upper and lower parks for free, saving 25$. Walked across the bridge up on \u2026",
          "Nice waterfall. Lots of watery goodness falling from through the air. Had all the appeal of a waterfall. 10 out of 10.",
          "Definitely worth the visit as it is very beautiful. You can take the cable car round trip for about $14-15. There is also various viewpoints, bridges and staircases for picture opportunities. Ziplining available too. It can get quite windy and cold closer to the waterfall so dress warm.",
          "Helpful friendly staff. We are glad we went before busy season as they get a lot of visitors in summer but it was pretty quiet when we were there this weekend. Short easy walk from the parking lot to the falls.",
          "Nice place for a long walk, lot of stairs though so be prepared. Great view of the waterfall.",
          "Beautiful scenery and a big park to relax and enjoy a picnic with friends and family. Definitely recommend for a day out.",
          "Still a beautiful place even though much was covered by ice since we went there in winter",
          "Great place to visit even during winter.",
          "Amazing view and very nice hike there ! The falls are mesmerizing and the 400 steps up and down are challenging but definitely a must see and so in Quebec",
          "It's one of the best waterfalls I've ever seen. Definitely a must-see place in Quebec. We've come in the beginning of November and there were few people visiting, so we didn't have to wait to enter any of the overlook spots. Keep your kids close: it's is very safe but also very high, so it is actually very scary. Highly recommend.",
          "Such an incredibly beautiful place to spend the day. You can easily walk around the entire waterfall and even across the top from one side to the other. There's a cable car from the bottom of the wash to the top of the falls. If you're \u2026",
          "Lots of water coming down. Very impressive. Not much into the tourism factory myself but I guess that may work for some. The staff is very friendly.",
          "Fun place to visit, except they have construction going on right now which doesn't allow you to fully walk the trail",
          "Fantastic pizza n wine served. Restaurant is unique in area of unsco heritage building and service was great",
          "Very nice place. Prepare to walk a lot $12.50 for parking plus cable car \ud83d\udea0 extra.",
          "Stunning views. Zipline is pricey, but absolutely worth it if it's within your budget. The trails around the park are incredible as well, and there is lots to see besides the waterfall.",
          "Really crowded, must be lucky to take a nice pic with no one on it.\nBut well, the falls are nice.",
          "A must if you visit Quebec City, you can take the bus from the city, so you won't have to struggle finding a spot for your car.",
          "Breathtaking! Really memorable and beautiful!. We took the cable car up and hiked down! Loved it!",
          "Great place. We loved the waterfall and my kid had a good time around the park there. Nice long bridges to walk right above the water flow which is so nice to watch. Great place for landscape photographers",
          "Visiting Quebec was amazing especially in the summer time, lots to do and see around the city...not the mentioning the Canadian dollar is lower than the US dollar. Winter was fun toooo but dammm cold....not highly recommended",
          "Awesome view of the falls from the park.  A good glimpse of Quebec City as well.  Highly recommend you visit this place.",
          "Amazing waterfaller.  You can walk across on a bridge, Zipline across, and descend to the base to experience the full wrath of nature pounding spray all over you.  Lots of good view points.  Fairly good hiking.  Great place to take the kids \u2026",
          "Amazing. I have no words to describe this place",
          "What a great place to get in touch with nature. Walking over the bridge at the top of the bridge was amazing looking out over the Canadian landscape.",
          "Beautiful views of the waterfall from foot bridge.  Zip lines are available. Montmorency Manit has shop and restaurant.",
          "Great place to go for either a walk or to have some peaceful time on an evening",
          "Fun place to take the family. The stairs going up might be a little too much for some, don't push yourself or others if they are not comfortable with the height",
          "Beautiful! Must see if you're visiting Quebec city",
          "So the Park itself is free, you just have to pay parking (8$) and Gondola if you want. After walking around the pathways and the beautiful suspension bridge we really didnt see the need for the Gondola ride since we were already parked at \u2026",
          "If you enjoy the nature, this place is for you! You'll walk a lot but it'll be worthy",
          "Very interesting. Well worth the stop.",
          "Very nice place. Enjoyed the zip liner and it was affordable price",
          "The panoramic views are definitely worth the visit. Drive up to the top and park near MacDonald's. From there you can walk to the bridge spanning the falls.",
          "This is a great place to spend two hours. We took the gondola up and then walked around and did the 2.5 km hike along the river. We walked down the steps to feel the spray of the fountain. It felt refreshing after all the walking. We bikes \u2026",
          "Beautiful and very well maintained but semi-hidden behind tall fences if you stay at the bottom. You have to pay for parking and you also have to pay for a lift to go to the top.",
          "Must see ....Beautiful waterfall and gondola so you walk to the base",
          "Really nice place to visit. If you are fit and don't really want to pay $40 to use the cable car just park on the street and use the steps.",
          "Nice water park. Staff was superb. I lost a small item very important to me in water during a slide and one of the employee Fred was the hero he was extremely helpful and so nice of him he was able to found my thing. Fred thanks a lot. Other staff was also very nice and cooperative.",
          "Amazing view points and exquisite landscapes",

          "I really wanted to go there with jojo",
          "The amount of water in the spring is amazing. Very powerful! Being able to walk at the top, bottom and have side viewpoint is very interesting.",
          "Great place but very busy. Be prepared to wait in line for a long time to get into the park",
          "Great views!! Must see.",
          "This place is simply amazing. Be ready to walk a bit because the cable car is only on one side. Overall a grear experience though.",
          "Pretty cool, but I didn't get much of a chance to really explore. Wear your boots because the ground can get muddy from the waterfall spray.",

          "Beautiful place to spend the day with family and friends. Beautiful views and landscape",
          "The Monmorency falls were lovely. These falls are about a hundred feet higher than Niagara. Even though they were partially frozen, the entire view with water falling through frozen ice was breathtaking. Taking the cable car is worth it \u2026",
          "Tourist place.  Was pretty to see but I wouldn't go out of your way to get there.",
          "Spectacular views of a natural beauty. Steeper than Niagra falls.",
          "Beautiful waterfalls, and we enjoyed the place, but the zipline took us much longer time to prepare than the experience itself. The cable car was not as good as expected.",
          "The place was closed but you can take a look",
          "Nice, you can pay to ride the telecabin or use the 300ish stairs to see up and down the falls.  There is a bridge right over the fall also. Very nice easy short walk.",

          "Very nice. Wonderful walkways.  Easy to access it even with a wheelchair.  Very memorable.",
          "GORGEOUS and well worth the entrance fee. We were a bit disappointed by all the cables they had put up right in front of the falls but it was pretty nonetheless. You are able to walk up above the falls using a suspension bridge as well.",
          "We managed to get on the via ferrata and it was an experience of a lifetime. The park does get really crowded during the summer months and the zipline can have bit of a queue. Highly recommended to visit. Pass on the cable car",
          "What an amazing place! The cable car up was beautiful, and the board walk down offered stunning views.",
          "Go on a nice day like we did.  And take the tour, you learn some interesting stuff.",

          "Niagra falls is much better. The park here is good.",
          "Huge waterfall! Hard hike to the bottom of the falls. Very steep! Need good hiking shoes. Also has a easy hike and it was beautiful.",
          "We were very happy and recd. exceptionally good service from hostess Jeoyoni.",
          "Beautiful place, trying to get into the upper parking lots is a joke, extremely slow and frustrating. Little wait for cable car down, ridiculous wait time to go back to the top.quicker to walk",
          "One of the must see things in Quebec City in the summer time (or maybe in the winter for more challenge). Drive and park on the upper part of the waterfalls, and get a free parking spot around the neighbourhood.",
          "If you are visiting Quebec city, this place is a must go! They falls are breathtaking! They have cable cars and ziplining near the falls!",
          "Impressive falls! Taller than Niagara falls!  Make sure to not only visit from below, you can also get very close following the path to the right of the visitor center (Search \"Montmorency Falls Vista Point\" in google maps).  You can also \u2026",

          "Great views! Recommend taking a bike tour here from the city.",
          "Very nice scenery. I wouldn\u2019t recommend going while it\u2019s very windy and snowing, but over all a very good way to pass time. There are parks and benches and especially good for hiking and walks.",

          "YES!!!  The Zipline was fabulous fun!  I reccomend that you arrive early as it got extremely crowded later in our visit.  The falls are awesome!",
          "The falls aare beautiful. Take the cable car up the falls. There are several places to stop and take pictures.\nAfterwards cross the bridge right over the falls to the other side of the river. Try ziplining back to the other side if you're \u2026",
          "Was okay. Nice to see the chute tho its overcrowded on the bridge or activites.. and stuffs is quite expensive there.",
          "Nice water falls but it is overcrowded in summer, would recommend to take the stairs rather than the cable car. The view is much nicer from the bottom on the way up, there is a Via Ferrata option that would be fun, recommend to go early morning or late afternoon to avoid the crowd.",

          "Stunning waterfall and some history in the park also",
          "Visited while staying in Quebec city during a trip in Canada. We had not heard about it until during our trip. We did not regret including it in our program while in Quebec. You can easily visit in 2 hours and only need to pay the parking. \u2026",
          "A must see place if you are visiting Quebec city. 25 minutes drive from old Quebec city. Beautiful fall with fewer activities like ziplining and a cable car ride on a beautiful location . Parking is really tough on weekends. You have to \u2026",
          "It is sometimes a loooonnngggg way of trafic to make it to the parking lot (15m min for 20meter) on sunny weekend days. I recommend to park near IGA or CAISSE DESJARDINS or near by residencial streets for free. Afterall you went there to walk right?!",
          "Beautiful waterfall with lots of paths and bridges to explore. A must see when visiting Quebec.",
          "Nice parks, there are zips, cable car, or rock climbing. The park is free, if you don't want to pay a parking fee - go park in Iga supermarket and buy something after that you have two hours.",

          "Beautiful view, you can walk on the bridges and if you're more adventurous, then you can definitely climb the 400 and something steps all the way down. I also saw that they do zip line and they do have a funicular although neither of them were working because of the season",

You can take a cable car, hike, climb, rock climb, or even zip line..to experience this wonder.",
          "Its a nice place to go if you are in the vicinity but for those who are from GTA/Niagara this is not that of a wow thing, as they have seen Niagara falls which are way better than these falls.",
          "Make sure you are prepared for an hour or two at this place.\n\nCheck the weather before you go. There is a fee to park inside the park. It is reasonable. \n\nThe park itself is well kept. Falls is great to see. There is a lot of different spots to take pictures.",

          "Worth a visit during a trip to Quebec City.  Parking at the mansion on the hill was $11 but gave easy access to the bridge across the falls. There's a zip line across the falls, too, that you buy tickets for in the mansion. We walked down \u2026",

          "A must when in Qu\u00e9bec city. A 30min bus ride there. Just get it by the train station area and go until the final stop, where you'll find a small entrance to the park. Really worth it to be near this fall, it is good to have some nature in the city. You can go down by stairs (escalier) and up by the cable car (t\u00e9l\u00e9ph\u00e9rique).",
          "Great place.",

        "wiki": "Old Quebec (French: Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec) is a historic neighbourhood of Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. Comprising the Upper Town (French: Haute-Ville) and Lower Town (French: Basse-Ville), the area is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Administratively, Old Quebec is part of the Vieux-Qu\u00e9bec\u2013Cap-Blanc\u2013colline Parlementaire district in the borough of La Cit\u00e9-Limoilou.\nThe area is commonly referred to as \"the Old City\" or \"Quebec's Old City\" in English. It is sometimes referred to as the Latin Quarter (French: Quartier latin) as well, although this title refers more to area around the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, the original site of Laval University.\n\n\n== Upper Town ==\nSamuel de Champlain chose the Upper Town as the site for Fort Saint Louis in 1608. It has remained the city's military and administrative centre because of its strategic position atop the promontory of Cap Diamant. It was occupied mainly by British government officials and Catholic clergy after the British Conquest, while French and English merchants and artisans lived in Lower Town.\n\nMilitary use did hamper growth in the Upper Town for many years, and a movement arose in the late 19th century to demolish the fortifications as obsolete and as an obstacle to urban development. It was Lord Dufferin who successfully persuaded officials to preserve and rebuild them.\nThe area declined and fell into disrepair in the 1950s but new building began in the 1970s.\n\nMost of the buildings date to the 19th century, although some 17th and 18th centuries remain as well. The area has several commercial streets like Saint Jean, Sainte Anne and De Buade. Some public administration and other institutions in the Upper Town are the Quebec City Hall (H\u00f4tel de Ville), the S\u00e9minaire de Qu\u00e9bec, the Ursulines Convent, and the Augustinian Monastery and l'H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec. There are many hotels, including the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac, the Old City being a very popular tourist destination.\nParks in the Upper Town include De l'Esplanade, Artillerie, Des Gouverneurs and Montmorency parks as well as the grounds of l\u2019Hotel-de-Ville.\n\n\n== Lower Town ==\nThe Lower Town is a historic district located at the bottom of Cap Diamant. During 1608, Samuel de Champlain built a habitation where its remains can be found with Place Royale as its centre. It was restored with the goal of reconstructing the French flair from its origins. Construction of the Church of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires started during 1687 at this location and was completed during 1723. The Mus\u00e9e de la civilisation, the Mus\u00e9e naval de Qu\u00e9bec, the caserne Dalhousie and the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Petit Champlain are among some of the museums, performance halls, theatres and exhibition venues in Lower Town.\n\nPlaces such as the Louise Basin, Brown Basin, La \u2013Pointe-\u00e0-Carcy, the Gare du Palais and the Marche du Vieux-Port can be seen from the Port of Quebec.\nOther places of interest include:\n\nPlace de Paris,\nParc Ulric-Joseph-Tessier,\nSaint-Pierre Street,\nSaint-Paul Street,\nSault-au-Matelot Street and\nSaint-Vallier Est Street, previously called Saint-Charles Street, the first paved road in Quebec.A funicular car allows for easy transportation up Cap Diamant connecting to Upper Town from the narrow Petit-Champlain road at the foot of the Cape to the top with a marvellous view of the city. C\u00f4te de la Montagne is another option for hikers.\n\n\n== The Historic District of Old Quebec ==\n\nThe Old Quebec heritage site is located in Quebec City although it is administratively recognized as a part of the borough La Cit\u00e9-Limoilou. It has gained recognition as a part of Quebec's cultural heritage and is also among UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage Sites.\n\n\n=== Background ===\nDuring 1956, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada was given the authority to acquire or expropriate any \"site, building or other place of national historic interest or significance\".The historic district was established following public debates from 1945 to 1965, concerning the preservation of Old Quebec and the restoration of Place Royale. The historic district of Old Quebec is a UNESCO World Heritage List since 1985.The district was established by the National Assembly of Quebec on July 10, 1963 after an amendment to the Historic Sites and Monuments Act. The act made the area in the historic area of the city a \"Declared Historic District\" (French: Arrondissement historique d\u00e9cr\u00e9t\u00e9)' by the province of Quebec, and was expanded the next year to an area of 135 hectares (330 acres). It includes 1,400 buildings within the neighbourhood of La Cit\u00e9, including the promontory of Cap Diamant and a strip of land below the cliffs, between the Saint-Charles River and the Saint Lawrence River. The protected perimeter of the area was delimited in two stages. The initial layout included the fortified area as well as its periphery. The second and final layout added other surrounding areas to the plan on May 6, 1964. The whole district covers a total area of 1.4 km.\nOn December 3, 1985, UNESCO declared the Historic District of Old Quebec a World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Rail ===\nOld Quebec is serviced by Gare du Palais train and bus station. Built during 1915 by the Canadian Pacific Railway, the ch\u00e2teauesque station is similar in design to the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac. Via Rail operates regular services to Montreal via Drummondville. The station is also serviced by the private coach company Orl\u00e9ans Express.\n\n\n=== Air ===\nOld Quebec is 16 km east of Quebec's Jean Lesage International Airport.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Just a short walk from the funicular in Lower Old Town there is this plaza with a historic church. At first all you see are a few old gray buildings. But then you start reading the history and putting things in place. Now we are happy walking this way from our restaurant back to",
          "The square is beautiful. Stand in the center, turn 360 degrees slowly, and just take in the remarkable architecture. Or travel there, as we did, in December and enjoy the magnificent Christmas tree, an off chance of catching a chorus of carolers, and the opportunity to get",

          "We decided to go down and sit in the Square and have breakfast very early which was fantastic. We popped into the church and did that before we saw the bus load of tourists come up from the port. Generally speaking they aren\u2019t there long but after a while they do become",
          "The Place Royale is a great place to shop in Old Quebec. We did not know that Canada is the largest producer of nephrite jade in the world. If you like Jade, Le Jade has a wonderful selection of jade jewelry at very reasonable prices. Many of the stores have items you won't",

          "This square definitely transports you back to a different time. It is very pretty and always has full flower boxes. It's really busy and crowded in this area, very touristy. If you can get past that, it is definitely worth a stop.",

          "Stood in this square, I commented to the wife, it\u2019s just like being in a back street of Paris, that how it felt. A lovely little hidden square, in the lower town, you can\u2019t really miss it, as you walk around. Beautiful!",

          "the Place Royale is a very cool spot to walk through - but be careful if it is icy! The cobblestones can become slippery in the winter due to weather. We went at the end of February, and they had just started to take Christmas trees down, although there were still lights",

          "Little authenticity here but it is a very pretty square. The church is ok but not worth a detour. The public toilets are behind it and they\u2019re probably as big an attraction!",

          "This is a don\u2019t miss if you are staying in Quebec City. The buildings have all been restored back to original condition. A cobblestone street along with the old sidewalks takes you back in time.",

          "Stepped into the square and felt like we were transported back 400 years. The buildings and narrow lanes are a delight to walk. I love how the City is maintaining the charm. The bars and restaurants are subtle and in keeping with the surroundings. Well done the City.",
          "... Place Royale will prove that the clich\u00e9 is true for a reason. This charming little cobble-stoned square could be in Brittany or may different parts of France. Have a cafe au lait on the terrace of a tasty little bistro and watch the hordes of tourists (many from bus tours,",

        "wiki": "The \u00c9difice Marie-Guyart, previously and still commonly known as Complexe G, is a 31-storey, 132 m (433 ft) office skyscraper completed in 1972 in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The brutalist style tower is the tallest building in the city, as well as the tallest building in Canada east of Montreal. Situated in the Parliament Hill borough, the building houses most notably the Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports, the Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks, as well the Observatoire de la Capitale observation deck.\n\n\n== History ==\nDuring the 1960s, as a result of the Quiet Revolution, the Quebec provincial government undertook a period of rapid expansion, resulting in a greater need for office space in the downtown area. In 1961, the \"Commission d'am\u00e9nagment de Qu\u00e9bec\" (Quebec Planning Commission) was formed and in 1963 the Commission produced an ambitious plan for the area surrounding the H\u00f4tel du Parlement. The different buildings outlined in the plan were identified by letters, hence the name \"Complexe G\". The first version of \"Complexe G\", which appeared in 1965, comprised four towers between 22 and 25 floors, a complex that would have offered two and a half times more floor space than what was eventually constructed. In 1969 the project was modified to include the current tower, as were two other towers between it and the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Qu\u00e9bec. The existing buildings on the site were acquired and demolished, however these two additional towers were never constructed. Construction of the current tower began in 1967 and was completed in 1972.In 1987, the tower was officially renamed \"\u00c9difice Marie-Guyart\" in honour of Saint Marie of the Incarnation (born Marie Guyart), an Ursuline nun who was the religious foundress of the Ursuline order in New France.\n\n\n== Observatoire de la Capitale ==\nOn the highest floor of the building, the Observatoire de la Capitale provides a 360 degree view of the city from a height of 221 meters. Visitors can see the Citadelle de Qu\u00e9bec, the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac and the countryside surrounding Quebec City.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Quebec City\nParliament Building (Quebec)\nCitadelle de Qu\u00e9bec\nCh\u00e2teau Frontenac\n\u00c9difice Andr\u00e9-Laurendeau\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nObservatoire de la Capitale",

          "This was our first stop when we arrived in Quebec City. It was a great way to get the lay of the land.",
          "Besides the grand views you could see from all directions, the walls are decorated with facts and figures about Quebec City, the Province and Canada. A fun visit and easy to get to and quite reasonably priced",
          "We went on our last full day in Qu\u00e9bec, and loved being able to look down on the places we'd visited - could see the river and dock, city walls, Citadel, Plains of Abraham, etc. It wasn't at all crowded, no wait for the elevator, well worth the price. Fun information on all",
          "Things that are large in scale, such as the Plains of Abraham, La Citadelle, and Les Fortifications, etc., look better when they are viewed at the Observatoire de la Capitalea. At this high elevation, everything looks better at the proper perspective. You can also see how the",
          "A trip to the top is well worth the time and money as there is a 360 degree view of the city plus a short featuring a guy jumping off the top and sailing about town.",
          "I rarely say things are must see but if in Quebec City and it's a clear day then this is an event you do not want to pass up. It was worth every bit of the $15.00 admission. The 360\u00b0 views are incredible and stunning it gives you a much better appreciation and visual",
          "On floor 31 of this building is a great view in four directions with historical information on the interior walls and fun videos in the interconnecting walkways. Our photographs through the glass came out very well.",
          "Decided to pay the nominal price for the elevator ride up to the observation deck on the 31st floor. Stunning views of all the surrounding area. Detailed descriptions on panels to help the viewer identify buildings one is seeing. Gives one a great sense of the city. Glad we",
          "We found this place to be a great value - especially compared to the prices you pay in places like Boston or New York to get such fabulous views. We visited early on a Sunday and the observatory was pretty quiet. We did, however, meet the local guide who roams around answering",
          "This was my first time to go up in the observatory and I'm glad that I went but I will not be doing it again. Although the view is spectacular up there, it's also spectacular anywhere you are in Quebec City. You can get just as good of a view at the Chateau Frontenac and you",
          "We enjoyed our visit of the observatory. There were no queues for tickets and we were straight up the lift. We were at the top for about an hour. The views were great but no surprises that the best views were of the old city. Lots of interesting information about the city in",
          "Just because I described the Observatoire as \"run of the mill\" doesn't mean that it's not enjoyable. Rather, it's an observatory and you know the drill -- you go up high and see outstanding views of the area. The views are really nice and you're able to identify parts of the",
          "We stumbled across the Observatory, and decided to go up. So glad that we did. It was a beautiful day with clear skies, and gives such a good overview of the city",
          "We hopped off Double Decker to experience the views. It's amazing, 360 degree views of Q C. Outstanding along with the historical info. Can do the entire show and still catch next scheduled bus.",
          "We stopped in to the Observatory on our second day in Quebec City. It was inexpensive and a great way to get your bearings. The panoramic views helped to orient ourselves to the city.",
          "The tourism office recommended we go to the Observatory to get a great bird's eye view of the city and its environs. Great suggestion! Little screens at various points have the main sights labelled and a short history of some of the places was very helpful and informative. Also,",
          "Me and my dad were part of a tour group which went there. It was an interesting place and there is a lot of information or things to learn if you had time which we didn't have much time because we are part of a tour guide. I would go again as the views are wonderful and I want",
          "We found parking in the area in lot with fee. Staff checking in and up top very helpful. All enclosed. You walk around the floor with views the side you are on and wall has history of the area. So 4 areas to view. Short film was available to view again with a bit of",
          "A good way to get oriented to Quebec, especially if it's one of your first things to do in the city and you have a few days there. The educational panels on the interior walls are really well done and informative. Not a crucial element of one's trip but a really good way to",
          "Way under publicized! This educational observation deck gives you history, location, spectacular views and fun facts on Quebec. Wished we had gone here our first day here to acclimate ourselves. What a wonderful exhibition- very well done!!! Only suggestion would be better",
          "A sky view of the surounding inlcuding the old city and the star shape of the citadelle. When the time is limited, but you want to see the area, this is more then a good option!",
          "We really enjoyed this. It's only $10.00 to go up to the observatory. The 360 degree views are captivating. Plaques placed around the observatory give info on the views and history of the areas. A good place to go and learn more about he city. A perfect view of the Old Town.",
          "the entrance is a little hard to find but worth it. the top is actually a restaurant that serves great meals..but.. they do not mind if you want to walk around and enjoy the view..The restaurant is revolving..takes about an hour to do a full turn.",
          "This is a great way to see the city. There are historical descriptions of Quebec on the walls which adds to the experience. La Ciel rotating restaurant on top of a nearby hotel also gives great views however for the cost this is the best value.",
          "Located in a city that is not surrounded by high buildings, the observatory allows to see the whole city plus a great view of the river and the mountains in the back. There's also a lot of info about Quebec and a nice video that takes you through the city and all its main",
          "This building let you have a very relaxing good view of the city, in your own pace. The ticket is good for the whole day, so you can return and take another look if you want to.",
          "Very nice area to view this beautiful city :) I would return again definitely! I took many photos of the different areas!",
          "Very nice views of Quebec City and the surrounding areas (I could even see the spray from the Chute-Montmorency, where we were earlier in the day!) Not much else up there apart from infograms on the walls. Spent roughly half an hour there. Was gutted that it closed at 5pm as it",
          "We recently visited the Observatoire de la Capitale. The views from the 31st floor gave us a real sense of the city and environs. Along all the interior walls were many facts about the history of Quebec and it\u2019s people. We learned a lot and loved the views.",
          "This observatory is located in the tallest building in Quebec City, the Marie-Guyart Building. You cannot miss it as it is a impressive monolith like structure close to the Parliament building. It is named after Marie Guyart, who founded the Convent of the Ursulines and the",
          "Probably the best aerial views of the city, but a bit pricey given there are no tour guides. The videos were not the best quality",
          "The Observatoire de la Capitale is on the 31st floor of what looks like an office building next to the National Assembly. We were staying at the Delta Hotel across the street so it was very easy to get to. It cost $14.50 to take the ride up the elevator to visit. It was free for",
          "We arrived a short time before closing. The staff were very friendly. The top floor is surrounded by windows and you can walk around and look in every direction. It gives you a real sense of the geography of the area. When we were leaving we got into a very lively discussion",
          "Was happy we were able to go to the observation deck and look over the city. It was so clear and could see for miles. Excellent way to see everything and take it all in.",
          "It's an interactive visit, don't wait for a very long building, but it's location gives you the privilege to admire this wonderful city the old part as the new one, must visit",
          "Clear 360 views all round including the plains of Abraham, Levis and \u00eele de l\u2019Orl\u00e9ans with the mountain ranges on the horizon. Not very busy so great opportunities for pics.",
          "The building isn't very high but you will get a lovely panoramic view from the top still. You can overlook the city through the windows. As you walk trough, you can see pictures and read up on the history on the building etc too.",
          "We were fortunate to visit the Observatoire on a clear sunny morning just after a tour group had exited. Apart from the stunning views, a very useful feature is the presence of monitors with points of interest highlighted for easy identification. For each point of interest there",
          "This building is right behind the Parliament building in Quebec. It is on the 31st floor of the tallest sky scraper in the city. The top floor has enormous picture windows that look out into the city. They are open from 10-5 daily but I think the last time you can go up is at",
          "This is a nice set of views esp the Citadelle and the port and older areas. However. The theme here is HOW GREAT ARE WE---WE SPEAK FRENCH AND HATE EVERYONE WHO DOES NOT. The walls of the exhibit are devoted to promoting in a nationalist way the view of the Seperatist",
          "This is the highest point you can get in Qu\u00e9bec City. You will see the configuration of the city but the best view from Qu\u00e9bec is from the ground.",
          "It is a nice place to get a bird eye vue of the surrounding of Qu\u00e9bec city. The price is too high, reasonable price.",
          "The observatory offers a wide aerial view of the city but, unfortunately, it isn't that great to justify the admission fee. It is basically a place to take a couple selfies and leave. Qu\u00e9bec City has better things to offer on ground level.",
          "On the top of this building, they have created an observation deck on all 4 sides, with detailed interactive maps showing what you are seeing. We were there on a clear day and enjoyed the experience and learned a lot about the city.",
          "The highest floor of the highest tower building just next to the old town has been set as the Town Observatory. Recently refurbished, with new attractions, it is by far the best spot to get a good view of the old town and surroundings. With a fair weather, you will see to the",
          "My wife and I went up to the 31st floor of the Marie Guyart building to enjoy the observatory and views of the city. Although you do get lovely 360 degree views, it is all indoors. It would be nice if there was an outdoor section to take better photos. It closes at 5pm, so there",
          "It is nice to see all of the city and views along with information provided about Quebec. We could not leave when we wanted to due to protests on main level. This is a government building. Eventually we were allowed to leave.",
          "We arrived on a Friday morning at about 11 am and were the only people there. Given that, the staff had plenty of time and made a point of telling us whatever we wanted to know. We spent well over an hour and left with so much more knowledge of the city than we started with.",
          "My cousin and I went in the midst of the great snowstorm of 2016...when it had already snowed 6 inches in a few hours. Our visibility was low, but we could still see out. In some ways, it was a cooler view of the city than on a sunny day. The woman who checked us in at the",
          "Fantastic views with an interesting movie filmed by a drone ,yes it is a glassed in observatory which doesn't detract from the views and allows school children and tourists to walk around unescorted.There is statistics boards with very interesting past and present history",
          "This is a 360 view and a history lesson all in one packed in one hour. Buy a coffee on the first floor and bring with you to enjoy view. The view is spectacular with information about what you are seeing far away. There is very interesting information about the history of",
          "The Observatoire provides a very nice view of Old Quebec, but I wish it was outside like the Empire State Building or Top of The Rock in NYC. I did enjoy being able to actually see the star-shaped outline of the Citadelle after hearing about it on the Citadelle tour.",
          "34 floors up to the most amazing views of the city! AND great explanations on interactive screens - you point and click and the explanations are there. Plus there are a couple guides up top to answer questions - they give very full, and interesting answers. We were on the red",
          "If you can, make this your first stop in Quebec City. It gives a great panoramic view of the city. Lots of touch screens to tell you what you are seeing, with history included. Very helpful staff.",
          "Peak a clear day and you will enjoy it greatly! Best views of the city...not only the most notorious places, but finding the red-roofed house, the beautiful buildings seen from above and just the movement of the city. I like information about the town displayed in the wall and",
          "The views are good from the top floor of this otherwise-mediocre office building. There is also a film you can watch which is shot using a daredevil with a go-pro camera. A very small space and no chairs available. The views are nice and the glass was mostly clean so the photos",
          "Great views of Quebec from here. It was so quiet, only one other couple looking round, yet it wasn't an expensive visit. On 31sr floor, you are inside and only a short walk from the firtifications and near the restaurants of Grand Allee. You can appreciate the areas around",
          "We came here on a rainy day and had the entire observatory to ourselves. The guide was happy to give us detailed information and history. At first, visibility was extremely limited. That actually turned out to be a good thing, because we spent a lot of time reading the",
          "Great way to see 360 degree views of the city. Was a clear day $14per adult $11 for seniors. We were pleased to have gone up.",
          "Go on a clear day for best views obviously. Quick quiet elevator ride to 31st floor. Signage in both English and French. We could see the city, river and mountains",
          "The view to Quebec is really nice. It's a good point to get started with your visit and getting a bit oriented where to head to when you're back on the ground",
          "This was a real highlight of our visit to Quebec. The observatoire de la capitale offers amazing views of all corners of Quebec City and the surrounding areas. The hostess at the welcome centre was excellent and spoke english well, providing a good explanation of what we could",
          "The brochures and books all say 360 deg views, which is correct, but not all at once! Be prepared to walk from room to room around the building, The info boards are great, and your ticket is valid all day which is also good.",
          "You can see these views from many other points for zero cost just before you enter old city. Yes, it is a walk up a hill to see views for free. Charging $14 is really a ridiculous price to look out at view from a window.",
          "At first i wasn't sure if this was the Observatory and walked past it. Worst enough it had started snowing. I had 40mins to go around. To me, the entrance fee is not reasonable. The little touch screens and the comfy circle like couch eliminate noise and lets you focus on",
          "This was out first stop in Qu\u00e9bec. It was good to get oriented and to see the Citadel from above, but we were disappointed by the seemingly random exhibit. Kind of pricey for what you get.",
          "I don't believe that seeing Quebec from this high up is worth $14, as there is nothing else but a few windows to gaze from, but as a tourist, it was nice to see once.",
          "The observation level, on the 31st floor, provides excellent views over the city of Quebec and the St Lawrence River. Information is available to help identify key sites - buildings, parks, churches, the port and bridges. The staff are also happy to provide assistance and answer",
          "It is ok but definitely not worth the $14 per person. I also don't recommend it to be your first stop in Old Qu\u00e9bec City, as listed in some of the touristic maps.",
          "The observatory is located on the 31st floor and lets you see 360 degrees (four sides). There are all sorts of historical notes around this park (it is run by the park service-just this floor). The staff roams around and answers questions. I had many and they were incredibly",
          "A nice view of the city from the top of the building with some explanations of the different historical sites, the port and modern Quebec as well",
          "This was a great way to see the layout of the city and they have a great interactive system to learn the history of city sites. The cost is $14/adult but there is a lot of good information on the history and sites of Quebec.",
          "Kind of expensive but the best views in Quebec. Higher than the revolving restaurant and closer to the old City. Comprehensive views in all directions.",
          "We checked this out on our Hop-On Hop-Off bus tour and it was definitely worth doing. We had a great view over Old Quebec and we used the screens set up all around the viewing area that enabled us to know what we were looking at.",
          "went here on a drizzly morn and was surprised how interesting it was. just coming to end of a refurb and there is so much info given in eye catching manner. and of course the views are fantastic.See where you have been or have still to go.Quebec City centre is very walkable",
          "We visited the observatories expecting to kill a few minutes and were there 2 hours later! This is one of the best viewing towers we have visited. It gives a 360 degree view of the city in 4 rooms. In each room there are interactive screens that show the view with main points of",
          "This is one of the tallest buildings in Quebec City and probably the best place to see the city from above, including historic Old City and the Saint Lawrence River. Highly recommended for cityscape fanatics like me!",
          "Highly recommended you to visit this place. From the 31th floor of the building, you can see 4 direction of the city with the best view you can have. The way they organize for visit also good and quick. I like this place.",
          "Building looks like an 1960's office building but the top floor was open for public viewing. Great views, 360 around the Quebec peninsula. There were some historical interpretations and digitally interactive which I appreciated. I'd say it was worth it!",
          "Amazing view of the city. Worth the trip to see the view. Within walking distance of town. Tour on your own, take as much time as you like.",
          "Offers a pretty incredible view of the city from above. Has a museum feel; once you take the lift up you can move through the stages at your own pace. Whether you're looking for exciting pictures or to delve into Quebec's history, the observatory has it all. Definitely worth",
          "I haven't decided whether this was worth the money yet. The view from the top was stunning and would be what makes it worth the money. Not too much to do otherwise. Took maybe 5-10 minutes to do the 360 view.",
          "The observatory was a great way to get my bearings before I walked around the city. We'll worth doing",
          "My wife and I visited here and it was excellent. The weather wasn't great so whenever we return to Qu\u00e9bec City on a nice day, our first plan is to visit the Observatoire de la Capitale. Very nice view from the 31st floor complete with tablets describing the view and history.",
          "The Observatoire is a fantastic place to get 360 degree views of Quebec city. You buy your tickets on the ground floor ($8.50 for seniors) then catch a lift up to the 31st floor where you are greeted by the very friendly staff. As you walk around there is information on the",

          "Although this 31 story office building offers excellent views of Quebec, one has to concede that it is perched atop an abomination of architecture -- an ugly concrete generic office building of the 60's. Indeed, the entire exhibit appears never to have been updated from the",

          "Like the CN tower in Toronto and the Olympic stadium in Montreal this also gave us some lovely views of another Canadian city. The story told was also well presented with audio visual screens providing both directional information and history.",
          "This place was really quiet with lots of seating available to enjoy the view on each of the sides. Plenty of information available too. Maybe because it's a little tucked away with no signage on the streets. We assumed it would be round building on a parallel street & we later",

          "We visited this attraction on our last day in Quebec, which added to our enjoyment since it enabled us to see all of the places where we had walked the previous three days. The view is amazing and the $10 fee per person is reasonable. There are comfortable chairs and",

          "We didnt know about this attraction until we saw it on the lift going up to the Hotel Frontenac. It was with determination that we eventually found it and what a fabulous attraction. We spent an age here looking at the views and reading about the history of Quebec. Well worth a",

          "The admission price is affordable. If you plan to go more than twice during your stay in Quebec, the $20 (plus tax) year-round pass is worth your money. The staff are very quiet and well-mannered and they leave you on your own for as much time as you like to gaze to your",
          "It is a very nice observatory. We enjoyed it, and the nice views. The only reason that I ranked it 4/5 instead of 5/5 is because there wasn't any wow factor. It was a great visit. There wasn't anything extra that stood out, however.",
          "It is all enclosed, which given the winters here makes sense. They have interactive displays which are fine for some, but we just liked the views!",

Be sure to take your time, and listen to all the information stations. Sit in the comfy egg-shaped",

          "Unless you're a photographer, you probably won't appreciate this place so much. It's nice, it's cool (literally - it's well-conditioned even on a hottest day), and you can see the city lying beneath you. I can't say that it's not 360-degrees view, but probably it's not",
          "The views are good at the top, but I would not consider them anything more than average. There are other locations in the city that can offer comparable views. The one exception is the view of the Citadelle, where you can get a great picture of the star-shaped design.",
          "The best FIRST place to go in Quebec City to see the entire city with the history of what you are seeing from the highest spot. Clever 360 degree audiovisual presentation includes old photos with which to compare the present vista. A few audiophones don't work, but the",

          "This was not initially on our to-do list but very glad we went! We went on a clear day and thoroughly enjoyed the spectacular 360 degree view. Multimedia displays/activities were informative re: history of the area. Would definitely recommend! $10 per adult was appropriate.",

          "The observatory gives you a birds eye view of the city. You can clearly see the Citadel and the plaines of Abraham. If there is a guided tour going on while you are there, tag along. It's worth hearing about the interesting points of the city. If you are visiting Quebec city,",

          "You'll get a great view of QC and learn about the history by interacting with attractions that have a very '70's feel to them. If you just go with it, we had a great time and really did learn a great deal about the history of QC.",
          "I would strongly suggest visiting the observatory first, as it provides you with a view of all four areas of the city, from the 31st floor. There are many interactive exhibits as well, describing the history of Quebec.",
          "The view from the top is great - provides 360 perspective. It was a cloudy day in November but still worth seeing. Exhibits are creatively designed and tell the story of Quebec very well. The ticket allows you to visit the city throughout the day so you can get various views.",
          "The windows through which you are supposed to be able to see great views are not very clean. Also, the 3-D exhibits are a bit of a waste of time (we couldn't see any 3-D - just the two colours of the lenses in the glasses). I wouldn't bother with this one again.",
          "My wife and I took the Ecolobus to get to the observatory (the Ecolobus uses less than $5 of electricity a day to operate!) Since the entire 31st floor is dedicated for tourist viewing, you get gorgeous views to all four directions. Try to ensure you go on a good weather day",
          "It took us awhile to find it as it's not well signposted but there were great views across the city and I'm sure your entrance fee allowed you multiple entries over the same day if you chose.",
          "The view is fantastic, and touch screens identify many locations. There are also 3d glasses and the old slides projected on the wall. Each direction is introduced by an airline stewardess circa 1960. She is amusing.",

        "wiki": "The Cathedral-Basilica of Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec (\"Our Lady of Quebec City\"), located at 16, rue de Buade, Quebec City, Quebec, is the primatial church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec.  It is the oldest church in Canada and was the first church in Canada to be elevated to the rank of minor basilica, by Pope Pius IX in 1874. Four governors of New France and the bishops of Quebec are buried in the crypt, including Fran\u00e7ois de Laval, Quebec's first bishop.\nThe church is a National Historic Site of Canada, and located within the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Historic District of Old Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe cathedral is located on the site of a chapel, Notre Dame de la Recouvrance, constructed by Samuel de Champlain in 1633. Construction of the first cathedral building began in 1647, and it was given the name Notre-Dame de la Paix.\n\nThe cathedral has twice been destroyed by fire, the first time being during the Siege of Quebec in 1759. It was rebuilt from plans by Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de L\u00e9ry draughted in 1743.  The belltower, however, was designed by Jean Baillairg\u00e9, who also oversaw construction. The interior was designed by Jean Baillairg\u00e9 and his son Fran\u00e7ois from 1786\u20131822. In 1843, Fran\u00e7ois' son, Thomas, suggested a reconstruction of the fa\u00e7ade to resemble the church of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve in Paris, resulting in the finest Neo-classic fa\u00e7ade in Qu\u00e9bec. The cathedral was richly decorated with impressive works of art: baldaquin, canopy, episcopal throne dais, stained glass windows, paintings, and chancel lamp (a gift of Louis XIV). \nIn 1922 the church was again gutted by fire, this time by the Canadian faction of the Ku Klux Klan, and restored by architects Maxime Roisin and Raoul Chenevert. Raoul Chenevert added a presbytery beside the Cathedral in 1931-32In 2014 the cathedral celebrated its 350th anniversary. As part of the celebrations, a holy door was constructed\u2014the second outside Europe and only the eighth in the world. The holy door was opened on December 8, 2013 and remained open until December 28, 2014. It again opened from December 8, 2015 to November 20, 2016 for the Year of Mercy after which it was sealed until 2025.The cathedral was designated as a national historic site of Canada in 1989 because \"...of its long and close associations with the history of New France; its influence on subsequent ecclesiastical architecture and interior decoration in Qu\u00e9bec.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJean Lemire, the master carpenter who constructed the south steeple of an early iteration of the church, 1684\nList of cathedrals in Canada\nRoman Catholic Marian churches\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Basilique-cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website",

          "Wow! This is the oldest church in Canada and the first to be designated as a minor basilica in 1874. Some governors of New France (including Frontenac) and bishops of Quebec are buried in the crypt. No wonder why this church is a National Historic Site of Canada.",

          "Beautiful church with amazing woodwork, colours and stained glass, topped off by a beautiful Casavant pipe organ. In Canada, second only to Basilique Notre Dame in Old Montreal, which is absolutely breathtaking!",
          "Historic Old Cathedral... Sit & take it all in...Takes quite a while to fully appreciate what you are looking at.. Unfortunately, the outside of the building was under repair...So hard to fully appreciate the Cathedral from the outside..with the scaffolding all around..",
          "This basilica is very different from the Basilique Notre-Dame de Montr\u00e9al This basilica is all white in its interior and therefore appears more well lit than the Basilique Notre-Dame de Montreal. However, both are beautiful in their own right. You don't expect to see the",
          "This is our first time in Quebec. We believe the best way to get to see and know a city is by walking it so we signed up for the 3:30 Grand Walking Tour. It was perfect! Our guide was (Ghi) not sure how to spell it but he was wonderful. He provided a ton of information and was",

          "This is a must-see if you\u2019re in the old town of Quebec. The cathedral is right in the middle of the old town, so you won\u2019t miss it. I really enjoyed sitting here in the quiet for a couple of minutes escaping the buzz from outside. There are free tours in English and in French.",
          "This a Catholic Church that is still running and at the moment is undergoing renovation works outside. The stain glass panels are so exquisite and beautiful. You can meditate here also. Services run as usual. It is a solemn place clothed within a magnificent old structure.",
          "Very nice Cathedral. Front was being renovated which is good as it shows that building is being maintained. Lovely altar. Nice quiet space to take a break from the outside shops.",
          "The cathedral was under some external restoration work when we went. But it was super easy to access. We just discovered it on one of our old city walks, just around a corner. The staff greets you right at the door, so that they can ask you to remove any hats you may have on.",
          "We stepped inside for about 30 minutes to view the inside of this church. A very different type of structure above the altar that we had never seen. They provide a self guided tour you can do with a smart phone, scanning the QR bar code at each point in the cathedral.",
          "Stunning inside, wonderful atmosphere, very calm and serene despite building renovations\\restorations.",

          "I was so impressed by this Cathedral and the surrounding area. It is magnificent! There is so much to see in and around the area.",
          "Definitely see this during your stay. Unfortunately the exterior is under major renovations, so much is obscured by scaffolding and barricades, but the interior should be seen for its beauty, architecture, and artwork. We got to hear the bells pealing as a wedding was ending",
          "Don't let the outside renovations scare you away - the interior of the cathedral is incredible! Beautiful carvings, soaring ceilings covered in gold, historic art, multiple alters and details on every surface. Absolutely beautiful!",

          "Beautiful cathedral with very unusual image of Christ holding the cross, lots of gold leaf and the holy door to open again in 2025. Canadian dignitaries are buried here. The cathedral is quite important for Quebec and Canada and a heritage site. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "When visiting quebec take 30 mins out to visit notre dame ballistica. It's a beautiful building inside and out. The stain glass windows are stunning. The decor inside is equally beautiful. Well worth 30 mins of your time",

          "Upon entering, you will see a sign indicating an app you can download to fully appreciate the treasures in the church. I found it easy to use and very helpful. An impressive feature is that this church has one of 7 holy doors in the world.",
          "Austere on the outside but beautiful on the inside. The gilding is superb and the organ wonderful to look at. The ceiling with the light bouncing through was stunning. Pity thek music blaring in from outside spoilt the peacefulness",

          "We were quite surprised when we walked in. The beautiful wood carvings covering the ceiling are amazing. We did not see it but in July there is a light show each evening called Aura. There were long lines to get in the Cathedrale and to see the light show.",
          "they were under construction on the outside but the inside was breathtaking. They have church goers that come in to pray and show there respect along with general tourists. They have a gift shop but limited. They have a tour of the upstairs but more historical things so not",

          "What a beautiful and ornate Cathedrale! We toured this Cathedrale with one of the helpers. I was intrigued to see the Holy Door. This Cathedrale carries one of 7 Holy Doors in the World. From what I understand, a Holy Door allows one to be forgiven of all your sins up to that",
          "Church is currently under construction but still beautiful with stained glass windows. Take time to tour special exhibits.",
          "We walked by this church several times before we realized we could go inside. So glad we did! It is absolutely beautiful!",
          "We happen to be there during a Mass in Italian (not French) It is a beautiful church; we weren't to take pictures during Mass, which I didn't know until after I'd unobtrusively snapped a couple, but Mass made it hard to see everything, and I didn't have time to wait.",

          "The building outside does not evoke the intricate grand art decor inside. It has an impressive altar area. There is also a holy door on the leftside as you face the altar - look for the steel door with the glass cross in it. It is free entry when the doors are open. There are",

          "Don't worry about the outside construction. Walk inside and be amazed at the ceiling and the alter area. It is nonetheless, an impressive sight.",
          "It's beautiful inside - and it's wonderful to enjoy it with no admission fee. You can spend as little or as long as you want here. We did not see anyone doing a tour when we were there. The cathedral is currently under renovation so it is a bit difficult to find the door,",

          "We went on a Friday & only waited about 10min to get in. Spectacular workmanship literally everywhere your eye rests. I\u2019ve visited Notre Dame in Paris & it makes me so sad to think of what they\u2019ve lost after being reminded of the magnificent craftsmanship.",
          "Be sure and ask about the light show at the Cathedral. You can go online and purchase tickets in advance and see some pictures or short movie about it. Not exactly what you would expect but very much worth seeing. Great Lights!!",

          "Current remodel, but still a beautiful place. Spend time in the side chapels as well as the main cathedral.",
          "A stunning church with ornate elements that are typical of the Roman Catholic exultance to God. Very interesting to visit this and the Anglican Cathedral Holy Trinity next door and make the comparison. The difference between two denominations in their glorification to",

          "The interior of this church is beautiful and it is a wonderful place to visit for those interested in the development of the Catholic faith in North America, as well as those interested in architecture. The lovely sculpture over the altar is reminiscent of Italian Baroque",
          "We visit local churches as we visit new places. This was awe inspiring, as it is intended to be. Having been burned several times, the last time by the Canadian faction of the Ku Klux Klan in 1922, it's not an old building. It is however, very beautiful. In 2014, a holy door was",

          "It\u2019s amazing that most churches in Quebec City are open during daytime hours for tourists to come and go and this includes while service is in process. We experienced a part on the Sunday mass, it was beautiful as well is the church. If you have the opportunity pop in. The",

          "I don't know what it is about these old cathedrals, but they never cease to amaze. The details and architecture are incredible. A little disappointed with the noisy vendors at the back of the hall, as usually silence is expected, but if you go closer to the front you can't hear",
          "The church is one of the nicest church buildings I have been in. It is beautifully decorated and brightly light during a church service . There is so much to see . The gold decoration on the architecture in side is amazing. There is a bar code you can scan to get a guided tour",

          "Very opulent cathedral thanks to the generosity of the French missionaries. Although grand, it hardly means anything to someone who is not a catholic. Do remember to remain silent as this remains an active place of worship.",
          "A beautiful church with the old traditions. French service with a bit of Latin and incense. A must see.",
          "Impressive, beautiful basilica located right in the middle of Old Quebec. Visited more than once. Nice time to sit and meditate.",

          "Worth walking through. It is a lovely church with many gorgeous details. The organ is very ornate and we were lucky to have someone there playing during our visit.",
          "A beautiful church worth visiting; done in old style and with many beautiful artworks; no admission fee",

          "We popped in here more for a quiet moment of reflection rather than to do the tourist stuff. The inside of the cathedral is simply beautiful and takes your breath away. The peace and solace however is something else. Yes I know it is the end of the summer season and things are",
          "We were really pleasantly surprised upon entering the cathedral as we had not expected anything so lightfilled and ornate interior after having read about it in our guidebook. It is absolutely beautiful and as it is still very much in use, it also has an amazing atmosphere. It",

          "The venue is worth a look. We were not familiar with French-Canadian church architecture, and we learned a lot in our visit.",
          "What a beautiful church. The gold plated statues will attract your attention immediately and you will be hooked on checking out everything else. Enjoy it.",
          "This cathedral is such an important place for a lot of reasons. There\u2019s been a church on the cathedral\u2019s current site since 1647, although this building dates back to 1843. Inside it\u2019s a monument to the Neoclassical and even Baroque styles, and it\u2019s gilded canopy above the altar",
          "The basilica was constructed as a labor of love by many who believe that they or their family were healed, because of their experiences here. Some things like the carvings of animals on the ends of each pew - a different animal on each representing the animals of the area -",
          "Stop in and if you are into magnificent churches, you will not be disappointed. At some point, you'll pass it on a stroll through Vieux Quebec.",

          "My wife not keen on visiting cathedrals but she was overwhelmed with this one. the decoration was breathtaking, also there was another cathedral downstairs below which was the same size as the one above. We also visited the copper workshop that manufactured the embossed church",
          "It has been 50 years between my visits to Norte-Dame and it still holds the magic as a place of Canada historical significance. I still haven\u2019t seen it all and am overcome by the religious significance that it has has played in the development of Quebec and Canada.",
          "What an amazing church, beautiful to see inside. It is such a spiritual place, full of history and peace. It is a simple and precious place.",

          "This lovely cathedral is in the heart of old Quebec and just a 5 minute walk from the Chateau Frontenac. It's beautiful and magnificent and worth a walk through. Quiet place for prayer time, too.",
          "Beautiful church to visit. Stained glass windows, ceiling were something to see. Architecture and design was astounding. The chapel in the basement with the curved ceilings is a real work of art.",
          "First time we went here, it was closed. We arrive 4 in the afternoon. You need to check their timings or opening hours before coming. I have been wanting to see this church for a very long time and I was really hoping that a could have a chance to go through the HOLY DOOR, but",

          "Part of walking tour was this church. Post tour went inside and a Mass was going on. We had limited time but what I saw was beautiful. They do not build churches like theses anymore. The architectural plan inside and outside was great.",
          "Unfortunately if you have travelled this church is not going to be outstanding. Nice but nothing out of the ordinary",
          "Stop by for at least a look at the altar with the golden artwork above it. It is unusual and worth a photo.",
          "Beautiful church that is the best attraction in the city, in my opinion. Be sure to stop by at least for a few minutes.",
          "Worth a visit for the gorgeous interior and learn about the religious history of New France (Quebec).",
          "When you enter, the first sense is of peace, beauty, and opulence. You learn that the early settlers were mostly poor and hard working. Their one luxury was a church such as this one. Enjoy that same emotion when you visit.",
          "Beautiful paintings, stained glass, alcove areas, and artifacts. You wouldn't realize from looking at the outside (which is impressive) how much detail exists on the inside. We just walked around admiring all the works.",
          "if your in the old city you have to walk in to the church its a wonderfull place to stop in take a look just sit down and look up and you will be stunned at what you see the ceiling is very impressive.",
          "What a magnificent cathedral! Feel blessed to have attended Sunday Mass here! Organ sounded amazing!",
          "OMG, could not of been any nicer. The priest was wonderful even though we were Americans and spoke English. He did very good to translate. What a beautiful place and the wedding could not of been any better. I would say five star all the way.",
          "If you walk around Old Town Quebec you will probably see the Basilica. It's not very impressive on the outside but the inside is lovely with the stained glass windows, the altar and the statutes. We've seen a lot of churches on our travels and this one is not as ornate as some",
          "Enjoy going to churches. This one was ok. If you enjoy these things - you should go. If you want an outstanding one - there are better ones.",

          "Amazing how after 2 fires still is there, totally restored and beautiful. Great combination of different art periods.",
          "As you walk around Old Town you eventually come across Quebec Notre-Dame de Basilique. It is not quite as exquisite as the original Notre Dame in Paris France or even the one in Montreal, but it was beautiful and very relaxing. After all the walking our group needed a few",
          "This church is simply magnificent! Being tourist season it was quite busy but still quiet and peaceful enough to allow silent prayer. I particularly liked that the staff did not pressure us to purchase anything. Time did not allow us to go on a basement/beneath the church tour",
          "This is a beautiful old Cathedrale that looks like it s/b in France or Germany, lovely architecture and well maintained.",
          "It's interesting that Quebec supposedly has some of the lowest church going population in Canada, since the 'Quiet Revolution' of the 60's. There are so many grandiose churches in Quebec that are not being utilized by the general population its sad that they do get seen by many",
          "A beautiful basilica in Old Quebec. Allow some time to visit even if not for religious reasons. Try going doing a less crowded time to enjoy some quietude.",
          "Beautiful cathedral in the centre of Old Quebec City! Stunning architecture!! A must to see for visitors.",

          "Amazing church in the old city, very quaint and beautiful architecture. Just one of many things to see",
          "Not far from the Chateau Frontenac you can find this stunning cathedral, the outside is impressive but the interior deserves your attention, the stained glass images are superb, well worth a visit.",
          "We visited as part of guided tour. Church was stunning and a smaller version of Paris. Stained glass was magnifique.",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral, so much to see and admire. The sculptured windows in one of the crypts are very innovative and beautiful.",
          "We were lucky enough to attend mass here on Sunday (French); however, we were taken aback by the numerous tourists taking pictures as mass was underway? Staff did ask a large tour group to leave, but many others still came in to take pictures or stand gawking at front of the",
          "I was lucky to hear the play if pipe organ. Inside of the cathedral is beautiful as expected. It\u2019s located in middle of old Quebec. Must visit.",
          "Please that we did not have to pay in order to enter as in Montreal. I was intrigued with the history of the church and founding clergy.",
          "So I'll start by stating that my kids do not enjoy going to Church. This Church, they loved. The architecture, the interior....'Daddy it is so peaceful here'....a must see.",
          "Stop in, its free. Beautiful glasses, gold and statues. And its free but be respectful, It is still a church",
          "You don't have to spend a lot of time here, but as you stroll the city at some point you will end up here and it's a very nice place to visit for a few minutes. It's well maintained and very pretty inside.",

          "If you love churches, you must visit the Basilica of Notre Dame. It is absolutely beautiful. The alter is magnificent - and all the statues and artwork are beautiful. We were extra lucky because we got there during the afternoon Mass, so it was extra special.",
          "This Cathedral has an amazing working organ which was being played when we visited..some great music but some very cheesy tunes. Impressive though with a very fat bottom end and a big reverb!",
          "If you are a fan of old churches, this one is beautifully decorated. It is still in use. French influence is apparent.",
          "This basilica is very different from its Montreal counterpart, which tries to replicate the Parisian original. Once you are inside, this one feels baroque and reminded me of Russian palaces and churches - certainly with its ornate gilted decor. It felt much brighter and",
          "Be sure to check the hours. A beautiful and peaceful church in the old part of town near the funicular",
          "We stopped in here when touring the city. It is a beautiful church and worth the visit. It seemed so peaceful and a nice break from walking. We also took the opportunity to prayed while here",
          "I'm sure there are bigger and better and more ornate Cathedrals but you should take some time to wander in. To me, it was very impressive and beautiful.",
          "Lovely respite from the hustle and bustle of the streets of Upper Town Quebec. It's a calming, peaceful and beautiful sanctuary. Talk to one the many volunteers who can fill you in on the history of the place.",
          "Nice Basilica with many stained glass windows. There was no admission charge and it was very nice inside.",
          "If you like to visit old churches then this is a must on your list. Beautiful interior. It is near a square that features street entertainment.",
          "The inside structure is very different from European or Latin American churches. Everything is in excellent shape.",
          "On the outside it is relatively plain in appearance but if you venture in, after taking off your hat, the statuary and the stained glass are beautifully executed. The altar area is furnished with a golden glow which draws the eye immediately upon entry. Light a candle ($2 or $5)",
          "Cool to check out. Stunning alter. Lots of information about the church and it\u2019s history. Fee entrance.",
          "Nice building . walk and climb up it good excersice . great history . tip the guide , it is mandatory in old quebue . we learned it quite later in our trip .",
          "Unfortunately we couldn't do a full tour of the Cathedral as mass was being conducted at the time of our visit. We had a peek in and waited for a while. What I found incredulous were the number of people who came in during that time, showed no respect and proceeded to wander",
          "Words and Photos can not even come close to seeing this wonder in person. I noticed only one person in the prayer room. Try it for a sobering and humbling meditative experience.",
          "This is a must visit while you are in the Upper Town in old Quebec City. So much gold and gold paint! The basilica also has the only \"Holy Door\" in North America. The door is currently \"closed\" however you can have a look at it from outside and inside the church. This is a truly",
          "The Basilique was very beautiful and centered in the old city for easy access. Lots of different areas to see. Would recommend",
          "Loved the Cathedral, reminded us of the cathedrals of Paris. Beautiful stained glass, high arch ceilings and right in the center of all the old city attractions and shopping. Sat in the park across the street at night to watch the street performers.",
          "This church is absolutely stunning. Noisy, disrespectful people almost ruined my visit. Please remember that this is a church. If you come in, be respectful (remove your ball caps), and if you must talk, talk quietly. The ornate decoration and the details are just gorgeous. It",
          "What beauty! A place to go and feel comforted. This is my favorite place to visit in Quebec City. Highly recommend.",
          "A very pretty basilica, certainly worth seeing while in Quebec. But, not nearly as magnificent as basilicas you may have seen in Europe.",
          "We stopped here for Sunday mass. It is a gorgeous church - very ornate. As expected, the mass was in French but it was a great experience.",
          "This is a gorgeous church. The architecture is spectacular and intricate in design. We loved going through it. What faith and devotion the early people who lived there had. The art work is amazing and the church has so much historical significance. I can\u2019t imagine how much",
          "If you are a devout Catholic, this church is not to be missed! The church houses one of the Holy Doors. I was able to attend an evening prayer which was a beautiful experience as I was seated by the altar section.",
          "The exterior is beautiful. I was hoping the interior would also be beautiful but did not think it was so. The traditional side alcoves are all filled with confessionals. The arches and ceiling tiles are nice but not spectacular.",
          "Although it\u2019s not very ornate cathedrale, the decor inside is very nice. There are gorgeous organs and the sound of the bells is just beautiful.",
          "In the heart of Old Quebec City, this church offered a lot to see. It's beautiful, traditional and offers QR codes with some great info. I learned a lot from the well done video that is in English and French... And enjoyed meeting \"Saint Francis,\" a member of the parish who",

          "Notre-Dame Basilica in Quebec City doesn\u2019t match the one in Montreal however it is a beautiful church that features a wonderful altar and stained glass windows. Not overly large it draws the crowds in so go early or late for best photo opportunities.",
          "Beautiful church. Newly added QR codes at various points added a lot to the experience by explaining parts of the church.",
          "From the outside it looks relatively unimpressive, but wow, the inside is beautiful. A true place of peace and tranquility in an otherwise bustling city.",
          "Went here on a recent trip to Quebec City and happened to stop by during mass. You are still allowed in but felt I needed to be quiet and wasn\u2019t able to walk around as much as I would have liked. Would definitely go back next time I am in the area. Would love to visit again when",
          "It is the centre of catholic life in Qu\u00e9bec. But it is quite undecorated for a church of that importance. The altar and the organ are beautiful.",
          "The amazing detail and art work at this Cathedral is stunningly beautiful! It is a full functioning church that you are allowed to go into and view! Bring your camera! Must be quiet and remove your hat to enter.",
          "The Cathedral is beautiful in and of itself with spiraling arches and incredible stained glass depicting different scenes from the gospel and the history of Quebec. I loved going just for the architecture and the beauty inside of the cathedral but I also had a chance to go to",
          "The cathedral is a beautiful building located in the heart of the old town. It is richly decorated and the self guided tours can be helpful to get a good understanding of its history and role in Quebec\u2019s society.",
          "If you have never been to an European Cathedral, this is your chance to see one without leaving North America. Spectacular!!",
          "This beautiful church took my breath away when I walked in.. The altar was incredible! I was a little uncomfortable taking pictures in a church that is actually used for Mass, but I did, because other people need to see this church. There was a private section for people to",
          "The cathedral is a beautiful building and peace pervades when those visiting remember the are coming into a church...I loved the stained glass work and the Porte Sainte....",
          "The church had a service happening and the people were so nice.. the church is beautiful and it was a great place to visit",
          "I\u2019m Jewish but I can still appreciate what a gorgeous piece of architecture this church is. I\u2019ve been in many churches in my life having been a wedding videographer for 10 years and this church is fantastic. The amount of detail in all the statues, the gold trim, the stained",
          "We bought tickets knowing this might not be very good. It was actually AWFUL! Almost sacrilegious! If you are near the front of the line, you have perhaps 30 minutes to walk around to see the statues in the basilica being lit and unlit - repeatedly. Nothing special there.",
          "A trip to Quebec must include this. It is absolutely breathtaking inside. There was actually a funeral going on when we were there.",
          "We not only visited the church, but attended Sunday Mass. Although were were not French speaking, we were very much welcomed in English. It was nice to hear the Mass in a different language surrounded by all the history.",
          "A beautiful church worth visiting. It\u2019s open for free to the public. The gold in this church is just gorgeous!",
          "My family and I visited the Cathedral in July. We arrived just as a beautiful mass was ending. We appreciated the cool darkness inside. The relics, art and architecture are lovely. It is definitely worth the trip if you are visiting QC.",
          "I recently visited this cathedral and it was a very good experience. This is the resting place of Francois de Laval, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Quebec and, therefore, North America. The cathedral is free to enter and a very beautiful space. It is not, however, of the",

          "There are so many beautiful churches in Quebec provence and this obe is another must see. Not as large a Notre-Dame in Montreal but equally stunning. Light a candle for a loved one while there.",
          "What an amazing building! We visited to look around and then attended the Saturday evening Mass. Although the service was in French, the priest did greet and bless visitors in English. The organ and soprano soloist combined with the acoustics of the old building were truly",
          "Prepare to be dazzled. How a building can still be imbued with a sense of reverence when there are, literally, hundreds of humans spilling over each other to get the perfect picture, bears testimony to the power of this place. The stations of the cross; the paintings; the",
          "This is a beautiful church worth viewing. It is centrally located near the visitor center. I believe the monastery adjoining the church is now a school.",

          "Awesome experience for any one of any religion. We attended Sunday mass just to see the interior and listen to the tenor sing.",
          "This is one of the most beautiful Cathedral's we've ever seen. We attended a mass here. The interior is stunning, the ceiling is heavenly. This church truly inspires awe into a person. A very memorable visit.",
          "Our family stopped by Sunday morning and were wowed by the architecture and history... recommend a quick tour and paying respect to the church.",
          "While I wouldn't consider this outstanding after visiting other churches in Europe, it was nice to stop in.",
          "Very pretty. In a lovely side street with cobblestone. Spent 20-30 minutes looking at incredible art. Only a 3-4 walk from the famous Frontenac. Can see church and many more historic sites in 2 full days. Can park on side street or at underground parking at city hall .",
          "This is a beautiful cathedral. It is awe inspiring. We sat for a while and then asked about the crypt tour. There were not tours this day, so we came back the next day. They give tours in French and English from 10 - 3. This was a highlight for us. We learned about the",

          "Just gorgeous cathedral worth a look and a lot of photos! More like Europe than North America with a grand sense of spirituality and love of beauty.",
          "This is a beautiful basilica. The interior is pretty fancy and it has a lot of gold. There was a strong smell of incense in here. There is fairly interesting history behind this large church and it is cool to read about.",
          "On the outside it doesn't look so worthwhile, but don't go with that first impression. The inside invites for contemplation and feels peaceful",
          "This Basilica is free to enter and, although relatively new (1925 rebuilt after fire) is glorious for the size of the sanctuary and the fine gold leaf work above the baptistery. Very impressive.",
          "Stopped in to see the building. Was nice to take in the view from a pew in the back. Alter is beautiful looking.",
          "The Basilique Cathedrale is quite nice for a quick stop-by, but compared to other cathedrales it is not that special.",
          "Very pretty bascilica , although not as pretty as Montreals. Right in the center of Old Quebec. Easy to find and accessible. Was able to hear part of a mass on French. Small and pews are divided into 2 or 3 seats.",
          "I have to admit, it was a bit disappointing. However, we did walk in during a Mass on the Sunday and the organ was incredible.",
          "Lovel Cathedral in Quebec. The ceiling paintings are lovely and it was great to stop for mass and see it in full beauty.",
          "The photos speak for themselves...this is a slice of Europe that has been magically transported to Canada!",
          "The cathedral is a jewel of the city and not to be missed. I attended Mass there and if was a great experience. Everyone was kind and welcoming. The cathedral doesn\u2019t have visitors hours, and is only open during Mass times. It closes down within 15 minutes of the Mass ending",
          "Not as flashy as Notre Dame in Montreal but the decor inside is really nice. There's no charge to go in just a donation box. The roof and the alter are definitely worth a look.",
          "So this church was largely destroyed by fire in the 19th century. It is big and grand but if you have seen other Cathedrales around the world this one kis nothing special.",
          "Notre Dame is free to visit and a lovely cathedral to see. Not much else to say about it really!!!!!",

          "The church does not have a well defined architectonical style and it is quite simple outside. However it is beautiful inside beside its importance for the catholicism in Qu\u00e9bec.",
          "I had actually walked past the cathedral a couple of times not realizing it was there primarily because it was covered in scaffolding and hoarding for works being done to the outside. It was on a tour that we were directed to it and what a sight to behold when you first enter -",

          "The restoration project for this cathedral is complete. The result is nothing short pf magnificent. Take a few moments to stop in and view this masterpiece. I feel this rivals many of the basilicas I have seen in Europe. The stained glass windows are stunning. Take a moment to",
          "I walked past this cathedral many times while staying in Quebec City. After seeing a number of beautiful churches in Canada, I suppose I'd become rather jaded and thought no need to visit another one. But, I'm so glad I made an effort (it was closed the first time I visited).",

          "Basilique Cathedrale is a beautiful church, although with all the gold, it was a little gaudy for my taste. The most impressive part of our visit was learning about the history of the local parish and dioceses and their importance in the history of the Catholic Church in North",

          "Really beautiful church and worth visiting it. It is next to all touristic spots, nice to take a pause and give thanks",
          "The gold piece above the altar is the star attraction here. We were unable to see the Holy Door (from inside) because of cleaning. Do take the time to watch the video in the side room about Francois Laval.",
          "We attended Mass on Dec.31st and were so blessed to have 12 priests to celebrate the Mass. The basilica was beautifully decorated for the Christmas season. Notre Dame is definitely a representation of the beautiful cathedrals one could visit in Europe.",

          "I have visited many centuries-old churches and basilicas in Europe, many of which are amazing in terms of their architecture, detail, age, as well as the awe they evoke from the beholder. I must say that although the Notre Dame Basilica in Quebec City does not come close in",

          "We visited Quebec City and the Notre Dame Basilique while on a cruise ship. There was a tour guide with a group nearby but it was Sunday so they were not allow to enter because the group was too large. Keep that into consideration if you are there on a Sunday. My husband & I",

          "I love cathedrals. Real ones. This one is a little boring, from my point of view. Nothing really special about it. But, it is a nice place to rest while on your Old Quebec visit. You'll appreciate the silence, mainly on week days in the winter time. Otherwise, do something else.",
          "My husband and I attended Sunday services. It was said in French but it was charming! Absolutely a beautiful church and right in the old district.",
          "Very much a French Roman Catholic Cathedral. Little information in English. Some very fine stained glass, but set within very glitzy surroundings. Clearly a very busy place of worship.",
          "This Basilique is so beautiful, it is very historic, we even had a free tour. It is located in Old Quebec. Recommended!!",
          "One of the more gorgeous churches in upper Old Quebec. Not a far walk from the Fontenec. Once you go inside, the alter propels you forward till you get to the forward section of the church. The decor, the stained glass windows, everything.....so much to look at. There were",
          "Big, bright and nice and warm on an exceptionally chilly spring day. Some amazing pictures adown the walls - 18th century nuns teaching the local natice American Indians - wonderfully captured",
          "While the interior of this church is worth looking at, it is not as stunning as the altar in the Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal. But its golden altar does catch your attention and it also has some lovely stained glass windows.",
          "Certainly the Basilica is worth going in just to admire the beautiful decor, stained glass, carvings, and altar. Beyond that, it was a wonderful respite from the hubbub of the city just outside its walls. As grand as it is, it still conveys a reverential feel and invites you",
          "After seeing magnificent cathedrals in Europe, I have to say that this cathedral cannot be compared to those ancient masterpieces. Nevertheless, it is a grand cathedral. One of our friends is Catholic and she really appreciated the beauty of Notre Dame. Even if you are not",
          "His Cathedral was steps from our hotel, right in the Old City. Walking inside, you are immediately transported to a place of tranquility and peace. Beautiful stained-glass windows, statuary and a gorgeous pulpit greet you as you take in the breadth of this structure. Many local",
          "We were wandering about just looking at things when we ran into the Basilique. We entered and found an amazing experience, very European. We are American and I grew up Catholic. There were oil paintings everywhere as well as exquisite stained glass windows. The pews were",
          "This grand basilica is gloriously beautiful. The architecture, the paintings, the windows, the ceiling decor, etc. A photographer's delight.",

          "Absolutely stunning. We walked in and showed ourselves around, keeping quiet and making sure not to use flash on the camera. They are usually closed on Monday.",
          "Lovely decorations and golden centre piece. There is also a short video guide room to how the church developed in English and French, a great touch to its history.",

          "The church opens early so it is wise to visit before the crowds descend particularly on days when cruise ships are in port. Thr interior is beautiful with lots of gold decoration. There is also a room to the right of the altar which gives interesting information on St Francois",
          "We attended the Saturday evening services. We found out that this parish - church is the oldest established church in North America other than those out of Mexico. The inside is beautifully articulated in gold. Although not huge it was a beautiful service when the singing filled",

          "Another beautiful cathedral. For some reason we walked by it twice as the exterior is less ornate than some we've visited. Very well maintained and worth a visit when in Quebec.",

          "This Basilica is just magnificent inside and is certainly worth a visit if you are in Quebec City walking around looking at the sites. Altar & part of the ceiling is in gold leaf up one end of the Basilica, it is awesome just looking at the design just mesmerizing you to see",
          "A must see. The church is just beautiful. At the time I was visiting they were preparing for a funeral for a young woman police officer who had died of cancer. Although they were letting tourist in I only stayed a very short time. I wanted to give the family of that officer",
          "Having lived in Europe a dozen years, my interest in seeing churches isn't high, but we nipped in here out of some obligation to see what it was about. It was positively impressive, to be sure, if one is into the splendor et. al. of Catholicism. I expect those for whom",
          "This is open to all people. It is even more stunning on the inside. Definitely worth seeing. Make sure to check the closing times. We just missed and had to come back the next day.",
          "A truly beautiful, light-filled cathedral. Simpler than many we saw in Europe, but that adds to its charm. We enjoyed hearing an organ practice while we were there. Free entry to the cathedral but with a box for donations.",

          "An absolute must-see. The interior is gorgeous and you'll be taking lots of pictures. I went in on a Sunday of all days and was surprised to learn they allowed tourists in. It wasn't during mass, of course, but still I thought I'd probably be turned away.",
          "The Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec is a very cathedral and a fantastic spiritual site in the upper old town of Qu\u00e9bec. The cathedral has many magnificent altars and - of course - the tomb of Saint Francois de Laval, the apostel of North America. Entrance to the Notre Dame is free.",

          "Very impressive basilica, not the massive church you would find in Europe but worth doing none the less. Located near the Frontenac is easy to find and explore",

          "This church is very beautiful. It is oldest Catholic Church north of Mexico. We attended Sunday mass at 9am in French. They also have English masses. The Cardinal performed mass and chatted with every person in line at the end -- he was very nice! I definitely recommend going.",

          "Beautiful Cathedral right in the heart of the old city. The French influence really showed in the architecture. Make sure you go to the right side of the alter, you will find a room with a movie about the founders and very unusual statues. Three of them, The priest, and 2 nuns"

          "Went to mass here and was in awe of how beautiful the inside was. The mass is in French but easy enough to follow.",
          "It's hard to rate this, I mean - it's a church! The cathedral is stunning in its opulence... but that is also the problem.  When entering, we were 'greeted' by some volunteers who made it very clear without saying a word that a donation was \u2026",
          "Interior as nice as many in Europe. Been in many of the notable cathedrals in Europe and this one holds its own for opulent gold leaf adornment of the altar and ceiling fixtures. Though not as large as some, the ornateness it is truly \u2026",
          "Wow, there so much information on the walls and ceiling! Lovely church!",
          "Beautiful place and buildings, Europe style. There is a quiet a renovation ongoing so we did not get the chance to see almost all what we had planned. There are lots of shops, and opportunity to take pictures of this picturesque holiday site in Quebec City. We plan to visit again.",
          "Oldest church in the \"new world\", from 1647",
          "Always the very best and most beautiful Catholic place in Quebec City. Magnificent and very welcoming church! Xmas mass was beautiful with songs by the children's corus.",
          "Very nicely decorated cathedral. You can find your peace and quiet in a prayer or enjoy the art.",
          "Well the art that went into the construction of the structure is awe inspiring. Its really something to look at.\nIt may be closed now and then due to special occasions or morning service but there is plenty nearby to do.\n\nThe tour talks \u2026",
          "This basilica is simply beautiful. The details are worth a slow walk inside. It has an area in the back where it tells the story about St Fran\u00e7ois de Laval, the first bishop of Quebec and a very influential man. Well worth the visit if you \u2026",
          "I must confess (no pun intended) that I had forgotten I had even visited the cathedral until I was looking back through photos afterwards. And the I remembered - this was the first church or cathedral that I can recall ever visiting that is \u2026",
          "Just a beautiful church with some great history. Dont consider myself a very religious person, but this was a great stop.",
          "Very grand, superb architecture both on the inside and the outside. The light show is supposed to be great, but we missed it.\nThere\u2019s a small entry fee (think it was $8) to get in. \nIt\u2019s in s great part of the city, so very easily accessible.",
          "A stunning church with ornate elements that are typical of the Roman Catholic exultance to God. Very interesting to visit this and the Anglican Cathedral Holy Trinity next door and make the comparison. The difference between two \u2026",

          "A beautiful catholic cathedral.  Currently undergoing exterior renovation.  When the bells rang at noon it was a beautiful moment.  Must see.",
          "Awesome place.. such a beautiful architecture a must visit if you are visiting Quebec city",
          "Big church full of churchy things inside. The seats are a bit hard for my liking and the kneeling pads were stiff. My knees hurt. The candles were a tad pricy as well, $5?? Wow, I\u2019ll just go to dollar store and get 5 for that price. Over all, three stars for originality.",
          "We went on a Friday & only waited about 10min to get in. Spectacular workmanship literally everywhere your eye rests. I\u2019ve visited Notre Dame in Paris & it makes me so sad to think of what they\u2019ve lost after being reminded of the \u2026",
          "Loved the serene and beautiful space.  There is an educational opportunity by watching the film.  It is being renovated but only on the outside right now, apparently.",
          "This is a beautiful place to visit. It isn\u2019t free and you can\u2019t visit all of the time (they have certain hours), but once you buy admission you are free to tour or to listen to a guided tour. It was interesting to learn about the Basilica and how it got it\u2019s name.",
          "I married my wife in this cathedral.  It's the finest in Ottawa",
          "Beautiful beautiful Basilica. Come and spot all the nice paintings on the wall. They're a little dirty from all the smoke but you can still look at them and wonder about when they were freshly painted. Architecture is also very nice, looks like it was inspired by the Greeks.",
          "Love this place..not crowded and commercialized like Montreal. Recommended to go thr if you want your own time and peace to pray. Architects inside very attractive.",
          "Such a beautiful church! It was free when I went although it might have just been because it was a week day afternoon, I'm not sure. Definitely worth stopping by if you're in the area!",
          "Lovely church. Wish the Holy Door was more noted to visitors since it has significance in the Catholic faith and tradition.",
          "Beautiful architecture! Rich-looking with all the gold painted sculptures. The mass is majestic and spiritual as well. Loved the experience!",
          "Beautifully ornate church in the heart of old Quebec. Free to enter and worth the few minutes it takes to tour.",
          "Splendid Basilique. I also enjoyed the guide to the Crypt and the visit to the small museum upstairs. The church is free entry. The Crypt and Museum cost 5$ each. The guided tours are in English and French every hour",

          "In the heart of Old Quebec City, this beautiful church is a good spot to stop and admire design. It's always a little busy, since it's often open to visitors (entrance is free), but it's worth at least a short stop.",
          "Beautiful church, went here for mass New Year's Eve.",
          "Serene, beautiful. Had a nice nativity scene for Christmas",
          "Very cool spot! We went for the light show and it was very well done. Be sure to buy your tickets ahead of time! You are in a church and you expect it to link back to that fact but it remains quite neutral and is a show about the seasons. The architecture is defiantly something to look at and admire.",
          "The WOW factor is only obvious if you step inside the building. Its exterior is almost understated. Once inside your eyes behild decades old artwork and spectacular architecture.\nOne cannot help feeling its inspiring spirit.\nWhat a wondrous find.",
          "Glad I made it this oldest basilica on Canada. I hope it will be preserved for the future generations. Architecture at its best.",
          "Totally awesome to view!  Doesn't matter what your religious leanings are.  This is a definite site to see if you are visiting Quebec City!",
          "This cathedral is steeped with history. It is a wonderful example of mid-19th century architecture. From a religious point of view, this house of God is a spiritually uplifting church to attend. My wife and I went to Saturday's Mass. It was a great experience as a Catholic to be here with so many travellers.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral, on going restoration, and always feel welcome walking in the door. Definitely a site to see in Quebec City if you're visiting",
          "This place is gorgeous wish I had more time to spend their",
          "It's a pretty church, yes. Not what I was expecting though. While doing research for Montreal/Quebec area I came across \"Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal\". Turns out these two aren't the same things. It's not a place in would look for or \u2026",
          "Nothing to really do or see other than donate your money. Shops nearby are just tourist traps. You're better off going deeper into old Quebec.",
          "Amazing building at downtown old quebec. The big front doors to the golden statues are absolutely breathtaking.",

          "Absolutely gorgeous and heart stopping. You've never seen true architectural genius until you've experienced the raw beauty and history located in the heart of Vieux Quebec",
          "Just... nice. The architectural and sculptorical details are not to my particular taste. I just like Montreal's  much more.",
          "What a stunning basilica! Absolutely speechless!",
          "What a majestic and spiritual place. Simply wonderful and a beautiful mass to attend.",
          "Great place, do not take kids if you know they will be running or screaming, quite place to meditate, and learn about some history, very well designed,",
          "It is stunning inside. Worth a visit",
          "What an spectacular piece of architecture! So many impressive baroque features and art pieces to take in.

          "Unfortunately there were a lot of renovations going on when I got a chance to visit, so I didn't have a chance to really see the grandeur that this building is known for. I definitely want to come back when there isn't a lot of construction going on in and around the Basilica.",
          "Not as grand as the one in montreal. However this has its own beauty. We were welcomed to a beautiful live choir performance and spent 30 minutes there. They are open from 830am to 4pm.....Arena they close on the dot....don't be late",
          "The basilica is a superb. A must see while visiting the basse-ville. It's an opportunity to step back in time. I was a little disappointed as I didn't find what I was looking for. My ancestor, Jean C\u00f4t\u00e9, is supposedly buried under the \u2026",
          "Its a beautiful church. Especially the inside.",

        "wiki": "The Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec (English: National Museum of Fine Arts of Quebec), often abbreviated as MNBAQ, is an art museum in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The museum is situated in Battlefield Park, and is a complex made up of four buildings. Three of the buildings in the complex were purpose-built for the museum, while the other was initially built as a provincial prison, before being re-purposed for museum use.\nThe institution was opened as the Mus\u00e9e de la province de Qu\u00e9bec in 1933. The museum initially served as the provincial archives, art, and natural science museum until 1962, when the natural science collection was removed. In the following year, the museum was renamed the Mus\u00e9e du Quebec. The provincial archives were moved from the museum in 1979, leaving it solely as an art museum. In 2002, the museum was renamed the Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec.\nIts collection includes over 40,000 works spanning from the 16th century, to the present day. Its collection primarily includes works that were produced in Quebec, or by Quebec artist, although it does also includes works from other parts of Canada, and the rest of the world. The museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, the Canadian Heritage Information Network, and the Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPrior to the formal establishment of the museum, several items for the museum's art, and natural history collections were acquired for the museum prior to the institution's creation. The Premier of Quebec Lomer Gouin first presented the idea of starting a provincial collection of art as a part of a program to \"define the Quebec nation,\" although most of the actual program was organized under his successor, Louis-Alexandre Taschereau. The program formally began in March 1920, when the cabinet minister, Athanase David, announced an initiative that saw the province support artists by buying their works. Works initially acquired for this collection were selected by a five-man jury, who sought to affirm \"innovative art trends,\" found among artists in Quebec, as well as works that push the conception of a common rural past.In 1922, the legislature of Quebec passed the Loi des mus\u00e9es de la province du Qu\u00e9bec (English: Act Respecting Museums in the Province of Quebec), providing funding for the construction of museums throughout the province. However construction for the G\u00e9rard-Morisset Pavilion did not begin until 1928; with the museum finally opened to the public in June 1933. Initially the museum operated as an art museum, a natural science museum, and as the provincial archives.The natural history collection was removed from the museum in 1962, and the institution was renamed Mus\u00e9e du Qu\u00e9bec the following year. The provincial archives was moved from the museum to the Universit\u00e9 Laval in 1979, leaving the institution with only its art collection. The institution was formally made into a provincial Crown corporation in 1983.From 1989 to 1991, the museum renovated and incorporating a former prison, Charles Baillairg\u00e9 Pavilion, into its building complex. The acquisition and renovation of the former prison building had more than doubled the surface space the museum had. The renovation of the former prison expanded the museum's viewing space to 12 galleries, as well as provided space for an auditorium, a giftshop, restaurant, storerooms, and a workshops. The museum's sculpture garden was completed shortly after the Charles Baillairgin\u00e9 Pavilion opened in 1993.In 2002, the museum was renamed the Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec. In 2013, the museum began work on a new pavilion, the Pierre Lassonde Pavilion, and was opened in 2016.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe property is situated in Battlefield Park, with the museum complex made up of four buildings, the G\u00e9rard-Morisset Pavilion, the Charles Baillairg\u00e9 Pavilion, the Pierre Lassonde Pavilion, and the Central Pavilion/Grand Hall. The pavilions are connected to one another through a tunnel network.\n\n\n=== G\u00e9rard-Morisset Pavilion ===\nThe G\u00e9rard-Morisset Pavilion was the first building built for the museum. Work on the building began in May 1928, and was completed in early 1931. The building was designed in a Beaux-Arts style by Wilfrid Lacroix; while the reliefs on the facade were sculpted by Joseph-\u00c9mile Brunet. The building was opened to the public in June 1933. The building features white marble, wide Victorian style steps, carved ceilings. In 2018, the museum completed renovations of the G\u00e9rard-Morisset Pavilion, which saw the brightening of its viewing spaces, as well as harmonizing the structure with the rest of the museum complex.\n\n\n=== Charles Baillairg\u00e9 Pavilion ===\n\nThe Charles Baillairg\u00e9 Pavilion is the second building that the museum occupied, although its age predates the other buildings in the museum complex. The pavilion was designed by Charles Baillairg\u00e9 in 1867, and was initially used as a prison. The design was modelled after the Auburn Correctional Facility, in Auburn, New York. The building was used to house inmates until 1970.Shortly after acquiring the property, the museum underwent a two-year renovation beginning in 1989. The renovations led to the creation of four exhibition galleries within the pavilion, as well as a section of preserved jail cells to highlight the building's former use as a prison. Designs for the renovation were by Charles Dorval and Louis Fortin. Along with the building, Dorval and Fortin also designed the underground access that connected G\u00e9rard Morisset pavilion with the Charles Baillairg\u00e9 pavilion. In an effort to maintain the Battlefield Park, the design concealed a section of the new wing under the park's natural landscaping. The museum opened the pavilion to the public in May 1991.\n\n\n=== Central Pavilion ===\nThe glass-facade pyramid, known as the Central Pavilion or Grand Hall was built during the 1989\u20131991 renovations of the museum complex, and was also designed by Dorval and Fortin. The Central Pavilion lies in between the G\u00e9rard-Morisset Pavilion with the Charles Baillairg\u00e9 Pavilion, and serves as the museum's visitor centre.\n\n\n=== Pierre Lassonde Pavilion ===\n\nConstruction of the Pierre Lassonde Pavilion began in 2013, and was opened in June 2016. The pavilion provides a glass-enclosed access from Grande All\u00e9e to the rest of the museum complex, situated further within Battlefield Park. The 14,900 square metres (160,000 sq ft) pavilion was designed by the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, led by Jason Long, and Shohei Shigematsu, the lead partners for the design project.During the construction of the building, renovations were also undertaken to the museum's tunnel system, transforming them into viewing spaces. The building is adjacent to Saint-Dominique Church, and has a tunnel that provides indoor connection to the other pavilions of the museum complex. The pavilion largely uses glass and steel for its building material, in an effort to foster transparency between the museum, and the general public.The total cost for the construction of the pavilion was approximately C$103.4 million. The pavilion features 2,741 square metres (29,500 sq ft) of gallery space; and also includes a cafe in its main lobby, a courtyard adjacent to the lobby, a white spiral staircase, and a gold-coloured elevator. The building was named after Pierre Lassonde, a benefactor of the museum. The colouring of the gold elevator was chosen to reflect Lassonde's work with gold.\n\n\n== Permanent collection ==\nAs of March 2019, the museum's permanent collection includes 40,000 works from 4,524 different artists from Quebec, the rest of Canada, and around the world from the 16th century to present day. The legislative act that governs the institutions notes that the museum's purpose is to promote, and preserve art from Quebec, from all periods in history, as well as presence for international art. The museum's permanent collection was either acquired through donations, purchase, or ordered directly from the artist/collector/merchant. The first works acquired for the collection was from the Art Association of Montreal's 37th Spring Exhibition in 1920, although only six works acquired during that time remains in the museum's permanent collection.Each pavilion in the museum complex houses a different department of the museum's collection. G\u00e9rard-Morisset Pavilion houses the museum's historical art collection; the Charles Baillairg\u00e9 Pavilion houses works of modern art, while the Pierre Lassonde Pavilion houses works of contemporary art.\n\n\n=== Selected works ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Library and archives ==\nThe museum also operates a library and archives that specializes in Quebec art. The library over 13,000 biographical files, in addition to catalogs, monographs, and audiovisual documents relating to art in Canada, and around the world.

          "We were in Quebec for a few days and had a full schedule of activities and restaurants. Visited this site specifically to see the \"Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera and Mexican Modernism\" and what a treat. This was a wonderful and comprehensive exhibit providing wonderful art and an",
          "I appreciated the variety of art on display. There were some installations that we loved (Modern and Historic). There were others like some of the Contemporary exhibits that were baffling and downright ugly; but even then I was grateful for their display because it reminded me",
          "Would probably be a 4 or 4.5 if we had only been adults visiting. They have started trying to promote it to families, which is a great idea, but not quite ready to be implemented. Pros: 3 buildings divided in historical, modern and visiting exhibits, (old jail, old church and",
          "My partner and I have completely different interests in art, I\u2019m hugely interested in contemporary art that pushes boundaries, as well as 60\u2019s & 70\u2019s pop art and the like. She however is into ancient Egypt and paintings of fields or big religious meals that I just don\u2019t",
          "It felt like I had to walk for miles. The only art I found was modern art which is not my taste. The pamphlet only pointed that out and some Inuit art I never found. Their audio guide only comes in French. It really felt like visitors of other languages were not welcome. I didnt",
          "Well, here's an art gallery that gets varied reviews! I so much wanted to like it and regret agreeing with the negative visitors. It is certainly interesting to see a collection of work by Quebec artists over a period of some 300 years but most of the exhibits are not very",
          "I loved museums but this one left me underwhelmed. I do not like its layout at all. Sprawled is the word that comes to mind when thinking about it. Its size doesn't seem to be compatible with its collections. It does have some interesting pieces but not enough to command that",
          "I highly recommend this gallery, it also connects with the Modern Art gallery nearby underground. This is where there is a nice, if difficult to find cafe as opposed to the two fine cuisine restaurants on the ground floor of each building.",
          "This museum basically went through only the history of Quebec City which had already been done for me by the Road Scholar guides. I found this museum to be very boring without much substance. I would not recommend going to this if one has already heard the history of the city",
          "if not for the art, go for the location and building. 3 building attached by underground tunnel. one building is an old jail.the artworks are well displayed. it is very specious. the Inuit exhibit is worth the visit. their is parking $17.00 for all day. a coffeshop cafeteria.",
          "What a beautiful museum! Spectacular if you like modern art, but, the Inuit exhibit is not to be missed! You get lost in the messages that the artists portray..definitely worth a visit!",
          "We rode a local bus from the Old Town to this museum. It consists of three buildings, each featuring various forms of local and Canadian artists. Some excellent modern art and sculpture.",
          "Contemporary art isn't for everyone, as can be seen in some of the less favorable reviews. Perhaps this museum should change its name from fine arts (beaux-arts) to modern art (art moderne), so people are forewarned that much of what they will find is modern art, which can be",
          "This is really a complex of three gorgeous buildings (connected by wide tunnels) holding many fine pieces. Spacious. You just might take more pictures of the buildings than of the artworks. If you need a break, there is a mini-mall one block away with several",
          "This is an excellent art museum which is comprised of several different buildings. They are all connected so there is not need to go outside. Each building focuses on a different form of art - contemporary, Inuit, modern art, etc. There is a lot to see and it is all very",
          "I write largely to violently disagree with the reviewer madly disparaging this museum. I found the place a light-filled architectural gem, and a visit to its Inuit sculpture exhibit unforgettable. I suspect 99 of 100 visitors would find this wonderful place (with a modest walk",
          "Wife and I walked to museum from the Old Town section. Worthwhile exhibits in three buildings. Had many Quebec artists and an array of first nation artists exhibited.",
          "Stopped here to see the Inuit art collection. Well worth the time if you would like to see and learn about northern Canadian culture and crafts. Museum itself is modern and beautiful.",
          "Several pavilions of art all connected underground. Familiar art presented in thrilling, fresh ways; newer art given respect and context. The spaces - for Inuit Art, for Contemporary Art and for temporary exhibitions in particular - are so well cared for, considered, valued. A",
          "Good place to shelter from a blustery day and enjoy some culture at the same time. The third floor of Inuit art blew us away. Dazzled us and enthralled me . I have never had so many pieces speak loudly to me. Spent hours.",
          "I\u2019d never heard of or seen any Canadian modern artists before, so this was a revelation. In particular I loved the Alfred Pellan exhibition. The buildings are interesting too.",
          "Our group of four was disappointed with this place. Just not worth the money. For an institution devoted to fine arts, the facilities are the most bland and uninspiring we\u2019d ever seen. Long white hallways, ceilings, and floors with little to break up the monotony. Few signs to",
          "Very expansive - more than one building, but connected by passageways. Nice mix of contemporary and historical works. The Miro exhibit was very impressive. One portion of the structure was an old prison, with a few of the cells accessable (but with nice plush seating inside).",
          "This museum is a real jewel, the architecture is fantastic and the exhibitions, both permanent and occasional are amazing.",
          "There are many different rooms to visit. I have really appreciated the Riopelle room in the museum, his abstract painting amazing.",
          "My grandson and I visited during our stay in Quebec. The docent who greeted us was terrific. In a few moments she gave us the history of the museum and gave us specific directions for points of interest to us. We spent a very quick moving 2 1/2 hours touring the facility.",
          "We spent a nice rainy morning at this apparently little visited museum. It has three wings, all filled with art made by Quebecois. One wing has mostly 19th century art, not too bad, with a gallery that had a cool, multi-media conceptual installation. The second wing is in a",
          "The buildings are just as much of a focus as the art they house. I found the various exhibits to be thoughtfully organized and interesting. I did learn a lot while I was there. The staff was also polite and knowledgeable. The price was a bit steep for the offerings.",
          "We go here every year and we look forward to seeing their collections and special exhibitions. This year is was Miro. The food is surprisingly good at both restaurants, although we prefer dining outdoors in the summer at the main restaurant.",
          "Modern museum in multiple buildings. The main building is very contemporary and is connected to adjacent buildings. Access by tunnel to the buildings across the street. The art is excellent and there was a large temporary Miro exhibit. The museum is on the hop-hof bus",
          "The place is great, three buildings so plan your time to visit it is worth it. The exhibition of local artists is very good, you get to know more about the country.",
          "Save for the Miro exhibition (temporary) and the indigenous peoples\u2019 section, it is a largely disappointing museum. No comparison can be made with any other major cities with similar collections (Western Europe, or North American); am glad to have visited, but unlike most other",
          "We visited here on a rainy day and were were not disappointed. It took us about 3 hours to walk around and see the exhibits and take in everything the museum complex has to offer. If you enjoy art I highly recommend a visit.",
          "This was a really nice visit to an art museum with particular attention to every detail - the buildings themselves are beautiful, with every angle intentionally designed. I enjoyed the eclectic and surreal Mir\u00f3 special exhibit, and there was a good mix of works throughout,",
          "Great exposition permanent and seasonal The restaurant in the old part is very good and not a sandiwch restaurant like in the new part Great place to lunch and visit",
          "Enjoyed the Miro exhibit. The 3 buildings that make up the museum are each unique and that alone is worth seeing. Wonderful exhibit about real fugitive slaves placed along side an exhibit of portraits of people who would have owned slaves. the contrast provided important",
          "There is plenty of variety spread over several buildings - allow plenty of time, there is a lot to see and all very well presented.. There is also a great cafeteria.",
          "There is plenty of art from multiple eras and styles to enjoy here. The museum is in a great location (in the park and near a nice section of restaurants), and it has several buildings. One is a converted jail so that was cool. We had a very elegant lunch in the lobby of one off",
          "We visited the Mus\u00e9e national des beaux-arts du Qu\u00e9bec in June 2019. We visited the temporary exhibit on Mir\u00f3 as well as the permanent collection (350 ans de pratiques artistiques au Qu\u00e9bec) on view in the recently renovated Pavillon G\u00e9rard-Morisset. Our four-star rating",
          "We visited for a temporary exhibit but were wowed by the building architecture, permanent collection (Especially Jean-Paul Riopelle\u2019s exhibit) and grounds.",
          "The special exhibit was a collection of Joan Miro's. We liked it better than the collection that is at the Miro in Barcelona. The curator just seemed to catch the essence of the paintings in the right sequence and blended the colors to perfection. We actually spent about twice",
          "Very impressive collection for a city of this size. They were having a Mir\u00f3 special exhibit when we visited - lots of his artwork and additional related activities, e.g., there was an interpretive dance in the lobby the day we visited. The rest of the collection was beautifully",
          "From years of living in Chicago, my wife and I have enjoyed some of the finest museums in the world, Here is another and worth a visit if you have any inclination or just need a break from the masses of people in the old part of Quebec. While the art interior to the building",
          "The modern Quebec artists are housed in an Old Quebec Jail. Old Jail cells are cleverly but simply highlighted in one hallway that almost make them look like a modern installation. The Old Quebec artists are housed in the modern part of the museum. Very sleek, white clean lines",
          "This is a must see museum in Quebec City. We were lucky because there was an exhibition of paintings and other art by Miro. The Miro exhibit had at least 100 impressive paintings. Their permanent collection is also impressive.",
          "Big museum four building in total. I like the painting the best. lots to see, have very interesting lunch there at the main entrance.",
          "Excellent visit on a rainy day. The cost is reasonable, $20 per adult, or $11 for under 30. A lot of nice photography spots here and relatively empty and not too touristy. Definitely recommend a visit if you want a unique photo. I recommend the mirror art!",
          "We visited the art museum while in Quebec. My only disappointment was not allowing enough time. The museum is quite large, there are 4 buildings: the central pavalion (which is where we entered), the historic art building, the modern art building and the contemporary art",
          "My family and I enjoyed the Inuit art and the contemporary art at Musee national des beaux-arts. I was especially moved by The Scar Project by Nadia Myre. The artist had individuals sit and \u2018sew their wounds\u2019, literal or metaphorical, on one of the canvases provided, and",
          "My husband and I recently visited this museum. We enjoyed seeing all the beautiful artwork on display. Our visit lasted about two hours. I recommend this if you love art and are in Quebec City.",
          "In our recent trip to Quebec City, we had the pleasure of spending an afternoon at this great museum. We could have spent more time (for art lovers, you can easily spend 4 hours with a nice lunch in between). We were lucky that Manif D\u2019Art 9 (La Biennale de Qu\u00e9bec) was going on,",
          "WE toured the art gallery in 4 hours but if you like art and different images you could easily stay longer. this is housed in the old jail and has other buildings attached now. Some of the displays are very thought provoking and then the old masters painting is in a different",
          "Situated in a beautiful surroundings just above the Plains of Abraham the museum had a number of buildings which houses a nice collection of art. Their modern and contemporary exhibits were the strong point for us. Some wonderful old Canadian master's works as well. Good for",
          "We spent an afternoon here before heading to the airport to catch our flight, and we couldn\u2019t have been more impressed. The array of available exhibits and the sheer size of the property was extremely deceiving from the exterior as the galleries are encompassed within a few",
          "We enjoyed learning about Quebec artists and art. We especially loved the one and only room on Inuit art. The building that had once been a prison was interesting.",
          "Our family of four really enjoyed the visit to this wonderful museum of Quebec Art. The history of early Quebec was represented in the paintings, which was educational for us from the US. We especially liked the landscapes of Quebec artists, depicting different times of the",
          "Very nice Musee for art lovers. Well worth the time to visit and plan on being there for several hours. Before we started our tour we ate a light lunch in the coffee shop. Sandwiches were tasty and staff courteous. We then started on the first floor and worked our way up. There",
          "We wanted to see the Brousseau collection of Inuit Art and were not disappointed. The day was very wintry and our walk was a bit of a challenge due to the sidewalk coverage and the blowing snow. Once we entered we could forget all about the weather outside. Our first and most",
          "The new wing/pavillion simply adds to its overall attractiveness... the \"riopelle\" walk-way is a must!! Even simply looking out the windows in the various buildings provides one with a special scene of the city landscape. The museum provides for a wide range of tastes...simply",
          "If you like visual art, it is one of the best places in the province of Qu\u00e9bec with the Montr\u00e9al Museum of fine art.",
          "The museum occupies three connected buildings of very different architectural styles and provides a good chance to look over the many examples of modern (and a bit of classic) art made in Quebec. For me Jean-Paul Riopelle was a great discovery.",
          "Not a major museum but some interesting art. There are three buildings (connected via underground passageway), each covering a different period. This was not clear to us and we ran out of steam by the time we hit the 19th century works. As an aside: staff was very",
          "We didn't realize what a large museum this is, so we did not have time to see everything. The collection of Quebec based artists if very interesting.",
          "Good selection of modern and contemporary art here, had a great time! There was also a very chill friendly guy at the cafe serving guests who knew his art and music.",
          "Situated in a huge park and recently added a new pavilion. Easily understood layout. This museum has improved it's exhibitions significantly in the past ten years. There is a strong collection of Quebec art throughout the centuries. There is street parking in the park. Bring",
          "We only made it through one of the buildings (I believe there are 3 total), and I really enjoyed it. We aren't huge art enthusiasts, but it was a very good museum. I would have liked to have spent more time there.",
          "Interesting, especially the Inuit art (often humourous) and the Group of Seven art. Pictures well-displayed, although the building layout is odd. There is a basement section on two levels which connects to buildings on the other side of the road. Nice view of the Leonard Cohen",
          "I love all museums, but I guess I don't have an appreciation for abstract art - and there was way too much in this museum. The building is gorgeous. Even the bathrooms were amazing, and spotless. They are expecting a permanent exhibit in 2019 which will highlight Quebec",
          "We enjoyed permanent exhibits of Jean-Paul Lemieux, Jean Riopelle, Alfred, Pellan, Fernand Leduc, Inuit art, and temporary exhibit of Marcel Barbeau.",
          "Situated on La Grande All\u00e9e on the edge of the Plains of Abraham this superb collection of architecturally interesting buildings, including a former prison, complete with cells, houses a variety of mostly modern Quebecois works. The historical section was closed for a mounting",
          "We do not like contemporary art and were disappointed that the historical art building was closed for renovations. The remainder of the museum was all contemporary art. However, the Inuit exhibit is a must see. Very profound. We then visited the Inuit gallery (down St. Lious",
          "This was an awesome museum and I really enjoyed my visit. My friends and I like art but we don\u2019t have the sort of stamina that allows \u201creal\u201d art-lovers to spend 3 or 4 hours looking through galleries. Even so, we got to see a lot in our 90-minute visit; the contemporary Quebec",
          "We were very impressed with our visit to this lovely gem. The art is spread through 4 buildings including a new modern wing and the old city jail. Good restaurants, a great gift shop, and some wonderful art from Canadian artists we had never heard of.",
          "Well done exhibits featuring Canadian artists. The special retrospective of Marcel Barbeau\u2019s career long work was wonderful. I also really enjoyed seeing a selection of each of four artists who have been influential in the evolution of modern art in Canada. Especially",
          "We love art galleries, and the buildings and the setting of the Musee des beaux-arts are great. The exhibitions were definitely not our thing though. We liked the work of J.P. Lemille. Two exhibition areas were closed, and we'd just missed a showing of an artist whose work is",
          "My teenage daughter and I spent hours here the other day, it was her first art gallery and she loved it. Discovering that part of the gallery was once the Qu\u00e9bec City jail only added to the experience, especially when we came across a former cell block. There was a great mixture",
          "Do not miss this art museum. Three large galleries comprise: Charles Bailliarge Pavillion is a converted prison featuring four celebrated Quebec artists from the 20th century: Alfred Pellan, Jean Paul Lemieux, Jean-Paul Riopelle, and Fernand Leduc. A special temporary exhibit",
          "Decided to walk to this beautiful gallery along the plains of Abraham . Good decision as these plains are beautiful laid out gardens with lots of paths and beds of flowers and plants . Went to see the enormous collection of indigenous art but found so much more . The indigenous",
          "The Musee national des beaux-arts seems to fly somewhat under the radar, but to me it's the best museum in town. The 4 buildings it comprises are very different from one another - one is a re-purposed brick prison, another is a 2016 all-glass cube - but each is architecturally",
          "This is a beautiful multi building art gallery just off the Plains of Abraham. They are a mix of new and old building all connected underground. A wrist band provides you access to all building. There is a great collection of design objects from Canada and painting from",
          "I had an excellent experience at this museum, which not only offers a great introduction to the art of Quebec, but also a superb environment for viewing art. The works were well chosen and hung extremely well in pleasing gallery spaces. The architecture of the building,",
          "This gorgeous modern art museum has diverse offerings, and our favorite was the Inuit sculptures of various Arctic animals. Amazing hand crafting. Pro tip - visit the museum on a nice day so that you can enjoy a leisurely stroll through the Plains of Abraham and the Joan of",
          "The entry ticket was surprisingly pricey for a national museum, but the Berthe Morisot temporary exhibit was well worth the fee. The museum is spread over three buildings, connected by underground passageways. All of them are worth a visit. The permanent collection contains",
          "We enjoyed an exhibit of Berthe Morisot, a much overlooked Canadian Impressionist who hung out with Renoir and Manet (and was married to Manet's brother!), as well as modern art in an old, renovated prison. Lunch at the Museum Cafe was a treat.",
          "The venue does real justice to the work exhibited. Well worth a visit . The collection of Inuit art a highlight.",
          "Expanded since the last time I visited, the new pavilion has interesting contemporary works, while the older buildings, which are accessible by a tunnel, hold special exhibits and the permanent collection. Was impressed by the rooms dedicated to four giants of Qu\u00e9bec modern",
          "I did not know much about Quebec art prior to visiting but there is quite a bit to see in this beautiful and expansive facility. The Berthe Morisot exhibit was an extra added bonus. There is a nice restaurant on the premises, and many interesting exhibits. The First Nation",
          "A wonderful art museum made special by a (temporary?) Berthe Morisot exhibit. Several buildings and underground passageways to explore, so save some time to visit. An exceptional Impressionist collection of Berthe's paintings, as well as many other interesting paintings and",
          "This museum is several buildings connected by inside walkways. We went for the Bertha Morrisot exhibition, and it was outstanding. It was obvious that this museum deserved much more time, and I wish I had spent a whole day there. A must see for art lovers.",
          "This museum boasts a very nice restaurant and a fine view from the patio behind the restaurant. The museum was nice, but we were on a tour and did not get to see the entire collection. What we did get to see was not my favorite style of art.",
          "We spent a few hours at the museum and really enjoyed it. It\u2019s definitely heavy on contemporary art but we liked it. It was the perfect thing to do on a rainy day. We were a little surprised that a some of the areas were closed but we liked what we saw. Worth the trip.",
          "We spent a few hours here and very much enjoyed it. My boyfriend is not a huge fan of contemporary art, but he also found it worthwhile. It is laid out well with a wide array of exhibits. Definitely worth a trip.",
          "We went to see the Berthe Morisot exhibit and spent time on the Fait a Main exhibit - contempary artists using everyday and found objects to create new art.",
          "We were told by a local that this is the finest museum in Quebec City and one of the best art museums in Canada. So we budged 5 hours. Working our way slowly though the museum (reading about 60% of exhibit labels), we spent a little less than 3 hours total including eating some",
          "We are visiting from New York City and had a particular interest in this museum for the historical Canadian art - something we can't really see at home. I had heard this museum has a good collection of historical Canadian artists, so we walked a good distance in the heat, bought",
          "They have good restaurant on top floor called Escape Nord . Started drinks outside including appetizers like kangaroo -go figure but very tasty. I had a great tomahawk pork chop . As it\u2019s in the museum we had access to a couple of exhibits . Definitely best as a group event .",
          "Special exhibitiion on picasso was excellent. the rest of the museum and the buildings are worth seeing; nice overview of some Canadian art and the area of the city offers interesting walks and sightseeing.",
          "We enjoyed the special exhibit of the female impressionist painter B. Morisot, but many of the other exhibits were either closed or not of interest to us in this large museum. The free interactive audio guide was not available to us because the wi-if signal was not working",
          "The museum did not disappoint. We especially loved the Inuit art. But the best was the lunch we had in the dining room. It was exceptionally delicious - delightfully presented - extraordinary in the food selections.",
          "Even the building itself is a work of art & we enjoyed seeing the masters of Quebec's art so well displayed, as well as a large room of Inuit art. The restaurant near the back entrance had a great fixed priced 3 course menu for $20 with wonderful service.",
          "What a surprise to stumble on this museum. The contemporty pieces are in one building and the modern ones are in another. Good architecture.",
          "This gallery is worth a visit if only to look at its architecture. The use of the old prison is imaginative and also the link to the newer modern gallery. The Inuit art gallery is a highlight, well worth a visit. The main section we visited focused on four modern male artists so",
          "and this was part of the general walk around. The building has beautiful and eye-catching sculpture pieces around it, visible from the foyer's floor to ceiling windows. Its small enough not to be overwhelmed by the great number of exhibits. Entry is free. The cafe was an",
          "We went to this museum on a weekday morning in June and although it was a great museum it was limited in the amount of art. There was no historical art, all either contemporary and modern. Don't get me wrong, what was there was beautiful but the scope was limited.",
          "We only visited the modern and contemporary wings of the museum, but we found the exhibitions interesting but not stellar. The modern wing included a display of old jail cells what were part of the original tower, but the modern art itself was limited to four Canadian artists.",
          "A nice break from inside the walls .... this Musee featured a Wonderful exhibit of Canadian artists - modern and contemporary art. We lunched at the restaurant in the main building - Excellent!!",
          "I love this museum! It has plenty of art to view! The building has amazing architecture! This is easily seen in 4 hours! I would return!",
          "I went to see the Giacometti exhibit. They had wonderful sculpture in large quantity. The ausio guide is free with the ticket which was reasonably priced. I am glad I could visit before the exhibits ended.",
          "The permanent Innuit Collection is worth the trip into the Museum. It is a smallish room , but filled with the most exquisite sculptures, some whimsical, some ferocious, some of spirits. I could have stared at any number of them for a very long time. We were fortunate to get",
          "The current temporary exhibition is on for a couple more weeks and extra opening hours (Thursday and Friday evenings) have been added. Giacometti's oeuvre is very well presented starring his early work and until the very end and includes major sculpture and painting",
          "ONe of my best experiences ever in a Museum. Giacometti is a master, is a genious artist, but having Giacometti in the MBNAQ is an experience you shouldn't let it pass. The photos will let you feel my words!!!",
          "This museum is quite modern.. the building is reconstruction from an old prison. there are 5 big halls to showed the artist's work . and include one is from the Inuit . Quite fun and nice ..",
          "Many exhibits worth seeing and a very pleasant way to spend a few hours in the afternoon. Our headphones weren't working but there are English translations about the works so we knew what we were looking at. The museum is clean and the building itself is a work of art. The",
          "Recently visited the Giacometti exhibit. World class. Great building and venue. Wonderful architecture. Wonderful setting. Convenient location.",
          "The museum is wonderful on so many levels. Architecturally, it is a series of five buildings interconnected in the most interesting ways. In one case, an underground tunnel filled with murals is the connection. Large open spaces invite the visitor to explore and some rooms",
          "Part of the museum is housed in the old prison and they maintained some of the cells open to the public. Otherwise, they have a large collection of Jean-Paul Riopelle and often have very interesting temporary exhibits.",
          "Definitely in colder months, no trip would be complete without visiting this museum. First off, it is huge. Worth the money. Great exhibits and layout. Beautiful facilities. Will take you 2-3 hours to see Museum. It is really quite exquisite. One of the nicest museums I have",

          "Some amazing pieces of modern art and installations. My favourite was the wooden Mercedes by BGL - the group of 3 male artists that were Canada's choice for the Bienale a few years ago. But the building itself is beautiful and well worth the visit in and of itself. A wonderful",
          "This museum is very nice. Multiple floors in multiple buildings. Do not miss the original jail cells that are on display. In each of the buildings, there are cafeterias or restaurants. You can rest with a glass of wine or some extraordinary food. The details right down to the",
          "It is an interesting compilation of mostly modern art from contemporary artists. I could appreciate some of the more traditional art but looking at a blob of green paint and the artist titled it an apple.. I'm sorry. The galleries are crowded and it's a long walk from wing to",

          "I re-visited this museum after 10 years and the experience has change. I found it quite small compared to other museums I have visited. The collection was not the best either.",
          "We especially enjoyed the top floor exhibits in the new Contemporary pavilion -- one on Design and the other on Inuit Art. Some of the other \"art\" was not exactly our cup of tea. Interesting how they converted old prison to the Modern exhibit building.",
          "We enjoyed the Mitchell/Riopelle exhibit very much, and the contemporary exhibit as well. The price for a family of 5 is steep though, as they don't have a family discount. The cost seemed especially high as 1/3 of the museum is presently under renovation and cannot be viewed.",
          "We toured the Modern, Contemporary and Inuit Art collectuions; the pre-20th century art was unavailable for viewing as the building housing it was a closed for renovations. We were impressed with the building housing the modern Qu\u00e9bec art collection; it is a converted prison.",

          "We are not fans of modern or contemporary art and those were the only exhibitions on display. The historical art building was closed when we were here. If you are not a fan of modern or contemporary art then do not come here. Wish we saved our money and spent it on something",
          "I visited the Musee national des beaux-arts du Quebec with my wife, and we enjoyed an interesting 'Ripolle' exhibit as well as a very good lunch at the museum's cafe. This may be the best way to beat the cold on a winter day in Quebec City, and the museum is large enough to",
          "Having visited many of Europe's great art museums, I kept my expectations low...but I found myself pleasantly enchanted by the mix of old and new art, and the classic and modern. $20 gives you access to three buildings worth of art, progressively taking you through classic,",
          "We started off well; impressed by the top floor display of Inuit art. After that, the exhibits seemed rather sparse. The ground floor main entrance seems to occupy the whole ground floor. On the second floor, the amount of space in the elevator lobby is huge. There are other",

          "I only had time to visit two areas of the museum - first was the temporary Mitchell/Riopelle exhibit which just completely blew my mind. I appreciate art, but in a very all-encompassing 'that's nice' kind of way. Kind of like if you give me a fancy red wine, I'd probably say",
          "One of the buildings was closed, but we were able to visit the other two. There was an exhibit of 4 Canadian Contemporary Artists, a large display of decorative arts by Quebec designers, and the Inuit Art Collection. Well worth a visit. Was also nice to walk out of the",
          "Our second visit to this nice art gallery near old town QC. They had displays of several Canadian modern artists on offer, some awesome, some...well, it's art. One of the buildings in the complex was once the regional prison, and some of the cells remain on display. Nice grounds",
          "We visited the museum to see the exhibit on Riopelle and Mitchell, 2 abstract artists painters who painted in the second half of the 20th century. The exhibit was situated in the new Lassonde pavilion, which is modern and beautiful. The museum is inexpensive compared to Fine",
          "The Inuit exhibit was fascinating. The contemporary art is of little interest to me and the more traditional section was closed for renovations. So, all in all, if you are not a fan of abstract art the rest of the museum will be unappealing to you.",
          "We're not really modern art folks and that is primarily what this museum features, but the Inuit sculptures were phenomenal. I wanted to bring one home! Got the book instead.",

          "We toured at least a portion of this museum over a couple of hours. There was a lot of walking to find any exhibits at all. Some were interesting, but many we missed because you get no directions on how to find them.",
          "I was last at this museum about two years ago. In the interim it has undergone a major change. The museum originally consisted of a central glass atrium housing he ticketing area, a 3-story building on the right, and what I believe is a former prison building on the left. On",
          "I visited this museum through a hospitality event during a business trip in September 2017. This included the opportunity to view the collection, and it is well worth a visit for anyone with an interest in art and art history. Much of the collection focuses on the development",
          "This art museum is within walking distance of old Quebec and in a former prison. We saw a lot of exhibits from some Quebec modern artists and enjoyed the children's room. Lots of cafes, meeting spaces and washrooms. An interesting use of space. Lots of stairs if you want. We",

          "Good art gallery in several building so be careful not to miss any. A good range of artwork in pleasant surroundings. Some of the other museums and attractions were offering 20% off linked destinations.",
          "This museum has the most modern, and best layout of any museum I have seen...and I have seen many. The mini cafe here is also very good, had better tasting soup and sandwich than restaurants I dined at around Quebec city. The special exhibits were great, but hoping they had",

          "If modern art is your thing, then this is it. The Flux and the Puddle work was obviously expensive, and if a jarring experience was intended it succeeded. We still don't get it. An interesting section of Quebec historical scenes and carvings, but not enough to save the",
          "Although I'm not a huge fan of some of the modern art, there was more to see of native Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois art in the 3 buildings that we visited. The gallery buildings themselves were pieces of art inside and out. The Pellan collection, I thought, was particularly impressive. I don't",

          "There is three different sections but it's all connected, no need to go outside to get to the other buildings. Some of the art was beautiful but some I would never call art so we walked quickly past those. However I did get annoyed because the security guards kept asking my",

          "After seeing this museum (16.00 entry), the song \"Is that all there is\" kept going through my mind. It's a very large and stately building with what I thought to be very little of it dedicated to exhibits. There was an interesting display of Indian miniatures, but after that",

          "I don't know why this is advertised as free, since we paid $30 dollars for the three of us, but the visit was well worth it. Some of the galleries featured mainly automatism and abstract works, which didn't appeal to us, but there were still numerous galleries filled with",

          "Easily doable in a 3 hour visit you could also spend more time here. The current special exhibit of the Impressionist Collection of William Paley (through Feb.) is worth a visit. The museum's collection of Inuit Art is superb and is well presented and should not be missed.",

          "Interesting museum with a lot of contemporary art set in an old building formerly a prison. Actual jail cells still there for viewing.  This museum is actually 3 buildings and one is newer. The entry is contemporary and airy.  Outside we \u2026",
          "The modern Quebec artists are housed in an Old Quebec Jail. Old Jail cells are cleverly but simply highlighted in one hallway that almost make them look like a modern installation. The Old Quebec artists are housed in the modern part of the \u2026",
          "Perfect !! Full of things to see and to do. We visit for 3 hours and was not enough !",
          "As always great to have a lunch and visit a great exhibition like the one of Frida and Diego.",
          "Enjoyed the Miro exhibit. The 3 buildings that make up the museum are each unique and that alone is worth seeing. Wonderful exhibit about real fugitive slaves placed along side an exhibit of portraits of people who would have owned slaves. \u2026",
          "Beautiful building, modern museum, great exhibits. Must visit in Quebec.",
          "Have visited here several times.  Always something interesting to experience.  The new building is a bonus to the other displays of the musee.\n\nThe location is close to the downtown and other attractions in Quebec City.  If you are here make a visit the Musee part of your to do list.",
          "Wonderful museum but very crowded on free entrance days.",
          "Beautiful pieces in this museum with ranging concepts. I left the museum still thinking about some works that I had seen and really felt like I had a different perspective on life. Usually museums don't really have this impact on me which is a testament to the exhibits this museum has to offer.",
          "very interesting way to display art. The museum itself is an ode to creativity. Great architecture and very oriaginal expositions",
          "The historic part of the museum was best. I personally dont like contemporary art and they had this creepy temporary exhibition placed near the family gathering area where children could be... And I don't think that was a very safe or wise \u2026",
          "Does not worth it at all. Modern art is terrible! The traditional part is better but its not comparable with Montreal art museum at all and it was expensive too. Besides, one of the employees had a very very bad and rude behavior with us. Not recommended at all.",
          "Stunning museum space, spread across several building pavilions each with a unique feel. Beautiful outdoor park space in between but also an underground path for cold months. Great range of fine arts both contemporary and historical. \u2026",
          "I love the culture, that's why I tried to go when there's something new.",
          "It's a must if you are visiting Quebec city. You will learn a lot about the culture and art. Minimum two hours of your time will be OK, however if you want to visit deeper, you can spend up to five hours. You can find all information in \u2026",
          "Beautiful exhibits throughout the corridors of inspired architecture. Well worth the entry fee for the lovers of art",
          "Fantastic museum, the permanent exhibits fantastic and the temporary one was great!",
          "It was a very nice experience. The modern art wing was definitely my favorite part. The religious parts where a bit much. I mean ther was a lot of religious stuff, if you're in to that.",
          "Good exhibits especially inuit art.",
          "Its a beautiful place to spend the day, admire the art and think.",
          "An artsy museum with a quite and healing atmosphere.",
          "Outstanding displays of Quebec oise art. I expected a somewhat diminished level but was delighted by the exhibits shown of World class standard. I enjoyed the Innuit sculptures particularly. Also the excellently curated Joan Miro \u2026",
          "Beautiful buildings located on an amazing site overlooking the St Lawrence. Joan Miro retrospective was excellent and well presented. However the rest of the museum was not as impressive.",
          "Incredible variety of exhibitions, you have many hours to spend there to visit everything. A cultural jewel near the heart of the city.",
          "This art museum is massive. While it had about as much art in it as others I've been to, it's so spread out that you never felt crowded. There is also a wide variety with pieces from the First Nations to modern day pieces and plenty in between.",
          "This is a glorious museum punching well above its weight with the permanent collection and the rotating shows ( a testament to their importance was the Joan Miro retrospective - a spin-off of the MoMA and Tate and grand Palais show) . The \u2026",
          "Went solely for the contemporary art, and there is some fine work to be found there. The top floor had an exhibit on Inuit sculpture, and the contemporary works were interesting and challenging, just like I like a museum visit to do.",
          "Went to the Miro exhibit. Very impressive. This whole complex is lovely. We ate at the restaurant. Delicous",
          "Interesting architecture, really nice collection. Good for kids. The grounds are beautiful! 3 cafes on site",
          "A must-see in Quebec city! The museum is a group of three buildings linked each others by a pathway. There's plenty of art from Quebec, including some Inuit art. Just beautiful",
          "Loved all the exhibitions. There is a certain degree of interactivity at this museum that I haven't found any where else!",
          "A modern museum with a small, but interesting collection in a very interesting setting. The buildings of the museum are fabulous. The Mir\u00f3 exhibition was on display when we went and it is a must see!",
          "Very nice place and good temporary Expo",
          "They had a great Miro exhibit in display. There was also a decent display of some of Quebec most famous and influential artists. Worth the price of entry :)",
          "One of my happy places in Quebec, open spaces, family friendly, good food and off course, great exhibitions",
          "Great museum go check it out. They have several rotating exhibits and some permanent exhibits which are quite nice. They had an exhibit on about poison which was quite interesting.",
          "Wooonderful place. Magical.",
          "It's a great place to hang out with. And to get inspired. But of course we cannot compare it with the other big museums from Europe. But it does have a good collection. The environment is perfect. And the place has quite a bit of historical significance. You also get a good look at the Saint Lawrence River.",
          "Very nice exhibits. People are very friendly and always willing to assist you.",
          "Small and poorly chosen collection. The building itself is more artistic than the collection inside.",
          "Amazing buildings and exhibits. Great layout, display, and friendly, bilingual staff. Strongly recommended.",
          "Wonderful exposition of Mir\u00f2 plus the other amazing pieces. The building itself it's a piece of art",
          "We decided to walk to the museum from Chateau Fairmont. I always like walking in cities I\u2019m not familiar with - it gives you a better sense of the city and all it has to offer.  We came when the museum opened which was good as it got busier \u2026",
          "My intention was to visit Plains of Abrahams...the GPS took us to this place!..it was a nice mistake..the staff there are very nice. One explained to us how to get to Plains of Abrahams, he even suggested that we come after 5 to get the discounted rate..\nMy kids enjoyed the experience of visiting an art museum.",
          "This place is great. Be sure not to miss Marie Chantal\u2019s resto in the main lobby!",
          "Great modern art museum. We saw a huge collection of Juan Miro's art. Don't miss the Inuit sculpture exhibit on the top floor!  \nThe space is huge - connecting three or four large buildings underground by tunnel. Directions are in FRENCH only and thus confusing to many. Parking is avaliable but not shown on Google Maps.",
          "Very nice Art museum. I recommend if you like art exhibition.",
          "The building is beautiful, spacious and air conditioning is great on a hot day. There is quite a varied collection of art.",
          "It would still be worth a visit with no art pieces in it because the buildings are really quite a thing. The permanent exhibitions are worth the stroll however as you get quickly up to speed on you quebequois contemporary art. Not quite the cutting edge you may say, but a building block for sure.",
          "What a huge and plasent place. Good taste its not always on hands whith good art but here youll find s piece thats speaks on mostly everithing. As any museum or gallery go whit a lot of time to enjoy. At the end there s cafeteria were to restore it the large day",
          "Best art museum I have ever visited, hands down. Fascinating art, beautiful architecture and interior design, and a thorough lesson on the visual history of Quebec.",
          "Excellent in every possible way.",
          "MNBAQ is well worth a trip. With approximately a dozen galleries, everyone is sure to find some exhibit that catches their imagination. It is particularly nice during a rainy day as there are tunnels between all the buildings as well as a \u2026",
          "So cool - so much to see. Nice way to spend the day. Wont post pics becayse you need to check out the art in person. But had a nice soup at lunch and saw interesting exhibits in a lovely setting. You can check your coats/bags.",
          "Nice staff and good facilities, however we did not enjoy the exhibition",
          "During my visit they had Mir\u00f3's work in an exposition. The museum building has an beautiful art collection that may be appreciated while walking from one structure to another, all in the Battlefield Park, interconnected in a very smart way by means of underground passages.",
          "Very cool art exhibitions! Everytime I come to Quebec is a must to visit.",
          "I visited this place by accident. However, it was a very good place to know this region culture. Three building are connected through underground corridors. It costs 20 canadian dollars to look around. It is worth 20 dollars or more. I'd recommend you to visit here if you have 2 hours available.",
          "I love the Miro echibition! Beautiful place.",
          "Beautiful museum. Very modern and elegant. Easy to navigate. The exhibitions were perfect when I was there. It was also not very busy so it helped to be able to see it all quickly. Some extremely rare pieces on exhibition from private \u2026",
          "Wonderful museum and amazing staff. I was there working for an event and really the staff there has got to he some of the nicest ever !",
          "Best exhibit on First People's Art ever.  Amazing.",
          "Amazing art on offer, including a curated Inuit art collection. A well stocked boutique that has great gift options on offer. The ticket works like a day pass, enabling you to go out for lunch and be back later. It is open into the night on Wednesdays.",
          "Comprehensive collection of Inuit and \"autochtone\" art, as well as interesting special exhibitions such as M\u00edro, currently.",
          "My wife and I went to see the MIRO exhibition. Certainly worth a visit.",
          "I want really impressed to be honest. The museum was pretty small and nothing was all that amazing. No wow factor.",
          "My wife and I spent a few hours here on our trip to Quebec City. What an amazing place! The museum is well designed. We went through all of the exhibits and thoroughly enjoyed them. We stopped for lunch at the museum restaurant and had a \u2026",
          "The quality of the exhibitions and the warmth of the environment are spectacular. Another must for Quebec City!",
          "Amazing art museum. It focuses on Quebecois art so there is not a lot of classical or historical work, but once in a while, there might be an exhibition. I easily spent 3 hours here looking at the collection they have here. This is must-go if you enjoy modern and contemporary art.",
          "Two big problems here. Firstly, came to see the permanent collection and no prior warning that a large part is closed. Would have been nice to be told before buying our tickets, it was the historic rather than modern art that we came for. \u2026",
          "A beautiful space filled with amazing artwork from Qu\u00e9becois artists and more, I highly reccomend for anyone trying to exapnd their knowledge or just please their eyeballs!",
          "Great space for events. Indoor/outdoor. Lots of windows. Love it!",
          "went last week on a rainy day. paid full price only to find out, after the fact that that 1/3 of the museum with the historical artwork was closed for whatever reason. So the native artwork was nice but the modern and contemporary art \u2026",
          "Wonderful art presented in equally beautiful buildings.\nA great afternoon of past and present.",
          "The exposition in this museum are amazing. The building architecture is very modern. I recommend to visit this great place.",
          "Nice museum, the temporary exhibitions were great. Beautiful buildings!",
          "Huge spaces, not much to see if you are not into contemporary art.",
          "It was a great experience and exactly what we expected. The layout of the building is all over the place, so you'll be walking back and forth through exhibits to get to every one. For anyone who isn't comfortable with stairs, this is not an \u2026",
          "Wonderful collection of sculptures, paintings, wood carvings and Inuit art to boot",
          "This place was really cool. We got a discount because we're a couple under 30. They have a gorgeous garden, and they have some really cool exhibitions. I would definitely recommend this place if you're staying in Quebec City.",
          "A very unique place with a great collection of modern and contemporary Quebecois art as well as Inuit art.",
          "Super cool museum. The Barbeau exhibit was inspiring. Great place to spend a winter afternoon. Thought the cafe could have been more welcoming...",
          "Good exhibition for kids",
          "Very friendly and helpful staff.",
          "Went on a Wednesday evening when admission is half price. The building itself is worth the visit, with a marvellous entrance hall and the biggest elevator I've been in, with gold sliding doors and an internal mirror to make it look huge. We \u2026",
          "Very unique sculptures ans paintings. Go on Wed since it's half off.",
          "Well... Not so bad",
          "There are not many good collections of arts. It has mix and match, fine arts, contemporary arts and modern arts. Part of the museum was the old prison. The new modern building is beautiful. The special exhibition on Berthe.\nMarisot is excellent. Inuit art collection is very interesting.",
          "What a beautiful, amazing Museum!!\nMy personal favorite Museum has always been the Fitchburg Art Museum in Fitchburg, Massachusetts USA...and this museum is a fantastically perfect compliment to that! \nA modern architectural building \u2026",
          "It's a place for people who understand and appreciate art. I don't happen to be one of such people. Some of the art forms look interesting at the face of it. I was more amused, but maybe something epic for the learned. If you think any of \u2026",
          "The most beautiful Inuit art collection that we've seen in Canada, some real masterpieces.\nAlso a nice little section on design, and local painters.\nDo not miss a ride in the impressive golden elevator!",
          "Lots to see. Will go again, as I am sure we missed somethings. Be prepared to walk a lot but was truly worth every minute. Toured without a guide, which allowed us to take the time to look and enjoy all the pieces.",
          "I could happily spend days here. Buy a membership so you can go as often as you wish!",
          "Really worth going to. Such a wide range of art.",
          "Very poor collections.  Except for the First Nations pieces, it is really a waste of time.  The focus on Canadian artists should be it's charm, but actually just makes it shallow.  Beautiful building and facilities....very short on actual \u2026",
          "Loved the art and the articheture. Great for kids with several interactive exhibits.",
          "If you like modern art that's an unmissable place to visit.",
          "Beautiful architecture and great exhibitions. It\u2019s a must if you visit Quebec City",
          "The architecture is beautiful and it makes for a lovely evening, though the art is more on the abstract/experimental side.",
          "A wonderful building and fantastic display of Art.",
          "Some of the best contemporary collections in Toronto. A mind blowing installation hides in the historical wing. Finally, the modern art wing is housed within the prison adds a whole extra level immersion. Highly recommended, one of the better ways to spend time when exploring Quebec City",
          "Not the most impressive museum I saw in my life but it worth it. Very beautiful galleries (especially Riopelle who was very talented). You'll have so much fun :) I am 20 years old and I paid 11$ to get in (prices change depending on your age). There is no reduction for students.",
          "The new wing of the museum is amazing. It brings the museum at the same level as the other great contemporary museums around the world",
          "Large museum with wide range of artworks, from historical to contemporary to First Nations culture, I respect every work very much. You would have to spend a whole day to absorb the art world!",
          "Beautiful museum with amazing exhibitions. If you like art you will enjoy this museum. There are several buildings that make up this museum with an underground passage connecting all of them. The museum is located off Battlefields park and a walk through the park after visiting the museum is really worth it!",
          "Amazing Arts museum. I was here for 2.5 hours and didn't see it all",
          "Lovely museum with great permanent collections. Part of the museum is situated in an old prison...really cool!",
          "It is an amazing place a fun place to visit",
          "The beautiful museum which is totally worthy to visit!",
          "Wow, what a beautiful museum! So much art and architecture to it!",
          "I've been to a lot of museums -- DC, London, NYC, Rome, etc -- but for some reason this place captivated my mind like few other art museums have... Thought-provoking postmodern work (not just canvas splashes, which can get old). The \u2026",
          "I went to see First Nations exhit. There is a single Intuit (very good) room but nothing else. Poor show.",
          "A place where rich people display how they launder money and/or get kickbacks from the government.",
          "Decent collection of mostly modern/contemporary Canadian artists spread through several buildings. (The G\u00e9rard Morisset Pavilion with historic art was closed during our visit.) Good presentation, lighting, and navigational aids. \n\nWe didn't \u2026",
          "Spent half a day wondering around and it was charming.",
          "I visited the museum last year while on vacation in Quebec. It was a real pleasure to discover so many great French Canadian artists like Riopelle. David Altmejd\u2019s Flux and a Puddle sculpture is a real treat for the eyes. Highly recommend for  art lovers!",
          "Great place for parties but as a real museum it seemed a bit sparce. But this is because of  waning interest in art in Quebec City... for a museum to survive they must also have big social events.",
          "I'm not generally a fan of art museums. This one though had something for everyone. The dinner in the cafe is worth the visit alone! Amazing food! ...and the art is OK too I guess.",
          "Great view . Service is lacking",
          "Incredible galleries, magnificent paintings!",
          "Great place to spend an afternoon. The contemporary art exhibit is highly recommended. Also recommend the cafe in the basement of the former prison that is attached.",
          "Surprisingly fun place!!! Lots of stuff to see!",
          "Awesome and so so beautiful! Staff throughout are disinterested and rude. Our experience with the lovely ladies at the ticket counter however was wonderful!",
          "Beautiful building..",
          "Fantastic museum and the museum restaurants are not to be missed!!! They provide spectacular works of art on a plate!!! Absolute must if you are a foody who loves magnificent  culinary experiences. :-)",
          "Fabulous collection of B. Morisot. And every 1 working at the Museum was so very nice to us",
          "Miro is awesome. Go see it.",
          "Beautiful artwork on display. Cheap admissions fees that cover all three of the art museums. Must see in Quebec City",
          "Lovely modern building; floats on air!",
          "Amazing museum, love the underground that takes you to the other building, you can find a lot of amazing artists and love the way the separate the rooms with the distinctive theme (:",
          "This is a nice large museum. \nIt has various art sections and one of them is in an amazing lighthouse building. \nThe entrance fee isn't too cheap so I would check if there is something that you want to see beforehand",
          "Beautiful museum!  A delightful Sunday afternoon adventure. Highly recommend a visit!!",
          "well curated, with a space and presentation that gives you permission to go beyond an initial impression",
          "Not bad",
          "Interesting collections at this moment. The museum is an interesting structure: a nice bright building.",
          "Must visit, presents a rich history of quebecois art which is excellently curated and presented",
          "Great art. Wonderful curation. Food was bad but it didn't matter. Totally worth the visit.",
          "Art museum with a heavy focus on local artists, but also featuring some international work. Very nice little caf\u00e9.",
          "They have baby area which is perfect for infant to crawl and play. Lots of rest area",
          "This is the must visit place in Quebec City!!! My friend and I spent the whole afternoon in there, loved that place!!! definitely gonna visit again!!",
          "Mostly contemporary and modern art, the historic section was closed, disappointed. A long walk between buildings and we had to check our coats in a different building than we entered. We ended our tour far away from our coat check, not good \u2026",
          "architectural eye candy!",
          "One ticket for three buildings! Go early, otherwise you won\u2019t have enough time to finish it.",
          "Great time with cool people ! See you for summer camp!",
          "Beautiful installation on the second floor.",
          "Best place around to get inspired.",
          "Beautiful place! Friendly staff and beautiful exhibitions.",
          "I was quite a bit disappointed in this Museum. During my stay in Quebec City it was the only time I wished I had done something else.  \n\nSome exhibits were lovely, but on the whole there were issues. The staff was also moderately \u2026",
          "Quite a nice place for filming...",
          "Wonderful exhibition space, interesting special events, dining on site enjoyable.",
          "Some of the exhibitions were great and there was a large variety and amount of exhibitions so I'm sure everyone can find something they like. Some of the captions for the contemporary stuff was rather overly pretentious, but that might just be me.",
          "The buildings are beautiful, and the collection is pretty good with the Canadian artwork being the most unique and extensive. Wasn't thrilled with the guards/docents, several of whom were very rude and constantly asking my girlfriend and I \u2026",
          "The museum was very spacious with lots of different types of  art work to see",
          "Beautiful exhibits and beautiful architecture",
          "Huge gallery with good variety of displays and exhibitions. Comfortable seating areas and helpful staff. Free coat check was very handy. Onsite restaurant had a fixed price lunch menu that was well priced and delicious. We ate on a gorgeous outdoor terrace.",

          "Nice place for art lovers",
          "Some very nice art pieces, especially liked Old Jail building",
          "Really enjoyed the museum, would have given 5 stars but the historical arts pavilion is closed till Nov 2018.",
          "Not the greatest collection but worth a visit. Their collection of Inuit Art is a must see.",

          "Lovely!",
          "It's a pretty tranquil museum without any heavy metal music or gangster rap, but it's good for visual arts. I enjoy audio arts more than visual. I'm an audiophile.",
          "Some hit-or-miss exhibitions and artists, however a lot of great finds here - especially the Inuit art section.",
          "Super nice staff and charming place but I didn't enjoy my experience there. I think the installation where poor on the background leaving people with few instruments to live the museum experience. Pity.",

          "A sensational centre to visit and explore",
          "What a beautiful building (Pierre Lassonde the contemporary art one) ! The Inuit art exposition is amazing and most of the temporary ones are great ! The rest is interesting. Takes a full day to check everything. They organize a lot of events that are worth trying. ",
          "Loved the exhibit Fait Main, excellent art and Inuit art gallery was exceptional.",
          "Exellent Museum. Should spend 2 hours to view all",
          "Great art museum! Blown away by the size and variety.",
          "Well organized and curated.  Beautiful instalations - the location is also incredible.  Definitely worth a visit - there is even a child friendly installation on the first floor.",
          "Definitely worth visit if you like modern art. Collection is much better than sfmoma. Don't have big names or mega $$$$ art like Moma but we feel Quebecois artists are as good as any in North America.",
          "The best museum in Quebec city",
          "Awesome and incredible!",
          "Great! Could be more English-friendly.",

          "The best museum in Canada, amazing expositions, with great divided areas. Perfect design tunnels that connect each building, to avoid going outside during winter. David Altmejd exposition really makes a statement. Want to go back! ",
          "Amazing architecture, the curration is usually on point and the lighting is great. I wish they would take more risks and show more contemporary artists to compensate for the lack of a contemporary art museum.",
          "Loved all the paintings on the third floor but the other two floors I didn't really enjoy. Very abstract and modern sculptures but were interesting none the less. ",
          "This place is ok. It gives a light aspect to what a museum is. The artifacts are not of particular interest neither the building. It is however fun. ",
          "Excellent art, fabulous buildings, great restaurants, friendly staff... what more could you want?",
          "It\u2019s a nice place, some artifacts are beautiful and interesting",

        "wiki": "The Battlefields Park includes the Plains of Abraham with the nearby and smaller Des Braves park, both within the district of Montcalm in Quebec City, and forms one of the few Canadian national urban parks. Its significance lies in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (1759) and the Battle of Sainte-Foy, fought six months later on today's Des Braves park.\nIt was established as a park by law on March 17, 1908, it features an interpretive centre and walking trails, and is sometimes used for outdoor concerts, especially during the national festival events.  The park contains a collection of about 50 historical artillery pieces scattered about its grounds. It is managed by the National Battlefields Commission, a federal government agency under the Minister of Canadian Heritage with members appointed by the Queen in her Canadian, Ontarian, and Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Councils. The commission also oversees its own police service since 1948.\n\n\n== Martello towers ==\n\nBuilt by the British to prevent the Americans from drawing close enough to lay siege to the walls of Quebec, the four Martello towers were begun by James Craig in 1808 and completed in 1812. The towers were arranged to provide for each other's defence, being situated along an axis that bisects the Plains of Abraham from the northwest to the southeast in order to screen the western approach to Quebec City, and were numbered rather than named.  Tower No. 3 was demolished in the 1900s but the other three remain. The  limited openings on the tower were designed to prevent the enemy from taking it by storm, while the tower's rounded shape (to deflect projectiles) and thick masonry walls made it nearly impervious to artillery fire.\n\nThe doors to the tower are at a height of twice the height of a man - about 4.5 metres (14.8 feet) - and could only be reached by a removable ladder.  The towers were never tested in battle, and became obsolete in the 1860s with the development of rifled artillery, which was powerful enough to breach their walls.\nUsing the theme of military engineering Martello Tower No. 1 is open for visitors to view its three floors during the summer months.\nThe Martellos were originally fitted with removable roofs in the fall to keep snow from accumulating on the gun platform at the top and removed in the spring. The roofs were later replaced with newer permanent ones which look almost the same.\nThe three towers were designated a national historic site in 1990, and also form part of the Fortifications of Quebec National Historic Site.One of the three towers is located within the city streets away from the park.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe National Battlefields Commission\nVirtual museum of the Battlefields Park\nMartello Tower 1 exhibitsdead link]",

          "Some of this was closed due to a lot of construction work. It is good to access from the road and walk down the 300 steps than the other way.",
          "Park is very historic if you know Quebec history, worth taking a look, hard to imagine an important battle took place there, pretty views of the Saint Lawrene worth the time",
          "Superbly curated presentation of the battle that changed the western hemisphere.. Must for battlefield historians.",
          "We walked through the park towards old quebec. It was very beautiful in May. My 4-year-old daughter enjoyed running on the ways among trees. If you want to walk and relax, I recommend this park.",
          "Well marked by didactics in both French and English show where Wolfe staged his amphibious landing and 4500 British Troops ascended a 50 metre cliff to the Plains of Abraham on the morning of 13 September 1759 where they confronted Montcalm's 4500 French Troops. An event that",
          "Visiting the battlefields is great but you MUST visit the Citadelle, and if you can make correspond with the change of the guard in the morning (around 10 am) This you dont want to miss, and while at the Citadelle you have the best view of the battlefield.",
          "We took a group here and completed two activities: Soldier of the Tower and The Snowshower. If you are looking for a group activity with lots of history and interactive methods of learning history, this is the one and only place to look for! Students left with smiles and",
          "this is a beautiful city that has a European charm. this is the battle field where the englis went against the French in just 30 mn of battle",
          "Beautiful grounds and quite interesting to learn about the history. We were there on a beautiful sunny day.",
          "We had a walk around Battlefields Park after visiting the fort - a great way to finish a day and watch the sun set over the water. There isn't much around by the fort but great for a bit of exercise/picnic and there were placques here and there that gave you information about",
          "A brilliant place to visit along with a tour of the base is a must for history lovers and sightseers.",
          "This Park is \u00e0 Green Space for to discover the beauty of Quebec. With \u00e0 nice view on the Saint-Lawrence river and the downtown, you can take a nice time in this area.",
          "Even though it was snowy, my family and I enjoyed our walk around this very historical place. The views of the Saint Lawrence River are great.",
          "This park is worth the visit either by foot or by car (through the parkway). You get a great view of the St-Lawrence River, the Citadel and Old Quebec and gain an appreciation of the history. Very close to the Grande Allee and nearby restaurants.",
          "It was a rainy day when we went but it didn't stop us to explore the park. Great for a picnic. Beautiful sights and picture ops! A must see!",
          "Really pleasant area to be honest not a lot to do but it is nice to relax and stroll around, some old cannons but thats about it",
          "We walked around much of Battlefields Park on our recent visit but as we are getting close to Halloween it would be a big mistake not to visit the individual garden areas close to the Joan of Arc Statue. There are a number of very well set out displays including ghoulish tales",
          "An impressive vista of green for walking, sitting and enjoying this historical place. There are interpretive signs strategically placed, and lovely photography opportunities all around. We were lucky to have an amazing guide retell the history.",
          "I say this is one of the most unique parks in the world in a way as the place displays multiple real cannos that were used back in when the city was still an active fortress. You feel the history... Location is right south of the Quebec City and it is accessible from the city",
          "There is a nice board walk that you can follow from here that follows the river path and ends up at the chateau. Good views all the way and across to levis.",
          "Hard to believe this is the site where a battle that lasted less than thiry minutes changed the course of history! Now it is a beautiful green space in the middle of an urban area. The park is absolutely lovely, beautiful rolling hills, lush green grass and well manicured",
          "A very informative pavilion with good exhibits. A very interesting historical film available at different times in both French and English. Well worth the visit as we had never heard of the Plains of Abraham before.",
          "I appreciate the care to maintain the historical references of this area's unique history. The museum was small enough to enjoy and the visual projection was good. The park is beautiful and you should take the time to walk around it in order to fully experience what happened",
          "This park is integrated with the Plains of Abraham, where a battle between the British and French took place in 1759, lasting about 15 minutes, and where both opposing Generals were killed. The walk takes you past nearby private residences, as well as fountains and monuments,",
          "A nice walk up many steps to get to this park. There were nice water views while climbing the steps. If you don't like steps, I would skip Battlefields Park.",
          "Worth visiting when in the old town of Quebec City. Great views of the harbour & city from many of its vantage points. In the summer they hold great concerts here too.",
          "My friend and I spent part of an afternoon walking around the park. It was overcast but we still had a great time.",
          "Now enjoyed by all apparently at one time it had social housing on it .On a recent visit in Seotember not many keaves had changed colours but it was warm and sunny ,but is well used in the Winter for outdoor sports .",
          "This is a very lovely garden. When we visited it in September, the garden was decorated for Halloween with tombstones, ghosts, etc telling the history of those who have died.",
          "For the park, I would definitely have rated this as 5. It is far better than Central Park in New York, especially as it is so much more peaceful. We walked through the park from the city, on the way to the Musee des Beaux Arts; on a sunny day, it was really wonderful.",
          "Hats off to Quebec City and its government for developing this historic site into a beautiful and welcoming public park.",
          "Very interesting preserved park. This was the site of the famous but totally inaccurately named Battle of the heights of Abraham. Wolfe is credited in all te stories as having scaled cliffs to get p and surprise the French. here are no, zero, zilch cliffs just a steep winding",
          "lots going on in the park as it is open space surrounded by trees and lovely older homes. We walked by it on the way to the Musee de Beaux Arts",
          "You can spend an afternoon there . It is very vaste the view is outstanding so either go for Jogg walk or even a pick nick.",
          "We only walked through the park - did not try to find any historical information. It is a pleasant green open area with pretty gardens as well. Great place if you need to let your kids run around to burn up some energy after a lot of sightseeing. Benches avaialble if you",
          "Great place to visit and learn about the history of quebec and canada as a whole i recommend it for all ages as the kids can run around and play while the older folks get to take in the history and beauty of this place.",
          "not too sure what I can say about this that hasn't already been written in history books. Take the tour and see how Quebec and Canada were shaped.",
          "breathtaking. taking the walk all the way and all around was a necessary exercise after all the good food... loved it beautiful greenery and perfect weather during labor day weekend",
          "I was here during August for the Festival D'ete and I must say that the plains never looked like the picture. Rolling Stones re featured and over 100,000 people attended that night. It is such a beautiful city and the Park has a lovely pathway that runs along the St. Lawrence",
          "Nice view - we took the bus tour - so we got all the history of this remarkable place. The Bus driver gave us a good history of the place, battlements, the canons, the trees planted by the US, etc.. We did see lots of families aorund",
          "Battlefields Park in QC is beautiful and a must see. The lawns are well maintained and give you a view of the city. My husband and I have visited QC many times and each and every time we make sure to walk through this Park.",
          "So convenient for morning jog... Lots of joggers... Didn't really do the \"battlefields tour\" from a historic perspective... More akin to Central Park in NYC",
          "This is the second time we've been on this tour. Abraham is fun and informative. It's a beautiful park too.",
          "A lovely spot for jogging yet so full of momentous history. If only the French had not lost to the Brits in 1759, perhaps there would have been no American Revolution in 1776",
          "The history of all that Quebec went through over the years was amazing. We took a little tour and learned quite a bit.",
          "so much history here, you can still see some of the mounds they dug 250 years ago during the battles.",
          "This is a beautiful park offering different views of Quebec, in particular Parliament. Kids can run crazy and climb on the cannons. Some seniors might have problems negotiating the numerous stairs.",
          "Very nice view overlooking the St. Lawrence River. Nice place to visit, but can easily be done in your car and doesn't take more than an hour or so.",
          "If you like history or are in Quebec, then this is a good place to visit. I will probably not be travelling for more than 2 hours to visit this though",
          "This was a lot of fun! A lot to see. Definitely sign up for a tour. Our tour guide was terrific, playing the part with a great sense of humor. Everyone was very helpful! Can be a lot of walking but it is beautiful!",
          "Views are amazing, canons are real, even dates are still showing on most of them on the side - must have been crazy times back in the days, long narrow paths, most of the walls around have been fixed, but you can easily understand the reasoning behind it, and extrapolate the",
          "Grab a loaf of bread, some cheese and a bottle of wine for lunch or dinner here. There are outdoor concerts in the summer. Plenty of history, gardens, cannons and statues. Plus some outstanding views. A great urban oasis.",
          "Basically the park is a large grassy field, but you can get a very nice view of the Quebec Parliament from the Plains of Abraham. It is a well kept park with many walking trails.",
          "I have read about The Plains of Abraham since I was a small boy. General Wolfe and the battle for Quebec was very exciting to me. To see the battlefield and see what the troops had to overcome puts it all into perspective.",
          "Our family enjoys walking so this was ideal. It is so clean and we kept. We opted to do the museums first then walk to the Tower for the audio tour. After that we walked the through the other museum. Interesting history and we enjoyed the park so much that we jogged it in the",
          "This is a very beautiful area in which we walked from our hotel Chateau Laurier Quebec to the Pavilion of the Plains of Abraham which we also visited and saw the Influence of Japanese Art on Western Art (European and US). The exhibition was excellent and very informative.",
          "A nice walk with the family and great time to learn more about the history of Canada. There not a lot of people visiting this site - it could be due to the fees to see the exhibition.",
          "You an spend a short time or a long time here, learning about the historic battle on the Plains of Abraham, or enjoying the beautiful park with it's excellent walking and hiking trails. There were many joggers using the trails, and the 400 step staircase, which takes you down",
          "The park is not that big. So it is very easy to walk around. Although there are arrows for in and out, the in option is not good as it directs to the road without walking path. So the easy way is to go to the side walk marked out. When you reach the pavilion, yon can choose to",
          "I thought this was going to be a Battlefield. It is just a park. Make sure you take the wooden stairs to the bottom and back up though!",
          "More of a historic place than one of beauty but we found that the park is great to stroll through after visiting the Grande Allee then making your way down to the lower part of town. The Joan of Arc garden and statue, the Martello tower, La Citadelle de Quebec and other exhibits",
          "Loved the urban setting of this park. Worth walking around and taking in the sights. It is close to all other attractions",
          "After many years one found a stairway down to the St Laurence River then you can go to a look out point in the river. Special. One can then run up 400 stairs++ and remember Wolfe did it with cannons! Great park for hiking, running and cross country skiing.",
          "Peaceful and green. You have the sensation that a carpet was laid and you must sit on it, bread the smell of the grass and enjoy the view. Do not miss the place, it is just wonderful.",
          "We walked the wall around Old Quebec and came to this park. It was very interesting to see the canons and artillery area as it was years ago.",
          "This is a large open greenspace. You will want to walk this area on a sunny day, and you'll enjoy beautiful views over the lower part of the city and the St. Lawrence river. It also is a good entry point to visit the Citadelle and have a guided tour next. Not suitable for a",
          "A fun place to explore for those who are mobile or have kids. The changing of the guard show is a must see. There are very beautiful views of historic Old Quebec City from the hills.",
          "We took an afternoon walk to the Battlefield Park not too far from the Concordia Hotel. It was so green and beautiful. The garden of Jean d'Arc was magnificent with tulips and other flowers. When we were there we met a group of Canadian with flags to remember this couraguos",
          "The park, when covered in snow like today is a beautiful sight. The canons defending the city also offer a historical glimpse into older times and offer a different perspective of what life used to be like here.",
          "My wife and I went to the Winter Carnival and had a great time despite it being VERY cold, but this carnival is clearly a big part of the city's culture and is very well put on. The park was the site of the majority of the activities and is very spacious and has nice views of",
          "hi, if you like a walk or see a great park, it will take you a while to see it all, be lovely for a picnic, enjoy the history",
          "nice place to walk through, close to all the other sights of old quebec. Lots of history here. Nice spot on a sunny day",
          "A very large park, with plenty of open spaces. Gardens, flowers, fountains, sun and shade. If you like some green spaces, don't miss it.",
          "We had a few hours to spare whilst in Quebec and decided to visit the park and the Discovery Centre. We weren't sure what to expect but we thought that this was a fabulous place to visit. We were in the centre for over two hours. There was so much information and things to look",
          "I had been a very big fan of history especially the eseven years war. For me this was a moment where I was taken to where the most decisive battle of the conflict took place. It was a very powerful time for me. There are beautiful views everywhere. It is so hard to believe this",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the National Battlefields Park Museum, which included the three-theatre presentation, \u201cOdyssey: a Journey through History on the Plains of Abraham.\u201d The presentation, which surveys Qu\u00e9bec City\u2019s history using a focus on the Plains of Abraham, was not only",
          "An easy walk and a peaceful setting now. Good views while walking and usually not too crowded. It covers a large area so do as much or as little as you want.",
          "Very much enjoyed the history lesson provided at the Battlefields Park on the Plains of Abraham. The park is easily walkable and the venues are low cost and high in historic value. Whether you are a Canadian or a American there is a lot of history that is brought forward here",
          "We discovered the park our first day and take a daily jaunt, discovering more each time. This is a great place to stroll or run. The nature trail is very relaxing and so verdant in the summer. Check out the fountains, the views, and the beautiful gardens. My favorite was the St.",
          "I made a tour visit, arranged in the tourism' office, with my wife and I adored. I was lucky to get a young female tourist guide that it was so nice and informative. Look for No\u00e9mie Martin-Chouinard. The day was rainy and my Canon complain a little bit but I got out knowing a",
          "Beautiful park overlooking the water. Great place to spend a quiet afternoon. Lots of history and gorgeous, well-maintained gardens",
          "Very nice view overlooking the Saint Lawrence Got great pictures of the kids standing next to cannons We parked across the street at Laval University, so this park is where we started everyday",
          "Beautifully preserved with abundant signage and informative brochures. Views are breathtaking. Clean and we felt very safe walking the whole length of the park. 5-stars!",
          "This is a real bargain for first time visitors. The bus tour guides, picked up at the Discovery Station inside the park, are humorous, informative and well versed in the history of this famous site.",
          "located just 5 minutes walk from grand allee if you stay in near grand allee quarter.In summer is nice to enjoy greenery and flowers from spring some are still blooming. the path is very nice for walking even a very long walking since the park is very big and we can have a very",
          "Pretty and close to the Old Town. The Jean D'arc little quarter was the prettiest spot we cm upon. Otherwise we were able to enjoy the greenery but we did not see anything very special at all.",
          "We literally stumbled onto this gem! There are great photo opportunities of the st. Lawrence river. There is a walking, running, and biking loop. It is very green and has plenty of benches to relax or enjoy a bite to eat. Im not really into history so if you are not as well",
          "A good sized and well maintained park which sadly doesn't capitalise on the 'battlefield' element. Some small markers but better to visit Plains of Abraham if a visitor",
          "My husband and I visited while on our honeymoon in June. We were first drawn to such a large park in the middle of Old Quebec City and only after reading the plaque did we realize the historic site we had stumbled onto. A lovely park to sit and rest, to watch the world go by.",
          "The 1759 Battle of Quebec took place roughly on the line from Av Briand toward the river. Here you will find markers placed where the regiments clashed.",
          "We happened upon this park on our way from the hotel to the Old City. It was a great place to stop and enjoy the view, as well as read about the history of the area.",
          "My perspective maybe a little bit different, because I was mostly jogging there during our stay in Quebec City. I certainly loved it! Nice beautiful trails, great views, and lots of space!",
          "Great to walk round on a hot day. Lots of grass and seating to enjoy picnics or just to rest and enjoy the views and surroundings. If you enjoy walking you will like this.",
          "It's worth going to the Military Museum (fee) and soak up some history about the plains. The Coles Notes approach is very entertaining and will help you appreciate how important the battles that took place in the historic park.",
          "This was just across the road from where we were staying and we walked into the city several times using the park and to get to the Citadelle. Lots of views of the St Lawrence Seaway and the park itself was beautifully kept.",
          "The view is gorgeous,with lots of benches to sit and reflect. It is hard to imagine the fighting that occurred.",
          "This is a historical sight were the French fought the British. It's beautiful during summer. The battle field and the fort cover a large area. Children would love this place during summer. They can freely run around. I would not recommend visiting this place during Winter or",
          "Go see it! The sights are amazing. A true winter wonderland. Make the trip to the (over priced but fun) Ice Hotel!",
          "There is a great viewing point of Quebec City from here and there is also a lot of interesting history. We went with a guide who gave us a great insight into the history of Quebec.",
          "Battlefields Park is just along St. Lawrence River, covered with green lawns & big trees. It is very hard for morden people to think there was a battle happened in this area. On the north end, it is the La Citadelle; on the south end, you can find Musee National des Beaux-Arts",
          "We went skating here. They ring was great -- we had a great view of the river each time we went around the loop. We also saw people cross country skiing. Nice place.",
          "I found it fitting that this is now used for recreational activities including cross country skiing, jogging and show shoeing.",
          "Day after Christmas, snowy and cold we walked the 300+ stairs through the promenade and through the park. Invigorating experience!",
          "This was a nice place to take a stroll, and enjoy the environment. It was a rainy day, but the flowers in the Joan of Arc Gardens were beautiful. It reminded me of the \"Assiniboine Park\" in Winnipeg, Manitoba.",
          "very charming park and very clean. We arrived in early afternoon and just loved walking, but we were relaxing. Great time.",
          "The tour guides were great, and they do speak English. They were a lot of fun, and very informative. It is within walking distance of the Manoir Victoria.",
          "What we saw was a large open space without explanation of what had happened there in the 18th century. That is done in some nearby museums, but for those of us who don't want too many museum experiences in the middle of summer, it would be good to know what went on at this site.",
          "we did this on our own, walked from the Marriott. More my husbands thing than mine, it was O.K. There is not much open in it at least in October.",
          "What a beautiful park! We took a stroll here to get some panoramic views of the area. The fall colors were spectacular! My son, the war history buff, was able to give us a bit more information about the battle that occurred here & we did read one plaque in the park regarding",
          "This is a beautifully positioned and well-maintained park overlooking the river as only a strategic defense rampart could. Worth the time and great exercise to boot if you circumnavigate the entire expanse!",
          "A bit of a jaunt from Old Quebec where we were staying but worth the effort. The park has wonderful views and a great sense of the historical significance. It is on a bluff and the wind was refreshing. After a great meal, a excellent choice to get some exercise in. If you",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed our leisurely walk through the park. It is well maintained and has many points of interest. The tranquil setting is in stark contrast to the epic battle that was fought there.",
          "This is a great spot for a walk and 'see the views' but the real downside is that there is very very little to explain the events of history and what took place. This is a real pity - irrespective of what side one or lost. In fact - its almost as if its been hidden",
          "Very green with lots of places to sit and take in the views. There is a place to view the river with an unobstructed view that is supposedly the highest point according to our tour guide. Take pictures and enjoy the park.",
          "We walked from the Citadel and it seemed like forever to find the battlefield. It's kind of a shame that the battle that turned the fate of modern Canada is treated so shabbily. Very little marking or explaining what happened here. Sorry to the Quebecois, but just accept it",
          "Unless you are really into history this was mostly a bore. Another battlefield ...where not much of consequence happened.",
          "We took a city tour that brought us through the park. It is big, green, colorful with flowers and looks like a nice location to relax. I noticed picnic tables but not sure about parking. Not sure if there is a fee.",
          "Spent the morning walking around and even then didn't see everything. Marvellous that so much time, effort and money has been spent on preserving this place. Great gardens and pedestrian walkways. Lots of trails and bike paths. If I lived here in would spend a lot of time",
          "If you need a history lesson on why Quebec City was so important visit this site. Very impressive site and views of the St. Lawrence Seeway.",
          "If your into history this is a great place. Huge park with lots of people out. Bike trail is awesome",
          "My family stayed at the L'Hotel du Vieux and I got up and had a great run around this park. It is a wonderful space to explore.",
          "Be sure to make time to do the Discovery Pavilion package - the Abraham bus tour, Martello Tower, and Odyssey show. We really enjoyed ourselves and were both entertained and informed. Our time here was one of the highlights of our trip. The site is a bit hard to find -",
          "Beautiful place! Try to go in the winter during the festival, there are lots of atractions both to children and adults and one of the most amazing firework show I've ever seen.",
          "The Park was verry nice well maintained there was a lot of Cannons.The place was a nice and quiet plave to take a break from all the action. we enjoyed it.",
          "This is a fabulous park to simply wander around in. It was many paved paths, and many field to wander through and/or nap on. It isn't an exciting place, but that wasn't what we were looking for.",
          "You can certainly work off that big breakfast by taking a trail or two. Note, there is a planted area because the park has been designed and arranged by a landscaper, but there is also a natural area of native plants untouched - so ask where that is if you can't find it on your",
          "This park is known by its part in the 7-year war (the first real world war) in the 18th century. It is very hilly with grass on top and more forest towards the bottom part. Great for walking or jogging or strolling with your dog.",
          "We wanted to take advantage of the beautiful weather and lunch al fresco. We visited 2 small grocery stores and then enjoyed a walk to the park setting for a romantic lunch away from the tourists and busy caf\u00e9s. We had already read the stories about the historical significance",
          "Very well done. Congratulations, Parks Canada. Only disappointment was that there was no bus service around the park until July 1! Not great for seniors or the disabled.",
          "Sprawling green grass, open sky, views of the river, nice trees and flowers. Amazing park to walk around in! Would have loved to go bike riding ... wish they had rentals. Definitely worth seeing. One of the highlights of my trip for sure!",
          "We drove this very enormous park where the battle between the French and English happened. There is even a monument on the exact location where General Wolfe (British) is said to have died on the battlefield. The collection of canons was superb, ranging from the really old 1600",
          "The apartment our family rented for our short stay to Quebec City was just across the street from this enormous, beautiful park. It offered a lovely view of the river, and numerous pathes for walking, jogging, or biking. Would also be a perfect place for a picnic on a warm day!",
          "Didn't have much time to have a good look around but I liked the feel of the area nice and tidy and looked after.",
          "beautiful view of the St. Lawrence and this huge park is where the major battle between French and English was fought. Great place for a picnic or to let the kids run free and play some frisbee or fly a kite.",
          "7 May, Some very smart people have put together a fantastic, \"virtual 400-year journey\" relating to the birth of New France. There is a 3 part, very entertaining multimedia presentation as well as uniforms and other historical artifacts that bring this part of Quebec's history",
          "We wandered through this park one afternoon, which we stumbled upon it quite by chance, and were glad we did! We went out walking with no real destination, save lunch, I would now make a point of returning!",
          "Well, you're in old Quebec. Might as well, it's not exactly breathtaking, but still worth your time, it's a 40 minute walk all in all and it offers very nice views over all the city.",
          "Perhaps we've been spoiled by visits to the Normandy Beaches, Verdun and Gettysburg, but there was little interpretive signage here to explain what was certainly a major battle in the War between Britain and France over control of Canada. It's a nice park to be sure but",
          "To discover Quebec city, walking and admiring flowers or people skiing in the middle of the city in winter. Great view of the Citadelle and St-Lawrence River.",
          "We enjoyed a walk on the battlefields. This was a good place to learn about the history of Quebec. Great views too.",

          "I visited the library. Didn't have time to see the jail. Loved the library. Total time warp. Two stories high with wood paneling and a spiral staircase. An actual library. Not much to do other than walk in, admire the view and perhaps do a bit of reading. But worth it. No cost",

          "I enjoyed this tour very much and was charmed to stay and have tea in the 2-story library there. This Georgian building was once a prison, then a college, and now a lending library of English books. The tour guide was equally charming. I was very glad I saw the interior of this",
          "Very sharp that some parts of that building are still authentic to the 1800's. The library part is the most awesome and overall, this is a hidden gem that everyone interested in the Quebec History should go. It's worth it and more. Stop reading this and go see that building. :)",

        "wiki": "Fort Saint-Jean is a fort in the Canadian province of Quebec located on the Richelieu River. The fort was first built in 1666 by soldiers of the Carignan-Sali\u00e8res Regiment and was part of a series of forts built along the Richelieu River. Over the years, it was destroyed and rebuilt several times, but it is, after Quebec City, the military site that has been occupied non-stop for the longest time in Canada. The fort is designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, and it currently houses the Royal Military College of Saint-Jean. The fort has been continually occupied since 1748, and is the core from which the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec grew around. Fort Saint-Jean played a crucial role during the 1775 American invasion of the Province of Quebec.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First fort ===\nIn 1663, the French King Louis XIV decided to take direct command of his New France colony, which had been previously colonized and managed by wealthy merchant associations. As the Iroquois were very often leading punitive expeditions on the New France territories and were continuously trying to steal away the French allies' hunting territories, Louis XIV decided to send the whole Carignan-Sali\u00e8res Regiment to build a series of forts along the Richelieu River and Lake Champlain, which explains why the area was later named the Vall\u00e9e des Forts (literally: the Forts Valley), and to lead a punitive expedition against the Iroquois. The first Fort Saint-Jean was built along the Richelieu River by the Carignan-Sali\u00e8res Regiment in 1666 for that purpose. This first fort is believed to have been a small square-shaped fort with four bastions made of wooden palisades. It was located right after the Chambly rapids, a highly strategic position that allowed the French to monopolize a very good portage location. The French offensive into Iroquois territory was a great success and thus, a peace treaty was signed between the two parties in 1667. In 1672, after several peaceful years, the Governor of the colony decided to abandon several forts that had become useless along the Richelieu River, including Fort Saint-Jean. Because of its strategic location, Fort Saint-Jean was later to be revived, unlike other French forts such as Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Sainte-Anne.\n\n\n=== Second fort ===\nThe second French fort Saint-Jean was built in 1748 because of tensions between France and England arising from the War of the Austrian Succession. It was a fort of two hundred feet by two hundred feet that had four bastions, two of which were made in stone. This fort was an important relay between Montreal and Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, which was located in the south of Lake Champlain, because a road linked fort Saint-Jean to La Prairie and allowed the communications between Montreal and St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to be considerably shorter. The second fort Saint-Jean was given the sympathetic nickname of \"Fort aux Maringouins\" (Mosquitoes Fort) because of the swampy climate of the area. This fort was destroyed by French soldiers in 1760 during the French and Indian War. As there were not enough men left to defend the fort against a three to five thousand-man British army coming up from the Richelieu River to take Montreal, the French decided to abandon the fort and before they left for Montreal, they set fire to it as to not leave it to their enemy. The stone bastions of the fort that survived the fire were afterward used as a relay by the British troops.\n\n\n=== 1760 British fort and the American invasion ===\nBecause of the dangers posed by the thirteen rebellious colonies to the south, the British in 1775 erected a third fort on the site of the previous fort. A year before the Declaration of Independence transformed the rebellious colonies into the United States of America, two small armies of rebels invaded the Province of Quebec in an attempt to defeat the British on Canadian soil and to raise Canadian opposition to royal British rule. Fort Saint-Jean played a vital role in the defence of the Province of Quebec against the Americans; indeed, it was the principal defense of Montreal against General Richard Montgomery\u2019s army, which had planned to use the Richelieu River to reach Montreal, then march to Quebec City. The garrison of Fort Saint-Jean fought valiantly against the American troops during a forty-five-day siege before surrendering to the invaders. The siege of Fort Saint-Jean considerably weakened and slowed the American offensive: Montgomery's expedition arrived at Quebec City early in December instead of mid-October, and only three hundred of his men, out of about two thousand, actually reached Quebec City.Because of bad weather and the weakened state of the few remaining troops, the Americans failed to take Quebec City in their assault on December 31, 1775. After British reinforcements arrived from England the next Spring, the Americans abandoned and burnt the forts, including Fort Saint-Jean, that they had taken north of Lake Champlain. But, fearing a new American invasion, the British reconstructed a strengthened Fort in 1776, adding a series of new ramparts. They also built in Saint-Jean an important shipyard to assemble the shallow-draft boats needed to follow the Americans on Lake Champlain. These boats soon would take part in the Battle of Valcour Island.\n\n\n=== 19th-century fortifications ===\nFort Saint-Jean lost much of its importance after the end of the American War of Independence in 1783 and was only used as a relay during the second American Invasion in 1812\u20131814. However, the Patriot Revolt episodes of 1837\u20131838 convinced the British of the need to fortify again fort Saint-Jean and new buildings were added to the fort. Some of those buildings, built in 1839 by the Royal Engineers, are still standing and being used nowadays on the site.\nAt the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, the fort was mostly used as a training school for several groups and regiments, The Royal Canadian Regiment (then known simply as the Infantry School Corps) and the Royal Canadian Dragoons among them. During the First World War, the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment, who was back then only a battalion, was founded and trained at Fort Saint-Jean before being sent to Europe. After the war, the 22nd battalion became the first officially French-speaking Canadian regiment under the name of the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment (known in English as the Vandoos). Known between the wars as Cavalry Barracks, fort Saint-Jean also served as a garrison for a Squadron and a company of The Royal Canadian Regiment.\n\n\n=== Coll\u00e8ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean (CMR) years ===\n\nIn 1952, the Royal Military College Saint-Jean was created to allow a greater number of French-speaking Canadians to become officers in the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force, thus becoming the first bilingual military college in Canada. Initially, only first- and second-year courses were offered and cadets had to complete the remainder of their education at the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario. Over time, the college began offering third- and fourth-year courses and in 1985, it became accredited to grant its own diploma when it received its own Academic Charter.In 1995, the CMR was closed due to budget cuts and classes were transferred to RMC Kingston. In order to maintain the CMR site and its buildings in good condition, a non-profit body was created, the Corporation du fort Saint-Jean. The \"Campus du Fort Saint-Jean\" then became a commercial and public site. The Corporation du Fort Saint-Jean leased some of its educational facilities to institutions such as the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQ\u00c0M) for their local programmes while also renting out other facilities for short-term events such as banquets, conventions and weddings. Moreover, the House of Commons' Language School was established in the Massey Building, where many federal Members of Parliament came to improve their French. However, the site never completely lost its military educational vocation; preparatory-year cadets and groups of officers continued to follow courses at Fort Saint-Jean.\nIn 2008, the military college was reopened and currently offers classes to preparatory, first- and second-year cadets, although it is no longer a degree-granting institution. However, CMR St-Jean remains a commercial site that is open to public, which is unique in Canada. There are both a museum and a multisport complex (including an ice rink and a swimming pool) located on-site.\n\n\n== Fort Saint Jean Museum ==\nFort Saint-Jean Museum was founded in 1960 as a private collection of artifacts, military objects and historical documents. With the years, the museum expanded its collection and new offers several instructive exhibitions about the site\u2019s rich military past and history. The Museum was first located in the Old Guardhouse built by the Royal Engineer between 1883 and 1889, but was relocated in 2005 to the CMR\u2019s old Protestant Church to better accommodate its exhibition and customers.\nThe Mus\u00e9e du Fort Saint Jean has collected some 2,588 pictures for an online photo album illustrative of the history of Coll\u00e8ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean from 1952 to 1984.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\nIn the early 1980s, Parks Canada led archaeological digs at Fort Saint Jean and discovered on that occasion the foundations of a part of the 1748 French fort and plenty of interesting artifacts of both the French and British Regimes. In collaboration with Fort Saint Jean Museum, the Royal Military College of Saint-Jean and Universit\u00e9 Laval, a five-year-long digging project (2009\u20132013) taking place in the summer at Fort Saint-Jean. Archaeology students for University Laval are doing excavations from mid-July to mid-August in order to find out more about the past of the site.\n\n\n== Features and historical buildings ==\nA metal National Historic Site of Canada plaque at the main gate of the college describing the history of Fort Saint-Jean reads,As a result of the Iroquois wars a first fort was erected at St-Jean by the French in 1666. In 1748 a second fort was built to protect the French colony against British military expeditions coming up the Richelieu. Later on, as a result of the American Revolution, two redoubts were built to protect the now English colony against an American invasion. Following the 1837 uprising a new military complex was built on the site of its predecessors. It is this complex which has served since 1952 as the core of the new Coll\u00e8ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean.\nThe DeLery Building, an academic classroom building, was named after Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de L\u00e9ry, a military engineer who built Fort Saint-Jean in 1748. The Officer\u2019s Mess, the La Galissoni\u00e8re Pavilion, and the Montcalm Pavilion are British buildings that were built in 1839 by the Royal Engineers.Escadron Richelieu uses Cartier Block and Pavillon Lahaie. Pavillons Vanier, DeL\u00e9ry, Dextraze, Massey and the Old Mess are shared. The campus provides state-of-the-art technological support: library, well-equipped laboratories, ample supplies of learning materials, and Internet access.\n\n\n== Designated buildings ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Books ==\n'Les d\u00e9fis du fort Saint-Jean : l'invasion rat\u00e9e des Am\u00e9ricains en 1775' by Jacques Castonguay (Saint-Jean, Qu\u00e9bec : Editions du Richelieu, c1975).

          "A good place to start learning about the military history of Quebec . While the diorama itself is old, the program has been updated with a new light and sound show. Entertaining and educational at the same time.",
          "A short but informative history lesson on the roots of Quebec City and the old fort. Gives you an overall lay of the land, piecing together the surrounding area's items of interest,",
          "This charming small museum tells a gripping story of the history of Quebec City, complete with a colorful lighted diorama that moves the audience through the various battles for the area, including several interactions with American military forces. I had wanted to find out",
          "I went there with a small group of friends and really enjoyed the 30 minutes presentation/reaneactment of the battle of the Plains of Abraham. The show is only $8 and totally worth it.",
          "My friend and I wanted to visit some local museums, and this was on my list because it advertised a \"30 minute light and sound show\", or something along those lines. I expected something like a mild Pink Floyd-esque show from that description, but it was more like an old DIsney",
          "It\u2019s a small museum, but we didn\u2019t regret we got in, because they have a nice and \u00e9ducative projection with light and sound effects. It\u2019s visual and therefore stays in everybody\u2019s memory. We learned ourselves and kids really enjoyed it, besides, kids were free and we paid only",
          "This place has a diorama, sound and light show which was very good, made history come alive. It traced the battles and made them more understandable",
          "The highlight of this museum is a large scale replica of Quebec City during the 1700s and some military figurines representing major battles for the city. While I find the sound and light show to be unique and interesting, I think the models are starting to show their age a bit",
          "As old as this site is getting, I always enjoy the depiction of historical events and appreciate the addition of dynamic lighting to the storytelling. This is a must-see if you want to know what happened in Quebec's history at the Fall of New France.",
          "Went in to see the history, and stayed for the entertaining show about the area and how the wars impacted the city.",
          "It\u2019s a small museum that has an light and audio show of the history of Quebec City. The show is done in French or English. The show uses a 3D model of Quebec City. It was informative.",
          "The diorama really explain the history of the city. Would be a good stop when first getting to town to orient yourselves.",
          "Our boys age 14, 12, and 9 are not usually so keen on museums and listening to history but this was so short and visual that it kept their interest and it left all of us with a good understanding of Quebec City's history.",
          "I feel badly not giving this a better review. It does contain a lot of history, but the show itself doesn't seem to be updated since the 1960's. Pictures of toy soldiers with gun noises added, and puffs of smoke coming from the diorama. Young children may find it entertaining",
          "Overall enjoyed the entire experience, from when you first enter and read all the short clips on the history of the area as you go up the stairs to the Diorama of the battles for Old Quebec.",
          "The multimedia presentation includes a large diorama of the area around Quebec city. It lasts about 20 minutes. When we were there the English version is on the hour and the French version starts on the half hour. The price is fairly minimal. It's a good filler for when you want",
          "I would suggest seeing this exhibit, movie + scale model first as it gives an excellent overview and orientation to the historic city and reasons for its existence. After that I would go to the top floor(s) of the hotel Frontenac across the square close by and look out of any",
          "My family of four, including kids 7 and 11, stopped into this museum after a lunch at Le Chic Shack as part of a Canada vacation including a stay in Quebec City. We were looking for a visual overview of the battle history of Quebec, including the battle of the Plains of",
          "Musee du Fort does an excellent job of putting the history associated with Quebec into perspective. The diorama and the interior are a bit dated and could use some modernizing, but the educational value of the museum is really top-notch. Highly recommended.",
          "We learned of this attraction while dining at Le Chic Shack. The main activity of this attraction is a large diorama of Quebec City and surrounding area that brings the history of Quebec City to life through the use of narration and a light show. Major historic battles and",
          "Passed by Musee du Fort on my way to Plains of Abraham. Did not really went in because when I was there, it was not opened yet.",
          "This was very enjoyable. The show was well done and very informative. Plus, they had some excellent mementos in the gift shop. Take advantage of the discount given between this attraction and the Chic Shack in the same building.",
          "This museum is basically a sound and lights show/video that does an excellent job of describing the major battles fought in Quebec City. The presentation is greatly enhanced by a giant diorama of the city, rivers and environs. As the video explains the events, various parts of",
          "This place recreates the battle for Quebec and Plains of Abraham with the use of a diorama. Interesting to see but not very sophisticated.",
          "We had visited the Chateau and after that tour we were looking for something nearby. The Musee is across the street from the Chateau and their diorama show is 30 minutes long. It does a good job of explaining the military importance of Quebec, especially if you are American and",
          "Such a good overview of Quebec City and it\u2019s history. We were impressed and surprised with the floor model of the city and the sound/light projection. Highly recommend to do this first before other attraction in the city as it will give you a great perspective.",
          "When we walked into the theater and I saw a big diorama, I inwardly winced. But it was surprisingly well done, and very informative.",
          "The Musee du Fort is an audio visual display of the various attacks on Quebec during its history. It is an interesting tale, well told making the most of models, lights and images to bring it to life. Staff were very friendly and knowledgable. If you have a passing interest",
          "Basically, it is not a museum. Rather, a place to watch a movie. It tells the national history about the battles between two armies, one from France, the other from England. The film takes round 30 minutes.",
          "A great beginning if it is your first time in Quebec City. The overall presentation gives you the history of how the city came into being. We did this our first day.",
          "A good explanation of how Quebec was founded and then fought over, but the presentation was a bit dated and not all of the buttons in the seats for the quiz afterwards worked. I did win a water bottle for getting all of the quiz questions correct!",
          "It Is not really a museum. There are no exhibits, just the diorama of the city and surrounding area as it was ca. 1759. They give you a history of the attacks on Quebec City by the British and Americans. Useful as most of us from the U.S. don\u2019t know a lot about Canadian history.",
          "If you're a history buff ,particularly interested in local battles, this might be worth it. Otherwise, it's a snore.",
          "Diorama telling the history of the siege of Quebec and the battle of the Plains of Abraham. A really good introduction to the history of the city. Much more effective at this than the museum dedicated to the story of the battle. In English on the hour when we were there and",
          "It was raining so this was a perfect way to pass 45 minutes. Nice history with a heavy pinch of quebecois pride. It\u2019s a sound and might show explaining the history of Quebec City and the battles between the French and English over the centuries.",
          "Having gone to Quebec City for its winter carnival in February 2018, we visited the Musee due Fort. Following an introduction by a museum employee, there was a thirty-minute sound and light show telling the story of the six sieges of Qu\u00e9bec City, including the famous battle of",
          "We had a few hours left on the morning of our departure from Old Quebec so hubby was intrigued in checking out this museum. It\u2019s right across from Chateau Frontenac, right above Le Chic Shack. Admission is $8.50 per person and includes a brief intro by the tour guide and a",
          "We did not go into this museum, although we appreciated the architecture of the building and its placement on the beautiful rue Saint Anne. If you interested in military history, it is a must as there is a diorama of the city explaining the battles that took place here between",
          "There is a scale model of the city of Quebec and the surrounding area. There is a light and sound show detailing the military attacks and history. It was informative but a little overpriced.",
          "I had been wanting to go to that little fort-like building just across the Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac many times before. Am I glad I did this time!! It's a diorama, a room size model of Quebec City and surroundings and explains very clearly in 25 minutes the history of the main military",
          "Good presentation if you're not familiar with the history of the area. It is a little overpriced $8/adult for a presentation that lasts about 25 minutes.",
          "Because you easily could - this is a small museum about the history of Quebec, especially the military history. And if you just want to see the displays it is free, but you really want to stop in to pay the $8 or so and see the \"sound and light show\". This is a room-sized",
          "This was a great way to start a trip to gain an appreciation of Quebec City. Was nice to be able to put into reference the places we were seeing, from lower town to upper town, the walls and more. The dioramas were neat.",
          "An interesting museum, filled with passion for storytelling. The information about the museum itself and the show is extremely intriguing. Make sure to call head so you know when the showings are and in what languages.",
          "On a cold day, this was a good stop to warm up for awhile. Quebec does not have much of a military history, but this presentation sure tried to make it exciting! Never knew that Benedict Arnold and the colonists tried to take QC. . . .",
          "First of all - access for those with walking difficulties is extremely difficult. Then you have to wait for a presentation in English (or French), when the presentation came it was good - not too simple or too technical. It\u2019s an amazing model.",
          "If you find yourself in upper Old Town on a rainy day, this small museum, in the main square of Upper Old Town (more or less opposite the impressive Chateau Frontenac), is a good place to spend part of it. It has some exhibits about the history of Quebec and Quebec City, but its",
          "I love history and when I visit a new place, I usually take a tour. This Museum is quite unique in that it is a 3 dimensional map with a sound and light show thrown in. I\u2019ve been several times with friends and always enjoy it. It puts the history of the British and French Wars",
          "The model and description of the battles of Quebec City were interesting. There's not much else here, so it was expensive.",
          "Good overview of the history of the wars in Quebec. There is a model that lights up and really helps you understand how the battles players out. Really enjoyed the film and learning about the history",
          "View a panoramic model of the St. Lawrence River and Quebec whish is accompanied by a thirty-minute film and the battles that formed Quebec",
          "We are avid history buffs and looked forward to experiencing the story of Quebec City's early days with a supporting AV experience. I guess we had in mind the Cyclorama style presented in Atlanta, Georgia for the Civil War's battle for Atlanta. This was not it. It's an",
          "This museum offers a paid experience to a history of the battle of the Plaines of Abraham, using a diorama in French and English. It features a sound and light show and lots of information about Quebec history. Guides were good, and the museum is small but effective.",
          "This was one of our first stops during our 5-day Quebec visit, and it certainly paid off. It gives an excellent \"bite sized\" version of Quebec's military history, including both successful and failed attempts at capture. The use of a fairly impressive diorama and light/smoke",
          "This is not a true museum in the sense of having rooms with items of lasting value, procured to be studied and displayed. Instead, it focuses on a sound-and-light presentation about the history of Quebec, highlighting the French occupation and the British attacks. As history",
          "I really enjoyed this little museum. First we got a wonderful lady to give us a tour of the surrounding streets which was very informative. After that we self toured the building itself which again was very well laid out and didn't take to long. If you are looking for a quick",
          "Located above the \"Chic Shack\" burger place is this small \"museum\" which is mainly a large Diorama of the Quebec area. The projections, lighting, sound and special effects (smoke and gunfire from tiny ships and cannons) are really quite good. A very interesting and entertaining",
          "This is a fascinating large-scale sound-and-light diorama production, very worthwhile. It presents Canadian colonial history parallel with that of the US, and gives a very concise story of early Quebec. The show itself is unlike anything I had seen, and I can't think of a more",
          "The museum has a miniature set of the Quebec area during its founding. The presentation, which lasts 30 minutes, is a thorough history lesson on the battles and politics of the founding of the area. Well worth visiting.",
          "It's a \"museum\" in the loosest sense: there is precisely one (1) theater, a small shop in the waiting area, and a few timeline pictures on the walls of the staircase up to the museum (note: it did not seem wheel chair accessible that I could tell, but there may have been an",
          "What a pleasant surprise this was. It doesn't look like much, but this little diorama and its sound and light show was well worth it. I would go there first before visiting the rest of the sites as it gives you a very quick and pointed history of the major battles for the city",
          "Right in plain sight is the Musee du Fort. Everyone sees it right in the middle of the upper town but how many actually go in? We've been visiting Quebec for years and never did until this time. They have a FANTASTIC animated diorama that lays out the history of Quebec City.",
          "I couldn't rate this museum more highly. It is a 30 minute presentation using a diorama which depicts exactly what happened in Quebec's history.",
          "Some other reviewers have disparaged this museum, however as a history buff generally familiar with a couple of the sieges of Quebec, I learned much that was new. The diorama effectively communicates the different confrontations that occurred here, especially those of 1759/60.",
          "It is an auditorium style film and model of the area (with lights and sound effects). This gave a good review of the history of Quebec and the battles between the French and English. We saw late into our visit to the town - in hindsight we would have done this visit first to",
          "The Musee Du Fort is a sound and light presentation. It gives the military history of Quebec. The presentation was well done.",
          "Great presentation and fun way to learn about Quebec history .very friendly staff and good value for money",
          "Not sure we would have visited this had we not had a rainy day. The presentation is entertaining, and you do get a good overview of the history of the City of Quebec from a military perspective; but there are other, better places to get this same information. There is also a",
          "We attended the museum as a preliminary to visiting the Citadel. It was worth the time. It provides an overview and time line of the history of Quebec. The staff was excellent .",
          "I remember having visiting the Musee du Fort as a kid during my Grade 8 school trip. I was curious to see that it was still in operation and wanted to bring my own family. The show has obviously been modernized but hasn't lost any of its relevance. We visited on our first day",
          "You enter in off the street and walk up about 10 stairs. You pay at the top in the TINY gift shop. You walk forward into the (about 40 seats) theater. There is a large display with the ships/river/forts. The video/display was more engaging as lights would be lit up on the",
          "This museum brings Quebecs history into reality. You sit in front of a model of the area and with a narrative and spot lights it shows the history of the battles between the French and English since the 16th century. It is a must visit",
          "Quite an unusual use of a model of the old City and the surrounding plains and river, including yes, toy solders and model ships. They don't have a lot of actual artifacts and displays, there is some literature available and information wall time lines. The main reason to go is",
          "Well worth the admission fee of $7 for seniors ($8.50 other to see the half hour presentation in this theater setting. It is a sound & light show of military history of Quebec City, There is a giant model with special effects built by a husband and wife team. Sows alternate",
          "Good place to start out to understand the military history of Quebec City. Multimedia with film, sound and display.",
          "Fantastic diorama when special effects that are part of a movie. The movie goes through the history of the founding of the Quebec settlement and all the different battles that took place. It is only 30 minutes but very informative and very nicely integrated with the diorama and",
          "This is the perfect thing to do first, it gives an excellent overview of the history of Quebec City and the model is really well done. Timings do vary though, dependent on school groups. Well worth doing.",
          "Small, unassuming, and doesn't appear in a lot of guidebooks. We went to see the 30-minute light/diorama show on the advice of a friend, and didn't regret it! In 30 minutes, the history of Quebec City was told in dramatic fashion, and easy to follow even for kids. This was a",
          "This little museum condensed hundreds of years of history into a 1/2 hour video/diorama concisely explaining the major battles and military history of Quebec City. This should be your first stop in Quebec City - it puts everything else into perspective.",
          "Do Not underestimate this Museum because of its size. In a matter of 35 minutes they manage to put a proper perspective on everything else you will see or do while in Quebec City. Their visual and narrative presentation of the Historic battles and those who were involved is the",
          "If you are a history buff this museum should be on your list of things to see in Quebec City. The main feature is an audio visual diorama about the military history of early Quebec. The conflicts between the French, British and early American colonial forces is cleverly",
          "The main item in this museum it a 20 minute slideshow with model of Quebec and St. Lawrence river explaining the various wars an conflicts in Quebec history. The show was excellent, however not much else to see.",
          "Mainly a big diorama and 30 minute video on the founding of Quebec and Quebec City. Focus is on the various battles over the years starting in the 1600's to take or try and take Quebec City. Good, entertaining history lesson.",
          "Very interesting and a very good starting place to begin your visit of Quebec. The museum is very small, but the diorama presentation will give you a very good idea of the history of Quebec and Canada too.",
          "This interesting historical presentation is best viewed after reading the story of its own history in the waiting room. The construction of the basic structure and the gathering of the history to form the background is very informative. Young folk who are used to video games",
          "The idea of this museum was great -- it brings to life some of the military history of Quebec City. This is an auditorium with a diorama with embedded lights, smoke (like from an electric train), a curved back wall for projection, and spotlights (a middle one was burned out).",
          "There are so many other better things to do in Quebec City. We had horrible weather - my suggestion, go inside and have a leisurely meal instead. The hot chocolate at the restaurant under the museum was amazing!!!",
          "Musee du Fort takes one on an extraordinary journey in time with a sound and light show that recounts the military history (six sieges in total including the battle of the Plains of Abraham) of Quebec City. A giant (400 square feet) model of the region of Quebec in 1750 helps",
          "The Musee du Fort is a multi-media presentation about the critical Battle of the Plains of Abraham in the fall of 1759, won by the British, as you'll learn, because it was the British reinforcements that arrived before the French the following spring. Both the French General",
          "Very young children may not be interested, but my husband and I and our daughter (who's 9) liked the presentation of the movie & diorama. Very informative!!",
          "I did enjoy this relatively simple diarama of the battle for Quebec City that we were all told about at school in Britain in the 1950s as it was such an important event in the history of the British Empire and north America.",
          "This is a 30 minute video that runs every hour in English and every hour in French. They have a cool replica model that is used to tell the story of Quebec's battle history. Worth the 8.00 admission, especially on a cold day!",
          "This is a must-do for all military history buffs. The main attraction is not a \"museum\" at all ~ but a well-done diaroma & narrative with special effects ~ a condensed version of the 6 battles fought in & around Quebec City during the mid-1800s. A dramatic overview of how",
          "The museum consists mainly of a large 3D map of Quebec covered in figures and ships. The map is accompanied by a movie that tells the story of Quebec City's military history. My girlfriend arrived at the museum knowing nothing about the city's history and learned a great",
          "A lot better than expected. The show alternates in French and English, with special effects and clever lighting. It is on the first floor up and worth the entry fee.",
          "This museum looks indeed a bit like a little fortress, wonderful architecture. Inside you'll find a miniature battle field around historical Quebec, and there will be a light and sound show of a half hour. Fun for children.",
          "Where else will you find a narrated wide screen slide show with a 3D model set up to play in sync with the show. Yes, it is not ultra high tech not modern but I can guarantee you will not see anything like this anywhere else, it only takes a half hour and you will learn all",
          "It can be easily missed but shouldn't be. It is very reasonable at 6.95 for seniors and 5 dollars for students. The 45 minute presentation is unique by using a diorama and very informative. It was highly interesting for me as my ancestors fought at the Battle of the Plains of",
          "I don't think this was worth the time taken out of my one day of tourism. This was a 30 min. film which was just ok. On the other hand, it did give some perspective of the history of the city. Probably the first thing you should see before touring the town.",
          "A tour guide recommended this place as we were very interested to here about the French & English colonial history of Quebec - the museum runs a video & diorama combination show which visually helps explain the military events that shaped the region and later the country.",
          "The light and media show provided an excellent view of local history. Displays supplemented the show.",
          "I loved this history of the battles in and around Quebec. It is well done using a unique light and video model of the battle areas in the defense of Quebec. The model of the land and the river seems accurate and realistic and gives a good feel to the difficulties faced by the",

          "The main (pretty much only) part of this museum is a \"show\" (which is like a film you'd see in elementary school history along with a light-up diorama) which tells the same story as all the other museums in Old Quebec. If you haven't visited the others & heard the story",
          "This little museum was up a small staircase and easy to miss. Not too much in the lobby area, but behind the doors was a wonderful little theatre that treats you to a visual/audio history of the Quebec area. It was very informative if you're interested in history. Not a great",
          "Excellent overview of the history of Quebec City and all the key battles between the French and the British. Uses both a movie and a diorama that makes the information come alive. Makes touring the arae more meaningful.",
          "A very good, brief, run through the military history of Quebec in diorama form. Well explained and entertaining. Wouldn't suit toddlers but older children would enjoy it",
          "There's little there but a movie show to see. I'd pass it up if I were you.There are better places to spend money.",
          "I loved this museum. The history of the battles in Quebec is so well done using an amazing model of the areas under siege. The topography of the land and the river is accurate, so it is easy to get a full picture of how and where the battles took place. The model also includes",
          "You must see this to get the real history of what happened in the area. It is inexpensive and good for the whole family",
          "This is an awesome short presentation of the history of invasions on Quebec city. It's part video and part diorama/light show. It was very well presented and we were so enthralled the 30 minutes was over before we knew it. My tip would be to sit in the front row if possible.",
          "This is the only museum I went to during my visit. I didn't have much time to spare and it was the only place that was written up in the tourism guide as a really exciting, must do activity, so I decided to go. The museum is literally a series of interpretive panels on a",
          "What a wonderful museum this is! Located right next door to the tourist information centre it's hard to miss. It has a half hour sound and light show, alternating between English and French, which explains Quebec and its history well. I learned a lot! I went there on my third",
          "I thought this was a perfect way to get a really great general overview of the history of Quebec City. From here, your exploration of the inside and outside of this walled city will make a lot more sense.",
          "I was looking for some place that gave a good description of the battles of Quebec. The museum at the Plains of Abraham did not, nor did the musee de civilization. This is the place to go if you want a vivid and understandable explanation of the 1759 battle and several others.",
          "The Mus\u00e9e du Fort is excellent. The history of Quebec's battles with primarily England and then the US, is made clear with this 25 minute multimedia presentation. You sit in a small comfortable theatre. A narrated movie works runs in tandem with the large diorama in front of",
          "Even before you do the Citadelle or Old Town, do this small theatre stop. Its an excellent diorama - a static display with sections highlighted during the audio presentation. It has French and English presentations. I don't know how the French version is done, but by the end",
          "Our guide on a free walking tour had recommended this place to us. If you visit the Musee de Civilization, you can get a 20% discount here. It was a small museum like others have said but since I am a history teacher, it was a multimedia presentation on Quebec's history and",

          "This museum is really a 30 min show about the military history of Quebec, using a model, sounds, lights, and a video screen. The topic was interesting, and they did a good job for what they were trying to convey, even if it was a little cheesy. It is not expensive, $8 CAD for",

          "We enjoyed this museum and its show telling the story of the various battles for Quebec. It was nice to get an overview of the region and understand the history of the walled city and its people. It's not expensive and takes about 30 minutes.",
          "This small museum in the centre of Quebec city is a great way to learn about the battle on the Plains of Abraham between the French and the English in 1759. They have a live commentator as well as a large diorama and a video which demonstrates how the battle occurred. We had",

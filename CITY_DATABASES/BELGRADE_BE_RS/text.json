        "wiki": "Belgrade ( BEL-grayd; Serbian: Beograd / \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, lit. 'White City', pronounced [be\u01d2\u0261rad] (listen); names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of Serbia. It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula. Nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade, a quarter of the total population of Serbia.One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vin\u010da culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and, after 279 BC, Celts settled the city, naming it Singid\u016bn. It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284. Belgrade served as capital of the Serbian Despotate during the reign of Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, and then his successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the Ottoman Empire during the siege in 1456 have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars. \nIn the period after the Serbian Revolution, Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when it was attached to the city, due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming the part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes after World War I. Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia from its creation in 1918 to its dissolution in 2006. In a fatally strategic position, the city has been battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times, being bombed five times and besieged many times.Being Serbia's primate city, Belgrade has special administrative status within Serbia. It is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and government ministries, as well as home of almost all of the largest Serbian companies, media, and scientific institutions. Belgrade is classified as a Beta-Global City. The city is home to the Clinical Centre of Serbia, one of the hospital complexes with the largest capacity in the world, and the Church of Saint Sava, one of the largest Orthodox church buildings. Belgrade hosted major international events such as the first Non-Aligned Movement Summit (1961), the first major gathering of the OSCE (1977\u20131978), Eurovision Song Contest (2008), as well as sports events such as the first FINA World Aquatics Championships (1973), UEFA Euro (1976), Summer Universiade (2009) and EuroBasket three-times.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nChipped stone tools found in Zemun show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools are of Mousterian industry\u2014belonging to Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered near the area, indicating some settlement between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic Star\u010devo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Star\u010devo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Star\u010devo. The Star\u010devo culture was succeeded by the Vin\u010da culture (5500\u20134500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Star\u010devo settlements and also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo). The Vin\u010da culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe. Also associated with the Vin\u010da culture are anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vin\u010da, the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe, and a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans known as the Old European script, which dates back to around 5300 BC. Within the city proper, on Cetinjska Street, a skull of a Paleolithic human was discovered in 1890. The skull is dated to before 5000 BC.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nEvidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from a variety of ancient myths and legends. The ridge overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, for example, has been identified as one of the places in the story of Jason and the Argonauts. In the time of antiquity, too, the area was populated by Paleo-Balkan tribes, including the Thracians and the Dacians, who ruled much of Belgrade's surroundings. Specifically, Belgrade was at one point inhabited by the Thraco-Dacian tribe Singi; following Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci wrested the city from their hands, naming it Singid\u016bn (d|\u016bn, fortress). In 34\u201333 BC, the Roman army, led by Silanus, reached Belgrade. It became the romanised Singidunum in the 1st century AD and, by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a municipium by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged colonia (the highest city class) by the end of the century. While the first Christian Emperor of Rome \u2014Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great\u2014was born in the territory of Naissus to the city's south, Roman Christianity's champion, Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), was born in Singidunum. Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate. In 395 AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun); the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 442, the area was ravaged by Attila the Hun. In 471, it was taken by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, who continued into Italy. As the Ostrogoths left, another Germanic tribe, the Gepids, invaded the city. In 539 it was retaken by the Byzantines. In 577, some 100,000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum, pillaging cities and more permanently settling the region. The Avars, under Bayan I, conquered the whole region and its new Slavic population by 582. Following Byzantine reconquest, the Byzantine chronicle De Administrando Imperio mentions the White Serbs, who had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home, asking the strategos for lands; they received provinces in the west, towards the Adriatic, which they would rule as subjects to Heraclius (610\u2013641). In 829, Khan Omurtag was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire.The first record of the name Belograd appeared on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal missive to Bulgarian ruler Boris I. This name would appear in several variants: Alba Bulgarica in Latin, Griechisch Weissenburg in High German, N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, and Castelbianco in Venetian, among other names, all variations of 'white fortress'. For about four centuries, the city would become a battleground between the Byzantine Empire, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and the Bulgarian Empire. Basil II (976\u20131025) installed a garrison in Belgrade. The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade, but, while passing through during the Third Crusade, Frederick Barbarossa and his 190,000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins.\nKing Stefan Dragutin (r. 1276\u20131282) received Belgrade from his father-in-law, Stephen V of Hungary, in 1284, and it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Syrmia, a vassal state to the Kingdom of Hungary. Dragutin (Hungarian: Dragutin Istv\u00e1n) is regarded as the first Serbian king to rule over Belgrade.Following the battles of Maritsa (1371) and Kosovo field (1389), Moravian Serbia, to Belgrade's south, began to fall to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe northern sections of what is now Serbia persisted as the Serbian Despotate, with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, the son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107. Lazarevi\u0107 built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and the west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist Ottoman conquest for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 people.In 1427, Stefan's successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107, returning Belgrade to the Hungarian king, made Smederevo his new capital. Even though the Ottomans had captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456. As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule and Austrian invasions ===\n\nSeven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by Suleiman the Magnificent, 250,000 Turkish soldiers, and over 100 ships. Subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest. Belgrade was made the seat of the Pashalik of Belgrade (also known as the Sanjak of Smederevo), and quickly became the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople. Ottoman rule introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, and the city was resurrected\u2014now by Oriental influences. In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vra\u010dar plateau; in the 20th century, the church of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.Occupied by the Habsburgs three times (1688\u20131690, 1717\u20131739, 1789\u20131791), headed by the Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy, and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon, respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time. During this period, the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations, in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by two Serbian Patriarchs, retreated together with the Austrian soldiers into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's Vojvodina and Slavonia.\n\n\n=== Principality of Serbia ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population. Traces of Ottoman rule and architecture\u2014such as mosques and bazaars, were to remain a prominent part of Belgrade's townscape into the 19th century; several decades, even, after Serbia was granted autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.During the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans. After the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Serbia achieved some sort of sovereignty, which was formally recognised by the Porte in 1830.The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of neoclassicist and baroque buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by St Michael's Cathedral (Serbian: Saborna crkva), completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular Romanticism, along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an eclecticist style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.\n\nIn 1841, Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 moved the capital of the Principality of Serbia from Kragujevac to Belgrade. During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (mahalas). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pa\u0161ina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pa\u0161ina, Bajram-begova and Laz Had\u017ei-Mahmudova. Following the \u010cukur Fountain incident, Belgrade was bombed by the Ottomans.On 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from Kalemegdan. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's de facto independence dates from this event. In the following years, urban planner Emilijan Josimovi\u0107 had a significant impact on Belgrade. He conceptualised a regulation plan for the city in 1867, in which he proposed the replacement of the town's crooked streets with a grid plan. Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimovi\u0107's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul\u2014the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia de jure still belonged\u2014underwent similar changes.In May 1868, knez Mihailo was assassinated with his cousin Anka Konstantinovi\u0107 while riding in a carriage in his country residence.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Serbia ===\n\nWith the Principality's full independence in 1878 and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly. Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to Ni\u0161, Serbia's second city. In 1900, the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants (at the time Serbia numbered 2.5 million). Still, by 1905, the population had grown to more than 80,000 and, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, disregarding Zemun, which still belonged to Austria-Hungary.The first-ever projection of motion pictures in the Balkans and Central Europe was held in Belgrade in June 1896 by Andr\u00e9 Carr, a representative of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers. He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have not been preserved. The first permanent cinema was opened in 1909 in Belgrade.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nThe First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. Austro-Hungarian monitors shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the Austro-Hungarian Army under General Oskar Potiorek on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by Serbian troops under Marshal Radomir Putnik. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, starting on 6 October 1915, Belgrade fell to German and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen on 9 October of the same year. The city was liberated by Serbian and French troops on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey of France and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Belgrade, decimated as a front-line city, lost the title of largest city in the Kingdom to Subotica for some time.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n\nAfter the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom was split into banovinas and Belgrade, together with Zemun and Pan\u010devo, formed a separate administrative unit.During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (with the inclusion of Zemun), and to 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in 1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. The Pan\u010devo Bridge, which crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935, while King Alexander Bridge over the Sava was opened in 1934. On 3 September 1939 the first Belgrade Grand Prix, the last Grand Prix motor racing race before the outbreak of World War II, was held around the Belgrade Fortress and was followed by 80,000 spectators. The winner was Tazio Nuvolari.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 25 March 1941, the government of regent Crown Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'\u00e9tat led by Air Force commander General Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107, who proclaimed King Peter II to be of age to rule the realm. As a result, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941, killing up to 2,274 people. Yugoslavia was then invaded by German, Italian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian forces. Belgrade was captured by subterfuge, with six German soldiers led by their officer Fritz Klingenberg feigning threatening size, forcing the city to capitulate. Belgrade was more directly occupied by the German Army in the same month and became the seat of the puppet Nedi\u0107 regime, headed by its namesake general. Some of today's parts of Belgrade were incorporated in the Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslavia, another puppet state, where Ustashe regime  carried out the Genocide of Serbs.During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz B\u00f6hme, the German Military Governor of Serbia. B\u00f6hme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. Belgrade became the first city in Europe to be declared by the Nazi occupation forces to be Judenfrei. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major \u017darko Todorovi\u0107 from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.Just like Rotterdam, which was devastated twice by both German and Allied bombing, Belgrade was bombed once more during World War II, this time by the Allies on 16 April 1944, killing at least 1,100 people. This bombing fell on the Orthodox Christian Easter. Most of the city remained under German occupation until 20 October 1944, when it was liberated by the Red Army and the Communist Yugoslav Partisans. On 29 November 1945, Marshal Josip Broz Tito proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade (later to be renamed to Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 7 April 1963). Higher estimates from the former secret police place the victim count of political persecutions in Belgrade at 10,000.\n\n\n=== Socialist Yugoslavia ===\nWhen the war ended, the city was left with 11,500 demolished housing units. During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the renewed Yugoslavia, developing as a major industrial centre. In 1948, construction of New Belgrade started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of Non-Aligned Countries was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built. In 1968, major student protests led to several street clashes between students and the police.In 1972, Belgrade faced smallpox outbreak, the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe since World War II. Between October 1977 and March 1978, the city hosted the first major gathering of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe with the aim of implementing the Helsinki Accords from, while in 1980 Belgrade hosted the UNESCO General Conference. Josip Broz Tito died in May 1980 and his funeral in Belgrade was attended by high officials and state delegations from 128 of the 154 members of the United Nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain, based on which it became one of the largest funerals in history.\n\n\n=== Breakup of Yugoslavia ===\n\nOn 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 were held in the city against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets to restore order. Many anti-war protests were held in Belgrade, while the most massive protests was dedicated to solidarity with the victims from the besieged Sarajevo. Further anti-government protests were held in Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud in local elections. These protests brought Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who did not belong to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia.In 1999, during the Kosovo War, NATO bombings caused damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were various ministry buildings, the RTS building, hospitals, Hotel Jugoslavija, the Central Committee building, Avala Tower, and the Chinese embassy. After the Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe, while more than third settled in Belgrade.After the 2000 presidential elections, Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people on the streets. These demonstrations resulted in the ousting of president Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as a part of the Otpor! movement.\n\n\n=== Modern Belgrade ===\n\nIn 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, an urban renewal project, was initiated by the Government of Serbia and its Emirati partner, Eagle Hills Properties. Aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy, the project hopes to revitalise the Sava amphitheatre, a neglected expanse on the right bank of the Sava river between the Belgrade Fair and the former Belgrade Main railway station. Around \u20ac3.5 billion will be jointly invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and the envisioned 'Belgrade Tower'. The project is, however, quite controversial\u2014there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, and its architecture's arguable lack of harmony with the rest of the city.\nApart from Belgrade Waterfront, the city is under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of Novi Beograd, where many apartment and office buildings are under construction to support the burgeoning IT sector, now one of Serbia's largest economic players.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBelgrade lies 116.75 metres (383.0 ft) above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, Kalemegdan, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, New Belgrade was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like Krnja\u010da, Kote\u017e and Bor\u010da, also merged with the city, while Pan\u010devo, a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of 360 square kilometres (140 sq mi), while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223 km2 (1,244 sq mi).\nOn the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m (994 ft). The mountains of Avala (511 m (1,677 ft)) and Kosmaj (628 m (2,060 ft)) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus.One of the characteristics of the city terrain is mass wasting. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. Downhill creeps are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the clay or loam soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in Karaburma, Zvezdara, Vi\u0161njica, Vin\u010da and Ritopek, in the Danube valley, and Umka, and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire Terazije slope above the Sava (Kalemegdan, Savamala), which can be seen by the inclination of the Pobednik monument and the tower of the Cathedral Church, and the Vo\u017edovac section, between Banjica and Autokomanda.\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardo\u0161, \u0106ukovac and Kalvarija. \n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBelgrade has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), according to K\u00f6ppen climate classification, with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from 1.4 \u00b0C (34.5 \u00b0F) in January to 23.0 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.5 \u00b0C (54.5 \u00b0F). There are, on average, 31 days a year when the temperature is above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and 95 days when the temperature is above 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Belgrade receives about 691 millimetres (27 in) of precipitation a year, with late spring being wettest. The average annual number of sunny hours is 2,112.\nThe highest officially recorded temperature in Belgrade was 43.6 \u00b0C (110.5 \u00b0F) on 24 July 2007, while on the other end, the lowest temperature was \u221226.2 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) on 10 January 1893.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nBelgrade is a separate territorial unit in Serbia, with its own autonomous city authority. The Assembly of the City of Belgrade has 110 members, elected on four-year terms. A 13-member City Council, elected by the Assembly and presided over by the mayor and his deputy, has the control and supervision of the city administration, which manages day-to-day administrative affairs. It is divided into 14 Secretariats, each having a specific portfolio such as traffic or health care, and several professional services, agencies and institutes.The 2014 Belgrade City Assembly election was won by the Serbian Progressive Party, which formed a ruling coalition with the Socialist Party of Serbia. This election ended the long-time rule of the Democratic Party, which was in power from 2004 to 2013.As the capital city, Belgrade is seat of all Serbian state authorities \u2013 executive, legislative, judiciary, and the headquarters of almost all national political parties as well as 75 diplomatic missions. This includes the National Assembly, the Presidency, the Government of Serbia and all the ministries, Supreme Court of Cassation and the Constitutional Court.\n\n\n=== Municipalities ===\n\nThe city is divided into 17 municipalities.

The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions.\n\nThe oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish t\u00fcrbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dor\u0107ol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Serbo-Byzantine Revival are present in buildings such as House of Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gra\u010danica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.In the socialist period, housing was built quickly and cheaply for the huge influx of people fleeing the countryside following World War II, sometimes resulting in the brutalist architecture of the blokovi ('blocks') of New Belgrade; a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Trade Union Hall. However, in the mid-1950s, modernist trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture.\nBelgrade has the second oldest sewer system in Europe.

Many criticised the move at the time due to the cost and the size of the building, and it soon became the gathering point of the Principality's wealthiest citizens. Colloquially, the building was also referred to as the staro zdanje, or the 'old edifice'. It remained a hotel until 1903 before being demolished in 1938. After the staro zdanje, numerous hotels were built in the second half of the 19th century: Nacional and Grand, also in Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac, Srpski Kralj, Srpska Kruna, Gr\u010dka Kraljica near Kalemegdan, Balkan and Pariz in Terazije, London, etc.As Belgrade became connected via steamboats and railway (after 1884), the number of visitors grew and new hotels were open with the ever luxurious commodities. In Savamala, the hotels Bosna and Bristol were opened. Other hotels included Solun and Orient, which was built near the Financial Park. Tourists which arrived by the Orient Express mostly stayed at the Petrograd Hotel in Wilson Square. Hotel Srpski Kralj, at the corner of Uzun Mirkova and Pariska Street was considered the best hotel in Belgrade during the Interbellum.

          "I love walking here and taking in all the history. When I was a young girl my grandfather took us there for walks and to talk/teach us Serbian history. I recommend you take a walk there when it's dark, it's so beautiful with all the lights. You have nothing to lose just gain",

          "The fortress was free for us to walk around and take in the history. The views of the river from the top were spectacular & the military be chile\u2019s a reminder of the more recent history in Serbia. A walk from the town centre this is a must for every visitor. The lack of anyone",
          "First visited the fortress on a walking tour of Belgrade, certainly a huge site, fairly well preserved, with of course commanding views of the rivers Danube and Sava. Rather vaguely signposted, and eventually no doubt, more English signage will be installed. Returned on another",

          "The fortress of Belgrad is conviniently located next tol old town. It has great views over the Donau and Sava rivers, and the other side of town - when the weather or smokey fog allows. There are a couple of coffe bars and terraces in the area, as well as a bit sad looking",
          "Really nice area to walk around and explore. Great views to many areas across the city. The only negative is lots of litter like beer bottles, cigarettes, plastic etc. It would be really great if this could get cleaned up.",
          "Do not forget to spend the 50 cents and climb the inside stairs then up the high point of the fort overlooking the Danube river. from there you can take a panoramic picture covering the full city and area. The park that includes the is the fortess is close to many outdoor",

          "Kids would love the Dinosaur park. We saw many children with their parents walking through the fortress. It was in a large shady park, beautifully maintained. There is a lot of walking. I didn't notice any elevators, so keep that in mind, if walking is a problem There is",
          "It is huge! You need plenty of time for this one! The views out over the Danube and Sava rivers is stunning. Loads to do or just walk round the extensive walls and gardens within. So many different nooks and crannies to explore. Didnt get the chance to go into the medieval",
          "What makes the Kalemegdan Fortress an easy visit, next to its historical significance for the city, region and country is it close proximity to the old town. You can basically just stroll over in one go and combine for a wonderful day of Serbian culture. We enjoyed our walk and",
          "A big fortress and green garden. Fantastic for a stroll. Especially liked the two churches next to the terrace restaurant.",

        "wiki": "Republic Square or Square of the Republic (Serbian: \u0422\u0440\u0433 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0435 / Trg republike) is one of the central town squares and an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, located in the Stari Grad municipality. It is the site of some of Belgrade's most recognizable public buildings, including the National Museum, the National Theatre and the statue of Prince Michael.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe square is located less than 100 meters away from Terazije, designated center of Belgrade, to which it is connected by the streets of Kolar\u010deva (traffic) and Knez Mihailova (pedestrian zone). Many people erroneously consider Square of the Republic to be the center of the city. Through Vasina street it is connected to the fortress and park of Kalemegdan to the west and through Sremska street it is connected to the neighborhood of Zeleni Venac and further to Novi Beograd. It also borders the neighborhoods of Stari Grad and Dor\u0107ol, to the north. Today, it makes one of the local communities within Belgrade with a population of 2,360 in 2002.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name of the square has been the subject of much debate in the city. Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 of the Serbian Renewal Movement suggested the square be renamed to Freedom Square (\u0422\u0440\u0433 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u0435 / Trg Slobode) after pro-democracy demonstrations were held in the square to oust Slobodan Milosevi\u0107 on 9 March 1991, during the 1991 protests in Belgrade. Most recently, a group of theater academics suggested the square's original name Theater Square (\u041f\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0448\u043d\u0438 \u0422\u0440\u0433 / Pozori\u0161ni trg) be returned.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nThe Celtic and Roman predecessor of Belgrade was Singidunum. Castrum occupied part of today's Belgrade Fortress but the civilian zone spread from the Kralja Petra Street, over the both Sava and Danube slopes, till Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac, extending in a series of necropolises from Republic Square, along the Bulevar kralja Aleksandra all the way to the Mali Mokri Lug. Necropolis at Republic Square contained a well-shaped graves from the 1st century AD. In general, the largest section of the civilian settlement was situated between the modern Simina (Dor\u0107ol) and Brankova streets (Zeleni Venac, Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac), and the Republic Square.During the digging of the foundations for the Monument to Prince Michael in 1882, tombs from different periods of Roman rule were discovered. One tomb was made from bricks, and there were 13 circular and 2 rectangle grave pits. Some of them are \"well-tombs\", named so because they are more than 10 m (33 ft) deep. The \"well-tombs\" are rare in these areas and it is believed that the custom arrived from Gaul. The brick tomb, which contained rushlight, was discovered close to the \u010cika Ljubina Street, while the other pits were where the monument is today. The materials found in the tombs include pottery fragments and vessels, pieces of terracotta and stone statues, fan-shaped floor tiles, bronze and bone needles, bricks, rushlights, etc. The pits were filled with ashes and contained animal bones. Coins and bronze rings, parts of the armor, have also been discovered. These \"well-tombs\" are considered to be the oldest part of the vast Singidunum necropolis, originating from c.100 AD, while the brick tomb is dated to c.400 and some of its bricks have a stamp of the Legio IV Flavia Felix. The entire square area belongs to the Archaeological Site of Singidunum, which was declared a protected zone on 30 June 1964. During the 2018\u20132019 renovation, two additional, though devastated tombs were discovered.\n\n\n=== W\u00fcrttemberg Gate ===\n\nThe W\u00fcrttemberg Gate was built in 1725 by the Austrians, during their occupation of northern Serbia from 1717 to 1739. It predated the construction of the protective trench built on the orders by the Generalissimo Ernst Gideon von Laudon. It was one of the four gates which lead outside of the fortress and was part of the fortification's outer walls. The gate was a typical baroque gate of its day. It was designed by Nicolas Doxat, who renovated the entire fortress during the Austrian period. His task was to project the new walls and ramparts system around the city, to develop a completely new grid of streets and the transform Belgrade into the typical baroque town. The final completed section of the inner fortified system was the W\u00fcrttemberg Gate. Other three gates were located in the modern Cara Du\u0161ana Street (Imperial Gate), Pop-Lukina Street and along the Sava river.The basic layout of the entire fortified system was finished by 1737. That year, another Austro-Turkish war broke out and the works on further fortification were stopped. After being defeated in the Battle of Grocka in July 1739, Austria agreed to sign a truce. As stipulated by the Treaty of Belgrade in 1739, Austrians had to withdraw and they insisted to demolish all objects and fortifications within the Belgrade Fortress, built in the period of their rule. In June 1740, on a boat in the middle of the Sava river, which now became border between Austria and Ottoman Empire again, an agreement was signed and the fortress, including the gates was demolished. The remains of the gate were found during the 1958 digging of the foundations for the \"Press House\". The remains of the walls and foundations were re-discovered during the 2018 reconstruction and showed no evidence of additional works and reconstructions after it was built.The gate was named after Charles Alexander, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg, who was Austrian governor of occupied Serbia from 1720 to 1733. His court and military barrack were located right behind the gate, at the very entrance into the fort. The National Theatre is today located on that spot. From descriptions, it is known that it was much larger and more monumental than the latter Stambol Gate, but there are no surviving illustrations so the exact appearance of the gate is unknown.\n\n\n=== Stambol Gate ===\n\nAfter entering Belgrade in 1740, the Ottomans found completely destroyed ramparts. They walled the remaining earthen defensive mounds with palisades. The Ottomans decided to build only one gate, while on the other access points they set \u010dardaks. They didn't use the foundations of the demolished W\u00fcrttemberg Gate, but built their gate a bit to the right, where the modern Vasina Street is, so the gate occupied the area between the modern National Theatre and the Monument to Prince Michael.During the Austrian occupation, generalissimo Laudon ordered a vast effort to fortify the city, which included the defensive trench which encircled a wider Belgrade area. The trench became known as the Laudan's Trench (Laudanov \u0161anac) and passed in front of the gate which was accessed over a small bridge over it. Though smaller than the previous W\u00fcrttemberg Gate, it was still the largest of all city gates at the time, but was also considered the most beautiful.The gate got its name as it was the starting point of the Tsarigrad Road, which linked Belgrade with Constantinople. Hence the name of both the road (Carigrad was Serbian name for Constantinople) and the gate (after shortened Serbian version of the Ottoman name for Constantinople, \"Istanbul Gate\"). The gate was made of dressed stone and bricks, on a rectangular base. It had rooms for housing the sentry units and three entry points: large, central one, for the carts and two smaller ones on the sides for the pedestrians. Above the main entrance there was tughra, a medallion with the signature of the Ottoman sultan. Doors were made of thick oak beams, nailed down with the strong iron plating. In time, the plating became full of obvious bullet holes.The Stambol Gate became notorious as the place in front of which the Turks executed the rayah, their non-Muslim subjects, by impaling them on stakes. It was also the place where during the attack on Belgrade in 1806 in the First Serbian Uprising, one of the leading Serbian military commanders, Vasa \u010carapi\u0107, was fatally wounded. In his memory, a street near the square (Vasina Street) and a monument in the vicinity were named after him. The gate continued to have certain strategic role in the 18th and the 19th century. After 1815, when Serbia was granted autonomy, Ottoman guards were placed at the gate to control the entering into the fortress. Already notorious, it became a symbol of the hated Ottoman rule after the \u010cukur Fountain incident in 1862. After the armed clash and rioting which followed, the gate lost its importance as the Ottoman garrison withdrew into the Belgrade Fortress itself, abandoning the gate.The gate was demolished in 1866, on the orders of Prince Michael, as the plans for the National Theatre were already in the works. The prince ordered it to be completely demolished to the ground on 20 March 1866 and the work was finished on 31 May 1866. The Ottomans fully evacuated from Belgrade in 1867. The stones from the gate were re-used for the construction of the surrounding houses and for the building of the theatre itself. The rubble was partially used for burying the marsh in Bara Venecija, where the Belgrade Main railway station was built. When the square was renovated in 1928\u20131929, the remains of the Stambol Gate's foundations were discovered beneath the pavement, but it was not recorded whether the remains were dug up again or were removed. Additional remains were found in 1949, during another rearrangement of the square.\n\n\n=== Formation of the square ===\n\nBelgrade's first chief urbanist, Emilijan Josimovi\u0107, devised a plan in 1867 for the system of \"green groves\" along the former route of the Laudon trench, which now divided old part of the city from the newer neighborhoods. The green belt was also to include avenues, promenades, etc. The plan was only partially conducted at the time, while the only two surviving parts of the plan are two small squares, at Topli\u010din Venac, where the Park Prole\u0107e is today, and at the present Republic Square's section in front of the Central Military Club building.After the demolition of the gate and establishment of Serbian rule in all of Belgrade in 1867, the site of the present square was not laid out for a long time. The remains of the Stambol Gate were still visible. They were surrounded by bogs and gullies and a row of black locusts, which was leading to the open farmer's market. The market was known for the lamb and pork meat, while the kirid\u017eije, who transported various goods from U\u017eice on their little horses, were bringing and selling bacon, sirene, kaymak, pr\u0161ut and kegs of rakia.The National Theatre, built in 1869, was the only large building for the more than 30 years as the square didn't develop as an urban area until the monument to Prince Mihailo was erected on 19 December 1882 when the square gradually started to acquire more buildings. The square was named Pozori\u0161ni Trg (\"Theatre square\"), keeping the name until the Communist rule after 1945. The square was formed between the theatre building, Cooperation of the printing workers, the Dardaneli kafana, the lots of Dimitrije and Lazar Andrejevi\u0107, the Kolarac House with pharmacy and the First Belgrade Brewery.The second ice rink in Belgrade, after one in Savamala, was built in 1909 near the modern Army House.  The place where now the National Museum is, was the location of long single-storied building which housed, among other edificies, the famous \"Dardaneli\" restaurant, founded in 1855. It was the most popular kafana in Belgrade at that time, especially after the 1896 reconstruction, when it became the meeting-place of actors and writers, and the central point of city's urban spirit and bohemianism. The building was pulled down to make way in 1903 for the Treasury (now the building of the National Museum). In a small park next to the National Theatre, there were the well-known \"Kolarac\" kafana and cinema (owned by Ilija Milosavljevi\u0107-Kolarac, a merchant and benefactor). The \"Kolarac\" was a regular meeting place of young officers and here, headed by Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107 Apis, they plotted the 1903 May Coup, which ended with the deaths of king Alexander Obrenovi\u0107 and queen Draga and termination of the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty. As the building was also location of the Association of Writers of Serbia, the first book fair in the city was held here.The square was damaged during World War I, in the bombardment by the Austro-Hungarian and German armies. Especially damaged was the building of the National Theatre. It was fully reconstructed by 1922.The \"Riunione\" Palace, in which \"Jadran\" cinema used to be located, was built from 1929 to 1931, on one section of the Andrejevi\u0107 family parcel. It was built by the Adriatic Insurance Company \"Riunione\" from Trieste, Italy. The palace had apartments, offices, cinema \"Uranija\" and \"Milanovi\u0107\" bistro. It was adapted into the pastry shop later (Kod kne\u017eevog spomenika) and is caf\u00e9-pastry shop even today. Part of the building was rented to German Transportation Bureau (Deutsches Verkehrs Buro). It was a public secret that it is actually a hotspot for German spies, but the state didn't react. Few days before the 27 March 1941 anti-German protests, including the coup d'\u00e9tat, Germans hastily left the building, so the protesters smashed it. Bo\u0161ko Buha Theatre is today located in that section of the building.\"Uranija\" was later renamed \"Jadran\", and the cinema was popular for its repertoire, mostly made of dramas and romantic movies. When it was sold to the privately owned company in 2007, they resold it the a company from Cyprus which closed the cinema and opened a caf\u00e9 and a pastry shop instead.\n\n\n=== World War II and later ===\n\nMost of the buildings were destroyed during the German bombing on 6 April 1941. In the summer of 1942 a failed assassination on Du\u0161an Letica by a group of six Yugoslav Partisans happened here. German occupational forces reconstructed the building of the theatre in 1942. After World War II, the tram tracks were removed as, until then, a tram terminus was located in the square.During the Belgrade Offensive in 1944, in which the Partisans and the Red Army expelled occupying Germans from Belgrade, 24 Red Army tank crewmen were killed. On 23 October 1944, three days after the liberation, a funeral procession consisting of 24 tanks moved from the Slavija Square to the Republic Square, where the crewmen were buried. Among the buried soldiers was Lt. Nikolay Kravtsov (1921-44), who was the only soldier participant in the Belgrade Offensive awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal. General Vladimir Zhdanov held eulogy at the mass burial, but addressed Kravtsov specifically. In 1954, the crypt and the monument were moved to the newly formed Cemetery of the Liberators of Belgrade at Belgrade New Cemetery.Later, the biggest building on this square, the \"Press House\" was constructed in 1961 on the remaining part of the former Andrejevi\u0107 family lot, so as  the \"City Restaurant\" and the International Press Center. For the construction of the Press House, a series of old, ground-floor houses was demolished.In the early 1990s, club \"Buha\" was opened in the building of the Bo\u0161ko Buha Theatre. It was very popular in the 1990\u20131992 period as one of the first venues in Belgrade to play electronic music, and was also a pioneer of rave music in Serbia.\n\n\n=== Opera controversy ===\nThe area of the present 'Plateau of Dr Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107', right across the National Theatre was seen as the site of the future Belgrade Opera from the 1960s. However, this became highly controversial issue, both academic and public, in the 2003, when city government decided to tear down the Staklenac mall (saying it has done its purpose, even though it was built in 1989) and to construct City Gallery, while the Opera is supposed to be built in the swampy and uninhabited area of U\u0161\u0107e in Novi Beograd. Despite opposition from the citizens, ensemble of the opera and prominent architects and artists, the city government, most prominently the official city architect \u0110or\u0111e Bobi\u0107, insisted that regardless of everything, they already made a decision that the Opera will not be built on the Square. Architect Milan Pali\u0161a\u0161ki proposed in 2003 a project \"Opera on the Square\". It included construction of the national opera and ballet house (up to 1,200 seats) and a large underground garage (1,400 parking spots). The project would rule out the need for smaller underground garages in the vicinity (like to one planned on Studentski Trg or, as it is the case with La Scala and Covent Garden, a separate building for the Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra which could also use it. The project, which also included the underground passage which would connect the new building with the building of the National Theatre across the Francuska Street, was supported by the \"Opera at the Square\" movement, headed by the opera singer \u017divan Saramandi\u0107. As of 2018 nothing has been either demolished or built.\nIn 2015 city announced that the Staklenac mall (Serbian for glassy) will be demolished. The mall, with 4,000 m2 (43,000 sq ft) of floor area, was built in 1989 on a temporary permit from 1988, which expired after 10 years. Hence, the object can't be officially legalized. It was built concurrently with the reconstruction of the National Theatre, in the scopes of the city beautification for the IX Non-Aligned Movement summit which was held in Belgrade. New project is a cultural venue, covering 15,000 m2 (160,000 sq ft) and comprising galleries, bookstores, conference halls and an underground garage for 500 vehicles. In August 2017, city architect Milutin Foli\u0107 said that the plan will include opera, ballet and a gallery, or a combination of those, though that was not in the project accepted in 2015 and even announced a possibility of yet another architectural design competition.In January 2018 it was again announced by the city that the mall will be demolished to make room for an opera and ballet house. It was disclosed that the demolition will start in the summer of 2018, but there is a possibility of postponing it, as the city will only then organize an architectural design competition so there is no economic point in demolishing the well established mall so early. In August 2018 it was announced by the city officials that the Staklenac will be demolished and the building of the Opera and ballet house will be built, \"in the next several years\". Some architects consider opera house on the square as a bad solution.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nAfter 2013, new city government announced the closing of the entire downtown for traffic, including the square, and turning the central city area in the pedestrian zone. The square and the entire section till the Kalemegdan will be paved in granite or concrete slabs, almost without any trees. The idea met with the universal opposition from the professionals (architects, urbanists, traffic experts) but also from the public.In 2017 city announced plans for the details of the major reconstruction of the square. The flower beds will be removed, the square will be paved with granite slabs and the traffic calming zone will be formed. The works started in August 2018 and the deadline is 14 months. The works will be organized in two phases. Phase I is dealing with the square plateau itself and should be finished on 1 March 2019. In the phase II, the streets will be closed for adaptation and renovation, rerouting the traffic in the sole center of the city. It is planned that the granite slabs in different color will mark the locations of some former landmarks, like the Stambol Gate and the temporary graveyard from 1944. During the process, the Prince Michael Monument will be renovated, too. In the end, even this idea was abandoned.\nIn September 2018, during the excavations, original wooden cobble laid in the second half of the 19th century was discovered. Once, the entire square, up to the Terazije, was covered with it. The cobbles were removed for cleaning. One part will be returned and form the protected patch so that pedestrians can see what the cobble looked like. Another part will be kept in the National Museum while the third will be used for other pedestrian areas in the city. Also, it was originally thought that remains of the former Stambol Gate were discovered, though it was believed that nothing survived. The remains were to be preserved and shielded by glass so that they will remain visible to passersby. The works were then stopped again for a while after the remains of the Roman tombs were discovered. It was later announced that the remains are actually of the W\u00fcrttemberg Gate, not the Stambol Gate. It was decided to scrap the idea of a glass cover which would leave the remains visible, and to continue with the original plan which included reburying of the remains and differently colored slabs which will mark its former position.The deputy mayor Goran Vesi\u0107 said that the works will be done \"24 hours a day\" and that cameras will be installed so that everyone can watch the progress. Asked why it takes 420 days for such a reconstruction, under such a rigorous working hours, Vesi\u0107 replied that it was a question for the authors of the project. Soon, reporters and public figures noted that the working site is still without workers from time to time or that it took less to build the entire Empire State Building, back in 1930\u20131931. In April 2019, administration of the Stari Grad municipality began intermittent physical blockades of the construction site and removal of the construction fencing, hence \"liberating the square\". Employees, local residents and sympathizers of the opposition would either physically prevent machines from working and escort workers from the site or would organize sport activities or sitting sessions on the square thus stopping works.Public complains continued, including the lack of greenery and replacement of the street pavement with the stone slabs. The cobblestone was placed as it was originally intended to turn the entire square into the pedestrian zone, but after much protests, the idea was scrapped, at least for now. Instead, city urbanist Marko Stoj\u010di\u0107 announced the revival od an old idea of building an underground garage on the square. During one of his inspections, president Vu\u010di\u0107 said that the massive building of the Press House should be demolished because it is \"so ugly\". Despite the legion of problems caused by the reconstruction, a patio of the local caf\u00e9, belonging to the controversial businessman with criminal past Predrag Rankovi\u0107 Peconi, was opened and operational all the time, even though it was right next to the reconstruction site.\n\n\n=== Post-reconstruction ===\nThe square was reopened on 1 September 2019. Public reaction was overwhelmingly negative: carriageway cobblestones were 41,000 cubes of rugged stone which made driving unpleasant and motorcycle, bicycle, pedestrian traffic almost impossible. City claimed such cubes were placed deliberately, to slow down the vehicles. At the widest section, the carriageways were narrowed. In protest, residents placed a fake monument to Goran Vesi\u0107 on the square. City and state official praised the works. President of the Republic, Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, said the square looks \"wonderful and that the cobblestone is from high quality material which is \"for ever\". Vesi\u0107 said they originally wanted plain concrete cubes, but president Vu\u010di\u0107 said \"no, you are doing the central city square, place everything best for Belgrade...and he was right, so we placed the best granite\".Less than two weeks later, heavy rains damaged the surface layer of the carriageways, prompting question whether it was granite at all. Amidst continued negative reactions, Stoj\u010di\u0107 said granite cubes will be turned upside down, with lower, flat part of the cubes on top. Vesi\u0107, claiming he was in a \"surprise control visit\", had an outburst, scolding the contractor \"Strabag\" (which billed additional \u20ac287,000 for \"unexpected works\"), calling them to repair it with their own money and without closing the traffic. Asked how the cubes, by city's orders with rugged side up, were praised for 12 days, Vesi\u0107 replied that \"Strabag had to point out this is not a functional solution\", calling the situation \"unacceptable\". 15 days after the re-opening, \"reconstruction of the reconstruction\" began.. Despite promises, the traffic was stopped again.Repairs showed cubes are not made of granite as stipulated by the invitation to tender and paid as such by the city, but concrete cubes with a thin silicone-glued rugged layer on top. Architects criticized the process - simple flipping of the cubes, especially glued ones like this - as a threat for traffic safety, especially during rain or winter, with pedestrians already complaining the cubes are slippery. The responsible engineer refused to sign the reconstruction project as the original project was changed by the city during the reconstruction, unknowingly to the public. Additional rains showed the draining system on the square wasn't functional.President Vu\u010di\u0107 supported city government again, saying \"Vesi\u0107 has done everything right\" and that he doesn't understand the \"hysteria surrounding continued works\", adding he is proud how things are done in Belgrade. City claims the total price of the reconstruction is \u20ac8 million,, which is deemed way to high and criticized even by the state Radio Television Serbia. Architect Dragoljub Baki\u0107 estimated real cost to no more than \u20ac4.4 million, though he deemed the reconstruction as unnecessary anyway. In protest, students painted cubes in \"gold\", to show how things function in Belgrade: fa\u00e7ades are painted, but everything decays inside. They were invoking government's claim that Serbia currently lives its \"golden age\". City filed charges against students claiming they are hooligans who destroy \"granite\" cubes. It was soon obvious that new cubes, instead of the old, turned upside down ones, are being placed. Mayor Zoran Radoji\u010di\u0107, when asked who is paying for this, said: \"Well, you know what, I can't really know about every single cube, you have to admit that\".The square was re-re-opened for traffic on 1 November 2019, however, despite claims that all lines of public transportation will be restored, two trolleybus lines remained shortened to Slavija Square, while two were completely abolished. This right away resulted in crowds in the surviving lines and massive public discontent. Authorities said that everything is covered with changing buses on other lines, but it turned out that for some, previously direct routes, it takes an extra hour for the commuters. But it was also reported that the reduction is part of the plan to transform the main traffic route into the pedestrian zone and because of the weight restrictions due to the botched reconstruction of the square. City responded that they acted after \"serious analyses and talks\" and upon wishes of the citizens. Asked to make public those analyses and explain when and how the citizens were interviewed about such \"tectonic\" changes, administration refused to disclose any documents. Simultaneously, city extended the deadline to 23 January 2020, which would make the reconstruction 519 days long, though without specifications what will be done in this period, except that there will be \"no field work\". In the end, locations of the Stambol Gate and the Red Army soldiers burial site were marked with different slabs. City announced that the total expenditures per contract (for 420 days) is 768.3 million dinars, or \u20ac6.5 million, but that exact number will be known by the end of the year. Warranty period is 3 years.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nIn terms of architecture, the square is not favorably perceived by the architects and artists nor is considered a proper square, which are generally lacking in Belgrade. Isidora Sekuli\u0107 wrote in the 1930s that \"in Belgrade, you have no beautiful squares. The square is a bordered and appeasing plane, which can't express the real character of Belgrade which is arbitrary, complex and opposed to the planimetrics\". During the Interbellum, the square was smaller and less \"spilled\" than it is today. One the sides where the Press House, space in front of it and park area in front of the Staklenac are today, the square was cornered by two blocks of tall and unrepresentative buildings. In such arrangement, the Riunione Palace (modern Bo\u0161ko Buha Theatre) was de facto the frontal edifice of the square's composition, despite the building of the National Theatre was clearly the most public object.The objects surrounding the square were all of different heights, creating \"height schism\" and not allowing for the buildings to be considered as an \"ensemble\". As a result of this, after the Riunione Palace was built in 1931, it created insulating fluctuation, both daily and seasonal. After the noon, one half of the square is in deep shade while the other is fully lit up. In summer, this becomes extreme due to the heat, which was only aggravated with the 2018-2019 reconstruction. Building of the Mortgage Bank (now a National Museum) wasn't a proper public building until it was adapted into the museum. Just as the height is diversified, the arrangement on the ground is off the markers, too. The strictly symmetrical front fa\u00e7ade of the museum faces the monument to Prince Michael, which, however, is not in the symmetrical axis  regarding the museum's fa\u00e7ade. Older, monument was placed right in the central axis between the Vasina and \u010cika Ljubina streets and misses the museum's axis because the streets are not equally wide.After the reconstruction, the square retained its amorphous borderline. The curved section to the Kolar\u010deva Street was bounded by two rows of trees, some of which withered before the reconstruction was finished. However, several trees were placed in front of the museum's front fa\u00e7ade, closing it, especially as the trees grow bigger in the future. Though it was tried to transform the square into the \"casserole\" (tepsija), the perceptive plane of the square was indeed lowered to the level zero but it only made obvious the tilting of the square. While some, even more tilted squares are considered architectural gems, like the Piazza Grande in Arezzo, the Republic Square misses all the important elements: spatial articulation, borderline edifices and impeccable junction details of all objects with the paved ground. In the \"shaved\" square, the tilted empty space reinforced its \"collage\" character.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe square is one of the busiest places in Belgrade, as one of the central business areas in the city, with over 20 bus and trolleybus lines of the city public transportation passing through the square.\nOn one side, the square extends to the Knez Mihailova street, the pedestrian zone and one of the main commercial sections of Belgrade. On the opposite side, the square is occupied by the Staklenac, the Belgrade's first modern glass and steel constructed shopping mall. The small flat area in front of Staklenac has been officially named 'Plateau of Dr Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107', after the Serbian prime minister was assassinated in 2003.\n\n\n=== Prince Michael monument ===\n\nThe bronze statue of Prince Michael on a horse, by the Italian sculptor Enrico Pazzi was erected in 1882. It was erected in honor of the Prince's most important political achievement, complete expulsion of the Turks from Serbia and liberation of the remaining 7 cities within (then) Serbian territory, still under the Turkish rule (1867). The names of the cities are carved on a plates on the monument itself, on the statue's pedestal and prince is sculptured with his hand allegedly pointing to Constantinople, showing the Turks to leave. During recent years, the role and honor of prince somewhat fell into the oblivion and the statue became simply known as kod konja (Serbian for 'at the horse'). Even the nearby restaurant is named that way, Kod konja.\n\n\n=== Millennium clock ===\nIn 2000, a modern public clock, named the Millennium clock and funded by Delta Holding, was installed in the square. The clock is placed on a tall stand, and it also displays current weather conditions. Two main, digital clocks face the less busy sides of the square (near \u010cika Ljubina and Kolar\u010deva streets), while two small, analog clocks face the two busier sides (near Knez Mihailova street and the National Theatre). The clock and its stand are made of chromed steel and glass and the stands are 4 and 6 m (13 and 20 ft) tall.The clock was described as the \"nice and modern architectural detail\" of Belgrade and that it has been designed and built in the accordance with the surrounding objects. Due to its appearance and construction, it looks almost transparent. With the addition of the clock, as the square is one of the most popular meeting points in the city, for a while Belgraders also used 'let's meet at the clock' as a meeting catchphrase, but by 2018 the clock was out of order for a long time. Public opinion on the clock remained divided as it was perceived by many as a foreign body in the square environment.One of the complaints by the citizens during the massive 2018-2019 reconstruction was why the clock wasn't removed from the square. In August 2019 it was announced that the clock will be moved to the plateau next to the Belgrade Arena, across the Sava river, in the New Belgrade. On 8 August 2019 the clock and the entire installation were dismantled and sent to the repair shop as it was out of service for years. After the repairs, it will be installed next to the Arena.\n\n\n=== Jugoexport building ===\n\nLushly decorated building at the entry section into the square from the Terazije direction was built in 1923. Located in the Kolar\u010deva Street, the building has a total floor area of 5,505 m2 (59,260 sq ft) and is protected within the Spatial Cultural-Historical Complex of Old Belgrade. The building is projected by the architect Matija Bleh, but it is better known for its fa\u00e7ade ornamentation, which can be divided into the fa\u00e7ade plastics and sculptures. Ornamental plastic was done by the Czech sculptor Karel Pavl\u00edk while Serbian scultpor of Italian origin Giuseppe Pino Grassi carved the sculptures in artificial stone. Decorative elements include figures of Atlases with Earth on their shoulders, male heads with \u0161ajka\u010da caps, female heades with bandanas, half-figures of lions, etc.After World War II, the building was occupied by the state-owned trade company Jugoexport. Jugoexport went bankrupt in 2001 and state tried to sell the building since 2006, but it was unsuccessful in the next 10 years. Main flaws of the building included non-functionality, high maintenance costs and lack of parking places. Serbian industrialist Petar Matijevi\u0107, nicknamed the \"meat king\" purchased the object in 2016 for \u20ac7,3 million, with an intention to turn it into hotel. It was announced that actually his sons purchased the building to him for his birthday, in the memory of Matijevi\u0107's father, who worked in the building as a bellboy.Adaptation into the hotel began in November 2017. As the building is protected, the exterior must be preserved. The investment is \u20ac6 million and it is expected to return in the next 12 years. Matijevi\u0107 also purchased a lot of 500 m2 (5,400 sq ft) in Simina Street, below the square, for the future parking lot. The four star hotel with 68 tooms, which should be named \"Centar\", is expected to open in summer of 2018, but as of July 2019 the hotel still wasn't finished.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCity of Belgrade\nTourist Organization of Belgrade",

        "wiki": "The Church of Saint Sava (Serbian: \u0425\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0433 \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435 / Hram Svetog Save, lit. 'The Temple of Saint Sava') is a Serbian Orthodox church which sits on the Vra\u010dar plateau in Belgrade, Serbia. It was planned as the bishopric seat and main cathedral of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The church is dedicated to Saint Sava, the founder of the Serbian Orthodox Church and an important figure in medieval Serbia. It is built on the presumed location of St. Sava's grave. His coffin had been moved from Mile\u0161eva Monastery to Belgrade. It was placed on a pyre and burnt in 1595 by Ottoman Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha. Bogdan Nestorovi\u0107 and Aleksandar Deroko were finally chosen to be the architects in 1932 after a second revised competition in 1926/27 (for which no 1st award was granted, Nestorovi being runner up). This sudden decision instigated an important debate in interwar Yugoslavia which centred around the temple's size, design and symbolic national function. This was accompanied by a sizeable increase in the base area of the ambitiously conceived project. The new design departed from the competition guidelines issued in 1926, and was to replicate the dimensions and architecture of Hagia Sophia.The first stone was laid in 1935. When Yugoslavia was under occupation in 1941, the construction was approximately ten metres high. The incomplete building was used as a depot by the German army and Tito's partisans. After the war, the Orthodox Church was unsuccessful in its attempt to secure permission to complete the building. Permission was granted in 1984, and the architect Branko Pe\u0161i\u0107 was commissioned to adapt the project to new construction techniques. On May 12, 1985, a liturgy was held at the temple with 100,000 people in attendance. This marked a turning point in the then-communist country; the church had reinstated its position and the communist elite had to back down from a decade-long ban prohibiting the construction of the church. In June 1989, the concrete dome of the temple, weighing 4,000 tonnes and constructed entirely on the ground, was raised to its present position. This was a landmark achievement in construction.It is the largest Orthodox church in Serbia, one of the largest Eastern Orthodox churches and it ranks among the largest churches in the world. It is the most recognisable building in Belgrade and a landmark, as its dominating dome resembles that of the Hagia Sophia, after which it had been modelled. The church contains a rigorous symmetrical layout with a great sensitivity to light due to its large dome and four apses. Its interior cladding with 12,000 m2 (130,000 sq ft) of gold mosaics is almost complete. The mosaics are a donation of the Russian Federation. This was assured by the Russian president Vladimir Putin for which Gazprom Neft donated 2016 the initial decoration of the dome. The mosaics have been designed by the artist Nikolay Aleksandrovich Mukhin from the Russian Academy of Arts of the Imperial Academy of Arts under supervision of its director Zurab Tsereteli. The first mosaic of the dome was finished on 13 December 2017, for which Sergey Lavrov was presented at an official act of state at the church on 22 February 2018. Vladimir Putin visited the church on 17 January. 2019, when he announced that the Russian state will finance remaining works in the mosaic cladding. He symbolically laid a stone in a mosaic with the presentation of the Mandylion.\nThe planned completion of the artistic work is scheduled for 2020, for which Vladimir Putin has been officially invited.\n\n\n== Site ==\n\nThe church stands on the Vra\u010dar plateau in Belgrade. It is located at the sight axes of the important commercial traffic artery from the old city to the SE outskirts. It is visible from the Ulica Kralja Milana, between Terazije and Slavija Square, which is in extension of the axis. The church is the terminus and landmark of the intended boulevard in the first urban plan of Belgrade made by Emilijan Josimovi\u0107 from the second half of the 19th century. With its architectural form paraphrasing the Byzantine Haghia Sophia, the builders hoped that it will eventually evolve into a universal center of Orthodoxy. Moscow also had at the time lost prominence within Orthodoxy, as the October revolution sidelined religion in Russia and a compensation was intended. Unfortunately, the Yugoslav communists also obstructed Saint Sava, as they banned further construction at the site after World War II. After a long delay, the church rose in 1985. In 2004 all works on the outside had been finished, the expected consecration with the finished interior space is expected to be held at the end of 2020.\nThe church lies on the western promontory of the Vra\u010dar-Plateau at 134 m height. It is located 500 m south of Belgrade's main square, Slavija square. The base of the church is 18 m above Belgrade's traditional geographic center, the Terazije square and the main pedestrian lane, the Knez Mihajlova ulica. It is also 10 m higher than Ta\u0161majdan park, where the second biggest church in Belgrade St. Mark's and the Serbian Parliament, the Skup\u0161tina are located. As it lies also 63 m above the confluence of the Sava River into the Danube, St. Sava is a primary natural viewpoint and from its massive dome a visible landmark for the city. From the publicly accessible gallery around the dome, a view on the urban fabric of Belgrade is possible. A lift will be installed after interior works are finished for all visitors of the church. \nBelow the foundation of St. Sava, pass the double-tubes of the Belgrade rail-commuter network, BG Voz This necessitated a redesign of the original plan of the crypt.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nSaint Sava (1175\u20131235), the patron saint and national hero of the Serbian people, was born Rastko Nemanja in 1175, the son of Serbian Grand \u017dupan Stephen (r. 1166-1196). Serbia was still a relatively young nation, having freed itself from the Byzantine Empire in the previous century. In 1077 Duklja became the first Serb kingdom, its founding being intimately interconnected with the establishment of the Roman Catholic Bishopric of Bar. Toward the end of the 12th century, the new state Ra\u0161ka, centered in what is now southern Serbia, rose as a second Serbian nation. Stephen Nemanja ruled Ra\u0161ka. In 1196 he, like his son Rastko before him, moved to the Eastern Orthodox monastic center on Mount Athos in Greece, where he was known as the monk Simeon. Soon afterward, he joined with his son to rebuild the ruined Monastery of Hilandar, on Mount Athos, which had been given to the Serbian people by the Byzantine emperor. Simeon died there in 1199. Sava organized after his return to Serbia the Serbian Orthodox Church and was consecrated the first archbishop of the Serbian church by Patriarch Manul I of Constantinople (r. 1216-1222), the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Sava died in 1236 after his unparalleled second pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Egypt and Mt Sinai in Veliko Tarnovo in Bulgaria. He was later canonized and named the patron saint of Serbian schools and school-chiildren.\nIn 1594, Serbs rose up against Ottoman rule in Banat, during the Long War (1591\u20131606) which was fought at the Austrian-Ottoman border in the Balkans. The Serbian patriarchate and rebels had established relations with foreign states, and had in a short time captured several towns, including Vr\u0161ac, Be\u010dkerek, Lipova, Titel and Be\u010dej, although the uprising was quickly suppressed. The rebels had, in the character of a holy war, carried war flags with the icon of Saint Sava.The war banners had been consecrated by Patriarch John I Kantul, whom the Ottoman government later had hanged in Istanbul. Ottoman Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha ordered that the sarcophagus and relics of Saint Sava located in the Mile\u0161eva monastery be brought by military convoy to Belgrade. Along the way, the Ottoman convoy had people killed in their path so that the rebels in the woods would hear of it. The relics were publicly incinerated by the Ottomans, on 27 April 1595, as it was placed on a pyre and burnt on the Vra\u010dar plateau, and the ashes scattered. According to Nikolaj Velimirovi\u0107 the flames were seen over the Danube.On the 300th anniversary of the burning of Saint Sava's body, a group of Serbian Orthodox believers founded the Society for the Construction of the Cathedral of Saint Sava on Vra\u010dar with the idea of building a cathedral on the site. Initially a small church was constructed and the search began to find an adequate design.\nThe church is widely regarded as an important symbol of the Byzantine revival architecture, that dominated church architecture from Russia to the Balkans in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. In particular, it had to serve Serbs as a symbol of the afterlife of the medieval Serbian empire. Especially in the context of Yugoslavia, a Serbo-Byzantine culture was favoured both by the Yugoslav king Aleksandar I Karadjordjevi\u0107 and the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The adoption of a pattern that followed the prototype of the Haghia Sophia in Constantinople illustrates the idea that Serbs are legitimate heirs to imperial Byzantium. Belgrade was visioned as a new imperial center of Orthodoxy, which had a particular resonance in the context of the demise of Moscow being the communist capital when the church was planned.\n\"Being only recently finished, the Belgrade church stands as a vivid reminder of the longevity of the Serbo-Byzantine discourse, a visual symbol of a peculiarly Serbian adaptation of the classical doctrines of renovatio and translatio, which has remained one of the sturdiest longue dur\u00e9e structures of Serbian national history, politics and culture\n\n\n=== Planning ===\nDate and location of the Burning of Saint Sava's relics remained disputed. Given years are 1594 and 1595, while the proposed locations, as the name Vra\u010dar was applied to the much wider territory than it occupies today, include: Crveni Krst, suggested by Gligorije Vozarovi\u0107 who erected reddish Vozarev Krst at the spot, which gave name to the entire neighborhood of Crveni Krst (\"Red Cross\"); mound of \"\u010cupina Humka\", in Ta\u0161majdan, previously known as Little Vra\u010dar, which is the preferred location of modern historians; Vra\u010dar plateau, which attracted the widest public acceptance.In 1894, which was then celebrated as the 300th anniversary of the burning, consensus was reached to build the church on the third plateau location. In 1895 the \"Society for the Construction of the Church of Saint Sava on Vra\u010dar\" was founded in Belgrade. The major part of the parcel donated for the construction came from Scottish missionary Francis Mackenzie, who purchased and developed this part of the city in the late 19th century. By the 1900 ukaz of King Alexander Obrenovi\u0107, the planned church was declared a \"nationwide edifice\". A small church was built at the future place of the temple, and it was later moved so the construction of the temple could begin.\n\n\n==== First competition ====\nIn 1906, an architectural design competition for the future church was announced. Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences was authorized to judge the project, and it rejected all five applications as insufficient. A series of wars followed (First Balkan War in 1912, Second Balkan War in 1913, World War I in 1914\u20131918), which stopped all construction activities. After the war, in 1919, the Society was re-established.\nA renewed competition was announced in 1926. Beside the church itself, it was to include buildings of the Patriarchate, Ministry of Religion, Seminary and Great Religious Court. The competition rules stipulated that the new church must be in the style of the Serbo-Byzantine architecture, from the period of Prince Lazar (late 14th century). There were 24 submissions. Though the first and third prizes were not awarded, a second-place submission was handed to the architect Bogdan Nestorovi\u0107.Soon, the project itself, but also the idea of the church and its proposed style became a matter of fierce public debate. In 1905, Croatian sculptor Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 proposed his idea of building the Vidovdan Temple. Fragments of the future building were exhibited in the pavilion of the Kingdom of Serbia at the major Rome 1911 exhibition. The full-scale model was then exhibited by Me\u0161trovi\u0107 in London in 1915. The idea of Me\u0161trovi\u0107 was that epics of all Yugoslav ethnicities are the same and he wanted to represent all \"three tribes\" (Serbs, Croats and Slovenes) in the monumental temple. He sculpted caryatides for the entrance of the future temple, which are today in the hallways of the National Museum in Belgrade. Me\u0161trovi\u0107 planned to build it at Gazimestan, on Kosovo, between the rivers of Sitnica and Lab.\n\n\n==== Second competition ====\n\nAfter World War I, Serbia was integrated into the new Yugoslav State, thus the idea for the memorial church transformed into a more ambitious project. In the second competition a church with a ground area of 60 x 60 m was publicly announced.\nA new impetus came from the foundation of an association to build a memorial church on Vra\u010dar. The managing board was held by the patriarch Dimitrije. The church was thought to have a built area of 3000 m\u00b2, to tower 80 m and offer space to 6.000 faithful. The church was to pay reference to close national building traditions and resemble edifices in late Byzantine art of the so-called \"Morava style\", highlighting locally built churches commissioned under the reign of Lazar of Serbia (1329-1389) and his successors. The churches from the second half of the 14th century had all a trikonchic floor-plans, a cross-in-square design and some important royal burial places and memorial monasteries were also five-domed. One specification said that only Yugoslav or Russian architects are eligible for entries in the competition. It favoured especially Serbian nationals and Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 architects, who were the main representatives in the neo-Byzantine movement which had graduated at the Vienna Academy of Arts, where Serbian students were lectured by Theophil von Hansen at the end of the 19th century in neo-Byzantine tendencies. They figured prominently in the competition of 1926/27.The guidelines of the competition stated that the building should be the \"greatest and most monumental building in the country, and have ultimate artistic importance\".With the preparation and implementation of the second International Congress of Byzantine Studies 1927 in Belgrade, tendencies of the neo-Byzantine movement culminated in Yugoslavia. The clerical hierarchy sought a church in the tradition of historicism based on classical Byzantine models, more precisely on buildings in the then-called \"Serbo-Byzantine Style\". The competition marked a climax in neo-Byzantine tendencies in Serbia which saw also the rising of Monastery Gra\u010danica as the ultimate achievement of the late Byzantine architecture and an acclaimed model for the building of the new church on Vra\u010dar, even so it was not requested.It was coincidental that the call for entries was listed on 3 November 1926 in Politika and the competition should be held on 30 April 1927, several months prior to the International Congress of Byzantine Studies 10\u201314 December 1927. Discourses in the Serbo-Byzantine movement derived not directly from the sphere of architecture, but established here from studies in humanities, which retrospectively sought to highlight the importance of the Byzantine commonwealth to the Serbian cultural tradition. The main proponents came from Russia. With an important Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 community, Belgrade had become after World War I a center of this tendency. Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 architects had become the main architects for public buildings during the reign of the Yugoslav king Aleksandar I, they were located atop the hierarchy and were preferably engaged for building representative government edifices.\nThe competition itself was not successful, no first-prize winner was announced. None of the entries sufficed the public and professional opinion. Most entries had even not fulfilled the guidelines, most proposed designs were based on models of the Gra\u010danica Monastery as the main representative of national Serbian medieval architecture or even the Haghia Sophia. It is believed that the Jury had recommended the two models. As with the Katholikon of Gra\u010danica, its design was regarded the highpoint of the national architecture, and the competition manifested as the initial point in an evolving discourse about architecture and national identity in Serbian art. Gra\u010danica, even not belonging to the group of memorial monasteries whose royal founders build them as burial places, became a chosen inspiration for the architects. They saw it as a modern source of inspiration in the quest for a true national style.The second competition saw 22 (24?) entries from major architects in the country. All final proposals had to be submitted before May 1927. Besides Bogdan Nestorovi\u0107 and Aleksandar Deroko, entries came from Dragi\u0161a Bra\u0161ovan, Milan Zlokovi\u0107, Milutin Borisavljevi\u0107, Branko Krsti\u0107 and Petar Krsti\u0107, \u017darko Tati\u0107, Aleksej Papkov, Miladin Prljevi\u0107, Bran\u010de Marinkovi\u0107 and \u017dikica Piperski, Aleksander Vasi\u0107 and others. The commission had Patriarch Dimitrije, Jovan Cviji\u0107, Andra Stevanovi\u0107 and Bogdan Popovi\u0107, Pera Popovi\u0107 and Momir Korunovi\u0107. The commission declined to name a winning entry, as none of the entries had fulfilled the tender criteria. The commission criticised the minor quality of most of the entries.\n\n\n==== Public controversy ====\nCompetition\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFive years after the second competition, 1932, and two years after the new Patriarch Patriarch Varnava took office, the Committee unexpectedly announced that the second-prize entry and the runners-up were chosen to be combined for the final project. That was followed by the similarly unexpected suggestion that the new cathedral should be reminiscent of Haghia Sophia. Bogdan Nestorovi\u0107's entry 1927 was based upon the Gra\u010danica model and had only touched some elements that resemble the plan of the Hagia Sophia, while the entry of Aleksandar Deroko even more reminiscent of Haghia Sophia was by no means a copy or anywhere close to the appearance of the imperial church. There were additional complaints about the plan to build an immense monument that was to be of national importance for Yugoslavs, given the fact that the cult of Saint Sava was a largely Serbian legacy. Despite the public debate, the realization of the Nestorovi\u0107-Deroko project took shape after 1932. Vojislav Za\u0111in was chosen as the engineer. Still, construction of the church couldn't start for several more years, in which the architects finalized their plans, as the size of the church and the dimensions grew. The decision process occurred amidst political turmoil, the Yugoslav kingdom became a royal dictatorship in 1929, the Croatian politician Stjepan Radi\u0107 was killed in parliament 1928 and King Alexander was assassinated in Marseilles, France in 1934, and the idea of integral Yugoslavism died with him. Especially during the hot phase of the debate 1931/32 a paradox happened, after two years of royal dictatorship the state adopted a new constitution (3 September 1931), following a new ideological path to unitarization. At the same time, the pan-Yugoslavian theme in building the church of Saint Sava was dropped, and its function in the Serbian tradition was adopted by the Serbian clergy. By the time the church was to announce the new plans, integral Yugoslavism had been adopted as state ideology, with the parallel decision of the Serbian Orthodox Church, Saint Sava was to represent only Serbian Orthodox believers, a genuine and active counterreaction was established. This path had started immediately after Varnava took office in 1930, vocal support of Yugoslav national unity remained only declarative, as Yugoslavism was meant only in the context of Serbian supremacy and under a Serbian sign.During the debate, some even pushed for the construction of the Vidovdan Temple instead. Especially vocal was art historian Kosta Strajni\u0107. He and his supporters opted for the \"Yugoslav, not Serbian Pantheon\". They also rejected the Byzantine design, as it only symbolized \"one tribe\". Me\u0161trovi\u0107 supported Strajni\u0107, insisting that the new \"Yugoslav style\" should be created, instead of the sacred architecture that would fit only one of the denominations. King Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 publicly didn't support any solution, but privately pushed for the Me\u0161trovi\u0107's temple. The King was a major proponent of integral Yugoslavism and changed the state's name to Yugoslavia. Me\u0161trovi\u0107, as the most important representative of the idea of the \"autochthonous Yugoslav art and architecture\", was his favorite artist.After the 1926/27 competition had no winner, the project remained dormant for three years. The \"Society for the Construction of the Church of Saint Sava on Vra\u010dar\" called the University of Belgrade in 1930 to delegate \"two specialists\" to join the Society and Nestorovi\u0107 in further elaborating on the design of the church. The faculty proposed two professors, Dragutin \u00d0or\u0111evi\u0107, from the architectural department of the Technical University, a known project engineer and Aleksandar Deroko, lecturer at the chair of Byzantine and Old Serbian Architecture. Meanwhile, only Aleksandar Deroko joined Bogdan Nestorovi\u0107 in the fulfilment of the task. Both architects were asked to submit separate new plans based to the new guidelines defined by the technical department of the \"Society for the Construction of the Church of Saint Sava on Vra\u010dar\". On 1 and 2 January 1932 their definitive plans were published for the first time by the newspaper Politika. The plans appeared as images of plaster models for the future church. Both of the new models differed from the previous competition entries of Nestorovic and Deroko in 1927. In contrast to their sketches from 1927, when their entries differed markedly in silhouette, materials, composition and general appearance, the new proposals now looked very similar. References to the national tradition had vanished, neither of the two models was based in any way in design on the \"Morava\"-churches or Gra\u010danica. The visual difference to the five year older proposals was even substantiated by the information in the accompanying text, where a 33 m measuring dome, which would dominate the church, was quoted. Without doubt the two similar plans had now been drafted authoritatively through the supervision of the society. The two authors acknowledged the Haghia Sophia. The similarity to the Haghia Sophia was apparent, and it did not stem from the authors' preferences, but from authoritative requirements which they had been asked to follow. The obligation set by Patriarch Varnava in 1930, that the church should be reminiscent of Byzantium was now, two years later, fixed in the newspapers' headlines, which stated the \"Style was set definitively to be Byzantine\". Varnavas and the Society's decision was uncompromizing as the newspaper article stated: \"With the model of Mr. Nestorovi\u0107 and the model of Mr. Deroko, it was exactly hit what was asked for - the church has to be completely Byzantine, resembling Haghia Sophia in Constantinople\".\nAfter this relevation, the newspaper headlines alleged that the Society had deliberately and unexpectedly given \"the directive, that the church of Saint Sava should resemble the Haghia Sophia in Constantinople\" and that its plan was accepted as the definitive design of the church. This was never denied. Nor the two architects, who accepted their part which they were assigned to. With it, a transition from the 1926-27 guidelines had happened, as Byzantium was now the key element for the identity in which the church would be built.\nThe resulting final result in the design process was set in the concept of Nestorovi\u0107 whereto certain corrections should be made in collaboration with Alekandar Deroko, which had been decided even before their two models were presented to the public. With this combination, both architects were to make the final blueprint. Despite the publicly announced models not being the final blueprint of the church, the accompanying newspaper text had announced them as the final appearance, which caused an avalanche of negative reactions in the public and among experts. The dispute from a sequence of opinions published by the newspaper Vreme started on 23 January 1931.\nAfter the king dropped his earlier veto on the decision to stop the further planning on the church, the opposing Club of Architects dropped its critical campaign after they were invited to the patriarch. A critical stage of further work occurred in an unstable society from 1932 to 1935. National antagonisms increased and the state saw nine different governments. Under such circumstances the planned church became even more Byzantized, it became a symbol of a political identity and not only an esthetic and stylistic predilection of its planners. The stylistic transformation of its plans to the imperialistic architectural narration is a testimony to the phemomen which by far surpassed questioning architecture per se and is a mirror to social and political contexts of the state. With it, the episode during which the church was debated, it bears conclusive witness to the drama behind the international political life of Yugoslavia.\n\n\n==== Synthetic redraft and invocation of Haghia Sophia ====\n\nWith the invocation of Justinian's Haghia Sophia the size of the church was even larger than that called for in the initial competition. As they developed their project, Nestorovi\u010b and Deroko reflected the growing enthusiasm of one part of the population that wanted Belgrade to have one of the largest Orthodox churches in the world. The size, height and weight of the dome were meant to surpass the grandeur of Haghia Sophia. From the initially planned 60 x 60 m, the church had now grown to a square of 80 x 90 m and could hold 10.000 instead of 6.000 worshippers. The diameter of the dome had much enlarged and was to compete with some of the great domed cathedrals of late antiquity, renaissance, baroque and the historicism epoch. As thus the only reference for the synthetic redraft of the Nestorovi\u0107/Deroko design came from the Haghia Sophia, which possessed a dome that initially had a diameter of 33 m. As it had been the cathedral of the capital city of the Byzantine Empire, its design was naturally imposed on the Belgrade Cathedral, as it was more appropriate for its urban context, than were the minor monastic churches of rural areas. With it, the idea to orient to national tradition was abandoned. This decision was highly criticised by public opinion, but not by the professional public, which didn't find many arguments for the proposal of building such a great church on the basis of the national tradition. The homogeneity of the interior space had come into consideration, which had been so successfully accomplished in the universally acclaimed Haghia Sophia. With the evolution of the model, Nestorovi\u0107 synthesized this with the proposal of Deroko into a final model, which resembled the dimensions of the Haghia Sophia and paraphrased several of its architectural achievements, but had created an interior space of its very own. It had a strictly centrally planned design with four apses which create a very dense, spacious and yet intimate interior. \nAs Branko Pe\u0161i\u0107, who continued the building after the long building ban, described it in 1988:\n\n\"It will be a unique cathedral due to the experience for anyone who enters its interior. Which means, this interior space, which was planned by professor Nestorovi\u0107, will be the most beautiful in religious architecture. It's not only my subjective opinion, but was stated by all who came here and even to those who had only a glimpse.\"\nThe adoption of the \"Haghia Sophia\" was led by impulses from western academic circles and literature, above all French and German, which acknowledged the Byzantine tradition in the rationality of construction from which followed spatial clarity, shown in a logical visually apparent image of the constructive system in the building structure.\n\n\"The utilitarian argument in the choice to use for St. Sava the architectural concept applied to St. Sophia was not a result of the decision in 1931-1932 and a sudden interest for the Justinianian church from its perfect spatial ambience and the system to overarch space, but came from the long tradition of its perception as an unparalleled structure, which had been active in Serbian scientific discourse.\"\nSince the beginning of the development of the scholarly discipline of architectural history in Serbia, St. Sophia has been referred to as a superior realization, equivalently in the importance of its constructive solution, structure and spatial effects. This was reasonably a reverberation of the global presentation of this church, whose modern life, from the beginning of the middle of the 19th century, became surprisingly dynamic and complex. The magnetic attraction of its architectural solution boosted towards the end of the 19th century and reached its highest amplitude in Serbia in the interwar years. Owing to its architectural uniqueness, St. Sophia is often regarded as a structure without examples and imitation, though the Justinianian church remained an \"archetype-building\" - and not in the context of its place in Byzantine architecture, rather as symbol of Byzantine cultural authenticity and partly superiority - from which it gained in importance in the narratives in the relationship between the Byzantine and Serbian identities and in the parentologic metaphor of the link between Byzantium and the medieval Serbian state.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\n\nForty years after the initial idea, construction of the church began on 10 May 1935, 340 years after the burning of Saint Sava's remains. The cornerstone was laid by Metropolitan Gavrilo of Montenegro, (the future Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V). The project was designed by Aleksandar Deroko and Bogdan Nestorovi\u0107, aided by civil engineer Vojislav Za\u0111ina. The work lasted until Second World War Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in 1941.\nThe church's foundation had been completed, and the walls erected to the height of 7 and 11 meters. After the 1941 bombing of Belgrade, work ceased altogether. The occupying German army used the unfinished church as the Wehrmacht's parking lot, while in 1944 the Red Army, and later the Yugoslav People's Army used it for the same purpose. After that, it was used for storage by various companies. The Society for Building of the Church ceased to exist and has not been revived. Children who grew up in the vicinity, including the future President of Serbia Boris Tadi\u0107, didn't know the intended purpose of the unfinished construction, so they played inside thinking it was a ruin of an old castle. The granite slabs, intended for the construction of the church, were used for the building of the Tomb of People's Heroes in 1948, in the Kalemegdan section of the Belgrade Fortress.\n\n\n==== Construction ban ====\n\nAfter the end of World War II, the building site was closed due to the changing political situation and the dominant ideological position of communism in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\nSoon after the war, material and financial possibilities to return to the continuation of works were dim. The communist elite identified themselves as atheists and rejected request of the Serbian Orthodox Church to build the site. The unfinished building was transformed to a playground and even various circus troupes used it for their purposes.\nDespite decades of efforts by the Serbian Patriarch German to continue building (and after he made 88 requests from 1958 onwards, of which 82 were sent to the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito to which Tito never personally replied) all of them were rejected by government authorities. Permission was finally granted in 1984 when the patriarch was invited to Du\u0161an \u010ckrebi\u0107, President of Presidency of Serbia.1948 saw the closing of the association to support the building of Saint Sava, her duties were transferred to the board of the patriarchy. In 1953 all belongings of the association to build Saint Sava were confiscated by the Secretary of the Interior Ministry via the decree 2/3-11.855. Even the existing foundation walls were seized and transferred to the people's property.\nThe decree never arrived at church authorities. Despite this, the church took legal action to counter the nationalisation of its property. In 1962 they were told by the Bureau of Religious Affairs that nationalized property can not be returned to church.\nAfter German had been named Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1958, he personally championed the issue. During his term of office it was one of his main concerns to commence with construction. He sent every month a titular bishop to the mayor of Belgrade, to request the removal of garages and all non-religious objects. After this was achieved, 88 requests were sent to various government agencies, who sent him from \"pillar to post\", from the lowest state agencies to regional authorities, the agencies of the city and executive organs of Serbian and Yugoslav governments.On 28 April 1966 the synod of the Serbian Orthodox church was offered by the president of the executive chamber of the Serbian government, Dragim Stamenkovi\u0107, to roof foundation walls and transform them into a church museum or a fresco gallery. As they were aware that no better offer would arrive, they agreed to transform it temporarily into a church museum, but rejected the fresco museum proposal. After that, the communist leader outplayed them, as the communist rulers declared that the church had consented to transfer the decision-making regarding all problems related to Saint Sava to the executive chamber of the Socialist Republic of Serbia. The church even received a changed record of their meeting, as it read that the church had agreed that the locality was to become a \"museum of church antiquities\" and \"fresco gallery\" under state supervision. The church, recognising its marginalisation, withdrew its consent and repeatedly demanded to build the planned church. \u00c9migr\u00e9 circles were approached for financial support, which the government dismissed. After the Serbian National Library was erected before the entrance of the building, the church was asked by the president of the Serbian Parliament Dragoslav Dra\u017ea Markovi\u0107 to relocate its property.A sudden turn came after Du\u0161an \u010ckrebi\u0107 was elected president of the Serbian Collective State Presidency. On 19 June 1984 he informed German and all the members of synod the church had the full right to build Saint Sava as planned on the foreseen place.\n\u010ckrebi\u0107 suggested to not make his decision public to avoid any counter action and restart work without notifying public. Suddenly all the functionaries, even those in highest positions, which had previously rejected the church building had implicitly tolerated the decision of their younger comrades and remained supportive. Naturally this decision was received as a media bomb and became a public sensation.\nOn 12 May 1985 100,000 people gathered in Belgrade to celebrate with the Serbian Patriarch and twenty bishops a liturgy inside the walls of Saint Sava. Still a part of a communist country, the event marked one of the historic turning points that symbolised the fall of communism in Europe. It was a turning point not only for the building of Saint Sava, but also for the demise of the political concept that lay behind the state atheism of communist Yugoslavia. The rising of the building also marked the return of religion to Yugoslavia.\n\n\n==== Resuming of work ====\n\nArchitect Branko Pe\u0161i\u0107 was selected as the new architect of the church. He revised the original plans in order to make better use of new materials and building techniques. Construction of the building began again on 12 August 1985. The original design project proposed a structure composed of masonry and partly reinforced concrete. The state of the existing foundations was learned after detailed investigative work. The four central bell towers were founded on 532 \"Simplex\" piles, 6 m in depth. The massive perimeter walls are laid on strip foundation 4 m in depth. The quality of the various materials used, i.e. brick, concrete, reinforcement, marble, etc. had been established through investigative work. Detailed survey of the existing structure, the as-built outlines were determined, and served as a starting point for further design and construction work.\nFrom the resumption of construction, the building was re-planned to use a very high level of assembling methods of all parts of the static system, although the complex geometrical shapes of the building made it necessary to use some new and unique methods. As the building was build from pre-assembled concrete slabs, a technological model had to be implemented to provide parallel works, secure quality and build economically. With innovation in the building procedure, the speed of \"assembling\" the building could be greatly enhanced. Construction was resumed on the level of the original design which used a combination of brick and concrete was cancelled. These lower levels were preserved with the foundation structure, which had to be repaired. The four-wing section had to be separated from the central part by way of expansion joints. Tying up of the foundations, the existing part and the new structure of forthcoming stages were achieved with reinforced concrete columns and tie-beams. Expansion joints in the wing sections were carried out along the line of intersection between the semi-domes and the main arches, and vertically down the bell towers up to the foundations.\nThe continued construction was designed as a fully prefabricated reinforced concrete element structure. From the geometrically complicated form in view of its structural points, the single elements had to be broken down into precast components outlined with straight lines to the greatest possible extent. Walls had been designed as hollow boxes, which, when assembled, give the building its massive appearance.\nAll arched shapes of the galleries and vaults were transformed into assemblies of elements curved into two dimensions, which, having been erected, formed three-dimensional shapes. The semi-domes and the dome have been linearized by designing a system of arched trusses and two layers of curved decking. The precast parts were bound into a whole by in-situ cast parts of the structure which provided the required safety and longevity of the building.\nThe bell towers were initially started as a combination of brick and concrete columns and were continued as concrete box-structures for providing the greatest possible resistance of the towers and the least possible weight. This part of the building was completed by applying the sliding shuttering method (slip-form), with the advantages of prefabrication.\nThe central part of the building includes four main arches between the bell towers and the central dome with the pendentive underneath and the dome on top. Each arch spans 24 m, which is one of the widest vault spans achieved, as most of the European great domes rest on 8 or 16 pillars. Only Hagia Sophia's dome rests on only four pillars with a span between the arches reaching 31 m. It is still the widest span between the arches of any historical sacral building and still the biggest dome which was erected on only four pillars.\nIt was found that the type of foundation chosen in the initial design lacked adequate strength to carry the loads imposed from the whole building. With the new materials and design methods, weight was reduced by 30-40 %. Before the lifting of the main dome the \"Simplex\" piles below the main tower-column had to be improved for carrying gravity and other loads. The foundation pile was partly replaced. While the initial foundation were only 6 m deep, the new ones with 1,4 m diameter reached a depth of 17 m and reached solid rock.\nThe structural analyses were made with dynamic calculation models using the \"TABS\" model from Berkely University. All the dimensioning of the elements was done in accordance with European and Yugolsav codes. For the lifting procedures, instruments were placed into the structures to compute the data collected which were analysed by computers. All relevant data was monitored live during the lifting of the heavy assembled elements of the main arches, pendentif and the main dome. Deflection, jack's strokes, leveling of supports, deformations and stresses of main elements were analysed.\n\n\n==== Lifting of the dome ====\nLifting of the Dome\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nThe greatest achievement of the construction process was lifting of the 4,000 ton central dome, which was built on the ground, together with the copper plate and the cross, and later lifted onto the vaulted arches. The lifting, which took 20 days with the specially constructed hydraulic machines, was finished on 26 June 1989.\nBefore the dome could be lifted, the four main arches had to be brought into place. The four arches are the elements linking the bell towers both physically and in terms of communication. All four pairs of arches were very successfully lifted and fixed into position between January and June 1988. On the outer arches, which belong to the wing section, the semi-domes were formed, each consisting of eight curved, reinforced concrete trusses covered with curved slab decking. The assembly of the arches was done on the ground from pre-fabricated slabs, with their weight of 4000 kN each, they were lifted with \"chains\" to their intended position. The lifting of heavy loads to great heights was remarkably easily achieved, which as an innovation was a completely new system especially designed for the building. The chains were tested against safety factor of overloading between 1.6 and 2.2. As the expansion-joint arch rests \"hanging\" from chains in the lifted position, its own columns had to be subsequently cast underneath. They were then relaxed and together with the columns, form a framed system in a \"portal\" configuration. As the arches are major elements in the structural safety of the dome, they were analyzed in detail in all stages of static live, both in terms of stresses and deflections. The dimensions of the arches were reduced, optimized, so that the resulting structure could become as light as possible for technological purposes, and at the same time strong enough for the lifespan of the building.\nThe main work was the heavy-assembly-pushing technology in the raising of the main dome. The dome, weighing 4000 tonnes, was lifted by pushing. For the, dome the main gallery, spanning 39,5 m in diameter, which bears the dome and connects to the four bell-towers was prefabricated inside the central square. It sat as a monolith on gravel embankment of 120 cm height.\nAs thus it could be completed in one phase with the supporting gallery, the dome and the cross and copper covering. Works began in November 1988 and assembly was finished at the end of February 1989. The main dome was assembled from 24 curved, reinforced concrete trusses with two layers of decking forming outer skins around either flanges of the trusses. The bottom decking was intended for mosaic ornament on the inner surface of the dome. The electro-hydraulic lifting equipment prescribed by KMG \"Trudbenik\" was designed and delivered by the Hydraulic and Pneumatic equipment and devices factory \"Prva Petoletka\".\nThe assembly-lifting of the dome structure, with completely executed copper covering works and cross, weighing 3.9 meganewtons (400 megaponds) from the ground up to the designated position at +40,09 m was done at speeds restricted to 2,5 m/day for safety reasons. With a hydraulic integral lifting power of ca. 49 meganewtons (5,000 megaponds), proportional serve-valves as well as strike and pressure pickup was done on all four reactive supports simultaneously. Computers led the unity lifting, vertical stepping of 110 mm in one step was realized by application of reinforced concrete slab-cribbing in all reactive supports by robots, which were successively placed under the jacks of the dome. Lifting to 13 m was done with supports passing by the bell-towers in order not to destroy the columns of the galleries. From there, the equipment and support steel (pi shaping) girder were moved into the slits which were left intentionally during the slip-forming of the columns. For each day, casting had to be done in situ around the cribbing slabs in order to finalize 2,5 m of columns per day. The columns were stiff enough for 2,5 m and lifting was restricted to five hours a day.\nOver 280 electronic elastomers were placed throughout the dome and its elements, all hydraulic components, were supplied by measurement instruments on information about jack's stroke and jack pressure which were fed to a specially designed computer to control the automatic lifting operation. A fully independent outside electronic leveling system was attached to the computer control, which secured the exact levelling information, and could stop the lifting operation in case of misleveling greater than 5 mm. One of two working Pc-At clones was collecting and monitoring of over 24 essential data during the performance operation which was finished without mistakes.\nThe last lifting operations were performed at level +39,69 m, while the top of the dome had reach approximately 80 m in elevation. With the lifting method no risky and complicated assemblies were necessary at this height. All the covering works of the copper sheet on wooden basis and the cross had been performed in March and April, while the dome was still on the ground.\nAfter the lifting of the dome, the pendantive was assembled again at ground level underneath the main dome. It represents the transitional tie element through which the rectilinear plan of the church naos changes to the circular plan of the main dome. With the lifting of the pendentive, the central part of the church was rounded off.\nThe structural connection between the pendentive and the main dome supports the dome in four positions. It was done by means of hydraulic jacks capable to produce 3000 kN each (12.000 kN in total). The pendentive will suffice for later additional loads from applied mortar, mosaic cladding and marble cladding on the facade.\nThe pendentive was lifted again by chains. The weight of the pendentive, about 1100 Mp, spanning in perpendicular direction 24*24 m and 14 m height was lifted to 28 m beneath the main dome. This was achieved during two days at the end of January 1990. It was lifted in 36 hours, with speeds at 2,0 m/h. It reached an accuracy within the prescribed technological design with 5 cm tolerance.\nWith this work the structural part of the church was finished.\n\n\n==== Interruption of works ====\nAfter the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999, the works were halted again. Patriarch Pavle, known for his asceticism, thought that such an expensive works are inappropriate when people are beaten and impoverished. After becoming a prime minister in 2001, Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 talked with patriarch and convinced him to continue the works.\n\n\n==== Final works ====\nAs of 2017, the exterior of the church was complete. The bells and windows had been installed, and the fa\u00e7ade completed. The Russian Academy of Arts under the guidance of Nikolay Mukhin is currently working on the internal decoration. On 22 February 2018, during the presentation of the new internal decoration, the decorated cupola was donated to the Serbian Orthodox Church.\n\n\n== Financing ==\nThe financing of the church was accompanied by many problems. During the initial building phase 1935 to 1941 financing was secured through a public association and donations from the king. From 1985 to 1999 public donations and collections were the only available resources. In 2001 Zoran Djin\u0111i\u0107 reinstalled the association for the construction of the church which worked from 2002 on. In 2004 the exterior of the church would be completed. Greek donations financed the facade, for which marble slabs from the same country were installed. In 2004 Boris Tadi\u010b took the chair of the association, and at the end of 2004 help from the Russian Orthodox Church was asked for the finalization of the interior. A fundraising event was hold at the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow, where the Russian Patriarch Alesej II welcomed Yugoslav president Tadi\u0107 and Patriarch Pavle. The concretization of the interior works were discussed with Zurab Tseretelli 2009, In 2009, Russian president Dmitri Medvedev visited the church, asked if Russia was willing to finance part of the interior decoration he replied: \"why only a part, when we could do all\"?. Vladimir Putin's first visit to the church in March 2011 secured his personal patronage for mosaic works. Patriarch Irenj, asked by Putin's who would decorate the interior, answered \"with God's help, we will do it and with Your support\" - Putin replied \"budet\" (\"it will be\"). State agreement was signed in Moscow 19 March 2012, a presidential decree Pr-1197 from 9 April 2011 enabled holding of a competition for the mosaics. From 2005 the Po\u0161ta Srbije collected funds through charity stamps worth 10 Dinar with every item of correspondence. The Serbian government also financed works with budgetary funds. As for 2019, approximately 100 million Euros had been spent on the church: for mosaics 40 million Euros, for other works in the interior 10 million, for the exterior construction approximately 50 million. This totalled roughly 100 million. Of these, 40 million came from government funds, Russia donated 10 million, and the rest was paid through private donations.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe church is centrally planned edifice, having the form of a Greek Cross. It has a large central dome supported on four pendentives and buttressed on each side by a lower semi-dome over an apse. Beneath each semi-dome is a gallery supported on an arcade. The general concept is heavily based on the Hagia Sophia. Its main construction idea stems from the central square beneath the dome, it is closely related to the geometry used by Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles. The central square in both churches has sidelines of 31 m, resulting in domes with approximately the same diameter (the dome of Hagia Sophia is slightly larger as it extends by approximately 0,5 the central square). The main differences in the dome structure is the high tambour in Saint Sava and that it is double-shelled. The low dome of Haghia Sophia was designed as calotte in which base 40 windows were set. As thus, both domes are built on pendetifs at 40 m height, the dome of Saint Sava is approximately 10 m higher (54 to 67 m). The naos of the church is 46 m wide and 46 m long. The space behind the iconostasis will not be public, it is 21,80 wide and 17 m long. The church interior has on three sides narthexes of which two have 9 m depth and 31,70 m width. Within the north and south narthex two small chapels will be created. The narthex to the main entrance in the west is 2 m longer and has four more columns than the other two. Above the narthexes are three galleries with the one of the west side assigned to the church choir. As of 2019 the marble iconostasis is in work and will have six main icons and three doors. On the left and right sides of the iconostasis are bishopric seats.\nThe dome is 70 m (230 ft) high, while the main gold-plated cross is another 12 m (39 ft) high, which gives a total of 82 m (269 ft) to the height Church of Saint Sava. The peak is 134 m (440 ft) above the sea level (64 m (210 ft) above the Sava River); therefore the church holds a dominant position in Belgrade's cityscape and is visible from all approaches to the city.\nThe church is 91 m (299 ft) long from east to west, and 81 m (266 ft) from north to south. It is 70 m (230 ft) tall, with the main gold-plated cross extending for 12 m (39 ft) more. Its domes have 18 more gold-plated crosses of various sizes, while the bell towers have 49 bells of the Austrian Bell Foundry Grassmayr.\nThe church has a bigger floor area than Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, which covers 3980 m\u00b2, compared to 4500 m\u00b2 of Saint Sava. Saint Sava is also longer 91 m vs 77,7 m and wider 81 m vs 72,42 m, it also has a bigger diameter of its dome 30,5 m vs 25 m. The dome of the Moscow cathedral is higher so, 77,37 m vs 103,4 m. Interestingly, both cathedrals resemble the Haghia Sophia in its structural design, they've been designed based on the arranagement of the central square in the Haghia Sophia. Thus they exempifly the importance of the imperial Byzantine church for main edifices in Orthodox sacral architecture.\nOn the inspiration that was drawn from Haghia Sophia, Deroko noted that two guiding principles were followed in designs for the Church of Saint Sava \u2013 the imperative of functionality of planning, and the monumentality of space and form. Looking back at the start of construction, Deroko commented on the challenges of designing a functional space for 10.000 people, which was done with reference to the architects' data, the seminal handbook by Ernst Neufert. He also noted information about the thirty-metre diameter of the dome, making an obviously important comparison with the dome of Haghia Sophia. Although the size of Saint Sava is not necessarily associated with monumentality in Deroko\u2019s opinion, the appearance and size of the St. Sava\u2019s church greatly mattered as it was to be a monument of national importance.\n\n\n==== Dome ====\n\nThe dome of Saint Sava is built in the classical style as a compound dome with four pendentives from a sphere of greater radius than the dome. It has an inner diameter of 30,50 m and an outer of 35,15 m, resembling the dimensions of the Hagia Sophia (it had initially a realized diameter of 33 m). The dome rests on four 40 m-high vaults, the square of the central space below the dome is 39,72 m wide and occupies 1.578 m\u00b2. The double-shelled dome is 27 m high and reaches to 67 m on the outside and on its inner side to 64,56 m height. Thus the dome of Saint Sava is slightly higher than its archetype of the Hagia Sophia (56 m). The dome supports a cross weighing four metric tonnes and 12 m height (including its not visible base). Its visible part is 10 m.\nAfter the Hagia Sophia, the dome of Saint Sava is the biggest in any Orthodox church. The celebrated dome of the Hagia Sophia, built by Isidore of Miletus and mathematician Anthemius of Tralles, was initially at 33 m which was reconstructed from the mathematical formulas used by its Byzantine architects. Today, after having been rebuilt three times, it has an elliptic form with the diameters 31,24 m and 30,86 m.\nAmong all Christian religious buildings, the pendentive domes of Hagia Sophia (33 m, initially realized diameter), St Paul's Cathedral (30,8 m), Florence Cathedral (43 m), St. Peter's Basilica (42 m), Berlin Cathedral (30,7 m), and Primatial Basilica of the Blessed Virgin Mary (33 m) have larger or approximately the same inner diameters to Saint Sava's. But except Hagia Sophia none of them were built on four piers and with four vaults. Among the mentioned domes, Saint Sava's has 24 m-wide vaults, only surpassed by  Hagia Sophia's (31 m) . The much bigger dome of St. Peter's Basilica has main vault's of only 23 m.If compared to the biggest domes realised in Orthodoxy, Saint Sava surpasses by large the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, whose dome has 29,8 m (outer) and 25 m (inner) diameters, the Kronstadt Naval Cathedral with 29,8 m (outer) and 26,7 m (inner) diameters and the Saint Isaac's Cathedral in Saint Petersburg with 25,8 m (outer) and 21,8 m (inner) diameters.In addition of its big diameter, the dome of Saint Sava has significant interior height as well. With 65 m (from the floor to the ceiling) it is the fourth tallest dome (by interior height) of the Orthodox Christianity, surpassed only by the domes of People's Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest (104 m), Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow (69.5 m) and Saint Isaac's Cathedral in Saint Petersburg (69 m). \nThe dome of Saint Sava also ranks among the tallest domes in the world.\n\n\n==== Cross ====\nThe design of the cross is a blend of the conception of the sculptural ideas of Neboj\u0161a Mitri\u0107, who was of Jewish descent and a survivor of the Holocaust, and the architectural ideas of Branko Pe\u0161i\u0107. The 12 m high, 5 m wide and 4 tonnes weighing cross was worked in the organization Modul, it was finished in Prva Iskra, Bari\u0107, where Mitri\u0107 oversaw the works. Afterwards it was transported to the building-site. Here it was put in a special hangar, where it could be gold-plated. The gold plating was done by Sava and Dragomir Dimitrijevi\u0107, who did the gold plating for all 18 crosses of the church.\nThe cross was lifted in May 1989 prior to the lifting of the dome to its presumed location, which was achieved in only 15 minutes. After the cross became visible on the city scape, the media criticised its modernistic design. Mitri\u0107 and Pe\u015di\u0107 used a minimalistic approach, which was not to everyone's taste. But most criticism stemmed from the invocation of the four S, symbolizing a Serbian Heraldic Cross, which was in former Yugoslavia seen as a symbol only of Serbdom. After the attacks, Mitri\u0107, who lost his whole family in the Holocaust committed suicide on 23 August 1989. Later the cross became one of the most copied crosses in the Serbian Orthodox Church and is commonly referred as Sava's Cross. Like Mitri\u0107' previous works, which were famous for their miniature sculpturing (i.e. the medals for the Winter-Olympics 1984 in Sarajevo), the cross' elegance and harmonic shape with a minimalistic conception in the main emblems were unique.\n\n\n==== Facade ====\nThe facade of the church was mainly executed in white marble. It covers 12.000 m\u00b2. The polished Grecian Volakas marble from Kavalla took 14 months to install. Cornices are made of red Balmoral granite from Finland. It covers 120 m\u00b2 on the dome and the half-domes. The pedestal is made of 80 m\u00b2 black Jablanica granite from Bosnia. The stones in the facade weigh 3.000 tonnes.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\nIt has a surface area of 4,500 m2 (48,438 sq ft) on the ground floor, with three galleries of 1,500 m2 (16,146 sq ft) on the first level, and a 120 m2 (1,292 sq ft) gallery on the second level. The church can hold 10,000 faithful. The choir gallery seats 800 singers. The basement contains a crypt, the treasury of Saint Sava, and the grave church of Saint Lazar the Hieromartyr, with a total surface of 1,800 m2 (19,375 sq ft).\nThe material of the sixteen great columns in the choir were imported from Italy in 1939. The capitals are made of Carrara marble, the columns by green marble from Baveno. The motifs of the capitals were designed by Aleksandar Deroko and were largely executed by Josif Grassi before WW II.\nThe main iconostasis is made of iron trusses on which slabs of Carrara marble will be installed. The whole construction of the approximately 20 metre-wide iconostasis will weigh 100 tonnes. It will be decorated with mosaic icons.The great central choros (chandelier) is the main circular lightning device of the church and will be cast in bronze. With a diameter of 20 m, it will weigh approximately 14 tonnes. The choros in Saint Sava will be the greatest and heaviest choros of the world. The author of the choros is Nikolaj Mukhin, who also designed the mosaic decoration in the church. The choros will be decorated with wooden icons. The choros at 7,5 m above the floor basement in the circular space below the dome will be attached with 12 suspension chains to anchors in the church walls. The choros will be decorated with stylized ornaments. It will be reminiscent of the Serbian choroi of the middle ages for which Serbian kings had been royal patrons. The two who at least were commissioned by royal patrons are those from De\u010dani Monastery in Kosovo and Metohija and Markov Monastery near Skopje which have been preserved until today. \n\n\n==== Mosaics ====\nMosaic cladding\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n===== Political implementation =====\nInformation on Russian interests to contribute to the mosaic cladding became public during the 2009 visit of the director of the Russian Academy of Arts, Zurab Tsereteli, to the church. Gazprom Neft was mentioned as sponsor. 2011 saw a state visit of Vladimir Putin during which he announced financial contribution to the mosaics. First assessments showed that 30 million Euros would be necessary for having all the interior done in mosaic cladding. An initial donation of 4 million from Gazprom Neft allowed first stage works in the dome to start. Gazprom deployed a representative to the meetings of the Russian Academy. The central meeting discussing the implementation of works was held on 13 November 2015 in Belgrade. Rossotrudnicestvo and its director, Lubov Nikolaevna Glebova, the designated Russian representative for the interior decoration, were present, as were the president of Serbia and its minister of foreign affairs.\nA second tranche over 5 million Euros was guaranteed personally by Vladimir Putin on 17 January 2019 during his visit to the church.\n\n\n===== Competition =====\nPutin advised a decrete, Pr-1197, 29 April 2011 that a state competition could be held in Moscow for the interior mosaic decoration of the Sava Cathedral. It was followed by a state agreement between the ministries of foreign affairs of Russia and Serbia on 19 March 2012. A competition with 50 entries was held in the gallery of the Russian Academy in Moscow, ul. Prechistenka 19, on 23 September 2014. On 5 October 2014, the work of Nikolay Aleksandrovich Mukhin was declared the best. His project was presented to the president of Serbia, the Serbian minister of foreign affairs and the bishop Amfilohije as the representative of the Serbian Orthodox church. Mukhin had chosen the classical Byzantine gold mosaics of the palaiologeen epoch of the 12th century as his inspiration.\n\n\n===== Authors =====\nAuthors of the mosaics are Nikolay Aleksandrovich Mukhin (\u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0439 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u0443\u0445\u0438\u043d, *1955), who composed the frescoes in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, and his fellow Yevgeniy Nikolayevich Maksimov (\u0415\u0432\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u043e\u0432, *1948), director of the department of painting at the Russian Academy of Arts in Moscow. The authors scaled a model of the dome at 1:10 in the Russian Academy, which was later installed in the Russian Embassy in Belgrade. Mukhin visited the church for the first time 1994 in official company of Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow who held service with Patriarch Pavle. Alexy returned in 1999 during the bombardment of Yugoslavia. Mukhin later worked in Serbia in various church decorations from 2002. Prior to Saint Sava, his main work in Serbia was the decoration of the church in Ub (Crkva Vasnesenja Hrista) which had to be built anew after an earthquake shook the Kolubara basin in 1998 and where he worked from 2003. He then was a member of the board of cultural advisors to Putin, whom he had known since the early 2000s. Mukhin has painted 18 churches worldwide, four of them in Serbia, despite being a Russian painter, Mukhin stated that he tries to paint close to the culture that the church belongs to. He explained that in 1994 his first idea came to decorate Saint Sava. As the church encloses an immense space, he stated that for him a golden decoration was the only possibility and that it signified the Transfiguration of Jesus. His main task, he said, was to make the church interior shine from its golden surfaces, he as author saw it as symbol to transfiguration. The impression of the light as a medium of sacral illustration will also be enhanced by illumination of certain scenes according to the church calendar. An impulse in the lighting will change from warm to cool tones, dependent on the religious feast. The smelt of the Tessara was made in Moscow and for the golden and silver Tessarae, pure gold and silver were used. Despite having worked in the Moscow Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, the task in decorating Saint Sava was of different magnitude, as the dome and size of scenes are much larger and the artistic media more complex.\n\n\n===== Structural implementation =====\n\nRealization of the mosaic works began on 28 September 2016 with the visit of Hilarion, director of the church Foreign Office in the Moscow Patriarchate and chairman of the Russo-Serbian commission at the Russian Academy. Zurab Tsereteli, Nikolaj Mukhin, Yevgeniy Maksimov and the acting director to the support of UNESCO, Manana Popova, presented the approved scale model.\nThe first seating of the commission for the mosaic works to place on 17 March 2017 in the Moscow atelier where the mosaic artwork was created.\nZurab Tsereteli as the coordinator of the artistic works expressed his gratitude to the authors at this first meeting. All mosaics were commissioned in the Moscow atelier in their original size, then cut and transported to Belgrade. The first ten tonnes of mosaics arrived in Belgrade on 3 May 2017. With a working platform at 43 m in the church, the mosaics were lifted with a specially constructed elevator.\nThe artists of the mosaics were chosen from the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in Moscow and the Repin Institute of Arts at the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg.\n\n\n===== Decoration =====\nThe central mosaic in the dome depicts the Ascension of Jesus and represents Resurrected Christ, sitting on a rainbow and right hand raised in blessing, surrounded by four angels, Apostles and Theotokos. This composition is inspired by the mosaics in the main dome of St Mark's Basilica in Venice. The lower sections are influenced by the Gospel of Luke and the first narratives of the Acts of the Apostles. The texts held by the angels are written in the Church Slavonic language, while the names of the depicted persons are written in Greek. The first indicates pan-Slavic sentiment while the latter connects it to the Byzantine traditions. The total painted area of the dome is 1,230 m2 (13,200 sq ft).It is one of the largest curved areas decorated with the mosaic techniques and when the work is completely finished, Saint Sava will be the 6th-largest church building in the world ornamented this way after St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, the People's Salvation Cathedral in Bucharest (also unfinished), the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, D.C, Primatial Basilica of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Esztergom and Berlin Cathedral. The mosaic was created for over a year in Russia, during 2016 and 2017. It was then cut and transported by special trucks to Belgrade. The total weight of the mosaic is 40 tons and it was placed on the dome from May 2017 to February 2018. The 3289 m\u00b2 mosaic installed at the eastern wing section, the side of the altar covers 3289 m\u00b2.\n\n\n===== Materials used =====\nThe material for the tessera is produced by Smaltfactory in Moscow. The enterprise's gold mosaics use pure gold (24k). It is reasonable to suggest that for approximately 400 tonnes of mosaic in total, that a great part of the costs comes from the price of precious materials. Beside pure gold, a great deal of the tessera also has pure silver in its content. The pure precious metal content prevents the materials from changing as time passes. Only pure gold's natural colour is not changed by the high temperatures during the smelting process in the kiln. The highly reflective properties of the gold tessera and the differences of angles where the mosaics are installed will produce differences in reflection, a technique that is used to blur the background and constructive elements of a church's interior.\n\n\n==== Sculptures ====\nCapitals and cornices show a variety of sculptures. The heraldic symbols of the Nemanji\u0107-Dynasty are a dominant motif. Floral motifs and anthorpomorphic figures are inspired by the rich sculptural tradition of the Morava school. The main author of the stone ornaments of the interior decoration was initially Aleksandar Deroko, whose plans were executed on all of the capitals at the columns between narthexes and naos and the altar apse. They were executed by the Swiss sculptor Josif Grassi prior to WW II. After the long delay during the communist period, the decorative work was overseen by Dragomir Acovi\u0107 and executed by Neboj\u0161a Savovi\u0107 Ne\u0161. A variety of different white marbles from Italy and Greece, green marbles from Italy, South America and India, dark and bright red marbles from Italy and India, yellow and greenish onyx, white limestone, red and white travertin and blue lapis lazuli. These decorative stones cover 1500 m\u00b2.\n\n\n=== Plateau ===\nDiscontinuous construction over decades produced numerous mistakes, one of which is the surrounding of the church which remained unfinished and nonfunctional. The construction of the National Library in 1973 affected massively the originally envisioned 1926 design by Deroko and Nestorovi\u0107. Three architectural design competitions for arranging the plateau which surrounds the church (Vra\u010dar or Saint Sava's Plateau) were organized after World War II. One of the rejected but popular designs, was the one by Mihajlo Mitrovi\u0107 and Mario Jobst, are invoked. Using denivelation of the Bulevar Oslobo\u0111enja, they envisioned the wide pedestrian connection with the Park Milutin Milankovi\u0107 across the boulevard. Denivelation would laso allow for two large garages one of which would be used by the church visitors. The square in front of the temple would have green areas on its rim, and would include the Alley of the Greats (with monuments to all major members of the medieval Nemanji\u0107 dynasty), while the section across the boulevard would be adapted into the green, children area.\n\n\n==== 1990 project ====\nOn the fourth competition, organized in 1989, the project designed by architects Vladimir Macura and \u0110or\u0111e Bobi\u0107 was finally accepted in 1990. As with all the other aspects of the church construction, this one was controversial, too, as it was publicly criticized with disputes even reaching the courts of law. Citizens organized in groups and signed petitions against the project under the slogan \"We don't want New Belgrade on Vra\u010dar, we want small Montmartre around the church\". Construction finally began in 2003, and the works were ceremonially opened by prime minister Zoran \u017divkovi\u0107. The works were pushed in order to be finished by February 2004, for celebration of 200th anniversary of the First Serbian Uprising. The plateau covers some 40,000 m2 (430,000 sq ft).Bobi\u0107 explained that the design was influenced by the Kalemegdan Park at Belgrade Fortress. Though it was envisioned by the church and politicians as the churchyard, the authors opted for public space, a green square, or even the park. This urban square was also envisioned as the ceremonial place in case of some important events. The conceptualized \"walls\" of the square were the National Library on one side, and the Parochial Home (clergy house) and the planned Patriarchate Building on another. The building of the National library was designed by Ivo Kurtovi\u0107 and finished in 1973, while the Parochial Home, with facade of shining, white stone, is work of Mateja Nenadovi\u0107 and his sons Milo\u0161 and \u0110or\u0111e. Patriarchate Building wasn't built. When built, the Parochial Home was deemed especially problematic, including its location inside the planned green area. It was also deemed too big for its location while the Patriarchate Building, planned in its extension, was deemed even worse as it was to be three times bigger. Old Church of Saint Sava remained dwarfed between the new church and the Parochial Home. The cubical design of the Parochial Home remained almost universally disliked.The traffic around the church was organized in such way that all streets around it became one-way streets in order to make circling around it possible. Bus stop for public transportation was envisioned in the Skerli\u0107eva street, below the church, but the public transportation line was never established. A parking lot was built behind the library, but only for the library purpose. The architects reject the idea of large, either under or above the ground garage, as the regulation didn't allow it at the time, plus, the authors believed that due to the nature of the object, people should come on foot anyway. Smaller underground garages, for Parochial Home and Patriarchate Building were planned, but never built. Kru\u0161edolska Street, along which the Patriarchate Building was planned, was to be expanded to become a \"major city thoroughfare\". This never happened, but the avenue along the street was cut under the pretext of this plan. Traffic solution was also criticized as some urbanists considered that all of those smaller streets behind the church should become pedestrian zones, with galleries, coffee and sweet shops, artistic squares, souvenir shops, etc.The physical churchyard and the public space are divided by the symbolical \"living fence\", which consist only of columns, with spaces between. There is a ground floor fountain, made of glass and stone, which covers 400 m2 (4,300 sq ft) and is used as the pathway when not operational. The fountain is ornamented with lights. Entire square is used for walking, even on the grassy areas, though there are relatively narrow pedestrian paths made of Jablanica marble. To enhance its \"friendly\" appearance. the plateau is fully flat, except for the mound with the Kara\u0111or\u0111e Monument. Almost 2 m (6 ft 7 in) of earth was removed from the plateau to flatten it. Plan included the planting of 400 trees, but after the first ones began to dry soon, this was abandoned. The Russian Orthodox Church donated statue of Saint Sava which was placed on the side facing the street bearing the saint's name. There are two children's playgrounds.As the result of the accepted plan, even though the new buildings in Vra\u010dar and neighboring Neimar were to have only three floors, buildings with six or seven floors were allowed. Urban historians claim that this damaged the inherited urban tissue of Vra\u010dar and Neimar. Construction of tall buildings in the narrow, small streets destroyed the neighborhood's ambiance and spirit.\n\n\n==== 2020 project ====\nIn time, due to the lack of maintenance, the plateau deteriorated a lot. Among other things, numerous granite slabs, used for paving of the churchyard and the pathways, crumbled and fell out, leaving holes. Scandal broke out during the visit of Russian president Vladimir Putin in January 2019 because of the sloppy repairs by the city communal service. Instead of replacing the missing slabs, workers even removed some more of them and created patches, filling the holes with the asphalt concrete which became laugh of the town.In January 2020, deputy mayor Goran Vesi\u0107 announced complete redesign of the plateau and the construction of the Patriarchate Building. The project was designed by architects Branislav Mitrovi\u0107 and Dejan Miljkovi\u0107. The project wasn't adopted by the city or any experts commission or jury, but by the Serbian Orthodox Church itself. The central pedestrian pathway is to be expanded and between the library and the new Patriarchate Building an artificial forest, partially growing out of the water, was to be planted. The existing fountain will be dismantled and the new one \"will not be a classical fountain\". Though city officials claimed that there will be more green areas, from the officially presented architectural model it was obvious that there may be more trees, but less green areas overall. First, smaller phase on the outskirts of the plateau were planned for October 2020, when the church should be finally finished.The design was criticized by the Association of Serbian Architects. They stated that the planned \u201cforest\u201d would degrade the historical, symbolical and social importance by reducing the area to the profane city park. It was also noted that mass gatherings organized on the plateau (funeral processions for Patriarch Pavle and prime minister Zoran \u0110ini\u0111i\u0107, visit of Russian president Vladimir Putin) showed that the area\u2019s space is inadequate as it is. Massive Patriarchate Building, though planned from the start, is also deemed problematic. It is considered too big and robust for its location. It will also enclose the Kru\u0161edolska Street, the tenants in it, and obstruct the view from the numerous street's caf\u00e9's on the park which has a touristic value. There are calls for keeping the square-like shape of the present plateau or even expanding it as it basically functions as the extended, open air narthex of the church and should have room for as much as possible visitors as the 1990 design unilaterally took care only of local residents'n needs, neglecting the areas's spiritual and religious character.There were repeated calls for either international or domestic public design competition, instead of clandestine process by which the church itself selected design for public space.\n\n\n== Further details ==\n\n\n=== Bells ===\n\nThe church has 49 bells. Four free-swinging bells are in the SW tower. The remaining 45 are part of a carillon, the only ones in the Balkans. All bells were manufactured at the Grassmayr Bell Foundry in Innsbruck, Austria. All bells have been paid for by private donations. The fourth-largest bell is dedicated to Zoran Djin\u0111i\u0107 during whose presidency the building of the church was restarted after the Yugoslav wars. The biggest bell is a donation of Svetislav Prlin\u010devi\u0107 for which 110.000 dollars were paid. The carillon plays regularly the hymn of Saint Sava.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n \n\nThe architecture of the church has been criticised in several ways through several epochs. It was especially debated after the second competition for Saint Sava in 1926/27, when no first prize was awarded, and after Patriarch Varnava assigned Bogdan Nestorovi\u0107 (1901\u20131975) in 1930 as winner of a second prize as principal architect to synthesise his plan with Aleksandar Deroko (1894-1988). The result was now asked to resemble the appearance of the Haghia Sophia in Istanbul, which hadn't been a requirement during the competition. The guidelines required an edifice in the Serbian tradition of the late medieval period under Stefan Lazar (i.e. the five-domed churches of the Morava monasteries). Nestorovi\u0107's own competition entry, based on the most-acclaimed achievement of Serbian medieval architecture, the katholikon of the Gra\u010danica monastery, had also circumvented competition guidelines. Most of the 22 participants had deliberately chosen Haghia Sophia as inspiration. Few entries used modern designs with expressionistic features. Thus Haghia Sophia was the chosen archetype even during the official contest. Most Serbian critics considered this unfitting, as it was not in the national tradition. The universal sacral expression of the Haghia Sophia did albeit fit requirements in the heterogeneous Yugoslav state, which consisted of many different religions and nationalities.\nAfter a criticism campaign started early 1932 in the newsletter Vreme, the most important art debate in the former Yugoslavia began to unfold. It led to the intervention of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, who approved the reworked plans of Nestorovi\u010b and Deroko. Nestorovi\u0107's change of model from \"Gracanica\" to \"Haghia Sophia\" is attributed to the new demands of the king and the clerics. The architects had each to present a plaster model at 1:100 scale, that appeared on 6 and 7 January 1932 in the Politika newspaper. Later that year, a new design, the final model, was presented.\nEven after this had been adopted, the debate continued. Especially modern art-critics, analyzing the ideological circumstances of the 1930 debate, labelled its appearance clumsy, non-inventive or a reproduction.Ljubica Jelisavac, art historian and art critic from the University of Arts in Belgrade, noted that the criticism was primarily based on ideological differences between traditionalists and modernists. Thus the real architectural achievement of the building was left marginalized in the debate. It was not even a topic inside art critic and architecture circles, but it wasn't omitted, that the decision to follow a traditionalistic design programme has been partly detrimental for architectural tendencies in Serbia in the interwar period.Milica \u0106erani\u0107 defended the architectural achievement and stylistical form. She stated that the well-proportioned and harmonic interior of the church is a result of a cohesion in designing the exterior and the interior. To achieve this, the architects used a rigorously centralized arrangement, which is especially known from early Christianity. The spheric and cubic elements are especially exponentiated - domes, exterior walls, shapes of openings, the stratification of facade surfaces, capitals and columns -  with the excellent mastering of all these elements, apparent in their volume, a memorable impression is given.\n\n\"In particular, the condensated forms, the simple and subtle use of decorative sculpturing in combination with the buildings monumentality creates a sublime visualization of its powerful architectural fabric, which despite being latent hermeneutic, pleases and generates interest\"\nShe points to the fact that the greatest impression to the percipient lies in the gradual pyramidal composition of the structure, which starts harmoniously from its portals across the conchs and representatively culminates in the dome. Observable at all four sides of the wings, whereby the western, southern and northern are identical, this cascading of the masses is most interesting and has the strongest imprint on the east wing, the side of the altar. The apse is polygonal, or rather pentagonal, thereby showing on its upper surface five small conchs, which correspond to five conchs on the lower side of the east facade. Thereby a synchronized effect in the development of the masses is realized, which are linked in sophisticated wave-like structures, that break the monolithic, square-build forms of the rigid walls.\n\n\"Today St Sava can't be regarded as an architectural failure or an anachronistic, weak attempt ... The architectural artwork that impresses with monumentality, massiveness, latent hermeneutics, but also harmony of masses and a sublimity achieved by simplicity in shaping complex pyramidal structures can't be called failure.\"\nItalian art critic and professor of Architectural Design at Milan University, Pier Paolo Tamburelli, praised the building. He claimed that the building possesses an incredibly pure and dignified interior. With its large dome and with its four apses it has a unified and well-developed, profound and dense space. While based on classical examples, Tamburelli notes its own ferocity and gentleness which is expressed in the sensitivity to light. \"The beauty of Svetog Save is not limited to the huge mass of concrete, the immense weight of incomprehensible and tremendous matter; the beauty of the church is not that of a mountain of concrete but a beauty that is all architectural, made of measurements, of relationships between different places and of a delicate order that nonetheless manages to govern the matter. ... the space of Svetog Save is not sublime, it is beautiful.\"\nTamburelli notes that he wonders if it would be possible to reproduce a theory capable of re-appropriating the resources that have been used to build Saint Sava, and whether it would be possible to find all necessary design techniques to build a construction theory on it, as its classical design layout was laid in subtle casts and shades of concrete slabs.\nThe church has been compared to Sagrada Familia because of their long-running construction phase and their cultural and artistic importance. And both churches have served for liturgy during their lengthy construction.\n\n\n== Arts ==\nPo\u0161ta Srbije depicted on 14 November 2019 a floorplan and Aleksandar Deroko on a stamp to commemorate his 125th birthday.\n\n\n== See also ==\nReligious architecture in Belgrade\nList of buildings in Belgrade\nList of tallest buildings in Serbia\nList of largest Eastern Orthodox church buildings\nList of tallest Orthodox church buildings\nList of largest church buildings in the world\nList of tallest church buildings in the world\nList of tallest domes in the world\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Annotations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nAleksandar Deroko 1985: Nastavak radova na zidanju crkve Svetoga Save.

          "This church is definitely worth the effort to get to it as it's very impressive and somewhat imposing from the outside. Unfortunately because of building work there was not much to see inside. Would be interesting to see some time in the future if the inside lives up to the",

          "We planned an awesome running route from the Moskva hotel down the pedestrian street right up to Saint Sava and then onto the fortress\u2026 It was so nice to stop in, and we made friends inside and took home a souvenir religious artifact for a great memory!",
          "Temple's interior isn't completely finished, but you can see the crypt 7m below the temple and get the idea of this monumental building. Whole church is supposed to be finished by the end of 2020.",
          "The only reason I gave St Sava 3/5, was due to being closed apart from the downstairs crypt that you could view. The outside is impressive too, and the scale of this place really is breathtaking. It will be nice to return here when it is finally finished because I'm sure it will",
          "While it is clearly a stunning and beautiful piece of architecture I did feel that the billions spent on this church could be much better spent in the rest of the country, where there are signs of neglect in local churches. Symptomatic of our times maybe, but witnessing the gold",

          "The main part of the church is under massive renovation and was not open to the public... but the Crypt (in basement) was newly opened and is incredible. There is a gift shop in the main lobby but there is no admission charged or tour guide available. It Is a beautiful church!",
          "This is a beautiful church with amazing icons inside and a must see crypt underground of the temple. The architecture is lovely and lots of wonderful art.",

          "Just for the crypt alone, it's worth going. The building itself is magnificent. Much of it is under construction, but the crypt is open. It's very impressive. Can't imagine how the church will look once complete. The plan for the dome already looks quite impressive. No entry",
          "This temple is one of the best which I've visited in the last few years. It's beautiful outside and inside. You can make very good pictures from the outside. Inside has shops and you can go to the underground of the temple and see how it is.",

          "I would recommend visiting but be aware that you can only visit underground (in specific times) as the interior is under construction/renovation",
          "This temple is currently being completed (only the basement is ready). During the evenings, only a small unimpressive part of it is open to the public. The temple is located too far from the center of town and I'd certainly wouldn't bother getting here unless I had something",
          "It is a unique building, so huge, lots of gold in interior and white stone. Really beautiful.If you are in Beograd it is definitely worth visiting",

          "It is a big orthodox church. Quite imposing since you see it. In my opinion, too lush and extravagant, for what a church should be and how to present God to the people. The upper part inside was in renovation, the underground part, very luxurious, the iconostas is very beautiful.",
          "I am from Serbia and yes, I am proud for what they done to tample But common.. first floor is still not over and do much money is given, donated.. uhh",
          "St. Sava Temple is a must when going to Belgrade. This great building is beautiful inside and out. We went around the entire temple and we were in awe. Because of construction we couldn't see much of the inside, but from what we saw we need to come back to see the rest, cause im",
          "Beautiful external facade. There was construction work inside so we only saw the catacombs, but it was beautifully decorated and well lit. A great example of the Eastern Orthodox style.",
          "This beautiful church/temple is impressive and beautiful to see from outside. It is huge, the biggest ortodoks church in the world we were told, in byzantine style. Unfortunately it needs renovation and upgrading inside, so that part was not open for visiting. The work was going",
          "Although under construction we were able to glimpse some of the mosaic on the ceiling.It is supposed to be completed in a year. The marble exterior is beautiful",
          "Walked miles to get here as decided last minute to go and see it. The outside is complete but only the crypt is finished so far which can be accessed for free. Worth a visit.",
          "Very beautiful church from the outside. Sadly, the interior cannot be visited entirely, but there is a very nice crypt that is definitely worth a visit.",
          "It was a bit disappointing inside was all scaffolding but we were able to go underground part at least Beautiful frescos and icons Unfortunately our taxi ripped us off 900 rsd for 2 minutes journey but apart from that taxis are ok Just use a pink one or an old battered one",
          "Church of Saint Sava... Serbian Orthodox Church with its 82 m tower and the gold plated cross alone is 12 m from that total height. We were so fortunate for having walked up to this magnificent, historic Serbian Orthodox Church, while partaking in the Viking PASSAGE TO EASTERN",
          "This is a rare chance to see a church being built, rather than just seeing all the finished ones around the world. A century in the making-imagine the planning of each person involved, none of whom may still be alive when it is completely finished. The crypt is incredible.",
          "It's really just a big church. Not that interesting architecturally, closed for visit inside and the exhibition at the basement was underwhelming at best",
          "The church to look at is very nice and beautiful from the outside. The only thing was the pavers out front were wobbly and broken in some places which was really disappointing. Here you have this amazing church in front of you and to get to it you can nearly fall over! It just",
          "This is one of the main sights of Belgrade and it is a really beautiful church. But the surroundings are dirty and everything is under construction. Too bad, but hopefully afterwards it's even more beautiful.",
          "So impressive from the outside but we couldn't see most of it as it is being renovated. However we were allowed to visit the bottom floor which was impressive too. They anticipate it will be many years before the renovation will be completed.",
          "Absolutely beautiful and gigantic temple, bigger than any other in this part of europe. Beautiful underground golden chamber",
          "Really huge and monumental building, far larger than we expected. The main hall was under renovation when we arrived, but we got to see the BEAUTIFUL crypt in the basement",
          "We had heard so much about St. Sava Temple and were anxious to see it. The outside is gorgeous from every angle. However, upon entering, we discovered that almost the entire structure is closed while they renovate. This was a big disappointment. Do go downstairs, the only",
          "St. Sava Church is a huge, magnificent monument, even though still it is far from finished. The construction which began in 1935 is likely to go on for many years as per local grapevine. The crypt is on public display and it is full of arresting frescoes and glittering",
          "The parterre of the church is completely closed, as it's being renovated. The underground area, which is newly renovated, is truly beautiful. One doesn't get a feeling of antiquity, but it's quite dazzling.",
          "The inside is goergous buy you csn not take a picture. Thr exterior of the temple gives you the feeling of greatness. The surrounding park is really nice. You should spend 2 hours in the area",
          "The outside of this huge Orthodox Church is completed but they are still working on the inside and will be for the next year or more. The crypt was fantastic with marvellous pictures, gold leaf, icons and a large candelabra. Worth seeing now and will be excellent when finished!",
          "In the middle of the belgrade city hides an ancient and amazing giant, you cant imagine how big it is until you get close",

          "It's beautiful, although still being built. you can this architectural jem from miles away. We were looking to visit it from the inside as well but it was so dark and stuffy cause of the hot humid day we we couldn't tare it and literally went in and out.",
          "This, correctly called the \"Church of Saint Sava\" will be absolutely spectacular when finally completed. At present the crypt is completed and is truly magnificent. The church was planned for in 1905 but due to wars and conflict construction began in 1935 but ceased in",
          "Even though you can only visit the crypt at this moment, it is worth a visit. The construction started well before WWII and is still not completed, but, again, it is worth a visit - it is a most impressive edifice.",
          "since the crypt is open and it\u2019s a must see! I have traveled all over Europe, have seen many churches, castles and ruins! This is a must see if in Belgrade. It\u2019s unbelievable the details, you will be in awe.",
          "The outside of the Temple is currently being renovated as is the entrance area, don't let that put you off, go inside and down a few stars to the Crypt. This is amazing, the murals and building is well worth checking out.",
          "A lot of money seems to be invested in this monumental church . But at presented most of its parts can\u2019t be visited due to heavy refurbishment works. In any case it seems this visit is one of the Musts if Belgrad.",
          "It\u2019s a short relaxed 20 minute walk from Republic Square to Sava Temple which can also be reached by the buses or trams that run along the Main Street. Sava temple is a beautiful sight to behold especially when the water feature is on. This is intermittent so be sure to hang",
          "When complete St.Sava Temple (Hram Svetog Save) In Belgrade, Serbia will rank as one of the most beautifully decorated churches in the world. The exterior is modern with straight lines blending with curved or circular elements. The architectural details are traditional orthodox",

          "Unfortunately there is ongoing renovation work , so the main part of the temple is closed off. However, the crypt is open and it's mind blowing!!! There are so many amazing icons; chandeliers; ceiling paintings and the like. One is totally staggered by the amount of gilt and",

          "We were lucky the the mausoleum was open. The rest of the interior was blocked off. After descending a short flight of steps you enter the vast underground structure. The graphic images are extraordinary. We had a loud tourist group before us that were ushered out for being to",

          "Very unusual that the lower level - our guide called it the crypt - is finished, but the main edifice is not. The dome is beautiful. This should be an indication of how stupendous the interior will be one day. Not yet.",
          "Don't expect this to be like the Sagrada in Barcelona or Notre Dame in Paris. Construction only started relatively recently (in the late 1990s) and its not finished. And is unlikely to be finished for some years. The decorations on the dome inside are coming along but it is",

        "wiki": "Kalemegdan Park (Serbian: \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a / Kalemegdanski park) or simply Kalemegdan (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d), is the largest park and the most important historical monument in Belgrade. It is located on a 125-metre-high (410 ft) cliff, at the junction of the River Sava and the Danube. Its name is formed from the two Turkish words: Kale (meaning \"fortress\") and archaic word of Turkish origin megdan (meaning \"battlefield\").\nKalemegdan Park, split in two as the Great and Little Parks, was developed in the area that once was the town field. It provides places of rest and entertainment. Belgrade Fortress and Kalemegdan Park together represent a cultural monument of exceptional importance (from 1979), the area where various sport, cultural and arts events take place, for all generations of Belgraders and numerous visitors of the city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first works on arranging the town field Kalemegdan started in 1869 after the Turks completely withdrew from Belgrade and Serbia in 1867. Though not the oldest park in Belgrade, it is the one which is being continually groomed and attended the longest. The area of the town field was sort of a buffer zone between the fortress and the settlement outside of the Laudon trench, which separated the Turkish and the Serbian sections of Belgrade. The idea of turning the area into the park came from Belgrade's first trained urbanist, Emilijan Josimovi\u0107, who in 1869 basically constructed modern Knez Mihailova Street. Prior to that, only a short part of what is today Knez Mihailova, called \u2033Delijska street\u2033, actually existed as a street. Josimovi\u0107 successfully transformed the existing incomplete trail into the proper street which directly connected downtown Belgrade with the fortress, thus establishing a direct communication between the inner and outer neighborhoods. Josimovi\u0107 then proposed that Kalemegdan, as now Knez Mihailova ended at it, should be transformed into \"gorgeous park\", as he considered parks in general \"air reservoirs\".Later, architect Aleksandar Bugarski who was also a landscape architect continued to improve on the work of Josimovi\u0107.\nKing Milan ordered the levelling of the terrain in the eastern sections of the fortress and planting of the greenery and trees, which in time developed into the Kalemegdan Park. He was inspired by the parks he saw in France. First phase of the forestation lasted until 1875 and included planting of the trees beneath the fortress' ramparts and in the Upper Town. The arranging of the main Sava alley, above the river, began in 1886. Most extensive works in the park were done from 1890. During March 1891, the pathways were cut through, and trees were planted; in 1903 the Small Staircase was built, based on the project of Jelisaveta Na\u010di\u0107, the first woman architect in Serbia, while the Big Staircase, designed by architect Aleksandar Krsti\u0107, was built in 1928.\nArea at the top of the Little Kalemegdan, which is occupied by the Cvijeta Zuzori\u0107 Art Pavilion today, was an open fairground for a long time. The very first recorded circus in Belgrade settled here in 1845. Sources from the period claim this was the first time the Belgraders saw an elephant. In 1869, a Tunisian circus with 18 acts, performed at Kalemegdan. Later, the fairground became permanent. Tents were placed, with numerous attractions: panoptikum or collections of curios, okular (\"funny\" ocular lenses), magicians, fortune tellers, illusionists, etc. Ilija Bo\u017ei\u0107 performed here the very first Serbian puppet show, Kuku, Todore. In the mid-1920s the fair was displaced to Vo\u017edovac, an eastern suburb at the time, due to the impending construction of the art pavilion. As the new location was too distant for most of the Belgraders, the fair was soon disbanded.Actor Nikola Popovi\u0107 (1907\u20131967) formed the Artistic Theatre in 1939, in order to preserve the tradition of the private professional theatres. As the theatre had no building of its own, they performed at the summer stage in Kalemegdan. A one-off motor race was held on the roads surrounding the parks in September 1939, the Belgrade Grand Prix of which the Belgrade City Race was the feature race. It is additionally notable as the last Grand Prix to be held in Europe for many years as fighting in what would become World War II had started just days earlier to the north in Poland.\nIn the mid-1980s, open-air disco \"Crveni Podijum\" (Red Podium) was organized in Kalemegdan. It was called the \"largest open-air disco in the Balkans\"  and was known to attract up to 10,000 visitors on some nights. In the 1990s, a club \"Underground\" was opened in the cave below the park. It was known for the specific type of music: acid jazz, funk, drum and house. The club enjoyed cult status for years but after the change of proprietors, the choice of music also changed and the club began playing folk music. It was closed later.As of 2013, Kalemegdan Park covered an area of 53 ha (130 acres) and had 3,424 individual trees from 80 different tree species. Most of the trees were between 20 and 60 years old.\n\n\n== Sections ==\n\n\n=== Great Kalemegdan Park ===\n\nGreat Kalemegdan Park (Serbian: \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a / Veliki kalemegdanski park) or simply Great Kalemegdan (Serbian: \u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d / Veliki Kalemegdan), occupies the southern corner of the fortress, with geometrical promenades, a military museum, a museum of forestry and hunting, and the Monument of Gratitude to France.\n\n\n==== Staircases ====\n\n\n===== Big Staircase =====\n\n\n===== Small Staircase =====\n\n\n==== Sava Promenade ====\nA pedestrian walkway along the southwest section of the fortress is called Sava Promenade (Serbian: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0430 / Savska promenada). Due to the static problems, it was renovated in 1932\u20131933. The project was drafted by the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 architect Aleksandr Anastyevich Chelpanbaev. It connects the Big and the Small Staircase and is location of many outdoor exhibitions.\n\n\n==== Pavilion on Sava Promenade ====\nA pavilion, with an area of 77 m2 (830 sq ft) was built in the 1920s along the Sava Promenade on the southern edge of the fortress. In the 1990s several families squatted in it. By the 2010s, the object was out of use, derelict and half-ruined. Lease of the object was announced in May 2014, but was recalled. It was repeated in July 2016. On 13 September 2017, without any announcements, the object was demolished. An info table was placed later, saying that the works on the reconstruction began on 15 September, two days after the object was completely razed to the ground. After public and media protests, the city owned communal company which administers the fortress, \"Beogradska tvr\u0111ava\", announced that the terrain is being prepared for the new object, which will have an artistic and cultural, but also a catering function. However, while the \"Beogradska tvr\u0111ava\", obtained a permit from the Ministry of construction, only works which will not affect the construction of the object were allowed, not a demolition. Also, at first they refused to disclose which company is the leaseholder, claiming that the investor pays for everything, though the info board named \"Beogradska tvr\u0111ava\" as an investor. As the entire Kalemegdan area is protected by the law, the State Institute for the monuments protection also had to approve any works. They issued a permit, naming which parts of the object have to be preserved and which may be demolished but, nevertheless, the entire house was demolished. \"Beogradska tvr\u0111ava\" claimed that everything has been done transparent and by the book (biddings, planned investments, etc.) but nothing could be found in the official records.Since then, the leaseholders became known: two companies (\"Cig\" and \"Black Rock\"), which are already in the catering business, and which admitted that they planned to build a coffee shop, not to recreate an artistic of cultural pavilion. City sued all three participants, \"Beogradska tvr\u0111ava\", \"Cig\" and \"Black Rock\" and on 27 November 2017 the court declared their lease contract void. Only now became known that the contract was signed already on 5 August 2016, while \"Cig\" and \"Black Rock\" formed their consortium just one day before. Also, the works were to be finished by the mid-December 2017, after 3 months. Construction inspections visited the site several times and finally ordered the closing of the site and return to the previous state. On their side, State Institute for the monuments protection also banned any further construction. After the demolition, the wholes were dug in the ground, presumably for the new foundations, but in February 2018 the construction yard was abandoned and the dug out holes remained.Public reactions were negative as from the start it was suspected that a restaurant or a coffee shop will be built. Further controversies, apart from the hidden information and almost absolute ignorance of the reporters and public inquires and refusal of the information disclosing by the \"Beogradska tvr\u0111ava\", were sparked when the bidding paperwork became public in the meantime. Only companies already in the foodservice activities were allowed to participate, even though it was noted that the object is not connected either to the waterworks nor the sewage system, and that there are no requirements to be connected at all.Ministry of construction confirmed that Ministry of culture issued the permit for archaeological research on the location in December 2017, when the construction site was declared an archaeological dig. Archaeologists made three digs and discovered the artifacts from the Antiquity and the Middle Ages. A fact that the investor didn't provide the proper archaeological survey, which he had to do since it is obligatory when it comes to Kalemegdan, was one of the reasons named for the banning the works by the Institute for the monuments protection. Clandestine works continued in March 2019.\n\n\n==== Gondola lift ====\nIn August 2017 the construction of the gondola lift, which would connect Kalemegdan with the neighborhood of U\u0161\u0107e across the Sava, was announced by the city government for 2018. Construction was confirmed in March 2018 when the idea of a pedestrian bridge was dropped after it has been described as \"complicated\" and \"unstable\". On the Kalemegdan side, the station will be dug into the hill, 1 m (3 ft 3 in) below the fortress' Sava Promenade. There is a cave 7 m (23 ft) below the projected station, so there is a possibility that the cave will be adapted for visitations and connected to the future gondola station by an elevator. On the U\u0161\u0107\u0435 side, the starting point will be next to the Skate Park, across the U\u0161\u0107e Tower. The entire route is 1 km (0.62 mi) long, of which 300 m (980 ft) will be above the Sava river itself. Estimated cost is \u20ac10 million and duration of works 18 months, but it is still not known when the construction will begin. Already existing criticism of the project continued, from the officially used name (gondola instead of a traditional Serbian \u017ei\u010dara) and chosen location, to the route, especially the Kalemegdan station which is a collapsible locality above the cave, in the area already prone to mass wasting. Park of the Non-Aligned Countries in the neighborhood of Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac was proposed as the better solution.Cutting of 47 trees in the park, because of the gondola lift began in March 2019. The pine trees were 50 to 60 years old. With an enlarged price of \u20ac15 million and unified opposition to the project by the environmentalists, architects and urbanists, with additional cutting of over 100 trees in U\u0161\u0107e park across the river, this prompted popular protests. Citizens organized and as the city was cutting the trees, they were planting new seedlings. Drilling also began and it was announced that the stone wall will be partially demolished, too. Municipality of Stari Grad also organized protests, demolishing fences on the construction site, filing complaints and fines against city and government officials and announcing 24-hours watch on site and demolition of any structure built in the meantime. Construction of the gondola lift is prohibited by the current Belgrade's General Regulatory Plan from 2016 which stipulates that construction of the \"cables for the alternative transportation and recreation\" is forbidden in the area of the Belgrade Fortress. The project was also opposed by the Serbian branch of the pan-European Federation for Cultural Heritage Europa Nostra, Serbian Archaeological Society and the History Department of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU). In its report, Europa Nostra desrcribed the project as controversial, irreversibly compromising for the fortress value, legally questionable, without clear purpose or any proper foundation of the idea. The detailed report, compiled by Hermann Parzinger, was delivered to the Serbian government.Ministry of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure issued the permit for preparatory works on 1 April 2019. However, on 17 April 2019, Belgrade's Administrative Court temporarily halted further works citing legality of the construction permits but also saying that gondola lift may have \"irreversible repercussions for both the cultural monument and the physical environment\" and \"damage wider public interests\". Deputy mayor Goran Vesi\u0107 stated that city \"respects the court\" but that construction will continue anyway. In May 2019, both the Supervisory and the Administrative board of the Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments of Serbia conducted investigation, concluding that the permit issued by the institute was not valid as it wasn't issued following the necessary guidelines and protocols and excluding experts in the process. Though stating it will obey the court's decision, the ministry filed a lawsuit at the Supreme Court of Cassation against the decision of the Administrative Court. The lawsuit was rejected as the previous ruling of the Administrative Court is a temporary one, not a final decision, so it can't be overturned by the higher court.Vesi\u0107 then stated that the gondola will be built, despite the \"hysteria of aggressive minority\". In an atypically harsh reaction by the SANU addressed specifically to Vesi\u0107 this time, they responded to \"hysterical minority\" criticism with listing of over three dozen of national and international organizations who oppose the construction and accused Vesi\u0107 of misleading, as he always talks about the Kalemegdan Park and not the Belgrade Fortress (which consists of the [former inner] fortress and the park), while the section where the gondola should be dug in is the core of the fortress. The statement concludes with the academy stating that Vesi\u0107's reaction \"entails us to most firmly oppose to handing over the faith of the historical and cultural monuments, and identities of our cities, to the people whose ambitions and power are in obvious disproportion to their education\".Even though no proper permits have been issued and no work has been done, city already in 2018 paid 267 million dinars (\u20ac2.26 million) to the contractor, or 83.5% of the planned investment in the project for 2018, though only 42% of other planned investments were realized. In the 2020 budget, city allocated further \u20ac4 million, while Europa Nostra placed the fortress on the list of 14 endangered world heritage localities in Europe, specifically because of the gondola lift project. In March 2020, the fortress was voted one of the Europe\u2019s 7 most endangered heritage sites.\n\n\n=== Little Kalemegdan Park ===\nLittle Kalemegdan Park (Serbian: \u041c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a / Mali kalemegdanski park) or simply Little Kalemegdan (Serbian: \u041c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d / Mali Kalemegdan), occupies the area in the eastern section, which borders the urban section of Belgrade. Northern section of Little Kalemegdan Park is occupied by the Belgrade Zoo, opened in 1936. The Cvijeta Zuzori\u0107 Art Pavilion, built in 1928, is also located here.\n\n\n==== Amusement Park ====\nAn artificial pond, with small island and pedestrian bridges was formed in front of the zoo. It was destroyed during the bombing in World War II. In 1958, an amusement park (luna park) was open on that same location. Its main attraction, the Ferris wheel, was installed in 1964. In Serbian called \"Panorama\", it was produced in the United Kingdom, then transported to Italy, while it arrived in Yugoslavia in the early 1950s. It was exhibited in almost all parts of the country, before it permanently settled in Kalemegdan. In 2013 there were only 6 of its kind in the world. Soon, it became a symbol of the park and Belgrade's counterpart of the Vienna's Wiener Riesenrad. When produced, it was the state of the art of its kind. It has a special mechanism which consists of a steel cable and a separate handle which allows for the manual bringing down of the gondolas, in case of power outage.\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\nIn October 2019, citizens reported increased number of scorpions in Kalemegdan. Experts explained those are Carpathian scorpions (Euscorpius carpathicus), which are small and, though they can sting, not poisonous for humans. Biologists said that there is no reason for panic, as the number of scorpions is stable and not enlarged, adding that scorpions live in this area for 50 million years, while humans settled some 3,000 years ago.\n\n\n== Protection ==\nOn 29 February 1952 city adopted the \"Decision on protection, adaptation and maintenance of the people's park of Kalemegdan\" which set the borders of the protected areas as the rivers of Danube and Sava and the streets of Tadeu\u0161a Ko\u0161\u0107u\u0161kog and Pariska. In 1962, Belgrade's Institute for the cultural monuments protection expanded the zone to several blocks across the streets. Detailed plan on Kalemegdan from 1965 provided that, despite the immense archaeological value that lies beneath the fortress ground, basically only what was discovered by that time can be explored, restored or protected. That caused the problem both for the expansion of the park but even more for the further exploration of the fortress' underground. Best example is the Lower Town where neither the park fully developed nor the remains of the former port, which was located there, are visible.\n\n\n== Proposed tunnels ==\nWhen Emilijan Josimovi\u0107 drafted the first official urban plan for Belgrade in 1867, he envisioned a tunnel below the modern park area. This way, he planned to connect the Sava Port, in Savamala, and the Danube Port, in Dor\u0107ol.In the 20th century, a 200 m (660 ft) long tunnel have been proposed along the eastern section of the park for decades. It would actually follow the route of the Pariska Street, between the streets of Gra\u010dani\u010dka and Uzun Mirkova. This would allow for the ground level to be transformed into the plateau with a fountain, which would make an extension of the pedestrian zone of Knez Mihailova and create a continuous pedestrian zone from the Republic Square and Palace Albania to the park, the fortress and the rivers. It was envisioned by the first phase of the planned Belgrade Metro, 1973\u20131982.A bit longer version, from the Gra\u010dani\u010dka Street to monument of Rigas Feraios in the Tadeu\u0161a Ko\u0161\u0107u\u0161kog Street, resurfaced in 2012, in conjunction with the project of connecting the Savamala port and the fortress. In March 2012 it was announced that the construction will start by the end of the year. However, the planners from the 1970s version were against the execution, because they believed that the entire complex can exist only if there are already functioning subway lines, which as of 2018, are still not built. This way, the traffic problems won't be solved. Do to the price, general halt of the subway construction and constant changes in its routes, the project hasn't materialized yet.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nWhile it was inhabited, Kalemegdan formed one of the quarters in the administrative division of Belgrade. It was called Grad, and translated in the foreign languages as \"fortress\". According to the censuses, it had a population of 2,219 in 1890, 2,281 in 1895, 2,777 in 1900, 2,396 in 1905 and 454 in 1910. The quarter was abolished on 24 August 1913.With the neighboring residential area, Kalemegdan formed one of the local communities (mesna zajednica, a sub-municipal administrative unit), which had a population of 3,650 in 1981, 3,392 in 1991 and 2,676 in 2002. Municipality of Stari Grad, on whose territory Kalemegdan is located, later abolished local communities.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

          "A spectacular place in so many ways: geographically, historically, anthropologically, the best thing while here is the weather, especially in May (mid Apr, through to June). May is the time of the year when randomly the rainy cloud would wonder by and circle Kalemegdan,",

          "Sine qua non for Belgrade. Every season offers you a different breathtaking view. You also can meet with Mehmet Sokolovic Pascha at the Defterdar Gate as one of the important figures of Ottoman Turkish history. Remember Amy Winehouse's one of the latest concert was here,",

        "wiki": "Princess Ljubica's Residence (Serbian: \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043a \u043a\u045a\u0435\u0433\u0438\u045a\u0435 \u0409\u0443\u0431\u0438\u0446\u0435, Konak knjeginje Ljubice) is a palace located in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Because of its cultural and architectural importance the residence has been designated a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance.\n\n\n== History ==\nThis palace was used for living until 1829, but taking into consideration its age and state Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 had decided\nto build another residence. New residence as it had been called during its construction was larger and more exclusive than the\nMaster\u2019s as it was supposed to show the economic growth and further strengthening of power of Obrenovi\u0107 after having received the Hatisherif (Sultan's Edict) in 1830.\nThe building residence is one of the most remarkable among the preserved examples of civil architecture in the first half of the 19th century Belgrade. It was built during the period from 1829 to 1830. According to plans of Prince Milo\u0161, the residence was supposed to have a twofold purpose \u2013 to be a home for his family, Princess Ljubica and his sons Milan and Mihailo, later rulers of Serbia and at the same time a residential palace. It was built according to ideas and under supervision of Had\u017ei-Neimar, the pioneer of Serbian building and construction.\nPrince Milo\u0161 decided to hire a constructor from Voden, Hadzi Nikola Zivkovic, since there were none in Belgrade at that time\nfor there were no construction activities for years. Thus Had\u017ei-Neimar became the first builder of renewed Serbia and he managed all of Prince Milo\u0161's buildings during his first reign. Foundation started in July 1829, and the residence was finished in late autumn 1830. Princess Ljubica informed her husband in a letter from November 22, 1830 that \"they have settled in the new residence\". A new Turkish bath (hammam), with one-storey wing was built later on in 1836.\n\n\n== Location ==\nIt is situated at the corner of Kneza Sime Markovica Street and Kralja Petra Street, former Bogojavljanska and Dubrovacka Street, in one of the oldest parts of Belgrade. Just across the present Cathedral Church the Old palace of Prince was situated stretching from the entrance of today\u2019s Building of the Patriarchate to the garden of current Princess Ljubica Residence.\nPrincess Ljubica Residence is placed in a free space in the center of a garden, initially fenced by a high wall as other buildings of this type and surrounded by greenery. It had an outer yard where one could enter through the car entrance as well as the spacious inner garden toward Kosancicev venac. Princess Ljubica Residence is facing the Sava River with its main\nfa\u00e7ade dominated by a bay window of the divanhana (tur. a room used for smoking and talking).\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nResidence\u2019s base has a rectangular form and is proportionally large; it has three levels \u2013 basement, ground floor and an upper storey. The basement is covered by vaults while ground and upper storey have been built in classic brickwork and \u201dbondruk\u201d manner with timber construction filled with unbaked bricks. Four slopes roof is covered with tiles with an octagonal dome and eight chimneys on it.This building has all characteristics of city houses of Serbian-Balkan style. Ground and upper storey have a centre hall around which all other rooms are situated, showing a traditional Oriental space concept, which originates from former closed inner yard model. There are divanhanas on both floors, which is a type of today\u2019s dining room, but also a reception salon. The ground floor divanhana is separated from the rest of the area by two steps and lined by wooden columns divided with parapets. Wide stairs, leading into garden, are located immediately beside it and this entrance is wider than the one leading toward the street.The other divanhana, on the upper floor, is more intimate. It is lined with walls on the side, and it has only two columns facing the central space. Its floor was in line with the surrounding floor and they were all made out of wood. This divanhana is overviewing the street.Although leaning to Oriental tradition with its spacious concept, Princess Ljubica Residence represents the breaking point in architecture of Belgrade, because it largely indicates the influence of European architecture with its exterior design and decorative elements. These European concepts are especially notable in diversity of facades, broken roof lines, chimneys and dome, in secondary details of architectonic fa\u00e7ade treatment \u2013 pilasters, arch endings and window surroundings, profiled wreaths and some interior details. Bay windows on a fa\u00e7ade of Princess Ljubica Residence which are usually rectangular have a half-circular base.\n\n\n== Development of the residence ==\nOne of the first records about Princess Ljubica Residence is from travel-writer Otto Dubislav Pirch, from 1892: \u201cOne small part of Belgrade stands out in comparison to others, and this is one small place at the Southwest end of the upper town main street. (\u2026) Although not the largest in its form it is the most beautiful building I have seen in Serbia\u201c.1 Consistent to its intended function, the new Residence differed from the common private houses and it \u201ccontains certain characteristics which (\u2026) place it among fortified palaces of great Pashas and wealthy Beys (tur. for a leader of a small region or province)\u201c.Princess Ljubica, modest by nature, wanted to arrange a high life in the Palace. Saved correspondence between the Princess and Prince Milos from January 1, 1831 states that the Princess asked her husband \u201cto provide red socks for servants in the palace\u201c. Presumably, the Princess got a negative reply, considering that in the letter from January 24 she claims \u201cthat she can manage without any servants\u201c.\nThe main state treasury was situated in Princess Ljubica Residence during the first reign of Prince Milos. Princedom Regency held their sessions in the Residence until the return of Prince Miahilo to Serbia in 1840, who lived there until 1842.\n\n\n== From the Lyceum to the gallery and the museum ==\nThe Lyceum was afterwards situated there, then the First Grammar School of Belgrade and the Supreme Court of Appeals.

          "It was a nice place near city centre and the payment of 200rsd as entrance fee was considered worthwhile as you viewed Ottoman influences there in the past. Worth to have a look in the House.",

          "Beautiful old house, built as a residence of prince Milo\u0161 of Serbia in 1830s, used as a residence of her wife princess Ljubica. It houses amazing collection of 19th centuries rooms, furniture, china clothings and you can see how city style and living changed throughout 1800s",

          "A great place to visit! Self guided tour of the house. It is representative of the living quarters of noble and/or wealthy citizens in Belgrade from 1800 to early 1900s. Now part of the national museum, very little of the furnishings are original. But it is so well done that",

          "It was interesting to learn about the history of that dinasty , but the residence is not very interesting. With some furniture on the XIXth century Ottoman style most of it coming from a bourgeois family, the residence looks more like a merchant's house than a royal residence",
          "Great small museum, the original serbian house from 18th century, the staying place of a brave Princess Ljubica, at the begining of forming modern Serbia. Very nice show is organized where you can try serbian coffee with \"Princess\" (don't miss it, costs about 2 euros) and feel",

Nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade, a quarter of the total population of Serbia.One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vin\u010da culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and, after 279 BC, Celts settled the city, naming it Singid\u016bn. It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284. Belgrade served as capital of the Serbian Despotate during the reign of Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, and then his successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the Ottoman Empire during the siege in 1456 have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars. \nIn the period after the Serbian Revolution, Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when it was attached to the city, due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming the part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes after World War I. Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia from its creation in 1918 to its dissolution in 2006. In a fatally strategic position, the city has been battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times, being bombed five times and besieged many times.Being Serbia's primate city, Belgrade has special administrative status within Serbia. It is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and government ministries, as well as home of almost all of the largest Serbian companies, media, and scientific institutions. Belgrade is classified as a Beta-Global City. The city is home to the Clinical Centre of Serbia, one of the hospital complexes with the largest capacity in the world, and the Church of Saint Sava, one of the largest Orthodox church buildings. Belgrade hosted major international events such as the first Non-Aligned Movement Summit (1961), the first major gathering of the OSCE (1977\u20131978), Eurovision Song Contest (2008), as well as sports events such as the first FINA World Aquatics Championships (1973), UEFA Euro (1976), Summer Universiade (2009) and EuroBasket three-times.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nChipped stone tools found in Zemun show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools are of Mousterian industry\u2014belonging to Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered near the area, indicating some settlement between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic Star\u010devo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Star\u010devo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Star\u010devo. The Star\u010devo culture was succeeded by the Vin\u010da culture (5500\u20134500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Star\u010devo settlements and also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo). The Vin\u010da culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe. Also associated with the Vin\u010da culture are anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vin\u010da, the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe, and a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans known as the Old European script, which dates back to around 5300 BC. Within the city proper, on Cetinjska Street, a skull of a Paleolithic human was discovered in 1890. The skull is dated to before 5000 BC.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nEvidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from a variety of ancient myths and legends. The ridge overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, for example, has been identified as one of the places in the story of Jason and the Argonauts. In the time of antiquity, too, the area was populated by Paleo-Balkan tribes, including the Thracians and the Dacians, who ruled much of Belgrade's surroundings. Specifically, Belgrade was at one point inhabited by the Thraco-Dacian tribe Singi; following Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci wrested the city from their hands, naming it Singid\u016bn (d|\u016bn, fortress). In 34\u201333 BC, the Roman army, led by Silanus, reached Belgrade. It became the romanised Singidunum in the 1st century AD and, by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a municipium by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged colonia (the highest city class) by the end of the century. While the first Christian Emperor of Rome \u2014Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great\u2014was born in the territory of Naissus to the city's south, Roman Christianity's champion, Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), was born in Singidunum. Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate. In 395 AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun); the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 442, the area was ravaged by Attila the Hun. In 471, it was taken by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, who continued into Italy. As the Ostrogoths left, another Germanic tribe, the Gepids, invaded the city. In 539 it was retaken by the Byzantines. In 577, some 100,000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum, pillaging cities and more permanently settling the region. The Avars, under Bayan I, conquered the whole region and its new Slavic population by 582. Following Byzantine reconquest, the Byzantine chronicle De Administrando Imperio mentions the White Serbs, who had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home, asking the strategos for lands; they received provinces in the west, towards the Adriatic, which they would rule as subjects to Heraclius (610\u2013641). In 829, Khan Omurtag was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire.The first record of the name Belograd appeared on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal missive to Bulgarian ruler Boris I. This name would appear in several variants: Alba Bulgarica in Latin, Griechisch Weissenburg in High German, N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, and Castelbianco in Venetian, among other names, all variations of 'white fortress'. For about four centuries, the city would become a battleground between the Byzantine Empire, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and the Bulgarian Empire. Basil II (976\u20131025) installed a garrison in Belgrade. The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade, but, while passing through during the Third Crusade, Frederick Barbarossa and his 190,000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins.\nKing Stefan Dragutin (r. 1276\u20131282) received Belgrade from his father-in-law, Stephen V of Hungary, in 1284, and it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Syrmia, a vassal state to the Kingdom of Hungary. Dragutin (Hungarian: Dragutin Istv\u00e1n) is regarded as the first Serbian king to rule over Belgrade.Following the battles of Maritsa (1371) and Kosovo field (1389), Moravian Serbia, to Belgrade's south, began to fall to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe northern sections of what is now Serbia persisted as the Serbian Despotate, with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, the son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107. Lazarevi\u0107 built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and the west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist Ottoman conquest for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 people.In 1427, Stefan's successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107, returning Belgrade to the Hungarian king, made Smederevo his new capital. Even though the Ottomans had captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456. As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule and Austrian invasions ===\n\nSeven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by Suleiman the Magnificent, 250,000 Turkish soldiers, and over 100 ships. Subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest. Belgrade was made the seat of the Pashalik of Belgrade (also known as the Sanjak of Smederevo), and quickly became the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople. Ottoman rule introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, and the city was resurrected\u2014now by Oriental influences. In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vra\u010dar plateau; in the 20th century, the church of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.Occupied by the Habsburgs three times (1688\u20131690, 1717\u20131739, 1789\u20131791), headed by the Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy, and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon, respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time. During this period, the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations, in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by two Serbian Patriarchs, retreated together with the Austrian soldiers into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's Vojvodina and Slavonia.\n\n\n=== Principality of Serbia ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population. Traces of Ottoman rule and architecture\u2014such as mosques and bazaars, were to remain a prominent part of Belgrade's townscape into the 19th century; several decades, even, after Serbia was granted autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.During the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans. After the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Serbia achieved some sort of sovereignty, which was formally recognised by the Porte in 1830.The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of neoclassicist and baroque buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by St Michael's Cathedral (Serbian: Saborna crkva), completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular Romanticism, along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an eclecticist style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.\n\nIn 1841, Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 moved the capital of the Principality of Serbia from Kragujevac to Belgrade. During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (mahalas). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pa\u0161ina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pa\u0161ina, Bajram-begova and Laz Had\u017ei-Mahmudova. Following the \u010cukur Fountain incident, Belgrade was bombed by the Ottomans.On 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from Kalemegdan. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's de facto independence dates from this event. In the following years, urban planner Emilijan Josimovi\u0107 had a significant impact on Belgrade. He conceptualised a regulation plan for the city in 1867, in which he proposed the replacement of the town's crooked streets with a grid plan. Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimovi\u0107's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul\u2014the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia de jure still belonged\u2014underwent similar changes.In May 1868, knez Mihailo was assassinated with his cousin Anka Konstantinovi\u0107 while riding in a carriage in his country residence.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Serbia ===\n\nWith the Principality's full independence in 1878 and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly. Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to Ni\u0161, Serbia's second city. In 1900, the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants (at the time Serbia numbered 2.5 million). Still, by 1905, the population had grown to more than 80,000 and, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, disregarding Zemun, which still belonged to Austria-Hungary.The first-ever projection of motion pictures in the Balkans and Central Europe was held in Belgrade in June 1896 by Andr\u00e9 Carr, a representative of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers. He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have not been preserved. The first permanent cinema was opened in 1909 in Belgrade.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nThe First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. Austro-Hungarian monitors shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the Austro-Hungarian Army under General Oskar Potiorek on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by Serbian troops under Marshal Radomir Putnik. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, starting on 6 October 1915, Belgrade fell to German and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen on 9 October of the same year. The city was liberated by Serbian and French troops on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey of France and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Belgrade, decimated as a front-line city, lost the title of largest city in the Kingdom to Subotica for some time.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n\nAfter the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom was split into banovinas and Belgrade, together with Zemun and Pan\u010devo, formed a separate administrative unit.During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (with the inclusion of Zemun), and to 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in 1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. The Pan\u010devo Bridge, which crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935, while King Alexander Bridge over the Sava was opened in 1934. On 3 September 1939 the first Belgrade Grand Prix, the last Grand Prix motor racing race before the outbreak of World War II, was held around the Belgrade Fortress and was followed by 80,000 spectators. The winner was Tazio Nuvolari.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 25 March 1941, the government of regent Crown Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'\u00e9tat led by Air Force commander General Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107, who proclaimed King Peter II to be of age to rule the realm. As a result, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941, killing up to 2,274 people. Yugoslavia was then invaded by German, Italian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian forces. Belgrade was captured by subterfuge, with six German soldiers led by their officer Fritz Klingenberg feigning threatening size, forcing the city to capitulate. Belgrade was more directly occupied by the German Army in the same month and became the seat of the puppet Nedi\u0107 regime, headed by its namesake general. Some of today's parts of Belgrade were incorporated in the Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslavia, another puppet state, where Ustashe regime  carried out the Genocide of Serbs.During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz B\u00f6hme, the German Military Governor of Serbia. B\u00f6hme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. Belgrade became the first city in Europe to be declared by the Nazi occupation forces to be Judenfrei. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major \u017darko Todorovi\u0107 from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.Just like Rotterdam, which was devastated twice by both German and Allied bombing, Belgrade was bombed once more during World War II, this time by the Allies on 16 April 1944, killing at least 1,100 people. This bombing fell on the Orthodox Christian Easter. Most of the city remained under German occupation until 20 October 1944, when it was liberated by the Red Army and the Communist Yugoslav Partisans. On 29 November 1945, Marshal Josip Broz Tito proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade (later to be renamed to Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 7 April 1963). Higher estimates from the former secret police place the victim count of political persecutions in Belgrade at 10,000.\n\n\n=== Socialist Yugoslavia ===\nWhen the war ended, the city was left with 11,500 demolished housing units. During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the renewed Yugoslavia, developing as a major industrial centre. In 1948, construction of New Belgrade started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of Non-Aligned Countries was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built. In 1968, major student protests led to several street clashes between students and the police.In 1972, Belgrade faced smallpox outbreak, the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe since World War II. Between October 1977 and March 1978, the city hosted the first major gathering of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe with the aim of implementing the Helsinki Accords from, while in 1980 Belgrade hosted the UNESCO General Conference. Josip Broz Tito died in May 1980 and his funeral in Belgrade was attended by high officials and state delegations from 128 of the 154 members of the United Nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain, based on which it became one of the largest funerals in history.\n\n\n=== Breakup of Yugoslavia ===\n\nOn 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 were held in the city against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets to restore order. Many anti-war protests were held in Belgrade, while the most massive protests was dedicated to solidarity with the victims from the besieged Sarajevo. Further anti-government protests were held in Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud in local elections. These protests brought Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who did not belong to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia.In 1999, during the Kosovo War, NATO bombings caused damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were various ministry buildings, the RTS building, hospitals, Hotel Jugoslavija, the Central Committee building, Avala Tower, and the Chinese embassy. After the Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe, while more than third settled in Belgrade.After the 2000 presidential elections, Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people on the streets. These demonstrations resulted in the ousting of president Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as a part of the Otpor! movement.\n\n\n=== Modern Belgrade ===\n\nIn 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, an urban renewal project, was initiated by the Government of Serbia and its Emirati partner, Eagle Hills Properties. Aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy, the project hopes to revitalise the Sava amphitheatre, a neglected expanse on the right bank of the Sava river between the Belgrade Fair and the former Belgrade Main railway station. Around \u20ac3.5 billion will be jointly invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and the envisioned 'Belgrade Tower'. The project is, however, quite controversial\u2014there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, and its architecture's arguable lack of harmony with the rest of the city.\nApart from Belgrade Waterfront, the city is under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of Novi Beograd, where many apartment and office buildings are under construction to support the burgeoning IT sector, now one of Serbia's largest economic players.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBelgrade lies 116.75 metres (383.0 ft) above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, Kalemegdan, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, New Belgrade was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like Krnja\u010da, Kote\u017e and Bor\u010da, also merged with the city, while Pan\u010devo, a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of 360 square kilometres (140 sq mi), while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223 km2 (1,244 sq mi).\nOn the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m (994 ft). The mountains of Avala (511 m (1,677 ft)) and Kosmaj (628 m (2,060 ft)) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus.One of the characteristics of the city terrain is mass wasting. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. Downhill creeps are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the clay or loam soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in Karaburma, Zvezdara, Vi\u0161njica, Vin\u010da and Ritopek, in the Danube valley, and Umka, and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire Terazije slope above the Sava (Kalemegdan, Savamala), which can be seen by the inclination of the Pobednik monument and the tower of the Cathedral Church, and the Vo\u017edovac section, between Banjica and Autokomanda.\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardo\u0161, \u0106ukovac and Kalvarija. \n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBelgrade has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), according to K\u00f6ppen climate classification, with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from 1.4 \u00b0C (34.5 \u00b0F) in January to 23.0 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.5 \u00b0C (54.5 \u00b0F). There are, on average, 31 days a year when the temperature is above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and 95 days when the temperature is above 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Belgrade receives about 691 millimetres (27 in) of precipitation a year, with late spring being wettest. The average annual number of sunny hours is 2,112.\nThe highest officially recorded temperature in Belgrade was 43.6 \u00b0C (110.5 \u00b0F) on 24 July 2007, while on the other end, the lowest temperature was \u221226.2 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) on 10 January 1893.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nBelgrade is a separate territorial unit in Serbia, with its own autonomous city authority. The Assembly of the City of Belgrade has 110 members, elected on four-year terms. A 13-member City Council, elected by the Assembly and presided over by the mayor and his deputy, has the control and supervision of the city administration, which manages day-to-day administrative affairs. It is divided into 14 Secretariats, each having a specific portfolio such as traffic or health care, and several professional services, agencies and institutes.The 2014 Belgrade City Assembly election was won by the Serbian Progressive Party, which formed a ruling coalition with the Socialist Party of Serbia. This election ended the long-time rule of the Democratic Party, which was in power from 2004 to 2013.As the capital city, Belgrade is seat of all Serbian state authorities \u2013 executive, legislative, judiciary, and the headquarters of almost all national political parties as well as 75 diplomatic missions. This includes the National Assembly, the Presidency, the Government of Serbia and all the ministries, Supreme Court of Cassation and the Constitutional Court.\n\n\n=== Municipalities ===\n\nThe city is divided into 17 municipalities. Previously, they were classified into 10 urban (lying completely or partially within borders of the city proper) and 7 suburban municipalities, whose centres are smaller towns. With the new 2010 City statute, they were all given equal status, with the proviso that suburban ones (except Sur\u010din) have certain autonomous powers, chiefly related with construction, infrastructure and public utilities.Most of the municipalities are situated on the southern side of the Danube and Sava rivers, in the \u0160umadija region.

The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions.\n\nThe oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish t\u00fcrbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dor\u0107ol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau.

Many criticised the move at the time due to the cost and the size of the building, and it soon became the gathering point of the Principality's wealthiest citizens. Colloquially, the building was also referred to as the staro zdanje, or the 'old edifice'. It remained a hotel until 1903 before being demolished in 1938. After the staro zdanje, numerous hotels were built in the second half of the 19th century: Nacional and Grand, also in Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac, Srpski Kralj, Srpska Kruna, Gr\u010dka Kraljica near Kalemegdan, Balkan and Pariz in Terazije, London, etc.As Belgrade became connected via steamboats and railway (after 1884), the number of visitors grew and new hotels were open with the ever luxurious commodities. In Savamala, the hotels Bosna and Bristol were opened. Other hotels included Solun and Orient, which was built near the Financial Park. Tourists which arrived by the Orient Express mostly stayed at the Petrograd Hotel in Wilson Square.

        "wiki": "The Aeronautical Museum Belgrade, formerly known as the Yugoslav Aeronautical Museum, is a museum located in Sur\u010din, Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Founded in 1957, the museum is located adjacent to Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. The current facility, designed by architect Ivan \u0160traus, was opened to the public on 21 May 1989.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1975 JAT, the national flag carrier, donated 48 a (52,000 sq ft) of land for the museum and the museum later purchased further 2.7 ha (6.7 acres). Construction of the present building of the museum began in the mid-1970s. The construction work dragged on, so it was only in late 1988 that the setting of the first permanent exhibition began. The museum's new location was ceremonially opened on 21 May 1989.The museum owns over 200 aircraft previously operated by the Yugoslav Air Force (both royal and communist), Serbian Air Force, and others, as well as aircraft previously flown by several civil airliners and private flying clubs. It also owns the only known surviving example of the Fiat G.50. The most valuable collections are housed in geodesic glass building, with additional aircraft displayed on the surrounding grounds.\nThe museum also displays wreckage of a downed USAF F-117 Nighthawk and F-16 Fighting Falcon, both shot down during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. In addition, the collection consists of more than 130 aviation engines, more radars, rockets, various aeronautical equipment, over 20,000 reference books and technical documentation as well as more than 200,000 photographs.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nNew 'Rocket and Radar' museum exhibition will be constructed.\nExisting missiles and radars in museum:\n\nP-15 Termit\nS-75 Dvina\n\n\n=== Gliders ===\n\n\n=== Helicopters ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Piston-engine aircraft ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Jet aircraft ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of aerospace museums\nList of museums in Belgrade\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseum review by TravelDriveRace\nHistory of the Museum at Jat Airways website\nBelgrade Aviation Museum\n\u041c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458 \u0432\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430-\u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0417\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430-\u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 (\u0443 \u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438)\nAeronautical Museum-Belgrade Official internet presentation of Aeronautical Museum - Belgrade (under construction)\nVirtual tour through museum",

          "Iconic building, iconic museum exhibition..... why? because it is unique, it is eclectic, it is crossover just like Yugoslavia has been.... has u.s. aircrafts, russian,planes, as well as France jet liner, Irish aviatio artefact and of course Yugoslav produced combat planes",
          "What an iconic building. And then place some big stupid commercial on it it\u2019s facade windows to even destroy that. Just tasteless. The collection is ok but since it opened probably there was not any change or development. That's pity and makes it dusty. Very little information",
          "A very good range of aeronautical exhibits! Both ex-soviet era and western world. Covers a lot of time periods in aviation, plus the wreckage of the only F-117 shot down! Must see!",

          "A one piece of history to all aviation lovers. A must see tourist attraction which not too many people are aware of. Look for it next to the airport terminal.",
          "I cannot add much to the previous contributor from Portsmouth who has summed the museum up very well. I am an enthusiast and thought the museum was fascinating, the fact that Serbia/Yugoslavia had links with both East and West as well as an indigenous aviation industry means",
          "The Belgrade aeronautical museum is located just a few minutes walk from the bus stop at the international airport. The cheapest travel option is to take either bus 72 or A1 from the city to the airport. The museum is housed within a huge mushroom shaped building, but there",

          "For anyone who likes planes, this is a must see. From first plane days in ex Yougoslavia, to military development through years. Only one minus is that this museum is not renewed.",
          "I arrived early for my flight and walked over to the museum. I'm glad that I did! The collection is large, varied, well-kept, and quite well advertised and documented. I was only able to spend about 45 minutes there; next time I will try to stay for a few hours so I can spend",

          "This info packed museum is located about 100 meters from the steps of the airport. It looks to be in the old terminal building. Outside there are about 75 planes/helicopters of the Serbian/Yugoslavian past. Inside their are examples of aviation history and pieces of an F16",
          "We have been really satisfied with the collection of planes we saw. There are really many of them. Astonishing. The building itself needs renovation, but there is no money we heard. We missed a shop with souvenirs, maybe some playground (with planes) for children, simulators",

It is the largest and busiest airport in Serbia, situated 18 km (11 mi) west of downtown Belgrade near the suburb of Sur\u010din, surrounded by Syrmia's fertile lowlands. It is operated by French conglomerate Vinci Airports.\nThe flag carrier and largest airline of Serbia, Air Serbia, uses Belgrade Nikola Tesla as their hub. It is also one of the operating bases for low-cost airline Wizz Air. The air taxi services Air Pink, Eagle Express and Prince Aviation also call the airport their home.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== First airfields ===\nThe first airfield in Belgrade was inaugurated in 1910 in the neighbourhood of Banjica and was initially used by aviation pioneers such as Simon, Maslenikov, Vidmar and \u010cermak. Two years later a wooden hangar was built for the Serbian Air Force, which was at the time engaged in the First Balkan War against Turkey. In 1914, the Banjica airfield was the base for the Serbian Air Force squadron and the Balloon Company. After the end of the First World War, the Banjica airfield was used for airmail traffic and included the routes Novi Sad\u2013Belgrade\u2013Ni\u0161\u2013Skoplje and Belgrade\u2013Sarajevo\u2013Mostar.In 1911 another airfield was inaugurated in Belgrade, in the lower city of the Kalemegdan fortress on the location of today's Belgrade Planetarium.\n\n\n=== Airport in Pan\u010devo ===\nAn airport in the outskirts of Pan\u010devo, a town located northeast of Belgrade, began its operations in 1923 when CFRNA inaugurated the international route Paris\u2013Istanbul which was flown via Belgrade. It was on that route that same year that the first world night flight ever happened in history. The same year airmail service began operating from the airport. The Pan\u010devo airport was also used by the Royal Yugoslav Air Force academy. After the World War II the airport was used by the Yugoslav Air Force before it became the airfield of the Utva Aviation Industry after its relocation from Zemun to Pan\u010devo.\n\n\n=== Airport in Dojno Polje (New Belgrade) ===\nBecause of the distance from Pan\u010devo to downtown Belgrade, which at that time required crossing the Danube, a decision was made to build a new airport which would be closer. The airport was planned to be built just across the river Sava, in a neighborhood today known as Novi Beograd. It was opened on 25 March 1927 under the official name of Belgrade International Airport (also known as Dojno polje Airport). From February 1928, the aircraft owned by the first local airline Aeroput started taking off from the new airport. The airport had four 1,100\u20132,900 metres (3,610\u20139,510 ft) long grass runways. The design for a reinforced concrete hangar that was built at the airfield was made by the Serbian scientist Milutin Milankovi\u0107, better known for his theory of climate change. A modern terminal building was built in 1931, while the landing equipment for conditions of poor visibility was installed in 1936.Before World War II, Belgrade was also used as a stopover for some major air races, such as The Schlesinger African Air Race.Besides Aeroput, Air France, Deutsche Luft Hansa, KLM, Imperial Airways and airlines from Italy, Austria, Hungary, Romania and Poland also used the airport until the outbreak of the Second World War. Belgrade gained further prominence when Imperial Airways introduced inter-continental routes through Belgrade, when London was linked with India through the airport. Belgrade was linked with Paris and Breslau because CIDNA and Deutsche Luft Hansa, respectively, included Belgrade on its routes to Istanbul. By 1931, Belgrade became a major air hub being linked with regular flights with international destinations such as London, Madrid, Venice, Brussels, Berlin, Cologne, Warsaw, Prague, Vienna, Graz, Klagenfurt, Budapest, Bucharest, Sofia, Varna, Salonica, Athens, Istanbul, and also intercontinental links with Cairo, Karachi and India.Starting from April 1941, German occupation forces used the airport. During 1944 it was bombed by the Allies, and in October of same year the German army destroyed the remaining facilities while withdrawing from the country.The airport was rebuilt by October 1944 and until the end of the war was used by the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia as part of the Allied war effort.Civil transport by Yugoslav Air Force cargo planes from this airport was reinstated at the end of 1945. At the beginning of 1947 JAT Yugoslav Airlines and JUSTA took over domestic and international traffic, and from 1948 Western European airlines resumed flights to Belgrade.A constant increase in traffic and the beginning of the passenger jet era called for a significant expansion of the airport. In the meantime, a plan to build a residential and business district called Novi Beograd on the location of the airport was introduced. The officials decided therefore that a new international airport should be built near the village of Sur\u010din to the west. The last flight to depart from the old airport was early in 1964.\n\n\n=== Airport in Sur\u010din ===\nThe new location for the airport was on the Sur\u010din plateau, 15 km (9 mi) from Belgrade's city center. Thanks to the original planners' vision, two conditions for the airport's development were fulfilled: a location was chosen which met the navigational, meteorological, construction, technical, and traffic requirements; and the special needs for the airport's long-term development were established.Building of the new airport started in April 1958 and lasted until 28 April 1962, when it was officially opened by President Josip Broz Tito. During that period a 3,000-metre-long (1.9 mi) runway was built, with the parallel taxiway and concrete aprons for sixteen airplanes. The passenger terminal building occupied an area of 8,000 m2 (86,000 sq ft). Cargo storage spaces were also built, as well as a technical block with the air-traffic control tower and other accompanying facilities. Modern navigational equipment was installed, earning the airport the highest international classification according to the International Civil Aviation Organization.The airport stagnated during the 1990s after the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars and the United Nations sanctions imposed on the Serbia and Montenegro. The sanctions also included a ban on air travel. The airport had minimal passenger movement, and many facilities were in need of reparation.\nWith a change in government and international sentiment, normal air traffic resumed in 2001. A few years later the airport's terminal 2 underwent a major reconstruction. The runway was upgraded to CAT IIIb in 2005, as part of a large renovation project. CAT IIIb is the latest runway system, giving aircraft the security of landing during fog and storms. In 2006, the airport was renamed to Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. Nikola Tesla was a Serbian-American inventor and scientist, generally considered one of the world's most famous inventors. The construction of the new air traffic control center was completed in 2010. In 2011 Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport shares (AERO) began trading on the Belgrade Stock Exchange (BELEX).\n\n\n=== 2012\u2013present ===\nIn 2012, construction works on the modernization and expansion of the airport began. It was carried out on the expansion and reconstruction of the A-gate and C-gate departure and transit areas. As a result, an extra 2,750 square metres (29,600 sq ft) was added. Jetways at the A and C gates were also replaced.\nAlso, there were plans for the construction of a new control tower as present air control tower was built back in 1962. Future expansion of current terminals should see additional 17,000 sqm added, with terminal 2 getting additional 4 jetways.In January 2018, the Government of Serbia granted a 25-year concession of the Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport to the French airport operator Vinci Airports for a sum of 501 million euros. On 21 December 2018, Vinci formally took over the airport. For 2018 calendar year, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport had huge increase in revenue and net income, due to Vinci Airports transaction.\n\n\n== Terminals ==\nAirport two terminals have a combined area of 33,000 sqm, with Terminal 2 being larger of the two, adjacent to one another terminals are connected through a hallway. The airport has 66 check-in counters and 27 gates (of which 16 are equipped with jetways).\n\n\n=== Terminal 1 ===\nTerminal 1 (T1) was the original and only terminal when the airport was built. The terminal handled domestic flights during the time of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro, and subsequently has come to be used for international flights, mostly by low-cost and charter airlines. The terminal went through a major renovation in 2016 and 2017 when the interior was overhauled.\n\n\n=== Terminal 2 ===\nTerminal 2 (T2) was constructed in 1979 for the airport's growing passenger numbers. The terminal has a capacity of 5 million passengers. The terminal contains airline offices, transfer desks and various retail shops. The terminal went through two major renovations: from 2004 through 2006, with the arrivals and departures areas of the terminal completely reconstructed, and another one in 2012 and 2013 when there were works on expansion and overhaul of the C platform. While not officially confirmed, it is believed that the overhauled T1 will be used by foreign carriers, while Air Serbia and Etihad Airways Partners would gain exclusive use of Terminal 2.\n\n\n== Airlines and destinations ==\n\n\n=== Passenger ===\nThe following airlines operate regular scheduled and charter flights as of June 2020:\n\n\n=== Cargo ===\nThe following cargo airlines served the airport on a regular basis as of September 2017:\n\n\n== Statistics ==\n\n\n=== Traffic figures ===\n\n\n=== Passenger numbers ===\n\n\n=== Busiest routes ===\n\n\n== Services ==\n\n\n=== Security ===\nBelgrade Nikola Tesla Airport is built with only one airside hallway for both departing and arriving passengers. For that reason, security checks are located at gate entrances rather than on a central location. Passport controls are placed on two entrances and the single exit of the hallway. All passengers must pass the passport control, as there are no domestic flights. An additional security check used to exist on the hallway entrance, but it was removed in 2013 as it inconvenienced passengers and was not essential for security. In 2007 the airport prohibited cars parking next to the airport terminal, instead they have to use the car park provided, as a result of the 2007 Glasgow International Airport attack.\n\n\n=== Lounges ===\nBelgrade Nikola Tesla Airport offers a single business class lounge, Business Club, for all airlines operating from the airport. \"Business Club\", opened in 2011, covers an area of 250 m2 (2,700 sq ft), and seats 30 guests.\nAirport also has a VIP lounge, with separate check-in and passport control facilities - also used by general aviation customers. The lounge consists of three parts - the first part for leisure, second for television crew and press conferences and a third part is a presidential suite. The lounge has a total surface area of 500 m2 (5,400 sq ft). The lounge is also used as a press centre, upon the arrival of VIPs.\nAir Serbia Premium Lounge is the first dedicated airline owned and operated lounge at the airport. It is open from 5 am 8pm every day for Air Serbia/ Etihad Airways business class passengers, as well as members of the Air Serbia/Etihad Guest frequent flyer program and other passengers who purchase one time lounge access.\n\n\n== Transport links ==\n\nThe airport does not yet have a rail connection to the city. But it is planned to build such a link.\n\n\n=== Car ===\nThe airport is connected to the A3 motorway via a nearby interchange. The toll station on A3 is located to the west of the interchange, and the sections to the Belgrade downtown and the Belgrade bypass are toll-free.\n\n\n=== Bus ===\n\n\n=== Taxi ===\nLicensed taxis from the airport to the city are available.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAeronautical Museum Belgrade\nList of airlines of Serbia\nList of airports in Serbia\nList of the busiest airports in the Balkans\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport at Wikimedia Commons\n\nOfficial website\nBelgrade Nikola Tesla International Airport at Airport-Data.com",

          "Nikola Tesla Museum is a museum located in Belgrade, the main city in Serbia. The museum is dedicated to Nikola Tesla, a well-known scientist due to their discoveries in alternating current. Here, you can learn a lot about his life, their discoveries and the objects, which",
          "Although it is a very small museum, it was definitely well worth it. It\u2019s refreshing to go to a museum where you aren\u2019t there for hours as it gives you the ability to see the rest of Belgrade during the day. Every hour they have a tour happening, mostly in English with a few",
          "If you see the movie \"The Current War\" you'll get Hollywood's version of the battle between direct current and alternating current. Thomas Edison wanted DC and Tesla invented AC. Tesla is not well known in the USA - Edison gets all the attention. However, Tesla was a genius and",
          "nice objects. But only in local language. English show is given once or twice a day, so if you miss, you can't see the whole exibition.",
          "It was unfortunately dissapointing for such a great person with such great history they make the museum incredibly small.",
          "Tours last 45 minutes although it could last 15. Long waiting lines with no former information about whether the number of people required for a group to form is completed. The documentary shown is nothing special. The guide spoke English fluently but with heavy Serbian accent",
          "We went there with high expectations but the way that the experiments were made, was a childish experience!! Also, the museum must reduce the tourists that enter the museum and see the exhibits as you can't see a lot of things going...",
          "Congratulations. It\u2019s amazing, the live experiments was interesting and the most important thing is that this museum is made by a group of people who wants to promote this savant.",
          "I\u2019m a Big fan of Tesla however to go in the museum you can\u2019t buy tickets in advance or at the museum and return which resulted in me have to wait outside an for a hour in the scorching sun with no shade in side and to be told if stand in shade(out of the vaccinity) you will lose",
          "Amazing experience, is so impressive what Nikola Tesla has in his mind so many years ago , staff is polite and funny they give tour in English as well",
          "Nikola Tesla was a fascinating inventor. This museum is home to a number of Tesla's inventions and a long list of patents (and, his urn!). The tour includes several 'live' exhibitions of electrical current flows. The museum is small and cramped, but it is worth visiting for an",
          "Small, crowded, with the main event being the 15 min film about Tesla. There are experiments and although interesting, there's only 3 of them. They do have Tesla's ashes in the museum. The tickets are not expensive, but try to go during less popular hours. Also, the museum",
          "A museum in favour of a great man, Nicola Tesla which was way ahead of his time... Contains video show and tour also in English",
          "Wish there was more to see. The 15min video was interesting as well as the experiments shown. Wish the museum shop would take credit cards.",
          "the whole museum is 4 rooms at the first floor, although the interactive experiments with electricity are very interesting, and worthwhile",
          "It was a very good experience and let you know the great inventor Nikola Tesla. There is a small price but totally worth it. It starts with a documentary about his life and then the fun part starts. They let you taste some of Tesla s great discoveries.",
          "Interested and good guide, but somewhat mechanic in the presentation. The experiments would do better if they were seen by everybody, but they were interesting and fun. We were there early - no line. It was also interesting to see the personal things of Nikola Tesla - and it",

          "We waited for an English speaking tour for more than an hour only to enter small space with 60 other visitors. We were looking forward to experiencing some of Tesla\u2019s famous experiments however we could not see anything due to overcrowding. Usual tour, I understand lasts an",

          "We went to the Nikola Tesla museum primarily because our son is a fan of the great inventor and engineer. We all came out of the visit a little disappointed. The exhibition area is diminutive - three rooms - and our guide did not seem to be a great narrator, at least at the",
          "Obviously it is high season but I think the guidelines are: finish the tour as fast as possible. I expected more from the Tesla Museum.",
          "Ticket was 500RSD which included a documentary on life and achievements of the Serbian-American scientist Nicola Tesla. They have some amazing experiments like induction motor, wireless transport of electricity etc. you get to volunteer in some which is an amazing experience!",
          "Nikola Tesla is one of the greatest scientist from the mankind, so his museum is must to visit. There are many of his patents you could see in this museum.",
          "Small museum but with nice interesting features with a guided tour to show some of that genius Nicola Tesla work and inventions. I think a visit to this museum is a must for tourists coming to Belgrade. Not seeing Tesla's museum is like going to Egypt and not seeing the",
          "It is a very small museum. If you want to have an English guided tour, you need to pay 500 dinars per person. They start with an introduction video about Tesla which takes nearly 15 minutes. The volume is too high for the small room. Then, they introduce some of Tesla's patents",
          "Great discoveries and learning in this museum about Belgrade....Serbia. I will definitely return back to discover more.",
          "Interesting little museum, well worth a visit if you're interested in Tesla or science. Entry is timed so worth checking beforehand as I had to wait over an hour for the next English tour. Tour starts off with an introductory video then moves to the more technical exhibits which",
          "In Belgrade for business and had an afternoon open after arrival. This museum was nearby our hotel (15 minute walk) so decided to pop by and check it out. I had recently come to learn more about Tesla and his work (podcasts) and this was a great follow on to what I learned.",
          "Very nice very good museum!! You will learn about Tesla's experiments and you will have live experiments where you can participate as a volunteer!! Please put English subtitles",
          "Like many things I didn't know about Nikola Tesla was that he was from the Balkan peninsula and so as the former capital of Yugoslavia, did Belgrade built a museum to honor this genius. The museum teaches a lot about his life, his inventions and lets you explore his findings in",
          "It's a little small, but all of the items on display are originals which more than makes up for the size. Some cool interactions with Tesla coils and electricity. Lot's of fun",

          "While on a Danube River Cruise we visited Tesla\u2019s burial place. It was interesting to see. It doesn\u2019t take very long. The one thing that was kind of strange was the guards who seemed to watch you closely.",
          "Fascinating Museum. The practical demonstrations are very informative. We arrived for an English tour which lasts about an hour. A must visit if you are in Belgrade",
          "One of the most genius minds ever, Nikola Tesla, left all of his heritage to cousin, that bring it back to Belgrade. Now, all of those mastermind patents, presented more than a century ago, can be examined here, in museum, in vivo. Presenters will include you in live experiment",
          "Even though it was offseason (beginning of November), there was awaiting line to get inside for the english guided tour. Once inside, there were just way too many people. No seating for the little movie they show, then nothing to hear when the guide does the 5 min \"tour\". At the",
          "Very bad organization.You can not buy the tickets in advance and We wait 1h with friends to get in and after 1h group of 40 students get in oin frint od ua and there was no place for us anymore. Very, very bad organization!",
          "Nothing much to see, museum is very small, cannot even call it a museum. The only interesting thing in the museum is the Tesla coil, rest is only about Tesla's life story and his personal belongings",

          "The Nikola Tesla Museum was established by Tesla's nephew in 1952. It holds the largest collection of Tesla's works/written materials and working copies of some of his inventions. Good film at the beginning of the tour. The most fascinating exhibit was the working model of a",
          "It is a bit pricy (5000 Denar per person) for a very small museum. The included tour gives you a 15 minute film on the life of Tesla and runs some pretty dramatic electricity experiments including the Tesla coil.",
          "Museum is too small, not enough space for experience all that great machines. More inventions should be to introduced. We paid 500 dinar for per person (1 hour) but even couldn't take seat for Tesla short movie (just a simple youtube video) .Also we waited a big tourist group",
          "When I got there at about 15:30, the girl at entrance told me their guided tour starts at 16:00 17:00 and 18:00 which is 600 dinar, and it\u2019s better to take guided tour. And they don\u2019t accept card and euro. I went out to exchange enough money and went back at about 16:00, the",
          "The English guided tour to the place costs 500 Dinars which is approximately 5 Euros and that is the only option if you want to enter(300 Dinars if you take guided tour in Serbian). They show you a short film about the life of Nikola Tesla and post that show the real life",
          "We were lucky and ran into the guided tour. She demonstrated us 3 experiments of Tesla which was a very interesting experience.",
          "The museum isn\u2019t worth doing unless you go on the hourly guided tours. Very interactive and interesting. 3 star as there is no toilet! You can\u2019t have a museum without toilet facilities.",
          "It was very interesting! But you have to go the hours that the tour is on! You will hear and see a lot of things!",
          "The museum is nice interactive but the video is not of great quality would like subtitles. Our tour guide female was not good she rushed the tour her English were bad. Worth knowing who tesla is but ask for the male guide.",
          "Very small - one room has 3 induction motors, that a guide demonstrates every hour. Another room dedicated to Tesla's life (cloths, pictures of relatives...). We joined a guided tour - there's one every hour, alternating Serbian and English (schedule published on the website).",
          "Came in the afternoon to be told I had to come in an hour later for the english tour, ok, that's fine. When we were finally let in, we sat down for the 15min movie, ok. Then the lady said 'everyone stand up, there's a reservation for the group of 30 people and they need the",
          "It is very poorly organized; there are no online reservations, you can\u2019t buy the ticket half and hour before the tour. You have to wait in the line for the whole time, outside with no place to sit and a hundred other tourists. No foreign currencies, no credit cards, not a single",
          "I was lucky to see the presentation. The guide was a fast talker with a huge knowledge. Thanks for the experience",
          "The museum is very small. They have show every hour and you have to wait in line outside. Once you are inside, there are three parts: - First they show some movie. I was not among the first who entered so I just could not see anything - all sitting space was taken in the",
          "There were so many people on our tour that we couldn\u2019t see the movie. We were lucky to be at the front for the Tesla experiment but there were so many people crowded in we moved to the back to get some breathing space. Disappointing as I\u2019m sure it was interesting but having 50",
          "It's not a big musem but very interesting. It holds the tesla coil and many of Nicola's inventions. There is also a live demo on how the coil and some motors work.",
          "Small, but beautiful... It's a nice, small museum about Nikola Tesla. After reading his bio, it was a real experience to see some of his experiments live. It's an absolute must see!",
          "Composed of only 4 rooms - I was expecting so much more. The guided \u201ctour\u201d is 15 minutes of a film then a few experiments with electricity. You would be very hard pressed to even spend one hour here. I would not recommend going to this museum - you will be disappointed in how",
          "The museum is very small (only 65 people allowed). There are tours in English (difficult to visit alone + check times). You can\u2019t buy tickets beforehand so it is adviseert to arrive 20 minutes before start of the tour.",
          "I guess that one knows about Nikola Tesla and its work. The most important of invention you can enjoy during fantastic excursion and after, during 2nd part of visiting just imagine how his life was, looking at his personal things. Vladimir is excellent as guide. Thanks to",
          "The museum activities were designed very interactively, engaging visitors to take part, showing the greatness of Tesla\u2019s patents. Very well organized, beautiful experience.",
          "Some good parts including having lightning come out of your hand and other cool demos, but our tour was overly crowded and the ticket system leaves a lot to be desired.",
          "Be aware that you can not pay the entarance fee by card. It is only accepted in dinars in cash. Very small museum.",
          "500 d (approx EUR 4) might not be a lot for a serious museum, for a 70 sm room it is quite something (in Serbia). So is the walk from the city center (15 min). The creator of the small museum may have done a good job, the actual management does not. The so called \"tour\" is a",
          "Really good place to learn about Nikola Tesla. Excellent presentation, great staff and good price. In the city centre, walking distance to the main square. Presentation available in English or Serbian.",
          "I didnt like the place, its small, you can finish it almost in 15 minutes. There is nothing much to see.",
          "The museum is a small but very interesting museum. Well worth the time, but you should plan ahead. You have to arrive one hour before your tour of the museum to get your tickets. You cannot go straight in. The tickets are sold one hour (or more) before you can actually take",
          "In general, an interesting museum, mostly to those who are not very familiar with Tesla and his inventions. Also the experiments presented were very interesting to both kids and adults. On the other hand for such a great man and inventor the museum in total was far too small in",
          "It's small but it gives you a big experience in short time. At first you watch a very good documentary about Tesla and then the English speaking guide demonstrates you some amazing experiments. The guide has very good command of English and is very willing answering questions or",
          "A very intersting musem espessially for Kids in order to learn about the life and the experiments of this great scientist. I would prefer to be bigger with audio transtlation all the time. It was overcroweded and we couldn't watch everything. Also I would prefer to be more",
          "Interesting albeit small museum. The highlights are the old transformers and the chance for volunteers to touch electricity, plus personal possessions of Tesla including a beautiful pair of boots. Movie OK. The guide we had was great, with good English and a lively presentation.",
          "The museum allowed too many people in at one time for it's size. Narrated tour was a joke if you are short. The price was to high for what you got in return. The museum does not take credit cards and only takes Serbian money. We highly anticipated our visit and we were sorely",
          "Average museum, apart from the live demonstrations it is not very interesting. It is also too small, if it weren't for the crowds we would've visited it all in 15 minutes.",
          "Queuing for a long time in the sun in front of a locked door. Jostling with other people to get in as a museum attendant lets people in in groups of ten. You find yourself inside a tiny museum with 65 other people waiting for the 'tour' to begin. The tour itself is an extremely",
          "I had such high hopes for this museum. First, they kept the door locked before they would allow us inside for our tour, leaving us scorching in the hot summer sun outside. When they finally let us in, they crammed in more people than there was room for such a small museum. It",
          "Great visit for science lovers. Nikola Tesla is unique character in world science and this museum gives insight into his great work and achievements.",
          "The thing that stood out - unfortunately - is the unfriendly staff, lack of professionalism and inefficiency. Being a \u2018forward looking science\u2019 museum they don\u2019t even take card payments or foreign currency. Tours are every hour only - you queue for hours and then the tour gets",
          "After a week in wonderful Belgrade I had the misfortune to \u201cexperience\u201d the AWFUL Tesla Museum. Can you buy tickets online? No you cannot. Can you buy tickets ahead of time? No you cannot. Can you even enter the building before the tour and sit somewhere out of the burning sun?",
          "The Belgrade National Library of Serbia is just across from the Saint Sava Temple, Serbian Orthodox Church with its 82 m tower. So it is a lot of interesting things to see and study more in depth. Our tour guide from the Viking cruise, did not give us any time for actually",
          "We had a great time at the museum. The guided tour was interesting. It consisted of two parts: presentation and experiments. But you should know that admission is by hours, and usually there is a large queue. It's better to go there early so you can go in early. Doors open 15",
          "Is this a museum? I don't know. I have attached a picture of it. This place reminds me the entrance of night clubs in London. People waiting in the queue, nobody knows what is going to happen inside. The reception we have had is \"Our doors are shut at the moment, therefore, shut",
          "Nikola Tesla Museum is too crowded to be able to enjoy with a young family and even for adults for those not at the front of the demonstration it is not possible to see. there is a large queue to get in and tickets are not sold in advance so you need to turn up about 40 mins",
          "We had a great time at the museum, but you should go with a guide, because they execute demonstrations and start the machines to show you how they are intended to work. The trip takes about an hour is is definitely worth the time and money :)",
          "Overly crowded, fitting 65+ people into the worlds smallest museum. Have to pay cash, closest cash point is a 10 minute walk away. Couldn\u2019t understand the guide to do her rushing through the tour and once saying \u201care you going to be quiet or am I going to have to shout\u201d in an",
          "Ranked 33 of best things to do in Belgrade however we were shocked by this following our poor experience. Went at 18:00 but arrived 30 Mins early as knew would be busy. Staff hiding inside shouting instructions through a hole in the door- very unprofessional. Every time somebody",
          "You can safely avoid visiting this museum, even if you\u2019re interested in science or curious about Tesla. The guided tour, your only option to get in, lasts 20-25 min with a free-YouTube-grade video of 15 minutes. After that, the guide rushes forward a group of 60 people to see 4",
          "We walked through the pretty neighborhood to visit the museum Nikolas Tesla. Once we arrived we got the explanation to wait for 40 minutes across the streets and to wait for the line to start.no way to reserve or get a ticket. We were given the advise to count the people because",
          "A very disappointing visit. We waited for 45 minutes in the scorching heat because we were told to be guaranteed of a spot to enter the museum if we made sure to be within the first 65 people waiting. We were well within the first 40 people and still sent away after waiting for",
          "This is a place, where they try to fool people: they give contradictory information about their opening times. I walked to this place in vain, only to find there a closed door and about 20 other angry would-be visitors, who had received the same misinformation. There are even",
          "We did not have a long list of specific things we wanted to see upon arriving in Belgrade, but the Tesla Museum was certainly one of them. We were anxious to visit this collection dedicated to one of the world's most important scientists. The museum is very, very small, and it",
          "They show you a 15 minute video about his life (without any negative mentions) and then a young man exhausted from his day explains some Tesla inventions. It\u2019s a very small museum. They say they own the ashes of Tesla.",
          "I came here at 1:30 pm and the line was already long in the scorching summer sun. It turns out they have scheduled tours every hour, but the nearest 2pm one was the only Serbian one (just my luck). They said I could tag along and look at things at my own pace, but it tour guide",
          "We had to wait 50 minutes under 30 degrees to get in. My 74 year old mother wanted to go to the toilets and they said \u201cno toilets for guests\u201d The guy doing the tour was rude and his English was hard to understand. The rest of the stuff was also rude. Very badly organized and",
          "Everything is planned for you. On the outside of the door there is a timetable about the hours of the museum tour like for example 15 o\u2019clock serbian or 16 o\u2019clock English etc. so you can choose the right session for you and after that you can buy a ticket for yourself at the",
          "The museum is a great experience! I recommend going on one of the tours, as the staff are knowledgeable and friendly, and really make the museum a great experience as you get to see demonstrations of Tesla coils and the like in action. Really enjoyable",
          "It is a good museum to visit if you are interested in Science. It does have an entrance fee. The live demonstrations are interesting. The place is a little difficult to find if you are on your own. There are no clear signs outside.",
          "A very good place to be visited in Blegrade, not to be missed out during any one's visit. History lies there",
          "It's an excellent but small museum. There are only 2 rooms, one highlighting his inventions and the other highlighting his life. There are English tours every hour followed by a demonstration of his inventions. Very interesting and worth the visit. There is wifi but no",
          "No English tours for 3 hours when I arrived and a crowd waiting outside to enter the next Serbian one, insisted I would pay the full price to browse alone but not allowed entry and was suggested I return the next day (door blocked by insistent member of staff).... Very",

          "Guided tours in English seem to take place every 2 hours (even hours) and in Serbian every 2 hours (odd hours). I arrived at 14:45 and there was a Serbian language tour at 15:00, which would mean a wait on 75 minutes. There were people queuing at the door, but I sneaked in and",

At first I had no interest on going to the museum but after I\u2019m done the tour inside maybe because of the electricity I\u2019ve taken I was in a really good mood. Tickets are 500 dinar each and tickets include museum tour, the things",

          "The museum itself is interesting and the experiments are very fun and will fascinate evening who is not that bright in physics. Unfortunately it is a little bit a mess, first there are high chances that you have to wait outside (hopefully in good weather) for half/hour, secondly",
          "It's an interesting type of museum with some experiments which could be a nice reason to visit the museum. Unfortunatelly the museum lacks of concept/system... There are just one doors either to enter or to exit. And on the steirs in front of the museum there is awfully crowdy.",
          "Great expedition in a small space resulting an experience not so perfect that could be due to overcrowded tours. Also you cannot book or buy earlier your tickets in order to avoid the really big queue that is always in the front entrance. We met some people and created a group",
          "It is a little bit far away from the center, however it is a very interesting visit for everyone, not only scientists. The demonstration of Tesla\u2019s inventions is the best part of the visit.",
          "Nice museum dedicated to Nikola Tesla. It contains Tesla's ashes as well as some of his personal items and few sample of his inventions. The museum is small but has an english guide that explain some of the items displayed, some of them are fun to watch and you can even touch",
          "Worth checking out if you're nearby and bored. The tour was fascinating and fun but only about 15 minutes long after the video. Besides the tour there's very little of interest in the small building. There is NO bathroom. I asked where the nearest one was and was told \"I don't",

          "Has several of Tesla's effects, as well as some inventions, some of which have a live demonstration. Did feel a little 'small', especially considering how much stuff Tesla invented, but still great. Also has his ashes in an urn in the back.",

          "Went there expecting a great experiences and to see some of his inventions. Instead we were presented a video and shown some experiments which didn\u2019t impress at all. Do not recommend anyone to go there the museum is a trap",
          "It is a very tiny museum. Small couple of rooms with some artifacts. Not much information or context. Tour consists of a video and a couple of experiments. Very crowded and difficult to see anything if you are not in front. Not very impressive. There could be so much more",
          "Nice and cozy place, filled with details of Tesla and his inventions. Nice presentations and spectacular demonstrations if you dare to participate. Somebody who contributed to modern world so much, deserves larger space and more exposure. One of the greatest Serbs of all times",

          "The only disappointment was the fact that the tour was too short! Interesting introduction to Nikola Tesla.",
          "Not friendly at all. You neef a gide??? They think that everyone is to stupid to understand it. The only thing that sucked though in city",

          "A very interesting museum about Tesla with the Tesla generator being very interesting. Theres a short film about Tesla and some exhbits but I thought the museu would be larger. Worth a visit but easy to look at everything in less than an hour",

          "Overcrowded and very small museum. We had to wait for 40 minutes in cold, outside, for a visit that only took 15 minutes. The museum does not have a lot of exhibits, and because there are so many tourists, you can hardly hear or see anything. You get more information about Tesla",
          "I was very excited when I found Nicola Tesla Museum is in Belgrade, when I was planing our family trip to Belgrade. He was a fantastic man with brains that were centuries before his time. Unfortunately this museum does not do him justice. The staff is arrogant and clearly do not",
          "The museum in small and located in an elegant old building near the centre of Belgrade. Parking can be difficult to find in the adjacent city streets. Much thought and investment has gone into the exhibits and they use both traditional and more modern methods of information",
          "The stuff was VERY rude and arrogant, ulike any other place in Serbia. Especially the management!!! Presentations of Teslas work are poor. The guide doesnt care at all about visitors or if they can see, hear and understand anything at all. We could not see anything because",
          "You can watch a video with his life and accomplishments. It's not large but It's a museum you must visit.",
          "We were on a crowded guided tour in English. The movie was interesting, but the presentation of Tesla's inventions was poor. The presenter was arrogant and she seemed bored and tried just to make it over. Were expecting much more.",
          "Nice introduction, presentation and demostration from Tesla\u2019s electromagnetic current lighting up hand held lamps. Definitely have a look and you have to join the group presentations conducted once every hour.",
          "Really good place to get basic and advanced info about Nikola Tesla. There is guided tour on Serbian and English. Starting with nice presentation and few words about Nikola. After that you can practicaly test 4-5 inventions! Rest of the tour is free and you can walk thru tge",

Exposici\u00f3n itself is small and contains 2-3 rooms Don\u2019t worth to pay",
          "Very interesting exhibition, you can try some experiments to see how Tesla coil work, there is famous Tesla egg and a model of remote control boat.",
          "After first lining up for tickets we were all moved into the exhibit hall until it was full & more were still encouraged to enter, as a result, we could only hear what the exhibit was & could not see it. As the crowd moved to the next exhibit I was able to see the first exhibit",
          "Amazed by this small museum. We havent been to many museums in belgrade but this one we loved. The entrance fee is totally worth it. Everything was well organised. They show u a video for 15 mins which talks about life of Tesla and then a guide shows u how the experiments work.",
          "We have arrived at the museum on a rainy afternoon. You have to wait outside. And the staff is very rude.I gave up and stop waiting after 20 min.",
          "The tour started out slow. But be sure to volunteer when you get to the Tesla coil, as becoming a human light bulb was fun! I was surprised that it didn't shock me.",
          "Tesla - one of the most important inventors of modern times! in order to enjoy the museum one needs to have a basic idea on physics and science.",
          "This is closest one can get to the genius, one of the greatest universal science contributor! He is Serb born in Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the Museum there are a lot of his interesting (inventions) - gadgets, interesting even if you are not science fan",
          "Visited the museum after we had been at the technological museum in Zagreb, so we knew quite a lot about Tesla already. The museum is very small and almost half is devoted to demonstrating electricity. The demonstrations is only with a guide.",

          "I have booked for the 1st of December at 10am by email. When I arrived he told me that the museum was closed until 12pm because of big group of greek tourists. I tried to explain that I have booked but the guy at the gate was very rude. He also told me to come 30 minutes earlier",
          "The museum is quite easy to be found and not expensive. Though was extremely small. A few Tesla's personal belongings and some of his inventions were put in one house and that's a museum. We watched a video about his life in English which was interesting and a boy showed us a",
          "It is very small but it is fun to see Tesla\u2019s instruments working. Good for kids, but similar experiment is show to the public in the USA too. Probably free of charge.",
          "Small museum, but the movie and tour are interesting. My kids enjoyed watching the demonstrations in particular The rest of the museum was not very engaging for kids.",
          "I think it's worth the money. The exhibition is small, but gives you a peek of the brilliant mind of such a great inventor. A great way to spend an hour if you came to Belgrade on more than one day. IMPORTANT ADVICE: Before going, find out when a speaking tour starts in your own",
          "To view the museum, you need to go there and find the times for the English speaking tours, and then show up at least 15 minutes early (and preferably more) to stand in line. They direct you to a room with about 30 seats, but they sold about 40-50 tickets on the day I went, so",
          "This museum is the most expensive one in Belgrade. And the life and work of Nikola Tesla would make an interesting topic. The museum however is very small and a bit disappointing. They have tours on the top of the hour in either Serbian or English. During this tour you get to",
          "Great museum with interesting machines and experiments. The major problem is that it is a very small museum for such an important figure in engineering. You have to visit several times to be able to enter as they only accommodate small groups (i think max 30 persons).",
          "You heard of Tesla ,no its not a car or phone.Recently recognized as greatest technical mind of the century that past,he has a small museum in Belgrade.Fiew personal items some of his patents,and his ashes,enough for anyone to go and pay respect to this unique individual.",

          "Nikola Tesla Museum is one of the prominent tourist place to visit if you are in Belgrade. A 500 Serbian Dinar ticket is worth for the 40 minute guided tour-cum-memorial.",
          "Place is not big but it's worth visiting, they have English tours and interesting stuff in there, it's small so with presentation 1 hour max is enough for tour.",
          "Very well documented life story about Nicola Tesla in his museum. you have Host who will explain about Teslas experiment and some of them they will demonstrate in front of you. You will see real films about his work, also you can see his clothes and stick he was using .",
          "Quite interesting presentation of his life and work. The live experiments are worth seeing. You feel as if you are at school again. Great hands on experience. The short film about his life is something you can see on you tube too. Not very impressive after all.",
          "Highly recommended, but especially with the tour. If I had just walked through on my own I think I would not have been impressed, but the tour was very entertaining and informative and did a number of live demonstrations of Tesla\u2019s inventions which were really neat. Check the",
          "It\u2019s nice to see how Tesla is honored very well for his contribution in the world of Science.

          "This museum is a really neat experience. There were several inventions that worked and some that didn't. We had an English speaking guide that told us several stories. One was, that Thomas Edison needed money for an invention and when he went to the Queen and asked for the",
          "It's a very interesting small museum. You will find inside personal belongings and inventions of Nikola Tesla. Visit after 5 pm because it's less crowded and you can do all the experiments with the tour guide.",
          "Many devices are not functional. The idea behind is however ok. No English guidance whatsoever. Go there!",

          "Whatever you do, do not miss this!!! Make sure you look up the timings for the English tour (if you speak English) and get there! It's a brief show of the life of Tesla and they then make you do some really incredible experiments while electrocuting you!! LOL! It's really so",
          "500 Dinars is way to much for this Museum. It has only two rooms with too much people in it. The museum celebrates Tesla as a genius and never criticises his later weired ideas about transferring power over the air. You can see some cool experiments with the Tesla coil but",
          "Firstly, a visit to the musuem is via the set tours at the actual museum which run approximately every hour. It is a small musuem, hence they can only accommodate a certain number at a time. There are no facilities to pay via EFT and you must pay in the local currency (Serbian",

          "You pay entrance to see nothing of the actual demonstration since they let in 50 people into a room which is made for max. 15. Its ridiculous. On top of this, the ticket sellers are unfriendly. The absolute opposite of serbian hospitality.",
          "We heard a lot about this museum and Tesla. When we arrived we stood in front of the counter for at least a minute before the girl put her head up. She had a long conversation with another staff member. We have been to many museums in Belgrade and this was the first time we were",

          "This fantastic museum is like heaven for who loves science. You have one hour to see and also test some of his inventions. During the tour, they show a movie about his life, then the tour guide shows how some of his inventions work. You can be volunteer to try some of Tesla's",
          "I was visiting it with my friend who isn't Serbian so we went for the English tour. I really enjoyed the museum but there were so many people, and many were standing. It felt like anyone could walk in because no one checked our tickets. I think that if they reduced the number of",
          "During the English tour, it felt like there were too many visitors... much more than the number of chairs. As it was impossible to see and hear the tour guide I have asked if it is possible for a refund, which wasn't possible. The staff was nice and offered to join the later",
          "It must be the only thing that dissapoints us in belgrade.serbians are polite.helpful.kind and full of knowledge but in this museum none of these is present",
          "Left me with a desire to learn more about Tesla and his discoveries. Very interesting. Will definitely recommend.",
          "It s a nice place with lots of new things to learn and see the tesla is amazing and it s cheap. It s not far from the city center and it s near saint sava church you can go walking.",
          "The museum starts with the group watching a 15-minute video about Telsa and his life before the guide talks about some of his creations where the audience can partake. After the talk, you can look around the museum at your leisure (it's not very big) where there are more",
          "This museum is about the inventions and life of Nikola Tesla. It is a guided tour, but it is not big. They did a demonstration of one of the inventions.",
          "What to say? You should go but expect to watch a video that will make you giggle (if you can see it through the crowd) and then a tour a collection of items which may or may not have something to do with Tesla. But go anyway.",
          "The museum starts with a 10 minute video about Tesla that seems almost like a cult video. It is interesting but peppered with hilariously odd quotes such as \u2018He came from a family with a military understanding of humour\u2019 and \u2018He had an amazing ability to imagine things IN 3D!!\u2019",
          "I visites this place twice and all I can tell you is: You have to see it. Tesla was inspirative man and you can see many of is personal belongings.",
          "This is the museum of one of the greatest man in whole mankind.Nikola Tesla,genius of past and future. Museum is in the center of Belgrade and museum presentation is very good and recommendable for all those who knows Tesla work and achievement.",
          "This has been said many times but the museum is simply too small, you can only join a tour in order to see it and the group size is far too big for the space available. When there is only space for around 25 seats, why on earth would you let groups of 70 people in? At 500",
          "Worthwhile wisit, and a good set. 1/2 h good strory in english and a small enough museum to get a good grip of Tesla in short time during a city vacation. Cash only !",
          "It was a nice museum dedicated to tesla with some nice informations about him and some of his works and some replica's of his work. His ashtray and some of his cloths.",
          "The ticket price is 500 RSD but if you are student and have an ISIC card it would be about 300 RSD. The tour is interesting but not so long. Rooms are too little and you should chose the date and time when it has no crowd. Also you have to check is there your in English or not",
          "N. Tesla is very important man in contemporary history, but many people do not know him and his inventions and his role in our life. This museum is very small and just has two halls, but it's wonderful. you can go there and join in group visit tour. Time table of tours is in",
          "Really enjoyed the electrical experiments and seeing the early equipment and tools. Small museum, but learned a lot about Tesla and his contributions.",
          "We walked to this museum only to find out at the door there is a sign that the next tour starts in 2 hours so we left as we did not want to wait at the door for that long. Went back the 2nd day and got in for the 5 pm tour. Very small space, not much in there. The 45 min tour",
          "The museum of Nikola Tesla is very small, however, it was a great experience for me. First, we watched a video on Tesla's life. After that, a guide was showing us some \"machines\" explaining how they function. Not only that he explained how they work, but we also had a chance to",
          "The museum is a great experience for fans of Tesla. You get to see some of his inventions and personal belongings. You should get the tour, since it entails several experiments and an excellent movie about Tesla's life. The main attraction is probably Tesla's urn, which we",
          "First of all it's not that big. I expect much bigger. Tesla coin was not working while we there. I recommend join guided tour and take the fluerosant experiment.",
          "The concept is great but the implementation a disaster. They admitted more people than the space could accommodate for the 14.00 slot; I think I can safely say twice as many than they should. The film was well done and informative for it's length. The demonstrations could not be",
          "This is a very small museum with a few exhibits included the remains of Tesla. There is a short video and a couple of working exhibits. It can get very crowded, we could not see very much due to the numbers there.",
          "if your visit is too shorts and you have time to visit only one museum in Belgrade it should be this one.",
          "The museum is small but very informative. The short film and guided tour are worth it. When they get to the lightsabers- volunteer.",
          "A tour runs every hour and that is the only way that you can visit. Signage is not very good and they only take Up to 40 people per group and won't let you in early. Cash only and cost is 500 rsd. Well worth a visit; really interesting. Visit takes an hour.",
          "nothing special, the place is very small. the will explain about tesla and show you some old electricity instruments to make the explanations clear for you. the explanation though was good and the guy was kind to us. you can see some private stuff in a small room of Tesla",
          "All you wanna know about him is available inside this museum. Very interesting items are available to experience the science.",
          "Don\u2019t waste your time and money visiting here. You will be disappointed. This \u201cmuseum\u201d is not what we thought it would be. It is literally 3 rooms. You can only visit by doing a tour. And the staff are not helpful or friendly. The tour consists of watching a 15 minute video",
          "They will charge you 500 dinar, for an \u201cEnglish tour\u201d. The 15min video has room for about 20 seats, but they sell 70 tickets per tour . Leaving 50 sitting on the floor, or worse , in the next room unable to see the video They then take you on a \u201ctour\u201d that demonstrates",
          "This museum was a dissapointment. The employees were not kind and the guide talked to daar to follow. After visited the museum we still dont know what Tesla did. Not recommanded.",
          "Quite of an experience, i knew a great deal about the man/god Nikola Tesla, but the curator showed amazing level of information about him. Definitely worth of visit.",
          "Belgrade is not full of museums, but this is the landmark! All about the great scientist with his own aches in the place, tour guided with practical experiments from the greatest Tesla",
          "Tesla\u2019s own wardrobe is kept and well preserved. The presentation given of his inventions is just excellent and so easy to follow. It is in English. It engages the audience and truly highlights Tesla\u2019s fascinating work. A must do.",
          "The guide was very good, he clearly knew a lot about the subject but was able to explain it in a less-scientific way. It is a very small museum, so don't expect too much. Still I am glad I visited it.",
          "We went to this museum in a large group. You begin by watching a film about Tesla, then move on to another first-floor room for a demonstration that involves volunteers. You'll want to wait for a tour guide because to miss these demonstrations is to miss the core of the museum.",
          "A great museum that every tourist must visit in Belgrade. You get a live demonstration that is very nice and fun.",
          "This place is less of a museum and more of a memorial of Nikola Tesla. They start with a 10-15 min long video based on Tesla\u2019s life and go on a walk through of a few working models of Tesla\u2019s inventions( much like a visit to a science museum). Very nice experience. A must do in",
          "this museum is located in a old and very nice two story building.there is full of many inventions of nikola tesla and you can find a audio visual class for visitors especially for school children.museum is in ground floor and very small but is enough to access and know about",
          "very cool museum. has a live demonstration of Nikola teslas experiments. you hold light rods and they shock electricity through the room. awesome experience. its a bit small though in general.",
          "There was a video on the inventors life and several working demonstrations as well as a few artifacts from his life. What was there was interesting and there were many patrons lined up but it lacked a depth of content. Staff were great but it's a small Venus for such a large",
          "The experience is great. They should accept cards, they don't but no matter what you can visit the museum and use its free wifi to get more details if you need, there is a video and a presentation of Tesla's most important inventions.",
          "This museum is quite small, just the first floor of a mansion. It shows interesting information about his life and education. Additionally, you may get to see some of his inventions in action. We had failed to make a reservation, but were able to see some demonstrations being",
          "Great place to visit, if you like going in museums don't miss it. People who works there are really nice and helpful. Must go!",
          "The museum is housed in a very nice building, but sadly whilst the entrance fee wasn't expensive, i just felt that there was insufficient exhibits inside the museum to really warrant the entrance fee. We were done within 10 minutes of visiting the place.",
          "It\u2019s verry interesting in Tesla museum.There is a lecture about Nikola Tesla and his work and then a demonstration of his mashines with participation of the visitors.",
          "A very interesting museum with a lot of interactive content. I belive that children will have fun to.",
          "The museum is in a quite street near the Spanish residence. I liked the building from the outside very much. It works from 10:00 to 18:00 except on mondays when it is close.",
          "We arrived very early, but that was pointless. The seating was for \u00abreserved groups\u00bb only. As we came early we were standing among the first ones behind the chairs but still we could still not see well. The information movie was okay, but the presentation after was invisible to",
          "I enjoyed the tour but the number of people entering at one time does not appear to be controlled. We could not see the demonstrations due to the number of people in the group, it was too crowded which was disappointing. The presenter was very good. This could be so much better",
          "Housed in an elegant building the exhibit is essentially two rooms. The first deals with his personal life and possessions. After a short film there is a room with all his experiments and machines. There was no English tour available at the time of our visit. Serbs are very",
          "A shame . Very expensive and nothing to see inside. Even the people are not friendly . Run away from this place.",
          "Dont miss this museum if u are in Belgrade. We had a great tour and found out many information about one of the biggest minds. Fantastic experience",
          "With some of the inventions of Nikola Tesla. It is very interesting. The guided tour is great - while explaining the guide put some of the machines on and you can see them work and even participate. the visit of the museum takes one hour or even less.",
          "This museum not only displays personal items that belonged to Nikola Tesla, but also real models of his inventions. Also, his manuscripts are really amazing and a delight to the eyes. If you're not a scientist, it's advised to follow the guided visit in order to better enjoy all",
          "This museum is small but it holds many gems. Beyond Tesla's inventions I loved seeng his suit, handbag, gloves, personal stationery, and most of all the orb/urn containing his ashes. You have to do a guided tour, we had an awesome guide who was very skilled guide and told",
          "It's a great option if you like science and phisics. They make guided visits in English. They explain Tesla experiments and have interesting documents.",
          "You need to take a guided tour to understand the museum. This is a must. It\u2019s quite a small museum. Not much to see. Visit if you are really interested. Make sure there is no schools visiting. If so they won\u2019t open the doors and you have to wait too much.",
          "It is one of must see place in Belgrad.It is very interesting museum with technological instruments.The second storey was closed during our visit.",
          "A must see in Belgrade. Great tour with an awesome host and really in depth explanations of Teslas concepts and achievements. Also houses some of his personal items, his grave and the remote controlled boat that turned heads in it's time. A great place that honours the spirit",
          "Tours seem to run every hour but some are in English and some are not. It seems to depend on how many people want an English tour, if one will operate. We did not win the lottery and there was no English tour after lunch. The attendant said it was not worth going inside as",
          "The museum is definitely worth seeing and also the price of the ticket, but of course it is necessary to understand what Nikola Tesla actually invented or developed. Very recommandable ( also for laiks, amateurs and others).",
          "Nice museum with short presentation of tesla coil in action. Downside is that is very small in size and some exhibits don't work. For a very low entry fee it's worth a visit.",
          "We made the mistake to go on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed. We couldn't get a student discount because we didn't have an international card. Entry 500 RAD per person. We were told we could join a tour that had started 20 minutes before. That group was so large we",
          "Had to stand 30 mins in the sun before entering. When the doors open, you have to wait for everyone else to exit. As the space is too small, people end up pushing eachother. When we finally entered, we realized that the inside of the museum was also very small. Very few things",
          "The museum itself is quite small, but be sure to be part of a group to see the experiments and the film of Tesla's life.",
          "It's a rather small museum that packs a big punch. There is a 15-minute movie that tells about the life of Tesla, then they show you his experiments. There are also several artifacts from his life, as well as his death (urn is kept here), that are impressive.",
          "Any city would be proud of this museum. First of all, Nikola Tesla was one of the biggest geniusses ever. He really was the man ' who brought light to this world'. If his ideas would have been understood by his contempories our world would probably have been a better place with",
          "Loved all the hands on exhibits and the willingness of the guide to answer questions. You can look up the schedule online and make it in time for the multiple english tours each day.",
          "The museum is located in the old part of the house where Nikola Tesla once slept. It is filled with personal items and original inventions of Nikola Tesla. Most of the exhibits were collected and presented nephew Nicholas Tesle. The best to come on Saturday because then you have",
          "It is a modest museum but the tours are awesome and make it worth the visit. The students from the Faculty of Engineering volunteer to be the guides in the Nikola Tesla Museum. They also perform a bunch of practical stuff where you can see the inventions at work.",
          "We went to the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade with our children and for such a tiny museum, it has been well explored by our family. What a brilliant scientist, not recognized for such a long period of time. It is only now that his legacy is being revised and it is about time!",
          "Great experience with lots of practical experiments! A worth visit in Belgrade... Just dont ask if Tesla is serbian or croatian as they will get very angry:)))",
          "Dedicated to honouring and displaying the life and work of Nikola Tesla, this small museum located in central Belgrade has a number of interesting exhibits. You are surely going to discover and learn something new after visiting this museum, especially regarding developments and",
          "I visited the museum while in Belgrade. Good displays and information on some of Tesla's inventions.",
          "I really recommend this place. Try to catch the guided tour (they are also available in English). :-)",
          "The eternal theme of Croats and Serbs is whether Nikola Tesla is a Croat or a Serb, my opinion is that he is both and that both nations should be proud of him",
          "You will find out a lot about the great Tesla. An English speaking tour leader is available and the tour starts on certain hours. A few electrical experiments will also be conducted through the tour.",
          "They do not have a bathroom. So we had to start our visit with going to a cafe down the street. The museum is cute and has sharm, worth a visit, just pee first.",
          "If you are in Belgrade, do not miss to visit Nikola Tesla museum. There is so many exhibits over there.",
          "First of all location of museum is out of center, with misleading signs on road. Even with google map took us 1 hour to find. Exposition is very small, 2 small rooms, few items which supposedly belong to Tesla and few electric generators. They have kind of guide who demonstrates",
          "The Tesla machines were great but the museum lacks a lot of information and you can only see the machines working with a guide. Unfortunately, when we got the guided tour it was too crowded...we almost couldn't see the guide. If the limited the number of people inside I'm sure",
          "\u0130f you go to Belgrade you should visit to this museum.They have good show to explain what Nikola Tesla did all his life.",
          "Small in size but great in essence and knowledge of what Tesla did, and make sure he did a lot.Ask ANYWAY ! for an English tour and video.",
          "A small museum about the inventions and life of Tesla. I expected a larger collection. There is a big Tesla bobin and a copule of inventions such as wireless boat and Columbus egg machine. There are simulations but I didn't excited.",
          "Very nice, small museum that tells the story of a man who was way ahead of his time. We were going to skip the tour because we arrived just a few minutes too late (the tours are every hour in English), but while waiting managed to catch the tail end of the video and a few",
          "The museum tells a fascinating story of Tesla's life and inventions -- definitely worth a stop. And it prompts you to google Tesla's life -- a fascinating read.",
          "Well, we all know who Tesla is, but little ppl know that he is from Serbia, and that actualy his grave is in museum, along with lots of his invencions",
          "One of the most interactive museums I have visited. The tour begins with a 15-minute video about his life and career. Then, a guide will show you samples and reconstructions of Tesla' s divices, urging you to participate. The guides are extremely well informed and will answer",
          "Tesla museum is a must visit in Belgrade. You should get the tour in English, in order to watch the experiments live. It lasts almost half an hour. To be honest, I expected it to be a bit bigger.",
          "Wanted to learn something new and find out the things you can't find online. But it seems that it's the other way around :(",
          "We had a guide which made the visit more interesting. I was impressed by the inventions, the pictures and quotes and also how the digital equipment showed Tesla\u2019s story. The guide did experiments which were very interactive",
          "Small, but very tidy and well arranged museum. Great tour guide, made a really good impression and gave all sorts of interesting facts and details about Nicola Tesla without being boring for one bit. Highly recommended.",
          "I had Guide Tour with my relative from USA. It was very nice tour with demonstration on English language. We were very excating after musem visit.",
          "It's a small museum but has a great video with exhibits - both personal and his experiments. Plus his ashes.",
          "Nikola Tesla was one of Serbia's greatst creative minds. There are statues of him throughout the city (and country) and this small museum was established in 1952, to house all the work and documents of the scientist. The building is a neo-classical building completed in 1927,",
          "I went here with my partner because he's a science nerd. I knew the history of the great Nikola Tesla, and this great little museum has taken great pride in showing all aspects of this great man's life. You can take a guided tour in Englsh, which costs more but the entry fee",
          "For tourists from all over the world Nikola Tesla Museum is a must visit spot in Belgrade. Nikola Tesla died 1943 in a hotel room in New Yorker and transferred to Serbija .Today's Museum was open for public in 1955 ,in small Villa in Krunska street. This Museum is the only one",
          "Even though the museum is quite small, its very very interesting and i definitely recommend go there. Also, in case you have children, the science experiment presentation at the end will be very fun for the,",
          "Nice and small museum with option of visiting with the guide, would recommend to anyone, very close to Metropol Hotel.",
          "This little museum is cute...thats the best way to describe it...having said that I would say if you are into anything Elon Musk is doing you should come here!!! Tesla was a frikin genius...100 years ago? Are you kidding me...way ahead of his time no question. 20-30 max",
          "The museum offers really great experiments show, which you won't forget. But don't expect to see anything much more than this - it's about three rooms only in all the building.",
          "It's a very small and nice museum. There is a TV film shown about Nikola Tesla and then the guide does some experiments including passing 100000v of electricity through body of willing participants. Must visit",
          "I thought that this would be just a boring museum, but turns out to be very interactive. It is a small museum, so the exhibits on display are very limited, but this is made up with a short film followed by some demonstrations of Tesla's work and concept. Basically the entrance",
          "I've read many books on Tesla, so naturally wanted to go see his museum. However, when I go there, I was more than disappointed. The shove way to many people in. And only show you a couple of his inventions.",
          "The museum is quiet small and the tour is short but it offers a lot of information. You cannot walk around the museum on your own, you need to book a tour either in Serbian either in English. The tickets are not very expensive. The tour is also interactive, they will let you",
          "I am not a museum sort of a person, but this one is really good. It is small and does not take a lot of your time, but offers a great information and even practical experience of Tesla enventions. Everyone in Belgrade should go there",
          "Im a little disapointed cause i was thinking that is bigger an had a lot more to show but,was nice...they had a lot off instruments,and have some electromechanical show but not always,must know the wright hour to be there to see it.Time off visit 20-30 mins.",
          "Amazing experience. A great place dedicated to a great man. We learned so much through the presentation given by the staff at the museum. And their exipits were too impressive",
          "The English tour starts with a video presentation in a small room with seats. However they sold far too many tickets meaning half the group was standing outside the room and unable to hear or see the video or the tour guide. There was some demonstration of a motor at the",
          "I went without realising you only get the most out of it if you have a tour in a language you understand. I felt like it was a waste of a trek and money although it's not expensive. We had been through two rooms which is half the museum and then had to wait while a big tour",
          "The museum offers a presentation and a small tour, but definitely is not enough when you are not familiar with Tesla's work. It is relatively small, you can find a few inventions and some personal items. I visit it 1 h before closing, I joined the last tour which was extremely",
          "The visit to the museum does not take long (less than an hour) and is quite interesting and impressive. You must be in a guided tour that starts every hour and watch a short video in the beginning about Tesla 's life, origin and inventions. The tour is interactive with some",
          "The experiment with Tesla's coil is really fun and a very nice experiment. And you should be volunteer :)",
          "The place where you can hear and see many inventions of Nicola Tesla. Amazing exhibitions and very interesting for people of all ages",
          "It is a small but interesting museum. It has all works of Tesla viewed in a nice way . There is an English live show at 12 pm for the experiments and works of Tesla.",
          "This time I was only in the front of the museum because I have already visited that day St. Sava Temple and surroundings, was exhausted, and didn't have enough time to come in. But next time I will for sure. Everybody recommends me that the museum is fascinating. I plan to see",
          "Emphasizing again, if you will visit this place, joining the tour is a must to understand this genius better. After a short video about Tesla's life, the guide does some little experiments with electricity and basics of wireless technology. Tours start at the beginning of every",
          "I visited there while one of my family in our group was electric company director and he described every thing there and i learned many things not only from Tesla but also from edisson and their compition and many things about electiricity production and i think it is very good",
          "Entering the museum with no specific expectations...it was a great surprise. A very inspiring and passionate young guide, very interactive, great demonstrations ! Worth to learn more about a Serbian big man !",
          "You will have interesting experiments there. Tesla is a great man but does not deserve such a small museum.",
          "Even i am not big lover of museums, Nikola Tesla museum is a place that will leave you breathess. Its in city center so its easy to reach.",
          "I had no idea that Tesla is so popular in Serbia. He even features on their paper currency. His fans actually take selfies in front of his sculpture and bust in the museum, pushing others aside to get there first. Strange! He lived mostly in USA and was born in Croatia but they",

          "Even taking the guided tour the museum was very small and quick trip. Only a few exhibits really. Only go if you are a superfan of his work in my opinion.",
          "A very small museum for a larger-than-life man. Inexpensive, and really few exhibits to look at. Luckily, the tour started when we were on our way out from what would have been a 3-star experience without it. The tour made the whole experience. If you are going to Belgrade, this",
          "We didn\u2019t expect much, but unfortunately we were disapointed anyway. Most of the things in the museum were described in English, but some information was in Serbian only. There was not much of Tesla\u2019s life story, and his inventions were not described Well enough if you didn\u2019t",
          "With great respect to the man himself, I found the museum below average. It was only a couple of rooms with a few items. I finished it in half an hour. Wish there was more to see...",
          "Nicola Tesla was a great man, when you visit Belgrad you have to go to this museum. There is nothing much to see in there but they are making a 30 min life story and demostration about him that you have to enter. And ticket was only 500 rsd!",
          "This is the only authentic museum of Tesla documenting a life full of achievements with a sample of his personal belongings, the tour take from 45 mins. to 1 hour, English tours have certain times so you need to check when they are as you must attend the tour and not only",
          "Tesla's house is operated as a small museum. Amazing experience with interactive shows which help you to understand the miracle of electricity!",

          "A beautiful house and 2-3 Tesla original models(or at least they say that). You can visit only the ground floor, and after a ten minutes tour you end up outside :). The 'guided' tour means you seat on a chair and they play a movie of around 20min maybe, in english!! That's all!",
          "Very small museum, with some real clothes and instruments used by nikola himself, an explanation about his life and a little show at the end",

          "Even it's not a large structure but i's definitly it's a beautiful one. If you heard and see documentary about Tesla his life and creations, you will love this museum. There are some elements that he used to produce energy, his clothes, begs, shoes, old glasses and a screen in",

          "Glad I visited and paid homage to a genius.the museum is small and only guided once a day I was told. Staff well there is none as far as informational. Not much of a museum really , pretty weak. 20 minutes inside see it all read everything.",
          "Highly recommend to join or sign up for a English tour because they do cool experiments with Teslas machines! Apart from that I've expected a lot more of Tesla history and equipment but unfortunately there isn't..",

          "During a business trip to Belgrade I had some time to spare and visited the Nikola Tesla Museum. It was much smaller than I anticipated, but I liked it very much. There was a tour going on and I listen to the guide a bit. Since Nikola Tesla is one of the most remarkable",
          "A small museum but very good. They have a short film about Tesla, some interactive exhibit. Nice to see and understand the genius.",
          "There was a tour running but we couldn't see or hear because it was too busy. I had no idea what I was looking at but my partner did. There are no explanatory signs so if you don't already have a basic understanding it's quite boring. Nikola Tesla's ashes are there though so",
          "My colleague and I decided to visit this museum after some work meetings and once we arrived to the museum, we caught the last organized tour in English. The group was about 10 people and first for the introduction we've watched a short video about Tesla and his career. Then we",

          "I was sold a ticket to the guided tour taking place, though I never said I want it. The ticket including the ~20 minute demonstration cost almost 5\u20ac, but in Serbian it would've cost half of that... They said that there's at least 100k+ items, but really I couldn't even count to",

          "You definitely need to visit this museum with the guided tour. The tour includes a video explaining Tesla's life followed by a demonstration of three of Tesla's contraptions. The exhibition itself is quite small, and I think you need the video to appreciate most of it. For us",
          "There is literally nothing in this museum if there is no guide. They weren't sure whether the guide will come or not and they didn't say a word about it I bought the tickets. On their official website they say that the guide is included in the ticket and an English guide is a",

          "Visiting Belgrado, the city of Nikola Tesla, a visit at the Tesla museum can not be skipped. So, on a rainy afternoon we went to the museum, payed our entry fee and started the visit.... After a few minues we had seen it all. Small, only a movie, no toilet, ... Not worth the",

          "The visit to the museum was very interesting, the tour is well sustained by the hosts (with film projection and than live descriptions and demonstrations) and we considered it a useful history and especially physics lesson. Mathias who presented made us the tour was well",
          "A magnificent experience! A lot of patents of Nikola tesla were displayed. The most important part of the visiting is the demonstration of Tesla's machines and the explanation of the basics of his scientific work! Also a mini documentary movie of his life is shown!",
          "It's a small museum in and old restaurated house with a few exhibitions related to Tesla and his achievements. At the beginning of the tour (which takes place usually every 30min) you're watching a really nice movie about Tesla for about 15-20min and after that there's 20min",
          "Enjpyed the visit . But the quasi religious alement ahoe horned into the presentation really stuck with me. The demos were excellent as was the tour guides. Any fan of science shout visit.",
          "I expected much more. The museum was tiny and had a few personal collections and inventions of Tesla. The guide was interesting as he demonstrated a few of these inventions. It was also said there are about 200,000 (or 20,000. don't exactly recall) artefacts that belonged to",
          "That was one of must do for us but we got really dissapointed. First price for entrance. Web page says 250 without guide and 500 with english speaking guide. We had no option. Just 500 and never found any guide. Museum is rather small but it nas some interesting points. There is",
          "The museum is really small. there are only several inventions of him and 5-6 personal items. There were only 2 working machine. Tesla coil was exciting but everything else didn't meet the expectation. 500 dinars didn't worth it.",
          "First day we were turned away because it was \"sold out\" Second day we sent some from our group to buy tickets in advance, but it was way too crowded. While some of us got seats and could get close to the action, others were stick behind and couldn't see anything. The museum",
          "This is a museum of one of the greatest world inventors and the greatest Serbian one. It is rather small and the building does not have anything to do with him, or his life. It is a city villa built between the two world wars. The museum exhibits some of the Tesla's personal",

          "I visited the Museum on my last day in Belgrade since I wasn't too keen on visiting the museum. The museum tour is quite interactive but with not much to see. A overview of his life and work, is just about what you get to see and hear. Although a main attraction, not a must do",

          "In this museum, specialist guides present the unique stories about Nikola Tesla, while showing the authentic working models of Tesla\u2019s machines. Tesla's personal items and artefacts, including his urn, are at display as well. The exclusive \u2026",
          "A tourist trap. Only 3 small rooms really. Nothing much learnt here that you don\u2019t already know from Wikipedia, the main attraction being a some working models of induction motors and such gizmos. The kind of demonstrations you get in an \u2026",
          "Lack of content. Organization of the groups lacking efficiency: one has to wait 1 hour for a guided tour and on the weekends with the maxiumum capacity of 75 people you do not get to see the actual demonstrations properly. If an experiment \u2026",
          "Small. You need to wait for an English tour to start, you cannot go and visit on your own the museum. Without the tour, you only have access to bottom floor with very few uninteresting exponates.",
          "Interesting and cheap, but unfortunately the groups size is too big: 65 persons in such a small space, we couldn't see the movie or the experiments.",
          "Absolutely loved it. I wish my son was with me. Don't forget to buy souvenirs",
          "Nikola Tesla was a dreamer and a genious that among others wanted to distribute electrical power to the poor. The least that someone can do, to honour this amazing scientist is visit his museum.",
          "It's tiny. You must check out the times for the guided tours before you go because you can see the museum only with them. They show you a 20mins video at the begining and continue with conducting 2 experiments with Tesla's inventions. The rest is not much but if you are in the area, do stop-by.",
          "The story of Nikola Tesla in one place. Our tour guide was very good and we realy enjoyed",
          "nice historical musim about nicola tesla the exhibits are nice",
          "The museum itself is very interesting and provides nice experiments related to Tesla's inventions. Unfortunately the museum is very small and lacked a bit if organization in the guided tours.",
          "Small museum but definitely worth the short time. \nMainly a video presentation and a practical experience demonstration plus some free time to look around and check out some displays.",
          "Loved it!!! The guide was very dynamic and made the experience one of the most fun and engaging parts of my stay in Belgrade. Absolutely recommend.",
          "Nice but little than I expected. It is also fun to participate in experiments :)",
          "It \u2019s very popular and there are lots of people.  But the order is not kept.  Many interrupts.  A small museum.  Experiments using Tesla coils can be seen.  Excited with a loud sound.",
          "small but interesting. could be nice to have a tour guide in greek",
          "The visits are well organized but you need to wait for a tour to start. The staff are friendly and very knowledgeable.",
          "Museum which should be on your list of places to visit in Belgrade. Tour is not long, very brief, nicely explained and guided for everyone's understanding. Nikola Tesla was an exceptional human being and this place emits that vibe from the moment you step in.",
          "We should name it Nicola Tesla model testing centre instead of museum. Some small interesting things for kids that's it. Nothing more than that. You can finish entire museum in 30 mins.",
          "To see all those marvelous inventions was wonderful. Tour guide was very helpful and patient. But it was very crowded and people had hard time to see experiments.",
          "Interesting and and fun with live demos. \n\nWarning: will almost definitely have to queue. Doing so in the summer sun is not fun. \n\nHaving gotten in it\u2019s small and intimate. Unlike other museums you start with a video about Tesla\u2019s life and \u2026",
          "We went there and we had to wait one hour in order to get inside. This information should have been mentioned in the website.  On top of that we could not pay with credit card or cash euro. The tour lasted aprox. 45 minutes and the 15 was a video. Also there were not so many items on display.",
          "Very cool museum. Interactive. If you are looking to do it in English make sure to double check the times for guided English tours. They have a very informative 15 minute video at the start. Then the guide will show you all the cool Tesla \u2026",
          "lovely, but small",
          "Okay museum although I think it is best if you have a good understanding of electricity and magnetism which I forgot already. The demo assumed that you already did so I was really confused about how stuff worked. It was cool though but if \u2026",
          "Really interesting,  well laid out , great experiments with the Tesla coil(how forward thinking was this man!)and the video-presentation was really informative and easy to understand.Learnt a lot!",
          "Excellent experience and english tour! Highly recommending to visit!",
          "A great way to understand the breadth of Tesla\u2019s visions and inventive mind. The coil is incredible to see in person.",
          "The museum part is much smaller than we anticipated. A 15 minute movie is shown then a couple of demonstrations of Tesla's ingenuity are performed. After you walk through a few small rooms with his artifacts and his machines and end at his \u2026",
          "During the guided tour, there were too many people. The exhibition itself is small, but very nice done! Very good explanation!",
          "Very nice staff and very helpful when you ask them something. If you are visiting Belgrade and want to learn something new be sure to visit this museum.",
          "Interactive museum my friends thoroughly enjoyed",
          "Amazing place, go there! Lots of details and fragments of Nikola Tesla's life. Good, working exhibits of Tesla Coils",
          "There are very small space inside. They started with a 15' min movie about Tesla. Than shows 3 demonstrations. After you have one more room to visit. They do not have toilets. Do not accept Euro and credit cards. As well, the visit in \u2026",
          "Really cool museum with several interactive displays. You must visit this museum if you are an admirer of Nikola Tesla.",
          "It was amazing! 100% recommend you to come and visit.",
          "It's a great place to visit and see some interesting invention of the Great Nikola Tesla, with an exciting demo and live experiments on some machines. Would love to see more of his legacy though to quinch my thirst.",
          "Great interactive experiences with high voltage coils",
          "Different type of miseum. Interactive experiments arw really excellent, so you can actually see what was Tesla's work all about.",
          "This museum not enough for magnificent man Nikola Tesla, it has to be better. \u0130nfo: Museum is close on monday.",
          "There is three room. Small place but interesting. Especially teslas bobbin...",
          "Fantastic! One of the must- see amusements in Belgrade. Take care that regarding space inside staff allow only to group up to 65 peoples come in on every complete hour. In meantime it is not possible to buy tickets. VR tours are during \u2026",
          "A bit small, but very informative. It's a quick tour and they have a few working Tesla coils to play with",
          "Small museum with basic information on Nikola Tesla and several his most important  discoveries presented as small scale artifacts.",
          "The building itself is nice however inside it\u2019s quite small for 60 persons. It was too crowd but it could be interesting for less visitors at the same time for sure. We\u2019ve waited 50 mins to get inside and there were no toilets for visitors :(... so we\u2019ve got the advice to go outside. It does not worth to wait and pay for it.",
          "A small museum with Tesla's personal belongings and inventions. The price for the tour is 500rsd including short movie of Tesla achievements and few demonstrations of Tesla work. In conclusion it worths the price.",
          "Very good show ! Small, but beautyful !",
          "Here you can find different inventions of Tesla, and it's really amazing",
          "Some impressive Teslas inventions to see, all the congrats to the tour guide, Tesla deserves  much bigger museum :)",
          "Good place to visit, maybe one place which you must visit in Beograd.",
          "Very interesting! I really liked it.",
          "The special magic of Nikola Tesla is there. Tesla's machines and experiences will be described by the nice museum guides. But be prepared to wait a little in the queue before entering the house. Visiting this museum is a must for everybody interested in Tesla's life.",
          "Small museum dedicated to the most brillant scientist of his time. Short movie about his life and work, guided tour through some of his contributions to the world and his belongings. Amazing demonstration of his inventions.",
          "Small but quite interesting museum, must see for residents and tourists.",
          "the viewing is done through groups. if the group is more than 20 you will probably see nothing if you are not in the front. A limit to the size of the group will solve this.\n\nNot so much written expalanation on the items. If you miss hearing the tour guide ... you probbaly will have to look it up in google.",
          "Smaller place than I thought, but also just 500 Din. Tours start at the hour. Nice AC demonstration. The video they show during the tour could be a bit less enthusiastic.",
          "I would not recommend it, it s cheap but it is not worth the lost time. Just one floor and the main attraction is the coil.",
          "Cash only. \n\nCannot enter the museum ourselves but have to follow a guide. Guides in English are available for almost every two hours, so it'd be better to schedule your visit in advance.\n\nThe introduction of the history of Nicolas Tesla and demonstration of his electrical machines are fascinating.\n\nThe museum has only one floor.",
          "The museum is beautifully presented and has great potential. The tour was interesting but the group was so large that I couldn\u2019t see any of the demonstrations. I went on the 19:00 Saturday tour so maybe try for a weekday and an earlier \u2026",
          "Limited to only 65 people per hour only, not advertised!!! . Get there quick, but for all of 5 euros no complaints. Staff are fantastic as is the museum experience",
          "Must visit and get know better about the scientist that brought the nowday electricity to us. Beside that he was a visionar who predicted all the technology we are using now a long time ago during his lifetime. In this museum you will get the opportunity to check how his invents are functioning.",
          "Great museum,  worths to visit if you have  kids.",
          "Being a huge Nikola Tesla fanboy this was a must and it definitely didn't disappoint.\nI really can't recommend this little museum enough!!",
          "Nice, compact - which is both good and bad. There could be more stuff, but the stuff you do see is well arranged and informative. Love the Tesla coils :-D",
          "Museum costs 500 dinar and includes a 15 minute movie and guided tour. The movie was overcrowded so about half of the people had to stand and watch from far away. The museum is very small, but could be interesting if you've never seen a \u2026",
          "It was cool to see and participate experiments, but other than that, there were nothing much to learn about Tesla, very small museum, only the first floor is used. First 10 minutes of the tour was a short video about Tesla, but acoustic was not good, either speaker was not good, or I was just sitting too far from it...",
          "Quite poor expedition to honour such a great inventor as Nikola Tesla",
          "Visiting only with guide possible (groups of 50people are allowed per tour, tour every 30min, 500RDS), to wait for it would ok however with such big group not possible to see much from what is being presented by a guide, individual \u2026",
          "Much smaller than I have expected. Almost disappointment. They are trying to convince people about some conspiracy with Nikola Tesla's inventions and death. Be careful and arrive quater to any opening hour. Each hour starts the new group. You are not allowed to turn machines on. Boring.",
          "Small but interesting and educational. There's a guided tour in English at 12:00.",
          "Such a cool place! The movie about Tesla\u2019s life is so interesting and the demonstration of his electrical machines is pretty amazing. Highly recommended.",
          "Very cheap, good fun with lots of demonstrations of the devices Nikola Tesla had designed himself such as the transformers etc",
          "Very important museum in Belgrade. Dedicated to the men who gave electrical power, wireless, internal combustion motor and much more to the world - Nikola Tesla!\nThe museum is small, and you can see some of original clothes and items that \u2026",
          "Excellent place. Well worth the visit. Exciting for all ages.",
          "Waited for 30 min outside because of the crowd. Than finnaly tour started and the room was full of visitors and we couldnt see anything.. there are just 3 small rooms in whole museum.. the exepriments cant be done by yourself.. tesla \u2026",
          "Nice tour, pretty cheap. The Tesla coils are amazing. Liked the experiments they did",
          "Tiny museum. The tour starts with a 15 min movie, audio played from little home speakers and the sound was bad. The guide is nice, the tour itself discuss tesla coil in a very simple way. The museum has a few inventions and some personal belongings. No reason to go there.",
          "Just Wow! \nThis Interactive Experience is a must-try if you ever been in belgrade.",
          "Small but nice museum. The way it works since it's small is base on guided tours, only in Serbian and English are offered. You can't buy the tickets in advance and you have to pay with the national currency. The cost is 500 dinars. After you can buy very interesting books there. About Nikola Tesla obviously.",
          "The only place where youll see Tesla ashes. Very small museum for a big man.",
          "Nikola Tesla museum is a fantastic place for everyone. Everybody can see the film about Tesla 's constractio'ns,and understand why he is the father  of wi-fi...",
          "There is nothing special about it. Some prototypes, a 15 min documentary very unspecific, a 5 min demonstration and 2 rooms full of pieces of machineries and old clothes. At least, with our student reduction, it was quite cheap (English tour for students 2,5 euros, full ticket 4,90 per person).",
          "Beautiful museum. \ud83d\ude03",
          "Amazing, interactive museum with spectacular experiments you can get involved with. A nice tribute to one of the most important scientists of all time. It is however unfortunate that they only accept the ISIC student card and not any other types.",
          "Very busy, cramped. Have to have a tour which misses key exhibits and incorrectly describes others. It starts with a 15 minute video, then gives you another 15 minutes looking at a Tesla coil and remote control boat. Then you've got ten - \u2026",
          "If you r in Belgrade, dont miis it.",
          "Nikola Tesla Museum isn't another museum named to honor a great. It is literally Nikola Tesla's posthumous home. Very well curated too.  A must visit!",
          "Interesting a small journey in a brilliant man's mind",
          "Very nice place, very nice staff, closed on Mondays, so be careful. (If your visit has to be on Monday, beforehand make a reservation for a VR tour, then you can see the museum this way ;))",
          "really interesting museum",
          "A must see when in Belgrade! Nikola Tesla museum is a perfect place to get more familiar with both professional and personal life of one of the biggest scientists and inventors of our World! Be sure to follow the guided tours (there are \u2026",
          "Interesting.  An educational talk; collection includes his personal effects.",
          "A must see in Belgrade. One of the most important inventors in the world has the museum in Belgrade with an extraordinary exhibition as well as an mind blowing tours. My warm recommendation for everyone to visit this place.",
          "It could have been much better if there was guiding in english whole day through and could pay by card",
          "1-2 very good experiments,nice artifacts and cool rumors from a great invertor",
          "The best scientist.",
          "From the outside it looks like a small house and you begin to wonder whether this is a tourist trap. But once you enter and pay the minimal fee, its a place of some serious facts, knowledge and great history. The ticket is also your tour \u2026",
          "This is the museum of the man who gave you the power to use your phone and everything else",
          "The museum is fine, but not well aganced... you wait hours to go in (under the rain) and you find a little place to see the presentation video. But still very interesting story and man. Then they show you how the old machines works. That's really cool!",
          "Hands on tour with demonstrations. Good price. The entry process is more complicated than it should be. You can\u2019t go inside and have to wait outside in the heat but it\u2019s because the museum is small and there\u2019s not a lot of room in there.",
          "If you're going, definitely only go for the tour. The museum is fairly underwhelming, considering this is the country where Tesla is from and he is so highly regarded here.\nThe tour is just a 15 minute video and a couple of tesla coil \u2026",
          "Its ok, a lot of great stuff from Nikola, But at the end, when they show experiments, you cant see nothing, because its to many people inside",
          "Worth checking out if you're nearby. The tour was fascinating and fun but only about 15 minutes long after the video. Besides the tour there's very little of interest in the small building. There is NO bathroom. I asked where the nearest \u2026",
          "Very busy little museum. Make sure you check when there is a tour in your language. We were lucky to happen upon an English tour which was informative and fun with demonstrations of machinery. Worth the walk",
          "Nice, but a small museum, where you see a pair of experiments he made and a video of his life.",
          "Small, but adorable, impressive and inspiring museum which captures the essence of Tesla's greatness and ingenuity.\nThe English guided ture was nice but a bit too shallow.\nThe display of Tesla's ashes in a metal ball is astounding and honorable. \nTotally worth the time.",
          "Very nice place. Good for kids too. A timetable whit online information about entries whit English would helpful.",
          "The experiment during the tour was so cool!",
          "Great place of a great man. Guided tour is very funny because it contains live experiments. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "Great experience! You should try to be a voluntier all the Tesla's experiments!",
          "Great place to be for science enthusiasts and to get to know the legend of Nikola Tesla",
          "In my opinion it is the Best place I visited in Belgrade. It is so inspiring to hear the story of one of the greatest scientists. I was amazed by the experiment with the lightning. There are a lot of his personal items there and some of his \u2026",
          "Great staff, excellent place to learn more about Tesla's work and life!",
          "Short,not enough good explanations,to much people in group. I think group of max 15,20people will be better.",
          "Fantastic. Live demo with prototypes",
          "Only guided tours are available. Short video introduction plus some interctive presentations.",
          "Very cool tour. English tours are at certain times. No restroom here.",
          "A well done documentary with experiments only wish it had a washroom.",
          "Not have to visit its boring",
          "Really good museum, representing and teaching people what Serbian genius did to this world.",
          "Cultural scientific experience not to be missed",
          "Groups of 70 people. Maximum capacity shiuld be 20. Not enough seating place. Badly organised reservation and entrance. No toilet facilities for waiting guest. English Guide Mariya was very informative.",
          "This small museum is well worth visiting. It will only take an hour to explore and be entertained and informed by the museum staff as they introduce Tesla and some of his amazing inventions. This is the most authentic Tesla museum in the \u2026",
          "Nice place, we just expecting that it will be bigge.",
          "Learn from the greatest. Tesla's museum gives you lots of answers - and lots of new questions are asked too...",
          "Fantastic museum albeit very small. Live demonstrations are very impressive!\nCheck beforehand the slots available for visits in your language!",
          "A nice little place to get to know his more intimate details. The man is amazing not only because of his inventions but his thoughtfulness and persistence to improve people s wellbeing.",
          "Really good museum, very interesting and has historical events linked to it , so I really liked it here , and I recommend to anyone who comes to Belgrad to also visit this museum. You will also enjoy an amazing movie about Nikola Tesla's \u2026",
          "It is OK but the tour feels a bit rushed. Watch this video, here is a device check how cool it is, there some stuff over there did you see how cool they are? OK you can go now.",
          "This museum was pretty fun! You will only be admitted on a tour, which involves a 15 minute video about Tesla, then demonstrations of various bits of equipment, which is really entertaining. Expensive by the standards of Serbian museums (500 pp).",
          "The museum itself is nice. You get to see some of Tesla's belongings, but I can't shake of the feeling that the english language tour is somewhat 'shortened', but twice as expensive as a Serbian tour, mind you. There's a lot of technical \u2026",
          "It seems to me that this only scratches at the surface. On the other hand, there is much here that is not found \u00e9lsewhere. Real history!",
          "Very Informative and interesting. Just keep an eye out for hours of operation for tours. Fills up quick. Call ahead for best results",
          "A must see museum while in Belgrade and an obligation to pay your respects to the greatest inventor of all time.",
          "Nice place with a lot of info.",
          "Very interesting. I recomend going as early as possible, and if they tell you to come back half and gour before the tour starts, I recomend you stay anyway fr the entire hour. It gets crowded very quickly. Unfortunately, from what they told us, you cannot book in weekends, so you're going to have to wait.",
          "The museum showcases some of the greatest work by Nikola Tesla and houses the remains of him in the urn. Also has some collection of his tools and work.",
          "If you enter the museum we also think something discovers a man his power feel there. The Nikola Tesla Museum is a science museum located in the central area of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is dedicated to honouring and displaying \u2026",
          "Is a must do in Belgrade. You need to learn and see for yourself all the  amazing things this men do in the history of technology and science.",
          "Absolutely recommend it! If you are not familiar with the work of the great inventor you should definitely visit this museum. You can see a few of Nikola Tesla's machines and the tour with the demonstration is just great! I am a fan of his work but there were some very interesting facts that surprised me a lot.",
          "Exhibitions are nice. However, 60 people in one tour is too much - you cannot see anything because of the crowd - so disappointing. On top of it, student ISIC discount sign was after the selling counter.",
          "It was a cool experience! I strongly suggest anyone who visit Belgrade to check out this place. You learn and experience much more about one of the greatest minds in the earth. The exhibition was well prepared and worth visit. Entrance fee is 500 dinar and only cash is accepted.",
          "Great museum representing a man that was 100 years ahead of his time. Some of his eventions will prove beneficial in the future. Thoroughly enjoyed & recommend.",
          "They have Tesla\u2019s remains and personal effects, including a massive Tesla coil that they operate for you during the tour while audience members hold florescent light bulbs. They turn off the lights so you can see the  fluorescent tubes \u2026",
          "You can\u2019t buy tickets for specific time. Instead they offer you to stand outside in a line to get in ones an hour ( 37 degrees outside!)",
          "The rooms are a little small, but the theme is important.",
          "Nice place! Better to make a phonecall before you arrived! Many groups are going there! Just ask if there place for you!",
          "Everything perfect apart from the sound of the video was shocking. Need to move the speaker to the front so it's more audible! Everyone I talked to complained about this. Top priority to fix!!!!",
          "A very cool little museum! An hour or so is plenty but this is a great hour - make sure you make it to the tour! You get to see a movie about Tesla and then there is a very cool demonstration! Both kids as adults will love it!",
          "We were kicked out from the group because our litle kid was too noisy (not even crying). It is not posible to visit without a tour so not suitble for noisy families. They didnt give money back, so lost of money and time.",
          "I was expecting much more. It was only two rooms that had the inventions of Tesla.",
          "Fantastic place to visit! \nDo not miss this  museum. Great explanation about the inventor, really interesting tour.",
          "Good but a bit small museum",
          "Small museum, a bit to crowded. It does not pay homage enough to the person that invented electrity. Interesting but a bit desapointing",
          "Short but very good. Excellent quotes in the laid interactive screen at the end :)",
          "Nice. But very small with very small exhibition",
          "So much information and fun",
          "Closed on mondays. Carry cash with u. Entrance fee 600 dnr.",
          "Cool and interactive museum. The tour guides were very pleasant and the staff in general were quite friendly. The museum is informative and there are some really cool experiments with transformators.",
          "Great place. Every hour there is a show. Arrive in the place at least half an hour earlier for every show",
          "important museum in belgrade- includes a movie \ud83c\udfa5 and a short guidence",
          "It has guided museum tour, There is limitation for each group. It would be better if you reserve your place before going there. It is 500 Serbian dinars for English guided tour.",
          "Poor Tesla is rolling in his grave(or urn). Entry 500 rsd, doesn't get you much. 15-20 minute video presentation followed by short display of Tesla coil and stroll around the museum size of a house with very little on display. The video \u2026",
          "Very nice museum, my daughter loved it",
          "Interactive presentation by enthusiastic and friendly team.Tribute to an outstanding Tesla genius. It features the famous alternate current generator but also the first and the original remote controled ship. Fun and educational way to \u2026",
          "Awesome museum. I would suggest to take tour instead of self exploration as you can learn. 500 din english tour and the guys did it pretty well! Unfortunately coal did not work for us, so we may return back next time again! Hope to get discount ;-)",
          "Lots of fun for 5 Euros. It shows live demo of Tesla coil and his remote controller boat",
          "We can enjoy the experiments practically. The guide is performed in English. There are also Nikola Tesla's belongings.\nIt wad good as overall, but the building and exhibition space were quite small as for the entry fee. It needs only    30 \u2026",
          "As expected provides a fascinating insight into Nikola Tesla, his life and his work",

          "Panegeric of a genial creator, but quite small and most of the experiments canot be used.\nIf you never played with Tesla's experiments, worth a visit, otherwise you are better with the Parisian Cit\u00e9 de la d\u00e9couverte",

          "Very positive experience and great presentation. Definitely worth visiting!",

          "The service was bad and after reading the review I don't think the museum has any intention for improvement for their stupid arrangement. Still require people queueing outside under 40 degree sun, also they just informed you they closed at 7 becoz the guided tour is full after 30min waiting outside,and just come back tmr.",
          "Place is so small and it take just 50-60 people at once a time. So if more than 60 people exist, you have to wait at least 30-45 min.  Also duty people push you to watch a movie about tesla's live. Except for these if you can enter as a \u2026",

          "Everyone paid but only half of the visitors could sit to 'watch' the movie. Listening was not a lesser challenge: just two iphone speakers. Subtitles in Turkish (if you could see) = hopeless. A Discovery channel movie would do best, you \u2026",

          "A decent museum but quite small. I wasn't impressed much by what I saw -  the 15 mins documentary and a couple of his inventions. His personal belongings (hats, suits, shoes, fountain pen, diplomas...) on the other hand were much more \u2026",

          "It has surpassed my initial expectations. The entry fee is very accessible in comparison with a lot of other museums (about 4 euros). The film, stories and experiments provided are very interesting. Experiments are interactive. The tour guide is very funny! Recomended stop while in Belgrade.",
          "Very great experience. Only thing I think could use improvement is having more tours daily with less people. There is to many people At once for everyone to see and hear the tour guid explaining all his work. \nOther than that it was great. Highly recommend.",

Tesla's ashes were preserved in the museum as well. Spoiler alert, they do an experiment before your eyes. It will blow your mind. Awesome.",
          "They have an appallingly bad system for entry; you cannot buy a ticket for a specific time slot, and you have to wait in line outside, while more and more people show up. This, by itself, wouldn't be so bad, if there was a proper waiting \u2026",
          "Nice place where you can learn a lot about Nikola Tesla and his legacy. Very great service, multiple language tours and lovely staff. Would go again.",
          "It was a great visit and I am glad that we stopped there",
          "Worst museum I've been: expensive for what really is (only four small rooms), the people working there are not kind, you are obliged to pay a tour in certain hours, the interactive screens doesn't work properly, and there is no bathroom.\nGoing here is throwing your money away, without doubt.",
          "Very interesting musuem related with science and the life of Nikola Tesla. It offers guided tours, really good experience.",
          "What more can I say. Nikola Tesla museum. Be sure to take the guided tour. Won't play spoilsport by mentioning the contents. But take the guided tour. Also seeing the urn of ashes of Nikola Tesla is a surreal feeling. Highly recommended.",
          "Interesting museum but way too small, mainly by video introduction. The tests were interesting but not too many to show. Comparing the price, it could be better.",
          "Interesting... worth to see",
          "Horrible experience. Waited in line in the scorching 35 degrees heat because we were told the first 65 people would get in. We were within the first 40 people but not let in last minute anyway. No communication and quite rude treatment. We were very disappointed.",
          "Must visit place. So much history here :)",
          "Bit small, but fun",
          "I love museums, but in all honesty, I have to recommend a pass on this museum except for the most diehard Tesla hands. It is way too small, poorly laid out, and the group entrance to a limited number of people every hour with video show and \u2026",
          "Small but fun place",
          "Very small. Guide tours on every hour. 15 minutes of video watching and then 4 demonstrations of tesla coil. Dissappointing. Tesla deserved better",
          "Site hours do not reflect actual availability. Museum closes at 6pm, not 8pm.",
          "Very intresting tour, you should do the tour and experiments during the tour!",
          "Super over rated... you can skip this visit without any regrets",
          "My husband had a blast here...unfortunately I didn't enjoy the experience at all...it was over crowded, personal space was nonexistent and you had to huddle up in order to see this very small exhibition...they have no restrooms and we were \u2026",

        "wiki": "St. Mark's Church or Church of St. Mark (Serbian: \u0426\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u043e\u0433 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u043a\u0430/Crkva Svetog Marka) is a Serbian Orthodox church located in the Ta\u0161majdan park in Belgrade, Serbia, near the Parliament of Serbia. It was built in the Serbo-Byzantine style by the Krsti\u0107 brothers, completed in 1940, on the site of a previous church dating to 1835. It is one of the largest churches in the country. There is a small Russian church next to St. Mark's.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe church, dedicated to Holy Apostle and Evangelist Mark, was built in the Interwar period between 1931 and 1940 in the Ta\u0161majdan Park, in the centre of Belgrade. It was built slightly north of a wooden 19th-century church that was destroyed in 1941.\n\n\n=== Old church ===\n\nThe original, wooden church, was built in 1835-36, in the days of Belgrade Metropolitan Petar Jovanovi\u0107 (s. 1833\u20131859). The main donor was merchant Lazar Pan\u0107a (d. 1831). Dedicated to St. Mark, it was built within an existing cemetery. It was a rectangular building whose exterior surface area was 11.5 by 21 m and whose interior was 7.75 by 17.46 m. At the same time Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107, who was also a donor to this church, built the palatial church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul in Top\u010dider (completed in 1834). Work on both churches was supervised by architect Nikola \u017divkovi\u0107 (1792\u20131870). In 1838, Prince Milo\u0161's eldest son Prince Milan and bishop Gavrilo Popovi\u0107 of \u0160abac were buried directly by the church. After the May Coup, the royal couple, King Alexander Obrenovi\u0107 I and Queen Draga Obrenovi\u0107, were buried in this church. In ca. 1870, the church was the parish seat of Terazije with 312 homes and Palilula with 318 homes. It was destroyed during World War I by Austrian troops, then reconstructed in 1917. It was badly damaged in the 1941 German bombing of Belgrade and the rubble was cleared in 1942.\n\n\n=== New church ===\n\nDue to the rapid growth of the city and population increase, it became necessary in the beginning of the 20th century to build a larger church in the Belgrade quarter of Palilula. Frequent wars did not allow this until 1930 when a pair of Belgrade architects, the brothers Petar and Branko Krsti\u0107, both professors of the University of Belgrade Faculty of Architecture, designed the plans for the new St. Mark's Church. The present building of St. Mark's Church was built according to their drawings between 1931 and 1940. The eruption of World War II interrupted the full completion of the church. Only the construction work was finished. Divine service took place in the new church during the war in 1941 and after it until November 14, 1948 in the adapted narthex of the church. On that date the church was consecrated (by Serbian Patriarch Gavrilo V) and the church opened for divine service. There were plans to decorate the whole interior with frescoes. The external walls are in two colors of natural materials in the Serbo-Byzantine style. The church bell tower is a part of the church itself on the west side.\n\nDue to the already urbanized area around it, the construction couldn't follow the strict church canon concerning the east-west position. In order to fit into the existing city grid, Serbian Patriarch Varnava gave a special permit for the new church to deviate for 10 degrees from the canonical rule. That way, the main entrance came in line with the Resavska Street, across it.The Gra\u010danica Monastery was used as a model for the new church. Until the Church of Saint Sava surpassed it, St.Mark's Church was the largest Serbian church. It is considered one of the most beautiful edifices of the sacral architecture in the Serbo-Byzantine Revival style.The Anniversary Day of Operation Storm, held for mourning killed and exiled Serbs from Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, is held on August 5 in St. Mark's Church.The interiors of the church cover 1,150 m2 (12,400 sq ft). The naos can receive 2,000 people and the choir gallery can accommodate 150 musicians. The church is 62 m (203 ft) long, 45 m (148 ft) wide and 60 m (200 ft) high, excluding the cross.In November 2017 a complete rearrangement of the plateau, which functioned as an extension of the Ta\u0161majdan Park in front of the church, began. Old asphalt pavement which served as a parking lot was removed. Architect Jovan Mitrovi\u0107 designed a new, leveled combination of granite slabs and green areas. The plateau will be divided in two sections, left and right, divided by the green island. The right, \"ceremonial\" side will be regularly shaped, with the granite slabs posted in the horizontal rhythm, interrupted with the thin squares of red Italian granite. The design is patterned after the fa\u00e7ade of the Michelangelo's temples on Capitoline Hill in Rome. The idea is to visually expand the church. The left side will have \"disheveled\" pattern, made of differently sized and combined granite slabs. The plateau was finished in February 2018.In June 2018 it was announced that a monument to Patriarch Pavle, head of the Serbian Orthodox Church from 1990 to 2009, will be erected on the green area between the newly finished plateau and the tram stop in Ta\u0161majdan Park. The  1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) tall bronze monument was authored by Zoran Male\u0161. It was placed in the park on 13 November 2018 and dedicated on 15 November, an anniversary of Pavle's death.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nSt. Mark's Church is 62 meters long and 45 meters wide, and the height of the main cupola to the base of the cross is 60 meters. The usable interior surface area of the church is about 1,150 square meters, and the naos (nave) of the church can accommodate over 150 singers. It has already been said that more than seventy years after the beginning of its construction, St. Mark's Church has not been completed. This relates primarily to its interior, decorating, fresco painting, appropriate lighting, acoustics, heating, and ventilation. After World War II little was done in the church itself for objective reasons. Above the entrance door to the church on the external fa\u00e7ade is an icon in a mosaic of the Holy Apostle and Evangelist Mark, the work of Veljko Stanojevi\u0107 in 1961. The floor in the church is from 1974, while the floor of the soleia (area in front of the iconostasis and the altar (sanctuary) was done in marble in 1991. The iconostasis of the church, designed by architect and professor Zoran Petrovi\u0107, dates back to 1991\u201392 and was done in marble, while the icons in it are done in mosaic, the work of academic painter \u0110uro Radulovi\u0107 from Belgrade from 1996\u201398. The altar table is also in marble with smaller mosaics on the front side. To the right of the altar is a smaller altar dedicated to the Holy Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 (d. 1427), and the altar on the north side is dedicated to the feast day of the Transfiguration of the Lord. As one enters the church on the right side along the south wall of the church is the marble tomb of Emperor Stefan Du\u0161an (r. 1331\u201355) designed by Dr. Dragomir Tadi\u0107 where his holy relics rest after being transferred from his endowment, Monastery of the Holy Archangels near Prizren, a monastery that has lain in ruins for centuries. On the opposite, north side the tomb of Serbian Patriarch German (d. 1991) has been built in the same style and of the same material. In the middle of the church underneath the central cupola is apolielei done in copper according to the design of Dragomir Tadi\u0107 in 1969, and executed by academic sculptor Dragutin Petrovi\u0107.\nBelow the narthex of the church is the crypt which was adapted during 2007. It is installed new ground marble, climatization, and ventilation, sound system, and graves were readopted. In it are several tombs transferred from the original church: Metropolitan Teodosije (1815\u20131892), Bishop Viktor of Ni\u0161 Viktor (1797\u20131888), Bishop Gavrilo (Popovi\u0107, 1811-1871) of \u0160abac, and Bishop Mojsije of Timok (1835\u20131896). Also interred here are King Alexander Obrenovi\u0107 and Queen Draga (\u20201903), Ana Jovana Obrenovi\u0107 (\u20201880), Princes Milan M. Obrenovi\u0107 (1819\u20131839) and Sergije M. Obrenovi\u0107 (\u2020 1878), and the grave of the patron endower of the old church, Lazar Pan\u0107a. Generally speaking, the entire space of the very large crypt is little used and suitable for a gallery, museum or display area. The church treasury is presently located in a room on the south side and contains a rich collection of icons and precious artifacts. The most valuable icons are Theotokos with Christ from the 16th century; Jesus Christ on the Throne, an icon from the end of the 18th century; St. Nicholas on the Throne, Holy Emperor Constantine and Empress Helen, an icon from the first half of the 19th century; St. Demetrios and St. George, an icon from 1849; Theotokos with the Saints, an icon from the first half of the 19th century; St. George and St. Demetrios, an icon from the mid-19th century; Crowning of the Most Holy Theotokos, an icon from the mid-19th century; Holy Emperor Constantine and Empress Helen (Exaltation of the Honorable Cross), an icon from the mid-19th century; Theotokos with Christ, the Holy Prophet Daniel and St. John the Baptist, an icon from 1863; Theotokos ofArabia, an icon from 1872; St. Sava of Serbia, an icon from 1870; Holy King Stefan of De\u010dani, an icon from 1883; Holy Apostle and Evangelist Mark, an icon from the end of the 19th century; Holy Archangel Michael, an icon from 1889; the Pilgrims' icon (the Theotokos, Jesus Christ, the apostles, the Final Judgment), an icon from the end of the 19th century; St. George Killing the Dragon, an icon from 1926; and many other icons. The icons are primarily the work of eminent painters and icon painters of the 19th and 20th centuries: Steva Todorovi\u0107, Nikola Markovi\u0107, Dimitrije Posnikovi\u0107, Vladimir Vojnovi\u0107, Pavle \u010cortanovi\u0107, Lukijan Bibi\u0107, Vasa Pomori\u0161ac, \u0110or\u0111e Popovi\u0107, Olga Krd\u017eali\u0107 and others.\n\nIn the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, we do hereby consecrate the cornerstone of this church of God dedicated to the Holy Apostle and Evangelist Mark in the Capital of Yugoslavia, the Royal City of Belgrade, next to the old St. Mark's Church, on the church patronal feast, April 25 (May 8 according to the new calendar) in the year 7439 since creation and the year 1931 since the Incarnation of our Lord during the joyous reign of His Majesty King Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 I of Yugoslavia, and the Head of the Serbian Orthodox Church, His Holiness Serbian Patriarch Varnava, who executed this holy act of consecration. \u2014 founding charter\n\n\n== Other burials ==\nAlexander I of Serbia and Draga Ma\u0161in (Queen Draga)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nBelgrade Church Architecture",

        "wiki": "The Military Museum (Serbian Latin: Vojni muzej) is a museum located in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Founded in 1878, the museum has over 3,000 ancient and modern items. These include Roman swords and helmets, Greek helmets and daggers, Serbian heavy knight's armor, axes, shields, helmets, crossbows, armoured gloves, as well as Western medieval weapons. There are also more modern guns, firearms, and elements of soldier's uniforms and equipment. Dioramas, plaques, and displays illustrate the use and historical context of the museum's collection.\n\nInside the museum's main building, the exhibits are found in a single long hall progressing from ancient through medieval and then towards modern. All exhibits are labeled in the Serbian Language in both Cyrillic and Latin, as well as English. Outside the museum's main building, there are numerous tanks, howitzers, and armoured cars of many types. Some were acquired during World War II, when they were captured by the Red Army and Yugoslav Partisans from retreating Nazi and Axis forces (Belgrade Offensive). These decommissioned tanks and artillery pieces line the walls and paths leading into the Military Museum from two directions. Recent exhibits address NATO actions against Serbia in 1999, including the controversial use of cluster bombs, depleted uranium, and graphite bombs, some of which are claimed to be in violation of international law. A well-known exhibit features parts of a US F-117 stealth aircraft which was downed by a Serbian S-125 Neva/Pechora.\nThe Military Museum is located inside the walls of the historic Belgrade Fortress, situated at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. The Belgrade Fortress is located within a popular park known as the Kalemegdan Park, near the center of the city.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Outer Exhibition ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Inside Exhibition ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "Very nice arsenal there from different wars and different years. I enjoyed walking and see the real scaling of those tanks or artillery. Next time I hope I will take a visit also to the museum. I spent quite a long time going around the tanks and weapons. I personally recommend",
          "Closed during Easter! The only reason why I visited Belgrade is for this muesam and according to their website, the muesam was supposed to be open. The hotel even called and verified for me. Upon my arrival, I was greeted by a locked gate. Outside of the gate are tank relics",
          "Located within the belgrade fortress, is the home of the military museum. It was fun to walk amongst the Artillery, Bofors etc, an assortment of tanks and missile launches, even a patrol boat. Definitely worth a visit whilst visiting the park.",
          "The museum has countless artifacts and weapons dating all the way back from the beginning of Belgrade\u2019s history, to items and weapons acquired in the early 21st century. Right in the heart of Kalemegdan, and very cheap to enter (around 200 dinara), it is a must see for any",
          "No any war is good, but this is interesting location, with old time fortress, tanks, big guns, museum. You can make many nice pictures if is good weather outside. Visit !",
          "You won't miss this museum if you are walking towards the gate of the fortress. It is located outside of it, before crossing the tiny bridge.",
          "This is more than just a museum; the collection relates the history of the Yugoslave/Serbian nations up to the present day, including evidence of NATO cluster bombs used in 1999.",
          "interesting for family with kids, a lot of things to see, walk and if the weather is good this is a perfect walk",
          "This is an outside museum. I liked the history that it has, seeing all those military stuff makes you become more curious about them.",

          "Entering from Stambol Gate you will find on your left and your right some old tanks, rocket launchers and artillery vehicles of Yugoslavian and Serbian war history",
          "Awesome museum! Outside you can see a lot of tanks, artillery, a boat, a big bomb, mines and many more. Inside they have 52 rooms with over 2000 pieces of military historical stuff. We were not able to go inside because we arrived too late and it was closed. If we ever come back",
          "Nice place to visit if you are in Belgrade. It is free, there is no entry fee. :) Located in the city centre.",
          "Unfortunately, Serbia was a participants in many wars over the history, so even though this museum has a really nice collection of weapons, it also tells a story about the whole history of Serbia.",
          "Most of the exhibits are outside, in the Kalemegdan fortress park. So if you are only interested in large vehicles, tanks and guns, you will find that outside. Inside is a large museum detailing the country's history, both military and politics, from early medieval times.",
          "Nice interesting tanks and weapons from the leftovers of World War One , within the same area of the fortress",
          "When you visit the fortress, be sure to take advantage of the opportunity to visit an unexpectedly good museum. The small collection of WWI and II equipment includes a WWI French tank. Kids will enjoy the playground-like atmosphere outside. Indoors, the collection of materials",
          "There are many tanks outside of museum and inside is large collection of all kinds of weapons. There are modern items like guns from War in Croatia and parts of American F-117 stealth airplane that was shoot down in NATO bombing of Serbia.",
          "Nice place to visit but notice that 1- go there in not raining day. 2- don't go torture place if you are softhearted.",
          "This museum has unique display regarding the military history of Serbia and Balkans in general. The museum is not too large but is well organized. The price of the tickets are responsible. There are discounts for group visits. Also you can arrange help of custos for group",
          "this is at the fortress along with the dinosaurs, basketball and tennis courts. A decent collection of tanks, artillery, and some missiles.",
          "Interesting exposition but with lack of maintenance. Some of the exhibits are overgrown with bush, some of them are destroyed and part of the exposition is not accessible at all. The overall experience is spoiled by tons of garbage that cover almost every spot. A bit of TLC",
          "It's interesting that as you're walking through the grounds of the old fortress you come upon an area with modern war equipment. Wasn't overly impressed with the whole idea of combining the ancient with the new.",
          "Wery interesting place situated on the one entrance of the fortress.If you are in Belgrade better to know the history .The museum its very well made .Dont forget that there was ipad tablets and when you direct them to the signed areas its a virtual guide.",
          "Extremely interesting museum with many military equipment predominantly before the Second World War, but there are also modern things. It is free and is located in the Belgrade Fortress.",
          "It was very nice as we had a nice guide who explained well and gave a historical scenario for what Belgrad faced in the 2ed world war, and before that the ottomans.. Great history.",
          "If you are a history person you would get some old weapons used in the WW2 and even earlier, some remaining inherit of the war, take a look, you will know how nowadays technology had changed people's life.",
          "If you have enough time you must visit this museum! It is a grace time travel to the path of history in an tremendous way which reaches the near present!",
          "Impressive place - with enough military hardware on display to satisfy a nine-year old with a camera.",
          "As an American I have been able to touch Mig's & now SAM 3's. They have a vast outside collection of weapons used thru out the years. I spent almost two hours exploring them.",
          "Belgrade has been bombed three times in history. Fist made by Ottomans, second one made by Germans and last one made by USA. So there are lots of historical places in Belgrade. Especialy military museum. If you have a chance you should visit.",
          "The museum by itself it is ok-ish. However it suffers due to having mostly explanations in serbian(English is present but not as complete as it should be) and from typical bored ex communists clerks. The ladies there were so keen on going home that they almost didn't let us",
          "The military museum displays tanks, missiles, and artillery outside and smaller weaponry and artifacts inside. The displays are chronologically ordered and generally well curated. Some of the old weaponry, especially the Turkish, is astonishing and chilling. Some display",
          "Managed to park near the site but one issue is actually finding it. Tourist attractions are not well signed so I followed Google maps to as near to it as I could then kinda stumbled upon the entrance. Main museum wasn't open, nothing to say why, but the fortress and military",
          "The museum focus on Serbian military history true ages, focus mostly on WW1 and WW2. There is outside some very interesting tanks and guns.",
          "centuries of Serbian military history, weapons, banners, etc. Many artillery pieces are on display on the grounds along with several tanks. Well worth several hours!",
          "Interesting museum to see during the visit to the Kalemgdan castle especially for those that are interested in the history and would like to see various guns, armaments and armored vehicles during the wars. Plan a good hour to be there if you want to go into details and read all",
          "As we are coming from a war-torn country. We stood silent for a moment and were moved by the memories of those wars in which they fought with all these weapons. Inside the green park they stand as a male to what we would not want anymore. Worth a visit, exciting and touching",
          "It has also a space outside, with cannons and tanks, which is very impressive, especially for children, but I am not sure if they are real models or just some pieces of sheet metal. Despite of this fact, the museum is a must in Kalemegdan.",
          "I really like military museums and things like this, but I must admit I was a bit disappointed about this one. Most of the museum is about middle age, so the most interesting part (for me) was from the 1st WW to the end. Moreover, some of the parts are translated in english,",
          "Covers the history of the country and some countries next to Serbia. A very beautiful demonstration of all periods of our countries. Visited a couple of times.",
          "A number of military systems as well as uniforms are presented .Regardless of the items presented there is a hard feeling related to the imbalance of the military power between the West Alliance and Serbia.Moreover the question from young generations of the purpose of that",
          "I'm not a military buff, so with that in mind, I'll say that I found the uniforms through the ages to be the most interesting part of the museum, seeing how they evolved over the years our reflected different cultures (the Turks developed fancy weaponry with mother of pearl",
          "Very affordable entry fee only 200 dinar, the museum is huge spread across two floors, with lots of artillery outside to view as well. The only suggestion I have is more English, quite a lot of displays only had Serbian or nothing at all.",
          "Situated in the Kalegmendan Park the military museum has some interesting things to see from the rich local history.",
          "A lot of exhibits, very rich varieties. You can figure what it means to be sponsored by the Russians with modern( at the time) weapons.",
          "It's perfect place where you can spend time in sunny days. Also there are interesting things to view, for free. They are all set in perfect garden. We go there every time when we are in Belgrade.",
          "I don't want to see weapons around. I hope to see all of them in a garbage one day. I hate to see violence also. But what was good, in city center we saw some buildings from war time, not renewed. They keep it as a bad memory of the war, about how terrible war is. All human",
          "The best thing in this museum was that the exhibition is outside. You may combine admiring the exhibits with a stroll. You may see different war machines e.g. natural sized tanks here.",
          "Situated in the grounds of the Kalemegdan park, overlooking the Sava River, this large museum traces the history of conflict from prehistoric times to the present in a vast series of well-presented and fascinating displays, featuring history, weaponry, ancient armor and all the",
          "The modest entrance and linear style bely the hugeness of the museum exhibition, on everything from ancient history to modern Serbian history. Serves as a quite well rounded history museum, beyond just the military, although that is the focus. Complaints are that it is a long",
          "Somewhat cool to see the old cannons and tanks but the fort itself where it resides is a better attraction.",
          "A superb museum which takes you through the country's fascinating history. Allow a couple of hours (if you wish to look in detail) to traverse the rooms in order. Personally, a little disappointed there wasn't a larger section on the events post 1945, particularly of those in",
          "This military museum is located at Kalemegdan, next to the Belgrade fort. There are many military machines from the Second World War and earlier periods connected to the Balkans wars!",
          "If your at Belgrade Fortress the military museum is a god cheap add-on while you are there. Plenty of displays of military equipment and history relating to Serbia and its Balkan neighbours dating back over a thousand years. Nice displays of pictures, clothing and models.",
          "There is a museum in the citadel about torture items in middle ages...It s not well organised but not and ordinary thing in our life.If u have time it s good idea have a look about 30 min..Price is 300 dnr",
          "Even if u dnt like history or even armory..u should go check it. Its a place full of history..ull be amazed by z way they evovled and z machines that used to torture back in time..u ll enjoy it!",
          "If you are interested in armament of European countries in WWII and you want to learn about Serbian history and history of Belgrade include this in your Belgrade visit program. Also from the fortress is the best view on Danube and Sava river.",
          "The most prominent part of the museum which is really hard to miss are cannons, tanks and other big weapons that are placed outside the museum building. The exibits are from the ww2 and earlier and are well worth seeing. I was really stunned how excited our kids were running",
          "This was my favorite part of the Fortress. It was full of history and had some of the original cannons, tanks, and cell. I truly enjoyed it. If you are a fan of history this is the perfect place for you.!!!",
          "A very good and organized museum. Covers a lot of historical periods, from ancient years up to today. Well preserved and lots of exhibits. Must!",
          "The museum's outdoor exhibits are laid out well in a very picturesque way, but it's inside that this museum comes into its own. Some truly fascinating exhibits, lots of translation (not all of it perfect, but all readable) for us touristy types, artefacts from 4th century",
          "All museum in Serbia are not so big but you can find a lot of interesting things and a lot of history that is hidden there.",
          "If you like history, especially war history from whole Balkan, visit this museum. There are a lot of exhibits of various types of weapons, soldiers uniforms, old maps and military vehicles.",
          "A small and a very nice museum that has a variety collection of weapons and weaponry machines from the time of WWI to later period in Serbia's history.",
          "Exhibition of tanks that were used in World War II. interesting to see. Suffice it to an hour to see. Is located next to the Kalemegdan park",
          "the tanks, cannon and mortars are worth a glance but not much more, i wouldn't spend much time here unless you have kids that find it an attraction",
          "Don't think that this is just a museum for just guns and tanks, you must go inside, in there is a weatlh of info and exhibits of the country's history, political and military, ome good interaction and excellent displays, one of the best in the city.",
          "One of the best museums I have ever been in. The exhibits are found in a single long hall progressing from ancient through medieval and then towards modern. The Military Museum is located inside the walls of the Belgrade Fortress, in a park known as the Kalemegdan Park, near",
          "You can find plenty of different tanks and artilleries from different eras. There are even some boat and torpedoes on display.",
          "We found the Museum very interesting well worth a visit..we spent over an hour there what maybe they could do would be to update something s..",
          "Visited this museum whilst at Kalimegdan park. There are a large number of military vehicles and equipment outside the museum building which are free to see. The museum building itself requires a small entry charge. The museum provides a good overview of the military history of",
          "When we visited Belgrade Fortress, we also passed by the Military Museum in front of the Castle. You were free to view the military displays in open ground particularly those who understoood past history in war time. Nice place for visitors.",
          "Very nice museum, you can spend 2 hours there without problems, lot of history of Serbia. The caveat is that many of the letters lacked english translation, need some improvement. Loved the idea of the ipads for getting extra optional information.",
          "Well curated exhibition takes the visitor through 500 years of history as the Turks, Austrians, Hungarians and Serbs conquered and retreated from this part of the world",
          "You will find the progress of the war technology and history in the museum. If you like history, sword&shield, you should see it.",
          "The Belgrade military museum is located within the Fortress and is just a short walk from the main pedestrianised shopping area in the city. Outside of the main museum building is a large collection of guns, tanks, naval relics and other assorted military hardware dating back to",
          "We had hoped to learn more, but most of the exhibits are in Serbian only. The few English signs didn't offer that much. But interesting artifacts on display, and only cost about $1.50 USD, so could be a fine way to spend an hour while exploring the fort.",
          "Coming from Lebanon, and frankly the machinery that was free of charge to see wasn't very impressive :)",
          "Impressive museum with different kinds of tanks and other guns. Most of it you can find outside, free of charge. If you are willing to go to the museum (inside the building) you need to pay for the tickets. Great place to go and visit specially when weather is good. Even small",
          "if you are into history of war equipment and military artillery and tanks and so on, then this is the right spot for you. The artifacts date back to 18th century. very interesting. i loved it...",
          "For all the fans of guns and canons and history - this is a truly very good place - on the open air there are tanks and canons, which the kids specially like..",
          "Visiting the Belgrade Fortress, you won't miss this objective. Read, walk, discover everything about military history. Walk every path, and you'll find a new and fascinating objective.",
          "Seemingly endless artifacts in this museum. From thought the ages up to recent un missions. Can't fault it either. Worth the visit.",
          "The military museum is, unfortunately, almost a Serbian history museum since the country has been at the center of Balkan wars forever. It is something that one must visit to also understand the Serbian character and their strength as well as their patriotism that could be seen",
          "I just loved this place, you can even climb on the tanks. If you're a history enthusiast, you'll really like it.",
          "I think this is one of the most comprehensive arms collections I saw, exposing weapons form the oldest times to the new ones.",
          "Been going there since I was a kid, almost every time I went to kalemegdan fortress, nice stroll inside the ancient fortress walls among old military hardware!",
          "This is probably the best military museum we have been to. It is so complete and the exhibits included costumes, guns, models and statues. The museum is so well done and goes in chronological order showing the evolution of the military from the Ottomans to the present time.",
          "nice place in the nice area, a lot of different tanks, cannons etc would be good attraction for the kids",
          "There was so much there, from all epochs- I am afraid I found it was most depressing that man has so long excelled in making horrendous ways to kill one another",
          "The museum is a Serbian historical presentation. It is a proud nation with a story to tell and a real need to tell it. This museum seems more aimed at supporting Serbian national pride for Serbians. This means it is still interesting, but you might want to take a Serbian",
          "A great military museum with a wide array of exhibits. The indoor displays chart right from the roman period to the present day, but do lack captions at times. the outdoor displays are also impressive with a huge amount of artillery and WW2 armor on display.",
          "The outside has some rarer WWII vehicles. The inside does not have much signage in English and was hot. Having said that, i you know some history, the displays are well worth it if you enjoy military museums. Everything you ever wanted to know on how the Serbs fought the",
          "If you are willing to learn about the Serbian and Yugoslav history, the military museum is the best choice in Belgrade. Their exhibition covers all the periods of the country with maps, objects, photos, etc. The only problem is that, most of the explications are in Serbian, so",
          "The exhibition was just a regular chronological presentation of weapons and battles around balkans. It's better just to go around the fort. History can be entertaining, but not here.",
          "If you are into military stuff, then, by all means, visit this museum. Tanks and other big, green, metal things don't excite me.",
          "As part of the Kalemegdan fortress and being free it is a very interesting thing to see with a great collection of cannons, armed vehicles and tanks and very interesting ones from WWI and WWII",
          "This is a must on any visit to belgrade - looks are deceiving - from outside looks like just another tourist attraction but contains a wealth of artifacts",
          "Located in Belgrade Fortress which is beautiful, the museum is really cheap to get into (150din which is about \u00a31) and there's artefacts from all eras. You move through the museum in chronological order which makes it more interesting. Some of the more modern history is a little",
          "This is a fascinating museum tracing military history back millennia. However, recent Balkan history is presented in a very one-sided fashion. Descriptions of \"NATO aggressors\" give the impression that Serbians were home minding their own business when NATO bombers arrived out",
          "Exhibits are well presented and there is plenty to see. As a Western European though, having lived through the later stages of the Cold War and with the events of the Balkan wars still fresh in mind, the museum to me is a monument to hypocracy. A big deal is made of the defeat",
          "We only had time to see the outside part of this museum but there are many tanks, guns, etc. to see , including a \"Big Bertha.\" If you are interested in World War II, you will find this display interesting.",
          "With my time in Belgrade short I planned the trip to see as much as possible and when I arrived at the military museum all the signs showed that it was open until 5. I spent some minutes admiring the tanks and big guns outside which compared to other military museums were very",
          "Belgrade Military Museum si very interesting museum. One part is on the outside and another one is in the inside of the Fortress. There are a lot of WW1 and WW2 weapons and tanks, and they are very interesting. Go there and see for your self.",
          "An pretty impressive array of cannons, tanks, motorized guns and other war relics. There's not much in the way of an intelligent array or patter of display.",
          "If you love military history this is one hell of a place....recommend take the guided tour for better understanding and flow as there are a lot of military effects (weaponry, Flags, Standards and uniforms) on display and its easy to get lost in the huge collection.... It is an",
          "Our family loved this museum. we have four boys ages 2, 6, 9, and 11. They all loved it and learned a lot about the history of the military through the ages. It was very well done and not to be missed.",
          "It's a really big museum, very interesting, the only thing I didn't like it was the fact nothing/very little was in english.",
          "Founded in 1878, the old part of the Kalemegdan fortress above the Roman well. Since he died in the First World War, the museum was reopened in 1937. During the Second World War museum collection has remained in Belgrade, and the Germans took away some very rare and valuable",
          "This place is important memento from my childhood and growing up in Belgrade during 70-s and 80-s. Inside of the old Kalemegdan fortress, in one of the inner canals/moats, you can see outter part of museum as row of old cannons and simillar heavy weaponry from WWI and WWII and",
          "If you are already visiting Kalemegdan make sure to pass by the military museum. It is small, but worth it.",
          "I've never had an interest in anything military but this was truly the exception. Historically interesting and the layout is beautifully done and incredibly informative. Great place to lazily wander around and you walk out having learnt plenty.",
          "I always enjoy going back to it, since you feel like strolling through time and history! There is a large collection around the museum, in the alleys of the Fortress, but the real thrill for the history lovers is inside! The entrance ticket is 150dinars (1.20 Euros) and worth",
          "Lots of armaments from the many wars over three or so centuries fought in this area. For the more recent wars, forget the armaments and look at and read the information on the photos. A great but chilling history lesson.",
          "The fortress in Belgrade is the main attraction and contains a lot of surprises including this fine military museum. There are several artillery pieces from WW I and beyond as well as some WW II tanks. There is also a display of Medieval torture devices.Try going on a milder day",
          "The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10:00 to 17:00. The museum is closed on: January 1, 2, 7, February 15, 16 and November 11. The cost for an adult is 150 Serbian dinar for indoor exhibits. There is no charge to view the tanks and artillery that are outdoors in the",

          "Just how many times in my past I passed beside this place, maybe searching another things within the glorious Belgrade Fortress, and not paying so much attention at this very fine Military Museum. This last summer I reckon, I corrected such neglect and more attentively looked at",
          "Serbian military museum is located at the Kalemegdan park in the center of Belgrade. There you can see old tenks and guns it is very nice place.",
          "The museum consists of two parts: outdoor part accessible to everyone FoC and indoor part. Very structured and interesting to see. Would recommend it for bad weather.",
          "If youre in Belgrade definitely need to visit here, also with the museum underneath about medival times, here is interesting and good to have a walk round an explore some of the weapons used and try to imagine how strong this fortress is to withold the amount of weight and fire",
          "The whole Kalemegdan Park is very nice and worth visiting, but the tanks are some of the most impressive monuments. One of thm is very old and unique.",
          "If it is your first time to a military museum of any kind, you will like it. If it is, not the first time, the main impression is: nothing special, you could see everything in any other place.",
          "A chance to see some cool war vehicles and equipment from the Serbian military history. Worth a visit since it's located within the fortress which is a must visit in Belgrade anyway. Nothing extremely exciting however.",
          "A beautiful sunny day in Belgrade and we were close enough to the \"Belgrade Military Museum\" for me to walk. It was too bad that the inside of the museum was closed, but you could wonder around outside all day till your hearts desire. I love armour, Aberdeen, Maryland, the",
          "Good pictures especially of WWII era. Also, many guns on display. Not credit cards accepted but not expensive.",
          "An impressive collection of military objects, from spear heads through to muskets and rifles, with assorted tanks and artillery pieces outside. Entry was cheap, at 150 dinar each (just over \u20ac1). Most displays had Serbian text that would clearly have provided further information",
          "The museum is in the fortress. The entrance may not be impressive but there are different pieces from various periods of history of Serbia. It is quite big with two floors. You can see many things from flags, medals, uniforms to contemporary pieces. I think it is worth to see.",
          "Note you have to pay entrance in local currency no credit cards. This is 3rd time I have visited and each time I learn of see something new. If you want to have the locals perspective on their own history this the place especially in the Balkan countries.",
          "The first museum exhibition was opened in 1904, the centenary of the First Serbian Uprising and then the institution, among other things, presented at the Balkan Exhibition in London in 1907. With 100 selected historical subjects, among which were the flags of both Serbian",
          "An really rich and comprehensive collection of arms, weapons etc. across the wide time spectrum. Further more, the location (old fortress) is simply perfect, and outside of the museum there is more: I WW and II WW tanks and cannons! Cute",
          "The militarily museum is interesting because is a part of the Belgrade Fortress. Many of these anti-aircraft guns date back to WW I. It's a good place for some nice photos.",
          "Military museum was excellent and the only bad was that the most info in the objects of the museum and the historical info was in Serbian!",
          "On display at the Belgrade Fortress are cannons and tanks from every war in which Serbia and Yugoslavia took part. It is quite a collection to wander through. But I also found it sobering for my generation and especially of my parents.",
          "I am pretty anti-violence and one one hand I think this museum was able to convey the violence of war in some sections, particularly WWII; but for the most part it was 100s of guns and other weapons from different eras with no context of them. What I found most disturbing",
          "The history museum visit took us approximately 2 hours. There are a lot of exhibits from the roman empire until in our days. The different weapons used in different periods are presented in chronological order.",
          "The museum is much bigger then expected. Everything is very detailed, the only Era I missing is, 1991-1995. For the Serbs this is maybe a period to forget about but I think this should also belong in a war museum. For the rest it's a very nice museum for a cheap price",
          "Thhis is militarily interesting and it is really part of the Belgrade Fortress. We read the plaques and found that many of these anti-arcraft guns date back to WW I. There was also half of a boat on display.",
          "I loved being able to see all of the various tanks of different sizes on display. You unfortunately get very little information about them, but they make for great pictures and you can get up close to see how big they really are.",

Founded in 1957, the museum is located adjacent to Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport. The current facility, designed by architect Ivan \u0160traus, was opened to the public on 21 May 1989.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1975 JAT, the national flag carrier, donated 48 a (52,000 sq ft) of land for the museum and the museum later purchased further 2.7 ha (6.7 acres). Construction of the present building of the museum began in the mid-1970s. The construction work dragged on, so it was only in late 1988 that the setting of the first permanent exhibition began. The museum's new location was ceremonially opened on 21 May 1989.The museum owns over 200 aircraft previously operated by the Yugoslav Air Force (both royal and communist), Serbian Air Force, and others, as well as aircraft previously flown by several civil airliners and private flying clubs. It also owns the only known surviving example of the Fiat G.50. The most valuable collections are housed in geodesic glass building, with additional aircraft displayed on the surrounding grounds.\nThe museum also displays wreckage of a downed USAF F-117 Nighthawk and F-16 Fighting Falcon, both shot down during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. In addition, the collection consists of more than 130 aviation engines, more radars, rockets, various aeronautical equipment, over 20,000 reference books and technical documentation as well as more than 200,000 photographs.\n\n\n== Collection ==\nNew 'Rocket and Radar' museum exhibition will be constructed.\nExisting missiles and radars in museum:\n\nP-15 Termit\nS-75 Dvina\n\n\n=== Gliders ===\n\n\n=== Helicopters ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Piston-engine aircraft ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Jet aircraft ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of aerospace museums\nList of museums in Belgrade\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMuseum review by TravelDriveRace\nHistory of the Museum at Jat Airways website\nBelgrade Aviation Museum\n\u041c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458 \u0432\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430-\u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0417\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0442 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u041c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458\u0430 \u0432\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0443\u0445\u043e\u043f\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430-\u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434 (\u0443 \u0438\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438)\nAeronautical Museum-Belgrade Official internet presentation of Aeronautical Museum - Belgrade (under construction)\nVirtual tour through museum",

          "For someone coming from Asia, I've never heard of this Tito so this is a place where I've learnt more about this leader and yugoslav's history, whether propaganda or not, not for me to guide.",
          "This museum serves one and only purpose of portraying Tito as the greatest leader ever. The exhibitions are a bit dull and there's a movie about Tito's journeys and achievements. It's nice to see it, but bear in mind that it's just another propaganda movie, typical for all",
          "For those who have no idea about history of this region, this is waste of time. But if you care for Yugoslavia and it's role as leader of non aligned movement and president Tito, it can be very informational and even amusing",

          "Actually it is not a museum of Yugoslav History, it is a museum devoted to Tito (who is an important part of the Yugoslav History). Make sure you catch the tour guide at the House of Flowers (2nd building behind the main one) in order to learn more about Tito period.",
          "Nice place to review the history of communist Yugoslavia under Josip Broz Tito, including his mausoleum and other attractions",
          "My wife and I had a wonderful experience here viewing the photos, films and installations. Do not miss the House of Flowers behind the museum, where Tito's grave is located and where museum exhibits continue. This is a must-see place for anyone interested in 20th-century",
          "Its great but it seams like they dont want to make a bigger story if Tito. And Tito is a great story. Hope they will make more of it in future",

          "This is a must see for any traveler. It is not only the burial place of a very important person in the history of the 20th century, one of the founders of the Non Aligned Movement, the complex also house different exhibitions. It has a part where gifts from around the world are",
          "Having in mind that majority museums in Belgrade are closed at the moment, this one is a logical choice. If you are interested in socialist era, this is right place for you. Many items, nice staff etc.",

          "Great museum about history of the Second (Tito's) Yugoslavia. Very well organised, with a range of exhibits from around the world. It's a must place to visit in Belgrade. The museum gives you a glimpse of the world that doesn't exist any more.",

          "It was very interesting to visit the House of flowers and Tito's grave. On the other hand, this museum is most of all a tribute to Tito. I hoped to learn there something more about thw history of Jugoslavia.",
          "Anyone who knows a little about the history of Yugoslavia will be interested in this place. If you have a great knowledgeable guide, as we did the experience is enhanced ten times over. Take time to stroll through and soak up as much of that history as possible and even then",
          "The setting was beautiful, but the museum only had displays of costumes and weapons, nothing really much about Yugoslavia. And the Tito museum next door was just his grave. Not worth the cab ride and the entry fee.",
          "It's an amazing experience to see Tito's grave and a lot of his belongings. If you like the history of Yugoslavia as I do, you will enjoy it. It's a really peaceful place and you can only hear the birds. I went there with a very good guide but if you go on your own it's also OK.",

If you know anything about Tito, you are sure to find the exhibits fascinating.\nThe classic 1960s building was closed in September 2019, and I believe will remain closed for some time.

          "I visited with a Serbian friend who explained all about it, very interesting also the small building history near the church. Inside nice but personally I was expecting a bit more. Outside people can burn candles for their family and friends or for those who are not with us",
          "A little bit hard to find, but once we did find the cathedral, we were denied access because our pants weren't long enough (in the middle of the summer, at a sweltering 35 degrees outside). Oh well, so we took a couple of photos from the outside, instead of entering the church.",
          "We were told that we could not go inside with short sleeve shirts. It was a blazing hot day and temperatures were in mid-30's so we thought we'd pass until we saw that locals were streaming out in short sleeved clothing. I guess modesty is relative. As long as you are quite",

          "Not the biggest, but very impressive among other Belgrade churches. Looks beautiful from the city and from the fortress. It is a noticeable sign in urban areas, if you look from the river or from one of the bridges. The interior decoration is quite strict and very decent.",
          "After almost 3 hours of walking around Belgrade and visiting various attractions, we finally reached this attraction. Our Guide took our Group Pictures and gave us instructions how to go back to the Republic Square where our Tour started. After our Group disbanded, I entered",
          "It is not so astonishing as other Christian temples, but it\u2019s worth to visit. It was Easter night and we saw the orthodox ceremony before Sunday. Interesting.",

          "I can not deny that the Cathedral is a beautiful building, and one of the landmarks in Belgrade, but we were left with a bad taste by being asked to pay because we were tourists. The lady ran out and tapped us on the shoulder when we walked in, asking where we were from, and",

          "Worth visiting, the decorations, paintings, architecture, and history inside this Orthodox church were unforgettable. It was free to visit and covering of knees were enforced by staff at the door (they'll let you borrow an apron thing during your visit, somehow i didn't have to",
          "Traditional Orthodox Cathedral. Not so wide, but beautiful paints and historical means inside. You'll have to pay 1 euro/ppl to enter. No issue, but the lady that receives visitors is unpolite and unkind. If you' re in short, dress, you'll have to cover your legs with tissues",
          "It was a cold Sunday morning in December 2016 with a little rain, but I went to the church with my youngest daughter to listen a beautiful chorus on the Sunday Liturgy. It was a mother's holiday and priest told us a beautiful story about mother's love at the end of the ceremony.",

          "A beautiful church within the Belgrade city with colorful glittering tower. Not a big but an elegant altar with all visitors to be standing for the mass. Fairly old paintings on the wall. Worth the visit.",
          "Just 100 meters from the residence of Princess Ljubica. Soft music playing inside gives the church a much warmer feeling. The tower is the most attractive feature of the church.",

          "Free entry. Photography needs to be discreet. This is a functioning church, so please be aware of the worshipers who come and go while you are visiting - I stand to the side if there are people praying and wait for them to leave before I start gawking at the artworks etc ... !!!",
          "Another Cathedral under construction in Belgrade. Take a look. Nice photo ops from the outside. And just behind the church is one of the Nato bombed buildings.",

          "I was pretty impressed by the place, although it was under renovations, you could still enjoy some paintings, nice.",
          "The Cathedral was located near to Danube River and the Fortress. It was an old Serbian Orthodox Church dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel. There were many paintings inside for viewing. It was a very important centre for local christians' gathering and worshipping.",
          "It is definitely worth a visit to see the Cathedral, it is a very serene and quiet place befitting a Cathedral. It was so quiet I chose not to even attempt any photos as just so serene and peaceful.",
          "We visited the church and it is very different to the catholic ones we are used to in Italy. The austerity inside in contrast with the elaborate outside of the Cathedral is fascinating . When you walk inside one thing that struck me was the huge columns and the feeling of beign",
          "this should be on American lists of places to visit. amazing history, great nightlife, delish food, safe, lovely rivers and islands and friendly people.",
          "Great looking relatively new temple, first church was built in 1833 and later this one. Inside you can see tombs of some historical figures of Serbian history. Like: Tomb of Emperor Stefan Dusan (\u2020 1354) Tomb of King Aleksandar Obrenovic and Queen Draga (\u2020 1903) Tomb Knjaz Milan",
          "The place was a bit crowded but at peace and quiet. paintings, design and architecture was masterpiece. Visiting usually takes about 15 min max , cameras's allowed but certain rules as all churches must be followed.",
          "This is a Serbian Orthodox Christian church. It opened in 1840. The architecture is Baroque and Neoclassic. It is located in the old section of the city. The art work inside is truly stunning but you are not supposed to take photographs inside. Such requests should be observed",
          "The cathedral is located within the old city and very close to the fortress. Its a huge church well preserved and important to the locals.",

          "That's what we call the Saborna crkva or the Cathedral Church of St.Michael the Archangel. It is one Serb Orthodox Christian church, located in the Prince Sima Markovic street, across the Patriarchate of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Here I had been during the one church wedding",
          "Nice Orthodox church with beautiful paints. You can combine it and see the Church and the Patriarchy and the vie of the castle which is near. There is also good restaurants and the republic square is 5-10 min walking.",
          "Nice medium sized Orthodox Church a two minute walk from the Fort, worth having a look in as you will be in the area anyway.",
          "When I visited The Princess Ljubica\u2019s Residence I saw this church on the other side of the street, so I went in. It is small, but a beautiful church. The Cathedral Church of St. Michael the Archangel is a Serb Orthodox Christian church in the centre of Belgrade, Serbia. It is",
          "Walking around the city and from the vantage point of our river cruise ship docked on the Danube, we kept seeing the tower of what I found out was this church. It was built between 1837 and 1840 and is one of the largest churches in Serbia. Before this church was built,",
          "Breathtaking decorations inside (no fotos allowed), treat it as a single room museum regardless of your religion or absence of such.",
          "Visiting only from outside, as - like other reviewers previously informed - the lady on the entrance, very unfriendly, denied our acces because both me and my son were wearing short trousers (3/4).... Nothing to comment about, we were in the same outfit in all the other churches",
          "I bumped into a wedding which was nice. The church itself is very classical in style and is located in a very cozy neighbourhood.",

          "St. Michael's Cathedral is an impressive church from the exterior. You can visit it during a walk in that part of the city, but there is not any particular reason to go there expecially for that.",
          "The outside was impressive ,great architecture, but not so great from the inside. It was easily accessible from the Fort area heading back in towards town.",
          "Very beautiful outside. A little disappointing inside, looking incomplete. I was impressed by the number of people who go in to pray",
          "Not too bad but there are far more interesting things to do and churches to visit in Belgrade areas.",
          "I didn't get to see much because it was under construction. Still, refreshing to visit an orthodox church instead of a catholic one.",
          "This St. Michael's Cathedral is another Orthodox church in the city, located on the side of the park of the fortress and easily recognizable thanks to the special high bell tower that stands out among the many others. Beautiful especially at night when it is being illuminated. I",

          "The reason for going to Belgrade was to be there when my son had his wedding in St Michael's Cathedral. Wonderful experience - so special to be able to be part of a ceremony in a different culture to the UK. Very ornate and spectacularly decorated walls inside. Well worth a",
          "I've been to many cathedrals across Eastern and Western Europe....and this one ranks near the top. The building is typical, but the interior is inspiring. Built in the mid 1800's, there is a gold-plated carved iconostasis near the alter. But be warned---they really don't like",
          "I've only rated this cathedral as average because it still seems to be getting built or is under refurbishment. The inside was very bare so not much to see but to look at from the outside was pretty cool. It's definitely worth going to see.",
          "This church is a wonderful example of a 'working' Orthodox church. The array of icons is amazing. I was there on a Sunday and there was a 'production line' of weddings.",
          "This cathedral is worth a quick visit. While in Serbia I found most places have tourist information mostly in Serbian Latin, quite often in Serbian Cyrillic, and occasionally in English. This cathedral didn't have English information from what I recall. There's a cool royal tomb",

          "I like this very old and traditional orthodox church which seems to be much more intimate than Slavija. It is a \"used\" church where you can see people pray all the times, lightning candles and obviously very much in awe of the spiritual implications. I also like the garden",

        "wiki": "Ru\u017eica Church (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0426\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u0420\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0446\u0430, romanized: Crkva Ru\u017eica, lit. 'Little Rose Church') is a Serbian Orthodox church located in the Belgrade Fortress, in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Original church was built in the early 15th century, while the modern one was adapted in 1869 and fully reconstructed in 1925. It is dedicated to the Nativity of Mary. With its location within the fortress and water spring of Saint Petka, constant crowds of visitors especially on Saint Petka's feast day, and unorthodox appearance, it is considered one of the \"best loved churches among the adherents\".\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe church is located in the eastern outer bailey of the fortress, between the Zindan Gate's northern arched tower wall on the south, and Jak\u0161i\u0107 Tower on the north, both towering above the church. It is situated along the downhill, partially stepped path, which connects the Upper Town of the fortress (section between the Zindan and Leopold's gates) and the Lower Town. Along the path, just to the southeast, is Belgrade Planetarium, while the path continues to the Neboj\u0161a Tower and the Sava bank.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Predecessor ===\nThe origin of the church is obscured. The church probably existed in the medieval period, during Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107's reign in Belgrade (1402-1427), but the exact circumstances about its construction - when it was built and by whom - are unknown. As a result, several myths about its origins developed and a notion that it was the oldest church in Belgrade. According to one, three sisters, Ru\u017eica, Cveta and Marica, built three churches within the fortress complex and each was named after one of the sisters.\n\nAnother origin story, described by Gregory Tsamblak in the 15th century, place construction of the church in 1403. Princess Milica and nun Jefimija pleaded to the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, also Milica's son-in-law, who eventually granted the permission for the remains of the Saint Petka to be transferred to Serbia before his loss of throne in 1402. Via Vidin, Bulgaria, the remains reached Belgrade in 1403. According to folk legend, wherever the caravan was stopping, the miraculous, healing water springs would appear. Above one of the springs in the fortress, at the location of modern church, the chapel and the church were built. The church was dedicated to the Mary, mother of Jesus, and the water from the spring flew under its foundations.\nThe remains of Saint Petka remained in Belgrade until 1521, kept in the rock nabove the spring. When the Ottomans conquered the city that year, the remains were transferred to Ia\u0219i in Moldavia (modern Romania) and the church was demolished. Saint Petka's finger is still being kept in the modern Ru\u017eica Church as its most valuable relic. The cult of Saint Petka as the healer was so strong, that members of all confessions (Orthodox, Catholics, Muslims), pilgrimaged the spring named after her in the fortress, which was believed to heal the blindness. The surviving remains of the church and the chapel were demolished by the Ottomans in the late 17th century.\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nDuring their 1718-1739 occupation of Belgrade and northern Serbia, the Austrians built a gunpowder magazine next to the spring. It was part of the 1723-1739 Baroque reconstruction of the fortress, and the entire city outside the ramparts, conducted by Nicolas Doxat. Though obliged by the treaty to demolish everything that was built within the fortress during their occupation, the Austrians didn't destroy the magazine which remained as one of the rare object that survived. The Ottomans continued to use it for the same purpose.During his first reign, prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 referred to the church in his correspondence with the Belgrade's Yusuf Pasha. When pasha asked for Milo\u0161 to repair the damaged minaret of the Batal Mosque in Belgrade, prince responded that \"within the ramparts there are two churches, where the Turks keep their ammunition, but they don't allow the Serbs to repair them\". The location was strongly embedded into the collective folk remembrance at the time, due to its alleged ancient origins and miraculous spring of Saint Petka. The myth surrounding the church especially developed in the 19th century, when population believed that Turks adapted the ancient church into the gunpowder magazine. Only 5 days after the Ottomans were fully expelled from the Belgrade Fortress on 18 April [O.S. 6 April] 1867, and on the day when Serbian army entered the fortress, Metropolitan of Belgrade Mihailo Jovanovi\u0107 asked that Serbian government hands over the object to the church for the reconstruction. The board for the reconstruction of the church was founded on 5 May [O.S. 23 April] 1867 and donations collection began.After the works on adaptation of the magazine began, they were finished in 9 months. The consecration was held on 3 January [O.S. 22 December 1867] 1868, by Metropolitan Mihailo. He compared the \"resurrection\" of the church with the biblical Raising of Lazarus. The regular service began by the spring of 1869 when the bell tower was completed. The altar was roofed in September 1869. The first bell was placed in October 1870. As the fortress was largely a military facility, Ru\u017eica was dedicated as the military church.\n\n\n=== Modern church ===\nThe church was heavily damaged during World War I and constant bombardment of the fortress by the Austro-Hungarian forces from across the Sava. It was almost completely demolished in 1915 but was also plundered by the Austro-Hungarian and German soldiers. The altar and the bell tower were damaged the most. Being a garrison church, a Holy Communion for some 1,000 soldiers, defenders of Belgrade, was held in Ru\u017eica in 1914, when Austrians attacked for the first time, and in 1915, when they attacked again. The soldiers were holding positions in the trenches below the church where most of them were killed. In October 1915, a grenade fired from the 42 cm Gamma M\u00f6rser hit the fortress wall right above the church but didn't explode. Church was badly damaged by this time and if the grenade exploded (cartridge weighted 900 kg (2,000 lb) and contained 96 kg (212 lb) of TNT), it would destroy the wall of the Zindan Gate tower which was hit and would level the church to the ground as it is located below the wall. Still, the bell tower was destroyed and the entire apsidal side of the church was completely demolished.At the location of the modern Monument of Gratitude to France in Kalemegdan section of the fortress, there was a monument to Kara\u0111or\u0111e, dedicated on 21 August 1913. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation, the Austrians planned to erect the bronze monument to their emperor, Franz Joseph I on that very spot so they melted the Kara\u0111or\u0111e's monument to reuse the bronze. When the Franz Joseph monument was being shipped to Belgrade in 1918, Serbian forces captured the ship and confiscated the statue. It was later melted into three church bells, largest of which still tolls from the bell tower of the Ru\u017eica Church today.\n\nReconstruction, after the design by the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 architect Nikolay Krasnov, lasted from 1921 to 1925, and the reconstructed Ru\u017eica Church was consecrated on 11 October 1925. A memorial plaque, commemorating this event, but also the destruction during the war, was placed on the church wall. The object wasn't expanded but the new bell tower was completely different than the previous one. The church lost the fa\u00e7ade mortar and Krasnov decided not to restore it. This made the stone, from which the church is made, exposed which gave it the rustic appearance and the object blended better into the surroundings of the stone fortress.The reconstruction was headed by the new board for the reconstruction and heftily helped by the Ministry of war. The Military Technical Institute in Kragujevac cast two large polyeleos chandeliers, three large candelabra and the relief-type icons made of metal. They were all made of melted military materials: rifle and pistol bullets, shell cases and sabres. They are unique among the church equipment because of this and enhanced the military allegiance of the object.During the 1925 reconstruction, two statues were sculptured. One represents the lancer from the period of Emperor Du\u0161an, while the other one is of an infantry soldier from the Balkan Wars period. Krasnov especially designed the side portal where these statues are placed, so as the bronze icon of the Mother of God. The two sculptures were also made of remaining war materials. Six icons were brought from the Serbian military camp in Nador, Morocco, but only two are preserved today. The iconostasis was carved by Kosta Todorovi\u0107, and the icons were painted by Rafailo Mom\u010dilovi\u0107. The walls were covered in paintings by Andrej Bicenko, another Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 artist, who finished his work in 1938.In 1926, the unexploded grenade above the church was deactivated and removed. Newspapers reported about the event on daily basis, and when the grenade was taken out, it was publicly announced that the fortress is safe for the visitors. The grenade is today exhibited in the Military Museum, on the top of the fortress. Also, works on the complex continued after 1925, when the waterworks pipes were conducted and the altar gate was placed. Works were finished by 1937, when the Chapel of Saint Petka, the porch and the clergy house were completed. They were all designed by the architect Momir Korunovi\u0107. It was during this works that an ossuary of the World War I defenders of Belgrade was built within the lower walls of the Jak\u0161i\u0107 Tower, right next to the religious complex.The clergy house was demolished during the massive Allied Easter bombing in April 1944. Only after World War II, with the new Communist government, Ru\u017eica stopped being military and garrison church, and worship services began to be conducted by the monastics and priests of the Patriarchate and the Eparchy of Belgrade-Karlovci.\n\n\n== Artwork ==\nMom\u010dilovi\u0107 painted the icons on the iconostasis using technique oil on plywood, after the sketches of bishop Irinej \u0110uri\u0107. Todorovi\u0107 carved the bulkheads of the iconostasis in the shallow, gold plated wood engraving to recreate the medieval Serbian Morava style. Bicenko's wall paintings are specific, as they contain images of certain contemporaries. Western section represents Jesus Christ's Sermon on the Mount, with priest Petar Trbojevi\u0107 and King Alexander in the audience. In the eastern section there are images of King Peter and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Due to high moisture levels, the iconography is mostly damaged today.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\"\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0459\u0435 - \u0426\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0435 \u0420\u0443\u0436\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0438 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0430\".

It is located on the grounds of the Museum of Yugoslav History in Dedinje, Belgrade, Serbia.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name House of Flowers comes from the fact that many flowers surrounded the tomb until it was closed to the public after the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Today there are only white rocks where the flowers used to be. It was internally called \"flower shop\" during Tito's life when it served as his auxiliary office with covered garden.\n\n\n== History ==\n\"House of Flowers\" was built in 1975, on the basis of a project by architect Stjepan Kralj. It was built as a winter garden with areas for work and rest of Josip Broz with an area of 902 square metres (9,710 sq ft) near the residence where he lived. It consists of three parts: the central one - a flower garden, and two parallel wide corridors on the sides. On the opposite side of the entrance is an uncovered terrace with a view of Belgrade. In the central part, following his personal wish, Tito was buried in May 1980.\nPermanent exhibition in \"House of Flowers\" consist of local, republic, and federal Relays of Youth from the period after  1957, from when 25 May was celebrated as Youth Day. Beside that, written messages that Tito received with relays, photographs of people carrying and exchanged batons, tickets and programs of rallies, and other related material are displayed in the museum.For almost a decade after the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia the entire complex (the tomb and the memorial museum) was closed to the public and the military guards were permanently removed. However, today the site is open again to tourists and to people who wish to pay their respects. Many guests, from all over the former Yugoslavia, visit the place, especially on May 25 (Tito's official birth date) - the former Youth Day under Socialism. The memorial was reportedly visited by more than eleven thousand people in 2004, and since 1982, more than 17,000,000 people.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nHouse of flowers - Virtual tour",

It was founded in 1958 as the Modern Gallery. It was moved into the current building in the U\u0161\u0107e neighborhood of New Belgrade in 1965. The building is a masterpiece of architects Ivan Anti\u0107 and Ivanka Raspopovi\u0107, a short-lived but highly successful partnership, which also produced the 21 October Museum in \u0160umarice Memorial Park in Kragujevac. The collection contains more than 35,000 works of art.\nThe museum collects and displays art works produced since 1900 in Serbia and Yugoslavia. It also organizes international exhibitions of modern and contemporary art. \nThe museum was closed for renovation between 2007 and 2017. After several deadlines were pushed back, the museum was finally reopened for visitors on 20 October 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nThe museum building is located near the confluence of the rivers Sava and Danube, in U\u0161\u0107e park in the Novi Beograd municipality. It was designed by Ivan Anti\u0107 and Ivanka Raspopovi\u0107 in 1960, with construction beginning that year and continuing until 1965. The architects received the October Prize from the City of Belgrade on 20 October 1965, the same day the museum was opened to the public.Due to its shape, architecture and location, it has been described as the \"crystal at the confluence\" or an \"(architectural) jewel\".\n\n\n=== 2007\u201317 renovation ===\nWhen renovation talks first began in the early 2000s, both original architects were still alive. However, Anti\u0107 died in 2005 and Raspopovi\u0107 in 2015. Reconstruction began in 2007, but dragged on for a decade, due to numerous reasons. After 10 years of renovation work, the museum was finally re-opened to the public on 20 October 2017, on the anniversary of the first museum opening 52 years earlier. The entire building was renovated and upgraded to meet current museum standards. The park surrounding the museum building was also reconstructed. The first exhibition to be held in the newly renovated museum was \"Sequences\" by Dejan Sretenovi\u0107.Raspopovi\u0107 contributed to the reconstruction project by suggesting that the glass, belonging to the  building\u2019s domes, be replaced with a darker shade. The newly added blue panels change their tone, depending on the weather and time of day. The domes have therefore become interactive and dynamic, complementing the surrounding park and the nearby modernistic glass-and-steel U\u0161\u0107e Tower. The main criticism, regarding the renovations, revolves around the use of too much concrete in the access paths leading to the museum.  Despite new lighting, as well as the addition of pebbles and tartan, critics believe that the concrete makes the area appear less \"humane\" and could hamper the future growth of  avenue-like trees along the paths.The parceling and concrete work done in the surrounding park area was also criticized, as was the apparent haste in the latter stages to finish the reconstruction quickly. The first company chosen to do the construction work was \"Montera\". It was paid fully for the job, but went bankrupt leaving the renovation unfinished for years. During the next public bidding in 2014, aimed specifically at redoing the roof, the company \"Jedinstvo\" from U\u017eice was chosen. The following bidding, which covered the remaining work, failed. \"Jedinstvo\" applied again and was selected by the museum, even though it had the highest offer. The Ministry of Culture, headed by Ivan Tasovac at the time, insisted that the lowest bidder should be picked instead, which was \"Modulor\", a company from Zemun. As a result, the museum director, Jovan Despotovi\u0107, was let go and the \"Termoin\u017eenjering\" company was chosen at the next bidding. They finished the entire reconstruction, renovating the roof a second time. Yet, already in July 2018 the reconstructed roof began to leak when it rained.\n\n\n== Departments ==\nThe collection began to form in 1958. As of 2018, 8,000 paintings and sculptures are exhibited.The museum has several departments and collections:\n\nCollection of Paintings before 1945\nCollection of Paintings after 1945\nCollection of Graphics, Prints and foreign Paintings\nSerbian and Yugoslav painters represented in the collection include: Sava \u0160umanovi\u0107, Milena Pavlovi\u0107-Barili, Vasa Pomori\u0161ac, \u0110or\u0111e Andrejevi\u0107 Kun, Vane Bor, Leonid \u0160ejka, Julije Knifer, Vladimir Veli\u010dkovi\u0107, Petar Lubarda, Krsto Hegedu\u0161i\u0107, Petar Om\u010dikus, Mi\u0107a Popovi\u0107, Milovan Destil Markovi\u0107, etc.\nThe foreign art collection has 323 works, mostly graphic prints and drawings.\nGraphic works are by Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Joan Mir\u00f3, Georges Braque, Salvador Dal\u00ed, Jacques Villon, David Hockney, Robert Rauschenberg, Eduardo Paolozzi, Victor Vasarely, Hans Hartung, James Rosenquist, Josef Albers, Albert Gleizes, Max Bill, Lucio Fontana, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Frank Stella, Antoni T\u00e0pies, Richard Hamilton (artist), etc.\nDrawings works by : Fritz Wotruba\nPaintings by Max Ernst, Andre Masson\nCollection of Sculptures\nThere are 752 sculptures by Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, Antun Augustin\u010di\u0107, Toma Rosandi\u0107, Walter S.

        "wiki": "Pobednik (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u043a, lit. 'The Victor') is a monument in the Upper Town of the Belgrade Fortress, built to commemorate Serbia's victory over Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empire during the Balkan Wars and the First World War. Cast in 1913, erected in 1928, and standing at 14 metres (46 ft) high, it is one of the most famous works of Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107. It is also one of the most visited tourist attractions in Belgrade and the city's most recognizable landmark.It is a standing bronze male figure in the nude with a falcon in the left hand and a sword in the right (as symbols of peace and war), modelled by the sculptor Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, set on a pedestal in the form of a Doric column on a tall cubic base, designed by the architect Petar Bajalovi\u0107. The statue looks forward across the confluence of the Sava and the Danube, and over the vast Pannonian plain, towards the very distant Fru\u0161ka Gora mountain (until 1918 a domain of Austro-Hungarian empire), it is probably the most powerful, most popular visual symbol of Belgrade.\nThe statue was removed from the column in October 2019 for repairs. It was returned on the pedestal after the restoration on 14 February 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe history of the monument goes back to the period between 1913 and 1928, even though the initial idea was born in 1912, when Serbia\u2019s success in the First Balkan War inspired proposals for erecting a monument in Belgrade to honour the final victory over the Ottomans. In August 1913 Belgrade city council made the decision to mark this momentous event by erecting a monument to Victory. Headed by the mayor Ljubomir Davidovi\u0107, the council decided to rename the Terazije square and build the fountain with the monument in it. They also awarded the construction of the monument to Me\u0161trovi\u0107, without architectural competition.Me\u0161trovi\u0107 accepted the job and quickly presented his design. The original concept was that of a monumental fountain which was to be placed in Terazije or what then was the Square of Crown Prince Alexander. The fountain was to be built of stone in the form of an oval basin, with  8 m (26 ft) in diameter, resting on the backs of four lions. At the centre of the basin was to be a marble column surmounted by the 5 m (16 ft)-tall statue of the Victor. According to the city council resolutions of 4 October 1913 Me\u0161trovi\u0107 was also to produce twenty masks for the rim of the basin and fifty masks for the column, all in bronze. The column was to have 5 segments, representing 5 centuries of Ottoman occupation. On 19 October 1913 the city contracted with Me\u0161trovi\u0107 and he set to work on the fountain but, being an Austro-Hungarian subject, he had to leave Belgrade at the outbreak of the World War I.\n\n\n=== Construction ===\nBackground information about the fountain and its more detailed description were brought out by the newspaper Vreme: ...a large basin (shell) the outer side of which would be decorated with a relief depicting warriors on galloping horses. Affixed along the rim of the shell would be lion\u2019s heads (from the present-day jet fountain) spouting water into the shell. [...] The column would be girdled with spaced hoops to which Turkish head masks would be affixed, and each would spout a jet of water into the basin below...\nIn order to finish the work as quickly possible, Me\u0161trovi\u0107 moved his studio to Belgrade. He worked in the semi-basement of the Elementary School King Petar I by the Cathedral Church, actually in the school's gym. Due to the size of the statue, the school's roof was partially removed. Within a short time he completed the figure of the Victor and lion\u2019s heads. Having sent them to Bohemia for casting, he began to work on the large reliefs of lancers. Sketches for the large lion figures were also done.\nMe\u0161trovi\u0107\u2019s statue of the Victor was done in 1913, immediately after and as a continuation, in concept and style, of the cycle of sculptures intended for his large-scale project for a shrine commemorating the Battle of Kosovo (Vidovdanski hram), which includes representative sculptures such as Srdja Zlopogledja, Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107 and Marko Kraljevi\u0107. Conceived as a colossal athletic male nude set up on a tall column, the monument symbolically represents the iconic figure of victory. In iconographic terms, the personification of the triumph of a victorious nation can be traced back to classical antiquity and its mythic hero Hercules.Then the First World War broke out. The Austrian ultimatum forced Me\u0161trovi\u0107 to leave Belgrade and almost all finishing works had to be ceased. During the occupation by Austrian, German and Hungarian troops, all was destroyed except for the statue of the Victor and lion masks, which were away in Bohemia for casting. The exact appearance of the fountain is known from the photographs of Me\u0161trovi\u0107\u2019s original drawings taken in his Zagreb studio by the sculptor Veselko Zori\u0107.The project of erecting the fountain in Terazije was revived after the First World War, but the available funds could only cover the casting costs for the Victor and lion masks. The statue arrived in Belgrade in the late July 1923 and was stored in a storehouse for plumbing pipes in Senjak. Yet, in 1923 the city council and Me\u0161trovi\u0107 reached an agreement that he should do the monument in Terazije, but the sculpture remained in the storehouse for the next 4 years.\n\n\n=== Scandal ===\nHowever, the beginning of preparation works for the monument's foundation in May 1927 caused a public controversy. The public challenged the erection of the monument on moral and artistic grounds. Instigated by the author and jurist Petar Odavi\u0107, the campaign against the monument began. Odavi\u0107 published an article in the Vreme magazine, attacking the sculpture claiming it insults the moral of chaste Belgrade ladies, so as the memory on Serbian soldiers which it was to represent, by not having \"symbols of the Serbian soldiers\", like the \u0161ajka\u010da hat or the opanak footwear, and that it doesn't represent a Serbian hero but rather some ancient one. Still, the design was endorsed by numerous members of Serbian academia, like Bogdan Popovi\u0107, Stevan Hristi\u0107, Branislav Petronijevi\u0107, Ksenija Atanasijevi\u0107, Zora Petrovi\u0107, Beta Vukanovi\u0107 or Stanislav Krakov, but also by certain women organizations and parts of the clergy. Division among public, elite and church soon gained political connotation. There were various, jokingly suggestions, like the proposition for the super-high pedestal so that its nudity won't be visible from the ground or that, since it is already nude, it may be placed in a swimming pool.Me\u0161trovi\u0107 also had his say: Belgrade City Council asked my consent to set up the \u201cVictor\u201d in Terazije temporarily. But aware that our \u201ctemporarily\u201d tends to last too long, I have made an agreement with the Belgrade architect Bajalovi\u0107 for a more solid pedestal for the statue. The Council, so I\u2019ve heard, set to work. And then stopped. What have I to say? If they intend to set up the statue in Terazije, let them set it up. If they have found a better place, let them set it up there. After all, it may as well stay where it has been for all this time \u2013 in a shed. As far as I am concerned, I\u2019d like it best to have the opportunity to do the whole Fountain the way it was originally conceived.\nEspecially vocal against it were the members of several female organizations. They considered the placing of a figure of a nude man in the center of the city is \"rude\" and that it will damage the moral of the girls. After much controversy, debate and criticism, the city council decided not to set up the monument in Terazije, but to find a location outside the city. As soon as Kosta Kumanudi took over as a mayor of Belgrade in 1926, he pushed to project to finally get it done. Belgrade municipality officially purchased the monument. Also, by this time the city decided to scrap the fountain and the lion heads at the monument's base due to the money reasons. The Arts Commission, formed by the city, decided in September 1927 to relocate the monument and place it \"on the ridge of the Belgrade Town, at the mouth of the Sava and the Danube\". As Kumanudi had other duties in the state government, this decision was confirmed by his deputy Kosta Jovanovi\u0107, and Kumanudi was neither aware or notified about it at the time. Kumanudi then informed Me\u0161trovi\u0107 that the preparatory work on erecting the monument had been ceased contrary to his instructions. This decision of the city council coincided with the completion of the Sava Avenue and the Great Stairway in Kalemegdan Park as well as with the celebration of the anniversary of the Salonika Front breakthrough. It was in commemoration of that event's 10th anniversary that on 7 October 1928 the freshly refurbished part of the Sava Avenue was inaugurated and the Victor unveiled.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nMeasurements from 1989 showed that the \"Victor\" is partially standing on the embankment and partially on the medieval rampart, which is why it is tilting. The technical documentation for the pedestal is lost so the Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments done its own research. It showed that the core of the pedestal is made of concrete while from the outside it has been slab-sided with the stone. The monument was partially repaired in the 1989\u20131991 period. Within this project, in 1990 it was cleaned from the graffiti and dirt.In 1996, the Institute tried to improve the static of the monument and to stop further tilting, but eventually unsuccessfully. The foundations were strengthened and the piles were placed to prevent the tilting. Still, the monument hasn't been fully straightened and remained in partially tilted position, as the piles were pushed into the soft section of the rampart and the subsidence of the terrain continued. Researches in 2007\u20132009 showed that it was tilted 0.8 mm (0.031 in).In 2015, when the broken plates were being removed and replaced at the foothill of the statue, it was discovered that the earth beneath is sagging. The measurements were conducted and an underground room, dug in the 1950s, was discovered beneath the plateau. That delayed the works on the plateau itself, which were finished in September 2016: the new marble plates were placed, so as the decorative lights, while the problem of draining the atmospheric waters was solved, but the monument itself (both the pedestal and the sculpture) were not renovated. That same year the Belgrade University Civil Engineering Faculty concluded that the \"tilting is a process which continues and shows no signs of slowing down or stopping\".In September 2017, it was reported that there is a crack on the monument. The crack starts from beneath the Victor's left foot, goes over the capital and down the Doric column. It is some 50 cm (20 in) long and quite visible. The cracks on the plinth, or the bronze base of the sculpture were the deepest, 4 to 8 mm (0.16 to 0.31 in) wide. The damage of the base, both to the sculpture and the pedestal, is such, that the sculpture stands on the inner, corroded iron skeleton and not on its bronze body. The reporters remarked that it looks like the \"Victor stomped with his left foot, creating the crack\". The Institute stated that the crack is there for a long time and that it is not affecting the stability or the static of the monument, despite the tilt. The crack was growing as the water was entering into it, getting frozen and expanding during the winters, causing further corrosion. The stone on the statue's round bas on top of the pedestal crumbled almost completely, while the steel parts rusted. They announced the full reconstruction and static overhaul for 2019, for which the special technologies are required. The bidding for the project was announced in October 2018. The bronze statue itself, which is damaged by the various ammunitions in time, will be removed from the column, repaired and returned to its place. The column and the pedestal will be repaired in situ and a temporary workshop will be set at the plateau on which the monument is built, where the statue will be repaired, too.On 9 May 2018 on the occasion of Europe Day, the Victor was illuminated for the first time with the colours of EU \u2013 blue and yellow (stars) \u2013 thanks to the EU Delegation in Serbia.\n\n\n=== 2019-2020 reconstruction ===\nOn 28 August 2019 preparatory works on the repair began. The base construction will be fixed first, in order to prevent micro movements and to straighten up the monument. The slabs and plates will be removed so that new piles and beams could be placed below. On 10 October 2019 the statue itself was removed and transported to Smederevo, where sculptor Zoran Kuzmanovi\u0107 will repair it. For the first time since it was posted in 1928, the statue was physically removed from its pedestal. When it was lowered to the ground, it was shown that the statue remained attached to the pedestal only by one screw and the lightning rod wire, while the cables which connected the statue to the base from the inside completely, all four of them, rotted and disappeared. It was also established that the sculpture was lighter than previously thought: it was estimated to be 1.5 to 1.7 tons, but it turned out it has only 1 ton. The sculpture was exhibited for a while at Tsarigrad Road, path in the Kalemegdan Park and former starting point of the road which connected Belgrade to Constantinople.Kuzmanovi\u0107 also headed the repairs of another Fortress landmark, the Monument of Gratitude to France, in 2018. The sculpture has never been repaired since the unveiling. In time it turned black, with only patches of preserved green copper patina. The inner construction of the statue and its connection to the pedestal will also be replaced as, at the time, they were made of iron which corroded in time. The top of the pedestal, on which the sculpture stands, will be completely replaced. Deadline is set for February 2020.The stone slabs used originally were from Ta\u0161majdan quarry, which has been closed a long time ago. Also, the rock below the monument, which was partially used during the construction, can't be used as it protected as the natural monument today, as it originates from the period when the area of Belgrade was submerged under the Pannonian Sea. Instead, stone from Fru\u0161ka Gora will be used.After transportation to Smederevo, it turned out that the statue is even in the worse condition than previously estimated, including terrible statics and loosened sword and eagle. A construction made of stainless steel was added inside the sculpture, to properly connect it to the pedestal. Also, it was discovered that part of the tombstone was embedded into the base. Tombstone probably originated from the Old Cemetery, the 19th cemetery in Ta\u0161majdan. The cemetery was relocated by 1927 to the Belgrade New Cemetery and the remaining tombstones were reused for various construction works around the city. The stone will be preserved and exhibited. Though this was the usual practice in the Balkans in general (the old, reused materials are called spolije), art historians are surprised that a tombstone was used as the pedestal.Due to the high concentration of sulfur dioxide in Belgrade atmosphere, the patina is mostly made of copper sulfate. However, it developed unevenly, so some parts of the sculpture are light green while some are black. It will be cleaned as much as possible (including dry ice) as patina is eating out the copper core. To slow down the process, the Pobednik will be treated with special chemicals. The oxides were removed using the technique of the dry ice abrasive blasting at the temperature of \u221275 \u00b0C (\u2212103 \u00b0F). It was discovered that the nose was partially covered with bronze tin patch, presumably because of the faulty mold. The patch separated in time which allowed for the water to enter inside the sculpture which explains why everything rusted and decayed inside. Kuzmanovi\u0107 cast a proper bronze section of the nose and closed it. It was also found that the steel connection between the handle and the blade of the sword completely corroded. The screw which also supported it was completely rotten and disappeared. It was a pure luck that the blade didn't fell down from the pedestal. Over 30 bullet and shrapnel holes were found on the statue. One cannonball was discovered in one of its legs.To prevent further tilting of the column and to make static of the foundation firmer, eight rebar bars were drilled into the ground. Each has a diameter of 40 mm (1.6 in) and an average length of 10 m (33 ft). Their purpose is not to straighten the column, only to make it more stable, so it will remain tilted. The column was cleaned from soot and the cracks in it, some up to 15 cm (5.9 in) deep, were filled. The sculpture had a total of almost 100 dents and in the end weighted a half of ton more than before the restoration.The statue was returned on the column on 14 February 2020. Works on the column itself and on the surrounding plateau continued until the complete reconstruction was finished on 5 March 2020.\n\n\n== Assessment ==\nThough monument's position and design may be interpreted in a way that he is \"guarding\" the city, and its present function as a major symbol of Belgrade, art historians tend to believe that, due to the scandals following its construction, the monument is placed on present location, on such a high pedestal and turned away from the city in order \"not to be seen better, but to be seen less\".After the creation of a new state and a new spiritual climate in the aftermath of the First World War, the concept of the Herald of Victory (which was the original name of the statue) as the crowning motif of the fountain as a monument to freedom and liberation from the centuries-long Ottoman occupation lost its originally intended sense and its name came to reflect its new dedication to the Salonika Front breakthrough and the victory of the Serbian army in the First World War.\nThe simple design of the pedestal and its well-proportioned height made it possible to take in the monument as a whole rather than in detail, which resulted in the desired monumentality and the perception of the monument as a sign or a symbol. Over time the Victor has become one of the most salient symbols of Belgrade. Along with the Monument of Gratitude to France, it belongs to the few public monuments erected between the two world wars in Belgrade which pursued contemporary stylistic trends.\nThe Victor Monument was designated as a cultural heritage property in 1992.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nTourism in Serbia\nProtected Monuments of Culture (Serbia)\n\n\n== Sources ==\nDu\u0161ko Ke\u010dkemet, \u017divot Ivana Me\u0161trovi\u0107a 1883.\u20131962.\u20132002 (Zagreb 2009).\nDanijela Vanu\u0161i\u0107, \u201cPodizanje spomenika Pobedi na Terazijama\u201d Nasledje IX (Belgrade 2008), 193\u2013210.\nRadina Vu\u010deti\u0107-Mladenovi\u0107, \u201cPobednik: polemike uo\u010di postavljanja Me\u0161trovi\u0107evog spomenika\u201d, Godi\u0161njak za dru\u0161tvenu istoriju VI: 2 (1999), 110\u2013123.\nCHPIB Documentation\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

        "wiki": "The Royal compound (Serbian: \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441 / Kraljevski kompleks) is a complex of residences built for the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 royal family between 1924 and 1937. The compound is located in the Dedinje neighborhood, a prestigious area of Belgrade, Serbia. It consists of two primary residences: The Royal Palace and the White Palace.\nThe royal compound covers an area of 134 hectares, of which 27 hectares surround the Royal Palace and another 12 hectares the White Palace. The service buildings include kitchens, garages, guards barracks and the office of the Marshal.\n\n\n== Parks and gardens ==\n\nThe Royal compound is covered with parks of the English garden type, where the vegetation is allowed to grow naturally, whereas around the two palaces the French garden concept of park arrangement is applied, meaning that flowers, bushes and trees have neatly shaped forms and are planted in strictly geometrical order.\n\n\n== Thatched House ==\nThe Thatched House (Slamnata ku\u0107a) is a structure built in the style of old traditional houses. King Alexander I of Yugoslavia used to reside in this house supervising the construction works at the Royal Compound, and it also served as the studying room for King Alexander\u2019s three sons (later King Peter II, Prince Tomislav, Prince Andrej) and the art studio of Queen Maria.\n\n\n== Royal Palace ==\nThe Royal Palace is a grand stucco villa in the Serbo-Byzantine style by architect \u017divojin Nikoli\u0107 and assisted by Russian immigrant architects Nikolai Krasnov and Victor Lukomsky, was built from 1924 to 1929 as an ideal home for King Alexander I and Queen Maria. The King thought that it would be a nice and quiet place, away from the city noise and curious public eyes. \nVisitors are able to see: The formal entrance hall with details taken from Serbian medieval art, Blue Salon, Royal Dining Room, Royal Library, Atrium, the Salon of the Wedding gifts or Palma il Vecchio Salon \u2013 and The King\u2019s Office. The palace's basement features a unique leisure room with a cinema theatre and billiard tables.\n\n\n== White Palace ==\n\nIt is another Palace within the Royal Compound.\n\n\n== Royal Chapel ==\n\nThe Royal Chapel, which is located within the Royal Compound, is devoted to Saint Apostle Andrew The First-Called, the patron Saint of The Royal Family of Yugoslavia. The church was built at the same time as The Royal Palace and is attached to it through a colonnade with semicircular arches from where there are magnificent views towards northern, western and southern parts of Belgrade, as well as to the terraced rose gardens. It is covered with frescoes painted by Russian painters who travelled around Serbia and copied the frescoes of the most famous Serbian medieval monasteries. The final decoration was chosen personally by King Alexander I with help from the architect Nikolai Krasnov. During the Communist era, the church was repeatedly desecrated, it served as a storage room for cleaners and gardeners. One of the most obvious signs of desecration is a bullet hole in Christ\u2019s forehead and a scratch of the Angel\u2019s wings, representing the communist symbolic \"murder of God\". The church is today used by the Royal Family, especially during Easter, Christmas, and Slava (Patron Saint Day).\nThe Royal compound, which many still wrongly call \"Beli dvor\" because it associates them with Josip Broz Tito, is now the home of Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia and his family. \nThe Royal compound opened its doors for the Days of European Cultural Heritage event and has participated at tourist fairs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nThe Mausoleum of the Royal Family",

        "wiki": "Prince Mihailo Monument (Serbian: \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043a\u043d\u0435\u0437\u0443 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b\u0443 / Spomenik knezu Mihailu) is a monument of Prince Mihailo. It is located in the main Republic Square in Belgrade, Serbia, and was erected in 1882. It was the first public monument with representation of an equestrian figure of a ruler in Serbia. The monument is by Italian sculptor Enrico Pazzi. Reliefs on the monument were performed according to the drawings of architect Konstantin Jovanovi\u0107. The monument was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1979 and it is protected by Republic of Serbia, as the oldest and the most representative figural Serbian memorial.\n\n\n== Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 III, Prince of Serbia ==\nPrince Mihailo (1823\u20131868) was Prince of Serbia from 1839 to 1842 and again from 1860 to 1868. His rule began after the death of his elder brother until 1842, when he was ousted in a revolt led by Toma Vu\u010di\u0107-Peri\u0161i\u0107.\nPrince Mihailo came to the throne a second time, after the death of his father, Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 I, in 1860. He ruled for eight years as the absolutists, making progress in Serbia, harmonized agreements with neighboring countries, for common action in the Balkans. During the second reign of Prince Mihailo, Turkish authorities handed over the remaining cities of Belgrade, \u0160abac, Smederevo, Soko, U\u017eice and Kladovo back to Serbia. In 1868, Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 was assassinated in the Ko\u0161utnjak.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nDuring the second half of the 19th century in Belgrade, an increasing number of monuments, representing numerous prominent personalities from the cultural and political life of Serbia, were erected. An official Serbian state delegation visited Russia in May 1867. After meeting with the Emperor Alexander II in Saint Petersburg, the delegates visited the All-Russian Ethnology Exhibition in Moscow. They noticed the watercolor painting \"Liberation of Serbia\", actually a design for the monumental project by the sculptor Mikhail Mikeshin. They brought the painting to Belgrade and the prince liked the idea. He contacted Mikeshin and invited him to Serbia to work on the project.However, the assassination of the prince on 10 June 1868, delayed the artist's visit. The Board for the erection of the monument was formed already on 14 June 1868 and decided to collect donations for the construction of both the church in Ko\u0161utnjak, at the assassination location, and a monumental sculpture in the city itself. Out of the respect for the assassinated ruler, Mikeshin in Moscow drafted the design for the memorial church or chapel in Ko\u0161utnjak. After arriving in Belgrade in October 1868, and inspecting the city, in cooperation with the government and the Board, he proposed two designs for the monument to the prince, which was to be erected at the Great Market, or the modern Studentski Trg. After the public display, the citizens apparently liked the designs and approved the building. Painter Stevan Todorovi\u0107 ordered the lithographs to be made in Vienna. However, the process of building the memorials dragged on, and in 1871 Mikeshin's propositions were rejected.\n\n\n=== International Competition ===\n\nAlso in 1871, the government opted to build only the monument in the city, which will be \"cast from the old cannons\". It announced the international design competition. There were three contestants: Stevan Todorovi\u0107, Vatroslav Donegani  from Rijeka and a Prussian sculptor whose name is not preserved. Dissatisfied with the results, the government repeated the competition in 1873. This time, the location for the monument was set at the Theatre Square (modern Republic Square), across the National Theatre in Belgrade, which was built by prince Michael.In total, 15 works were received, mostly from foreign artists. The commission added the former two works by Todorovi\u0107 and Donegani, lifting the number of proposals to 17. The first prize was awarded to the Viennese sculptor Vincenz Pilz, second to the distinguished Florentine master Enrico Pazzi, while the third was Wegener's fellow citizen  Anton Paul Wegener. However, late prince's chamberlain Anastas Jovanovi\u0107 pushed the commission in Pazzi's favor.Pazzi was born in Florence in 1819. He was a pupil of the famous sculptor Giovanni Sarti and Duperray. He was representative of the Italian verismo. His artistic direction was showing life as it is, with all its glory and despair. Pazzi had become famous for his work on a monument of the Italian writer Dante; it was erected in 1865 in front of the Florentine church of Santa Croce. Pazzi's Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 sculpture was to depict the ruler on his horse\u2014an innovation in Serbian society at that time. Work began  his work on the statue in 1872 and completed it in 1879, with Serbia gaining independence in 1878. The equestrian statue was undertaken in the classic Italian style of a ruler on a horse, having its model in ancient art. It was the first monumental equestrian statue in Serbia.\n\n\n=== Dedication ===\n\nThe ceremonial unveiling of the monument took place on 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1882, on the day of Saint Nicholas, patron of the dynasty Obrenovic. The event was conceived as a large ephemeral spectacle on the occasion of the proclamation of the Kingdom of Serbia. At that time, a horseman without a hat was an unusual occurrence, and was noticed by the public. Revealing of Monuments was a great spectacle, On the occasion of its unveiling, stage backdrops decorated with flowers, greenery, heraldic shields with a white double-headed eagles and flags, were set. On this occasion, Enrico Pazzi, as author of one of the most important Serbian monuments of the 19th century, received the Order of the Knight of Takovo, second degree. The ceremony was attended by the highest representatives of church, state and army and large numbers of the populace. Dignitaries included the prime minister Milan Piro\u0107anac and ministers; National assembly's deputies; Dimitrije Ne\u0161i\u0107, rector of the Great School with its professors; president and members of the Serbian Learned Society; mayor of Belgrade Mihailo Karabiberovi\u0107 and city council members and delegates from throughout Serbia. The monument was unveiled when King Milan and Queen Natalija arrived. The whole event was attended by the press of that time and above all by the \"Serbian Newspapers\". The  ceremony was designed to demonstrate the power of the newly proclaimed Kingdom.Unveiling of the monument was followed by firing from a hundred and one cannon, and the ringing of bells from all the churches of Belgrade were heard during the ceremonial unveiling of the monument.  In front of the monument the Prince was honored and the anthem sung. Journalistic sources say it was a sublime moment of the ceremony. Afterward, there was the laying of silver wreaths of glory.\n\n\n=== Later developments ===\nOccasionally, architects were suggesting that a protective, decorative fence should be placed around the monument, as the citizens usually sit on the pedestal, which is constantly covered in graffiti. The preservation works were conducted in 1983, and the monument was cleaned thoroughly in 1996, but only the pedestal, while the sculpture wasn't renovated for decades. The pedestal was again cleaned during the 2018-2019 reconstruction of the Republic Square. The reconstruction of the sculpture itself was to start in November 2019. The repairs will be done in situ. The sculpture will be cleaned with distilled water in order to find additional cracks and damages on the brass, which makes most of the material of which the sculpture is built. The patina will be partially cleaned. The large jardini\u00e8res which surrounded the monument were removed during the square reconstruction, leaving the area around the pedestal, so as the entire square, completely barren.The repair was then moved to 2 March 2020. In the folded parts of the monument (where hands hold the reins and where the arms, flintlock and sword, are attached), the restorers discovered animal bones - pigs, cows and pigeons. It is believed that they have been piled by the magpies. Bullet holes were discovered on the monument, but were mostly filled up, probably during some of the previous reconstructions. Where patina grew strong, it will not be removed as it protects the bronze. However, on some spots it became so strong that it altered the facial expression and some other parts of the monument. The monument was in good, sturdy shape, is nicely connected to the stone pedestal, with weight perfectly distributed without any visible changes or tilting. A small, drilled hole, presumably also from some previous survey of the monument, was discovered on the horse's right hoof. The casting sand was pouring out of it. The deadline was set for 1 May.Citing bad weather and the state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the works were prolonged for two weeks. Also, the chief conservator-restorer, Risto Mihi\u0107, left the project. The elaborate of \"Resturatika\" company lost the public bidding but was nevertheless selected by the Institute for the Culture Monuments Protection. Mihi\u0107, who is also a sculptor, opted for the removal of unstable, weak patina, while he wanted to keep the dark, stable one, claiming it is preserving the monument itself. Chosen project is foreseeing aggressive acidic removal of all patina and sulfuric treatment of the bronze to create new patina. Mihi\u0107 believed this would harm the sculpture made of several bronze pieces, so he quit and was replaced by Nata\u0161a Petrovi\u0107. The dripstone was added around the pedestal. Works were finished on 10 June 2020, marking the 152nd anniversary of prince's assassination.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n\n=== Design ===\n\nEnrico Pazzi was influenced by two Renaissance monuments from Florence, where he lived: Equestrian Monument of Cosimo I and Equestrian Monument of Ferdinando I. Both were designed by Giambologna with the former being built in 1594 on the Piazza della Signoria, while the later was erected in 1608 on the Piazza della Santissima Annunziata. Both are, however, influenced by the most famous surviving Roman equestrian statue, Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius, sculptured in c175, which became the blueprint for representations of heroes and winners (Justinian, Gattamelata, Henry IV, Peter the Great).The representation is the mix of Greek and Roman elements. As the ruler and winner on a horse, the prince is represented in Greek style, but the postures of his head, arms and leg, frozen in moment, are typically Roman. The prince's arms are the main representation of his power: the left one has a firm grip on the reins (representing power to control and rule the society), while the right one with extended index finger calls his subjects into future military and diplomatic battles.Model for the horse figure was an actual horse rode by Prince Michael. It was a black horse received by prince while he was returning with Princess J\u00falia from their honeymoon in Romania.\n\n\n=== Description ===\nThe monument is 11 m (36 ft) (of which the statue itself is 5 m (16 ft)) high and 8.46 m (27.8 ft) long. It was cast in the Ferdinand von Mueller's Royal Bavarian Foundry in Munich, Germany and cost 300,000 dinars. It remains unknown whether the old cannons were really melted and recast.The monument is a bronze, equestrian statue of Prince Mihailo on the horse. It was erected in honor of the Prince's most important political achievement - a complete expulsion of the Turks from Serbia in 1867 and liberation of the remaining seven Ottoman-held cities within Serbian territory. The names of the cities are carved on plates on the statue's octagonal granite pedestal, and with the Prince's hand pointing to Old Serbia, the remaining non-liberated territory.The monument is composed of three parts: the plinth, the pedestal and the equestrian statue. The bronze figure represents the prince on the horse, the Serbian liberator from the Turks, whose outstretched arm points to yet oppressed areas. The raised arm, with outstretched index finger comes from militaristic corporeal rhetoric dating back to Roman tradition;  in particular used later from French neoclassical art. For Prince Mihailo this gesture meant victory in the field of diplomacy, not on the battlefield. The Prince holds the reins with the left hand\u2014the gesture symbolizing the ability of the ruler to control and manage. Prince Mihailo was presented as the savior of the nation who sacrificed himself for the nation's ideals. The pedestal, made from the Ven\u010dac marble, is the oval type with a relief frieze. The representations on the front and rear frieze are taken from the circle of dynastic mythology that celebrates antiquity and heroism of the Serbian people and their renewal under the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty. The pedestal has been described as the \"fine ellipse of marble and bronze, elegant, which symbiotically fused with the figure of the horseman\".The scene of the \"Serbian Gusle Player\" is on the back north side, surrounded by people dressed in different costumes, which points to different ethnic boundaries of the nation, far beyond the political borders that existed in the period of the Principality of that time. The player is telling sons about the exploits of the Obenovi\u0107 dynasty. There is a representation of another gusle player, mourning above the casket of Prince Michael. On the front south side is the representation \"The Prince Milos in Takovo\" pointing to the idea of dynastic and national continuity, and to the idea of war for the liberation of homeland.\n\nOn the east and west side of the monument are reliefs which glorify Prince Mihailo. On the east side is the \"National Deputation in front of the Grand Duke Mihailo,\" based on the idea of restoration of the golden period in the restored state and on the west side is the representation \"The Serbs take an oath over the grave of Prince Mihailo\". In the middle of the scene there is an ancient sarcophagus with an inscription in French, which says: \"Michel III prince de Serbie\". The entire pedestal with reliefs was set on a high rectangular plinth, so that the monument's location and appearance would dominate the space; in the assessment, an important visual and symbolic role is made in the elevation of the royal personage.\nThe emblem of Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty is on the front south side of the plinth, similar to the emblem on the Duke's tomb in the Orthodox Cathedral. Three large bronze garlands are on the lateral sides, on which were inscribed in gilt letters the names of cities liberated in 1867: Belgrade, Kladovo, Soko, Smederevo, \u0160abac and U\u017eice. On the back, north side is the text (in translation): \u201cTo Prince Mihailo Obrenovic III. Grateful Serbia.\u201c In the corners of the plinth are placed four relief trophies, and around the monument, there is a fence with candelabras.\nThe Monument to Prince Mihailo was established as a cultural monument of great value, Decision on Establishment, \"Off . Gaz. SRS\" No.14/79.\n\n\n== Popularity ==\nPrince Mihailo is presented without any kind of hat on his head, which was highly unorthodox for any dignitary, let alone a ruler at the time. Popular story about this survived for a long time. It was about a boy, who on the day of dedication yelled \"where is his hat?\". The sculptor was so hurt by this, that he committed suicide. In truth, Pazzi lived for another 17 years, to the age of 81. He lived in Belgrade for several years and, upon leaving, wrote an open letter to \"chivalric kingdom\" of Serbia, stating: \"I'm Italian in my soul and emotions, but in my heart and rejoice I'm Serbian\".Though always highly regarded as a ruler, the role and honor of prince somewhat fell into the oblivion when it comes to his monument, and the statue became simply known as kod konja (Serbian for \"at the horse\"). Even the nearby restaurant was named that way for a while. It became the most popular gathering place in Belgrade, as people would just say \"lets meet at the horse\". Art historians partially blame the composition of the monument itself for this, as the statute is clearly \"more forcing the horse than the horseman\". Other chroniclers and journalists don't understand why the first association for the citizens is the horse and not the prince, but that it likely won't change soon as the habit of calling it \"at the horse\" now spans many generations.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMonuments of Culture of Great Importance\nTourism in Serbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Prince Mihailo Monument at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "Ta\u0161majdan Park (Serbian: \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a / Ta\u0161majdanski park), colloquially Ta\u0161majdan (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0430\u043d) or simply just Ta\u0161 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0422\u0430\u0448, literally: Tash), is a public park and the surrounding urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Palilula. In 2010\u20132011 the entire park saw its largest reconstruction since its creation in 1954.\n\n\n== Location ==\nTa\u0161majdan begins 600 m (2,000 ft) southeast of Belgrade's designated center, Terazije, covering the extreme south-west corner of the Palilula municipality, bordering the municipalities of Vra\u010dar on the south and Stari Grad on the west. In a narrower sense, Ta\u0161majdan occupies the area bounded by the streets of Takovska on the north-west, Ilije Gara\u0161anina on the northeast, Beogradska on the southeast and Bulevar kralja Aleksandra. The majority of the area is occupied by the park itself (central, east, west) while the northern and extreme western sections are urbanised. In wider sense, it occupies the additional area to the north (between Ilije Gara\u0161anina and 27. marta streets) and east (between Beogradska and Karned\u017eijeva streets) The latter is also known as Little Ta\u0161majdan. Ta\u0161majdan is bordered by the neighborhoods of Palilula on the northeast, while it extends into the neighborhoods of Vukov Spomenik, Krunski Venac and Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 Square on the east, south and west, respectively.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nThe neighborhood of Ta\u0161majdan forms a local community (mesna zajednica), sub-municipal administrative unit within Palilula. It had a population of 4,887 in 1981, 4,373 in 1991, 4,018 in 2002, and 3,073 in 2011.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\nAlmost two millennia ago, Romans were extracting stone from the quarry located in the area for the building of Belgrade's predecessor, Singidunum and for many surviving sarcophagi from that period. It was recorded that the Romans used this stone for the construction of the city's aqueduct in 69 AD. The castrum of Singidunum had tall walls, built from the white Ta\u0161majdan limestone. After the Slavs settled in the area, because of the white stones of the fortress they named the city Beligrad, or \"white city\".The quarry remained operational during Ottoman period, thus giving the name to the entire location (Turkish ta\u015f, stone and meydan, square), though it was also used for the extraction of saltpeter by Ilija Milosavljevi\u0107 Kolarac, which was used in the gunpowder production. Due to the proximity to the town, basically all stone buildings and walls in Belgrade from Ottoman period were built from the stone extracted here.\n\n\n=== Little Vra\u010dar ===\nSome historians believe that this is the actual place where the remains of the Serbian Saint Sava were burned at the stake on 29 April 1595 by the Ottoman grand vizier Sinan Pasha (area known as Little Vra\u010dar) and not the Vra\u010dar hill itself or Crveni Krst, another alternative site. Little Vra\u010dar (Serbian: \u041c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0412\u0440\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0440) occupied the area along the Tsarigrad Road, starting from the modern crossroad of the Takovska Street and Bulevar Kralja Aleksandra. Sinan Pasha transported the remains from the Mile\u0161eva monastery in the golden casket and later scattered the ashes over Ta\u0161majdan.When an international congress of Byzantinologists was held in 1927 in Belgrade, some of them gathered with Marko Kuzmanovi\u0107, a protopope of the Saint Mark Church. As Kuzmanovi\u0107 wrote, based on previous researches, they all took 60\u201370 steps from the church altar to the east and ended up on the small mound, called \u010cupina Humka from where both the Sava and the Danube rivers could be seen. Then they told him that this is the exact spot where the remains of Saint Sava were burned. On that spot today is the Poslednja \u0160ansa restaurant. Historians who claim that Ta\u0161majdan is the right location include Jovan Raji\u0107 and Sreten Popovi\u0107.During the 1717 siege of Belgrade, parts of the battle were in Ta\u0161majdan. Austrian army, headed by Eugene of Savoy, defeated the Ottomans, under the command of Hac\u0131 Halil Pasha. The Ottomans suffered heavy losses and had to hand over Belgrade to the Austrians, which kept it under 1739. The locality of \u010cupina [H]umka itself was named after captain Milija Le\u0161janin \u010cupa. He gained prominence in the 1717 fighting but was executed on the future \u010cupina Humka location in 1725.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\nDuring the First Serbian Uprising and the subsequent Siege of Belgrade in autumn of 1806, leader of the Uprising Kara\u0111or\u0111e set his camp in Ta\u0161majdan and conducted the liberation of Belgrade from there. He has done so, as from this location, up to the Stambol Gate of the Belgrade Fortress, there was an open field. One of the heroes of the uprising, Vasa \u010carapi\u0107, was wounded at Stambol Gate and died in Kara\u0111or\u0111e's tent in Ta\u0161majdan.The \u010cupina Humka mound was used for public reading of decrees and laws. It was here that on 30 November 1830 the Sultan's hattisherif (decree) was publicly announced, declaring autonomy (de facto, internal independence) of Serbia and granting hereditary ruling rights to the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty.Ruling prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 ordered the relocation of the cemetery to Ta\u0161majdan in 1828 and in 1832, when he decided to build a merchant area along the Sava river, he also relocated the inhabitants of Savamala neighborhood. In the churchyard a school for 35 pupils was built in 1837, which was only the second elementary school in Belgrade at the time. During the \u010cukur Fountain incident in June 1862, and the subsequent bombardment of the city by the Ottomans from the fortress, thousands of women and children found refuge in Ta\u0161majdan's caves.Because of the vicinity of the cemetery in Ta\u0161majdan, there were many shops of funeral equipment and stonecutters. Small shops in time evolved into larger facilities, mostly selling old and cheap goods for the poorer citizens. Mostly owned by the Jewish merchants, these second hand shops formed the predecessor of modern flea markets, stretching along the street to the location of modern Law Faculty.Eastern part of Ta\u0161majdan was a location of one of the first horse tracks in Belgrade. First modern horse races in Belgrade, based on those held in Western Europe, were organized in 1842, by the former British consul-general George Lloyd Hodges. During the reign of prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107, horse races became an annual event since 1862, with prince himself being one of the participants and creator of the rules. He organized three annual races: for the officers, for the public horsemen and for \u201canyone else who wanted to participate\u201d. But for decades, the city had no regular horse track. Originally, the races were organized in the, at that time, outskirts of Belgrade: eastern Ta\u0161majdan from 1863 (modern Vukov Spomenik neighborhood, close to the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law and Metropol Palace Hotel Belgrade area), and from the 1890s in Marinkova Bara.\n\n\n==== Cemetery ====\nAfter the successful Second Serbian Uprising when Serbian prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 ordered the building of a new town around the old Kalemegdan fortress (Savamala neighborhood), he also ordered that the old Serbian cemetery from Varo\u0161 Kapija (near Zeleni Venac) be moved to Ta\u0161majdan, which was done in 1828. New cemetery was intended as \"international\" contrary to the existing practice, so beside Serbs, it was also the burial place for Hungarians, Germans, Greeks, Italians and French.In the mid-19th century, near the modern crossroads with the Takovska Street (named Ratarska then), was where city ended at the time, and the fields began. The Batal mosque was located there, giving its name to the developing neighborhood. Kafana Valjevo was located where the Czech embassy is today. At the crossroad was the house of the Savi\u0107 family, used as a medical facility and across it was the Mari\u0107 pharmacy. Next to the pharmacy was a curvy road which was leading to the Ta\u0161majdan cemetery. The cemetery wasn't divided into parcels, but had numerous narrow, crossed paths, grown into bushes. This was also the location of Fi\u0161eklija, a series of gunpowder stores, where gunpowder was sold in fi\u0161eks, cone-shaped bags made from waxed paper. The stores developed in the second half of the 19th century, after Prince Milo\u0161 ordered for gunpowder stores to be removed outside of the city due to the safety reasons.Already in 1880, city newspapers were reporting on the bad condition of the Ta\u0161majdan cemetery. The burial lots were purchased in the Saint Mark's Church, which became quite wealthy, but the cemetery was neglected. Also, as the land was owned by the church, city administration had no interest into arranging the cemetery itself. Part of the cemetery on the side of the Takovska, belonged to the Catholics and the Lutherans. The hill in the direction of modern Seismology Institute was allocated for the graves of soldiers, drowning victims, suicides and non-Christians in general, except for the Jews, who had their own cemetery. Newspapers described the cemetery and the surrounding area as the \"shelter for rascals and danglers, who tear the flowers, steal monuments, defile graves with slurs and in other ways, so that cemetery is an abomination of Belgrade where there is no any piety for the deceased\".In the western section of the cemetery the Catholics and Protestants were buried, Serbs on the central promenade, while area around modern Seisomology Institute was left for the soldiers, suicides and drowned ones. In 1835 a small Palilulska church was built. Some of the most important Serbs from this period were buried in the churchyard, including politicians Toma Vu\u010di\u0107-Peri\u0161i\u0107 and Stojan Simi\u0107 and Stevan Kni\u0107anin, philologist \u0110ura Dani\u010di\u0107, botanist and first president of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Josif Pan\u010di\u0107 and philanthropist Ilija Milosavljevi\u0107 Kolarac. Belgraders protested because new cemetery, built on an inhabited fields, gardens and vineyards was away from then downtown, but already in the 1850s, the area surrounding the cemetery was completely urbanized.Also, as the city expanded, cemetery became inadequate. One the one side, it became too small for the function of the city's main graveyard. On the other, once projected to be on the outskirts of the city, as Belgrade grew, Ta\u0161majdan practically became downtown and close to the Royal court. The first official initiative for the removal of the cemetery came in 1871 from Mihailo Jovanovi\u0107, Metropolitan of Belgrade. As the city was in the financial crisis at the time and was not able to buy such a large lot for the new cemetery, mayor of Belgrade Vladan \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 donated a patch of his land to the city for the purpose of establishing a new cemetery. City government officially obtained land in 1882 and gradual restriction of burials was conducted until it was fully closed 1901. It was moved to the newly built Belgrade New Cemetery, several blocks to the east, beginning from 1886 and the moving was finally completed in 1927 with park being planted instead of the old cemetery. However, many bodies from older periods were not moved and remained below the park.As many weren't relocated because they had no surviving family members. or their families weren't interested or solvent enough to pay for the relocation, city administration was left with the large number of tombstones. Some of the stones and bricks were sold, earning nice income to the city, but still, many remained. Administration decided to reuse them for construction works around the city. The stones were used for the 1927-1928 works on the Belgrade Fortress (pathways around the Big Staircase in Kalemegdan Park which connected it to the fortress' Lower Town, parts of the Pobednik's pedestal), for the partial paving of the Ruzveltova Street and for the construction of the Ta\u0161majdan pathway between the churches of Saint Mark and Holy Trinity. Belgrade chronicler Zoran Nikoli\u0107 labeled the fortress path, made of the tombstones turned with the inscribed sides down, Path of the \"Former\" Deceased.This was the usual practice in the Balkan history in general (the old, reused materials are called spolije) as there are numerous Greek, Roman and Byzantine remains in the region. Still, citizens protested when former tombstones were used for the works on the fortress. One of the stone benches was made in such a manner, that the name of the deceased, Aksentije Jovanovi\u0107, was clearly visible, together with the carved cross and skull and crossbones.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nOn the horse race track, a football match was held in 1915, before the German-Austrian attack, between the gunners from the Allied nations (Russia, Great Britain and France) and the Serbian team made of the players from the teams BSK, Velika Srbija and Soko. BSK had its own court nearby, on the location of the modern Belgrade University Library. During the Interbellum, King Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 had an idea of building a catholic church in the Ilije Gara\u0161anina Street, next to the First Female Realschule. He intended to build it above the former quarry, where the modern stadium is, as an edifice \"monumental like Vatican cathedral of Saint Peter and beautiful like basilica Sagrada Fam\u00edlia in Barcelona\". The project was never realized.Tennis court was located on Ta\u0161majdan during World War II. As basketball was played on the clay at the time, local guys began playing basketball there. In 1942\u201344, a group of 4 players was formed: Bora Stankovi\u0107 (1925), Aleksandar Nikoli\u0107 (1924\u20132000), Radomir \u0160aper (1925\u201398) and Neboj\u0161a Popovi\u0107 (1923\u20132001). After the war, the group became founding fathers of the \"Yugoslav school of basketball\". Later, Stankovi\u0107 became secretary general of FIBA, Nikoli\u0107 was a coach, labeled the \"Father of Yugoslav basketball\" while \u0160aper and Popovi\u0107 turned to administrative positions. All four are FIBA Hall of Fame inductees.\nThe construction of the park began in 1950 and the opening ceremony was held in May 1954. The seedlings were transported by the horse wagons from the nursery gardens in Krnja\u010da and from Zagreb's Forestry Faculty.In 1961, the first olympic-size swimming pool in Belgrade was built in Ta\u0161majdan, within the complex of the sports center. At the time, the complex also included Belgrade Tennis Club, amusement park, \"Avala\" cinema, Fire Brigade and its fire lookout tower.Since the 1970s, venues in Ta\u0161majdan became some of the most popular hotspots of Belgrade's night life. In 1971, \"Cepelin\" (\"Zeppelin\"), the best and the most famous disco in Yugoslavia was opened. It was located at 28 Ilije Gara\u0161anina Street. Its opening was described as the \"rushing off\" of the Belgrade night life. At the opening night, almost all of the state and military top officials and members of the diplomatic corps, were present. The caviar was served from the Josip Broz Tito's plates. At the peak of its popularity, \"Cepelin\" had 10,000 members. It had three dance floors, state of the art sound system and the interior was patterned after the famed London club \"Lavalbon\": floors covered with the black artificial leather, dominant brass ornaments, luxurious s\u00e9par\u00e9es, plush covered armchairs, twenty different types of mirrors, one thousand colored lightbulbs, and strobe lights above each dance floor. It also had blacklights, projector which emitted psychedelic music videos on the walls which were mostly black. The rooms were stuffy and the colors of the lights changed depending on the DJ who was working that night. Parts of the walls and furniture were in red, with colorful flower prints. The club was located next to the Fifth Gymnasium and sponsored by the Ta\u0161majdan Sports and Recreation Center. It was opened by Sa\u0161a Nikoli\u0107 and had working hours of 16:00\u201321:00 (matin\u00e9e, for the minors) and 21:00\u201324:00, for adult visitors, with strict rules on not allowing the minors to stay during the later program. DJs, including Sa\u0161a Radosavljevi\u0107 and Ra\u0161a Petrovi\u0107, were located in the glass booth above the dance podium. It was renovated and expanded in the mid 1970s and included live performances from the most popular Yugoslav rock bands. Most frequent performers was Korni Grupa. \"Cepelin\" was closed in 1980.In the 1980s, \"Ta\u0161\" replaced \"Cepelin\". The club had the so-called \"Chivas booths\", which introduced whiskey as a symbol of prestige in the Belgrade's night life. Popular venues in the 1990s included \"Bus\" (in the park, close to the stadium, located in a small edifice which extended from the real derelict bus) and \"Pe\u0107ina\" (situated at the entry into the lagums, and in the lagums themselves. It hosted the \"Ovo je moj grad\" festival).\n\n\n==== 1999 NATO bombing ====\nTa\u0161majdan was bombed again during the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia when several objects in Ta\u0161majdan park were badly hit:\n\n23 April 1999 \u2013 At 2:06 NATO aircraft struck with missiles the building of the Serbian Broadcasting Corporation (RTS) situated in Ta\u0161majdan park. Part of the building collapsed, trapping people who were working in the building that night. Sixteen people were killed while many were trapped for days. The building of the Russian church nearby was also seriously damaged.\n24 April 1999 \u2013 A children's theatre \"Du\u0161ko Radovi\u0107\" in the heart of Ta\u0161majdan park was badly damaged due to its close proximity to neighbouring buildings that were bombed.\n30 June 1999 \u2013 A heart-like shaped monument was erected by the city of Belgrade for all the children that have died in the bombing. The monument says \"We were just children\" in English and Serbian.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nUrbanists drafted a detailed regulatory plan for the park in 2001. They concluded that both restaurants (Madera and Poslednja \u0160ansa) and a group of houses across the Law Faculty, shouldn't be in the park area. The only edifice which is completely surrounded by the park, and which should be preserved, was the Seismology Institute (churches are located at the edges of the park). Still, it was decided that nothing will be demolished, that nothing can be built in the park, that existing edifices will be kept \"as long as they stand\" and that they can't be enlarged and annexed, either in width or height. While Poslednja \u0160ansa was descriebd as a small object, while Madera was described by the urbanists as the \"boil\" in the park. In October 2019, under suspicious conditions, the leaseholder of Poslednja \u0160ansa since 1991 was expelled and Predrag Rankovi\u0107 Peconi, controversial business figure who has been acquiring hospitality venues in Belgrade in the past two decades, was announced as the new tenant. Sports Center, which owns the venue, claims the name will be preserved and the statue of poet Vasko Popa will be erected in the restaurant's yard.In June 2010, it was announced that the park will be completely reconstructed as a gift of Azerbaijan to Belgrade. The park has been reopened in June 2011 after throughout renovation, including the installation of a coloured fountain broadcasting classical music. As a sign of gratitude Belgrade has erected a monument to the former president of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev in the park. Reconstruction included the rebuilding of the paths, removal of sick trees and planting of new ones, construction of two children playgrounds and a special area for the pensioners. Two public toilets and park infrastructure were renovated, the video surveillance system was installed and the statue of the writer Milorad Pavi\u0107 was erected.As of 2013, Ta\u0161majdan Park had 1,100 individual trees from 61 different species and covered and area of 11 ha (27 acres).\n\nIn November 2017 a complete rearrangement of the plateau, which functioned as an extension of the Ta\u0161majdan Park in front of the St.Mark's Church began. Old asphalt pavement which served as a parking lot was removed. Architect Jovan Mitrovi\u0107 designed a new, leveled combination of granite slabs and green areas. The plateau was divided in two sections, left and right, separated by the green island. The right, \"ceremonial\" side was regularly shaped, with the granite slabs posted in the horizontal rhythm, interrupted with the thin squares of red Italian granite. The design is patterned after the fa\u00e7ade of the Michelangelo's temples on Capitoline Hill in Rome. The left side has \"disheveled\" pattern, made of differently sized and combined granite slabs. The plateau was finished in February 2018.In June 2018 it was announced that a monument to Patriarch Pavle, head of the Serbian Orthodox Church from 1990 to 2009, will be erected on the green area between the newly finished plateau and the tram stop in Ta\u0161majdan Park. The 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) tall bronze monument was authored by Zoran Male\u0161. It was placed in the park on 13 November 2018 and dedicated on 15 November, an anniversary of Pavle's death. Male\u0161 said that he wanted to show the etherealness of Pavle, who was deemed among Serbs as the \"walking saint\". He also added that he was influenced by the photos of patriarch commuting by the trams \u2013 it showed his mundane approach to life, using the public transportation, and he indeed often travelled to this spot when he was visiting the Saint Mark's Church. However, the sculpture of the patriarch in the sitting position, but without a chair, throne or anything that he is sitting on, garnered negative public reaction. The Serbian Orthodox Church said that this is a public monument and that they will not judge it, but that it plans to erect a proper, monumental sculpture of Patriarch Pavle in the churchyard of the Rakovica Monastery, where he was buried.Right across the park, at the corner of the Resavska Street and Bulevar kralja Aleksandra, a memorial plaque in memory of assassination of Galip Balkar (1937-83), Turkish ambassador to Yugoslavia, was unveiled on 8 October 2019. Assassination occurred on 9 March 1983 and the plaque commemorates both the ambassador, and student \u017deljko Milivojevi\u0107, who was also killed by the assassins while trying to apprehend them.\n\n\n== Landmarks ==\nWith the surrounding area, Ta\u0161majdan forms the cultural-historical complex Stari Beograd (Old Belgrade), while the park itself is in the zone of the protected natural area of Miocenski sprud-Ta\u0161majdan (Miocene ridge-Ta\u0161majdan).\n\n\n=== Churches ===\n\nSmall Palilulska church (church of Palilula) was built in 1835. It was destroyed in the German bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941. Today existing Serbian Orthodox St. Mark's Church was built in 1931\u20131940, in the medieval Serbo-Byzantine style, patterned after the Gra\u010danica monastery. The Serbian Emperor Du\u0161an is buried inside, along with the Serbian Patriarch German. Next to it is a small Russian Orthodox church of the Holy Trinity, built in 1924, inside of which the Russian general Pyotr Wrangel is buried.\n\n\n=== Sports complex ===\n\nWithin the Ta\u0161majdan park a sports complex of Ta\u0161majdan Sports Centre is located. Centre administers several facilities located outside Ta\u0161majdan, like \"Pionir Hall\" and \"Ice Hall\". However, swimming pools are located in the park. The outdoor swimming pool was built in 1959\u20131961. Its dimensions are 50 x 20 meters; its depth varies between 2.2 and 5.0 meters; its capacity is 3,500 m\u00b3 and 2,500 seats. Next to the big one, there is a small swimming pool for children. Altogether, there is enough room for 4,000 people. It is equipped for international day-and-night competitions in swimming, water polo, water diving, etc. and also used for certain cultural venues or as an outdoor cinema during summer. It was one of the venues for the 2006 Men's European Water Polo Championship and one of the venues of the 2009 Summer Universiade in July 2009, the event for which the pool was renovated. The indoor swimming-pool was built in 1964\u20131968 and open for public on 17 February 1969. Its dimensions are 50 x 20 meters and depth is between 2.2 and 5.4 meters; its capacity is 3,700 m\u00b3. The swimming pool is surrounded with four diving boards \u2013 1, 3, 5 and 10 meters high and 2,000 seats. It is equipped with underwater light. At  \u221216 \u00b0C, water and air can be heated up to 28 \u00b0C.\nSome of the best known happenings in the venue include: EuroBasket Women 1954, first Miss Yugoslavia contest in 1957 (won by Tonka Katunari\u0107), 1957 World Women's Handball Championship, concerts of Alexandrov Ensemble in 1958 and later in the 1960s and 1970s of Mazowsze, Ray Charles and Tina Turner and ice hockey matches with over 10,000 spectators.\n\n\n=== Seismology Institute ===\n\nAfter an earthquake hit Svilajnac in 1893, one of the strongest ever in Serbia, instigated by the geologist Jovan \u017dujovi\u0107, the Geology institute of the Great School began collecting data on earthquakes. After the Great School was transformed into the University of Belgrade in 1905, University established the Seismology Institute in 1906 and proposed the location of Ta\u0161majdan. First seismographs were installed in 1909 and the first earthquake was recorded in June 1910. Seismology Institute was officially part of the University of Belgrade until 1995, but is still located in Ta\u0161majdan.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nRTS main building in Takovska and Aberdareva streets. Previously, the television headquarters were located on the Belgrade Fair. After the first phase of the construction was finished, Dnevnik, central daily news, began transmitting from Ta\u0161majdan on 20 July 1967.\nthe main post office building of the national post office company Po\u0161ta Srbije, built in 1934, in Takovska street.\nThe University of Belgrade's Law School, in Bulevar kralja Aleksandra.\nfamed Belgrade \"Madera\" restaurant.\nanother famous restaurant, \"Poslednja \u0160ansa\", the first Belgrade restaurant opened 24/7.\nHotel \"Ta\u0161\", opened in March 1969.\nMetropol Hotel Belgrade, in Bulevar kralja Aleksandra.\nstatue of Desanka Maksimovi\u0107, leading Serbian poet, erected in 2007.\nstatue of Milorad Pavi\u0107, Serbian writer, author of the Dictionary of the Khazars, erected in 2011.\nchildren's amusement park.\nmany rock pigeons can be seen in the park, popular among the birdwatchers.\nroundabout of the tram line number 6.\n\n\n== Little Ta\u0161majdan ==\nLittle Ta\u0161majdan (Serbian: \u041c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0448\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0430\u043d / Mali Ta\u0161majdan) is the eastern extension of the park, across Beogradska street which forms its western border, while Ilije Gara\u0161anina and Karned\u017eijeva streets form its northern and eastern borders, respectively. The southern section of the complex is the location of the Law Faculty and Hotel Metropol.\nThe park has undergone a renovation in 2006. Concrete walkways have been placed (6,000 square metres), and new stairways lighting have been installed. In the centre of the park a playing area for children has been constructed. Near the children's area there is a fountain which has also been renovated and 30 new benches have been placed in the park as well.\nMarking 80th anniversary of his death, a monument to the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 architect Nikolay Krasnov was dedicated in the park. Krasnov designed some of the most representative public buildings in Belgrade during the Interbellum. A stone monument, representing Krasnov sitting at the drawing desk, is work of Neboj\u0161a Savovi\u0107 Nes. The monument, work of Russian sculptor Sergey Nikitin, was first announced for September 2016. The planned location was the Manje\u017e park, but this plan never went through. The monument is ultimately placed in the Little Ta\u0161majdan, across the building of the Archive of Serbia, which was designed by Krasnov.\n\n\n== Underworld ==\nGeologically, the rocks on Ta\u0161majdan are 13,5 million years old, and the ridge was probably a low island during the existence of the inner Pannonian Sea. Fosils from this period have been found and are kept at the Museum of Natural History. The caves under Ta\u0161majdan are 6 to 8 million years old. Remains of the Roman aqueduct are found in the caves. Military arsenals and warehouses have been housed for a long time in the catacombs left after the excavations of stone blocks, and these catacombs have been also used as shelters and first-aid places for wounded soldiers.\nDuring the Interbellum, the \u0160onda family, who owned the chocolate factory, founded the \"ice factory\" in Ta\u0161majdan's underground, below the modern building of Radio Television Serbia. The ice was advertised as the \"ice from the tap water\", as opposed to the naturally occurring ice from the Danube.It was a major hiding place for the local population during the 1914\u20131915 bombing of Belgrade by the Austro-Hungarian army in World War I and German bombing in April 1941. During World War II, the caves were the headquarters of Alexander L\u00f6hr, head of the German Air forces in Serbia, and colloquially called \"L\u00f6hr\u2019s cave\"., which is accessed after passing the former quarry. Headquarters were massive, with large metal doors, truck entrances and fully prepared to support 1,000 soldiers for six months without making any surface contact. It could survive chemical and biological attacks, had a ventilation system, power generator, phone lines and elevator and one of the caves was even adapted into the brig for disobedient soldiers. It was also used by the Germans as the collection center for the Jews. Vast labyrinth of corridors, expanded by the Wehrmacht, branches into all directions beneath the city and today nobody knows how many of them there are or where they all lead. Future examinations are slowed because of the lack of funding and many remaining German mines. After 1945 the entrances into the caves were closed and new generations completely lost any knowledge of it. It was only in the 2000s that they were rediscovered and today are slowly turning into one of Belgrade tourist attractions. Occasionally, people illegally dig through the walls of the caves, hoping to find some long lost treasure.Third large natural cave is right beneath the famed \"Poslednja \u0160ansa\" restaurant. It was described by Felix Kanitz, who travelled through Serbia from 1860 to 1864. He noted that in this cave he has found 150 oxcarts with food and that the entire cave could accommodate some 600 carts all together. After World War II, caves were used as \u201cice factory\u201d, which supplied with ice city kafanas until the 1950s. A big boulder broke off in 1966, fell into the center of the cave and a little girl fell through the hole and got killed. When sports center was built, rubble and remaining bones from the old cemetery were thrown into the caves, with deposits being some 15 m (49 ft) high today. Old doctors used to say that from these piles they took bones for the anatomy classes. In general, the cave, known as the \"Saltpeter cave\", appears at least half of its real size being buried under the deposits and geologists dubbed it \"the weirdest part of Belgrade\". It branches into the direction of the Faculty of Law, but this corridor is completely buried and was never explored. All caves are cold and wet.As the caves were under military jurisdiction after World War II, only when the military administration was revoked, the exploration of the underground began in 1992. The accessible sections of the underground are some 20 m (66 ft) below the park.\n\n\n=== Aquarium ===\nUnderwater research company \"Viridijan\" announced in June 2006 it would begin construction of the first Belgrade's aquarium in the caves beneath Ta\u0161majdan. The project includes construction of 50 underground aquariums with about 1,000 cubic meters of water in the period of 9 years. Over 900 marine animals were supposed to be placed in the natural environment provided by the caves. The project was initially backed by the Ministry of trade in the Government of Serbia and Belgrade City Assembly (the only problem appeared to be the building permit), but the project, which was promised to be \"more than just exhibit space\" and announcing \"the return of Pannonian Sea to Belgrade\" was abandoned.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTa\u0161majdan Park\nCity of Belgrade\nTa\u0161majdan Underground\nCrkva Svetog Marka\n(fr) Arkadi Kara, \"La philanthropie d'influence men\u00e9e par l'Azerba\u00efdjan, Portail de l'IE, 17 d\u00e9cembre 2014",

It is formed by two towers connected with a two-storey bridge and revolving restaurant at the top. It is 117 m (384 ft) tall (with restaurant 135\u2013140 m (443\u2013459 ft)) and is the second-tallest high-rise in Belgrade after U\u0161\u0107e Tower.\nThe building is designed to resemble a high-rise gate greeting people arriving in the city from the West (the road from Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport to the city centre leads this way). Disputed and criticized during the designing and construction process, the building is today a dominant landmark in Belgrade.One of the towers was occupied by the state-owned Genex Group. The tower got its popular name \"Genex\" after this group, while its official title remains Western City Gate. The second, taller tower, is residential. The tower formerly occupied by the Genex company is empty, while the residential tower is still home to scores of people. The revolving restaurant above it stopped turning.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe building is located in the municipality of New Belgrade, in the 41-43 Narodnih heroja Street. It is actually situated at the corner of the street and the European route E75. West of the gate are the neighborhoods of Studentski Grad and To\u0161in Bunar while Fontana is to the north. In the New Belgrade's blocks numeration system, the building belongs to the Block 33.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn the late 1960s, architect Mihajlo Mitrovi\u0107 was given a task of projecting a 12-floor building and the head offices of the local community of Sutjeska, a sub-municipal administrative unit, on Narodnih heroja Street. Mitrovi\u0107 suggested two connected and much taller buildings which would make a recognizable symbol of the capital city. A fierce opposition, disagreements and disputes ensued, but Mitrovi\u0107 was persistent in his idea, giving detailed and exhaustive explanations in front of the numerous commissions. He was finally given the green light and the foundations were laid in 1971. The towers were built by the \"Rad\" construction company.\nNevertheless, the project met with distrust and was disputed all the time the construction was on. But the opposition continued in the next years. Even in the 2010s, a famous caricature by Ivo Ku\u0161ani\u0107 in the daily Politika is still being mentioned and reproduced. It shows a gallows next to the building and the text: Who are these gallows for? For the architect!\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe two towers which make the building are not the same height. The higher one is a residential tower with 30 floors, while the lower is a business one with 26 floors. The bridge connects them at the 26th floor. The revolving restaurant built at the top never functioned. The building is 117.76 m (386.4 ft) tall.The building was designed in the brutalist style, with some elements of structuralism and constructivism. It is considered a prime representative of the brutalist architecture in Serbia and one of the best of its style built in the 1960s and the 1970s in the world. The treatment of the form and details is slightly associating the building with postmodernism and is today one of the rare surviving representatives of this style's early period in Serbia. The artistic expression of the gate marked an entire era in Serbian architecture.\n\n\n=== Mural ===\nIn 1979, Lazar Vujaklija painted a mural at the entrance. The mural covers the fa\u00e7ade and the ceiling above the entrance. It was one of the first murals in Belgrade, predated by the 1970 mural painted on a building in the Bulevar Revolucije, also done by Vujaklija. Another work was added in the 2010s, described by the architects as a \"graffiti, which is unsuitable and not a work of art\". After a reaction from the architects, the author of the graffiti decided to paint it over, in an agreement with Mihajlo Mitrovi\u0107's daughter who inherited the author's rights.\n\n\n== Protection ==\nThe building is placed under the preliminary protection. It means it should be treated as if it were protected until the final decision about the protection is made. Association of Serbian Architects in 2019 filed a motion for Western City Gate to become a fully protected cultural monument.\n\n\n== Local community ==\nThe local community of Sutjeska had a population of 5,067 in 1981 and 5,187 in 1991. By the 2002 census, it was renamed to the Local Community of Western Gate, after the building, and had a population of 4,278. It was later annexed to the neighboring local community of Fontana.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nGates of Belgrade\nList of tallest buildings in Serbia\nList of tallest structures in former Yugoslavia\nTrellick Tower and Balfron Tower, blocks of flats in London of similar design\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Genex Tower at Wikimedia Commons",

        "wiki": "New Belgrade (Serbian: \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, romanized: Novi Beograd, lit. 'New White City', pronounced [n\u00f4\u028bi\u02d0 be\u01d2\u0261rad]) is a municipality of the city of Belgrade. It is the central business district in Serbia and one of the major ones in Southeast Europe. It was a planned municipality, built since 1948 in a previously uninhabited area on the left bank of the Sava river, opposite old Belgrade. In recent years, it has become the central business district of Belgrade and its fastest developing area, with many businesses moving to the new part of the city, due to more modern infrastructure and larger available space. With 212,104 inhabitants, it is the second most populous municipality of Serbia after Novi Sad.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nNew Belgrade is located on the left bank of the Sava River, in the easternmost part of the Srem region. Administratively, its northeastern section touches the right bank of the Danube, right before the Sava's confluence. It is generally located west of the 'Old' Belgrade to which it is connected by six bridges (Gazela, Branko's Bridge, Old Railway Bridge, New Railway Bridge and Ada Bridge).  European route E75, with five grade separations, including a new double-looped one at the Belgrade Arena, goes right through the middle of the settlement.\nThe municipality of New Belgrade covers an area of 40.74 square kilometres (15.73 sq mi). Its terrain is flat, which poses a high contrast to the old Belgrade, built on 32 hills total. Except for its western section, Be\u017eanija, New Belgrade is built on a terrain that was essentially a swamp when construction of the new city began in 1948. For years, kilometers-long conveyor belts were transporting sand from the Danube's island of Malo Ratno Ostrvo, almost completely destroying it in the process, and only a small, narrow strip of wooded land remains today. Thus, it is romantically said that New Belgrade is actually built on an island.Other geographic features are the peninsula of Mala Ciganlija and the island of Ada Me\u0111ica, both on the Sava and the bay of Zimovnik (winter shelter), engulfed by Mala Ciganlija, with the facilities of the Beograd shipyard. The loess slope of Be\u017eanijska Kosa is located in the western part of the municipality, while in the southern, the Galovica river canal flows into the Sava.\nThough it originally had no forests in the real sense, of all municipalities of Belgrade, Novi Beograd has the largest green areas, with a total of 3.47 square kilometres (1.34 sq mi), or 8.5% of the territory. In time, several areas developed into the fully fledged forests, and three were officially classified as such: forest along the motorway (106.56 ha (263.3 acres)), forest along the Sava Quay (9.09 ha (22.5 acres)) and forest on Ada Me\u0111ica (13.4 ha (33 acres)). Majority of green areas, however, are made up of the large U\u0161\u0107e park. The latest addition to Belgrade parks, Park Republika Srpska from 2008, is also located in the municipality.\nThere are no separate settlements within the municipality, as the entire area administratively belongs to the Belgrade City proper and is statistically classified as part of Belgrade (Beograd-deo). The area located around the municipal assembly building and the nearby roundabout is considered to be New Belgrade's center.\nAs it was planned and constructed, New Belgrade was divided into blocks. Currently, there are 72 blocks (with several sub-blocks, like 70-a, etc.). Old core of the village of Be\u017eanija, Ada Me\u0111ica, and Mala Ciganlija, as well as the area along the highway west of Be\u017eanijska Kosa are not divided into blocks, while due to the administrative borders changes, some of the blocks (9, 9-a, 9-b, 11, 11-c and 50) belong to the municipality of Zemun, extending north of New Belgrade as one continuous built-up area.\nIn September 2018, Belgrade's mayor Zoran Radoji\u010di\u0107 announced that the construction of a dam on the Danube, in the Zemun-New Belgrade area, will start soon. The dam should protect the city during the high water levels. Such project was never mentioned before, nor it was clear how and where it will be constructed, or if it's feasible at all. Radoji\u010di\u0107 clarified after a while that he was referring to the temporary, mobile flood wall. The wall will be 50 cm (20 in) high and 5 km (3.1 mi) long, stretching from the Branko's Bridge across the Sava and the neighborhood of U\u0161\u0107e, to the Radecki restaurant on the Danube's bank in the Zemun's Gardo\u0161 neighborhood. In case of emergency, the panels will be placed on the existing construction. The construction is scheduled to start in 2019 and to finish in 2020.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nBe\u017eanija is the oldest part of today's New Belgrade, where a settlement existed from the neolithic to the Roman period.\nIn the book Kru\u0161evski pomenik from 1713, which is kept in the Dobrun monastery near Vi\u0161egrad, settlement of Be\u017eanija was mentioned for the first time under its present name as far as 1512, as a small village with 32 houses, populated by Serbs. In this time, the village was under the administration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and was part of the Syrmia County. The inhabitants of the village crossed the Sava river and settled in Syrmia after fleeing the fall of the medieval Serbian Despotate under the hands of the Ottoman Empire (hence the name be\u017eanija, \"refugee camp\" in archaic Serbian).\nIn 1521, the village became part of the Ottoman Empire. From 1527 to 1530, Be\u017eanija was part of Radoslav \u010celnik's Duchy of Syrmia, an Ottoman vassal, until its subsequent organization into the Ottoman Sanjak of Syrmia. The Habsburg Monarchy conquered it temporarily during the Great Turkish War (1689\u20131691), but it remained under Ottoman administration until 1718. In 1718, the village became part of the Habsburg Monarchy and was placed under military administration. It was part of the Habsburg Military Frontier (Petrovaradin regiment of Slavonian Krajina). During the 17th and 18th century, hunger and constant Turkish intrusions devastated the village, but it was constantly being repopulated by the refugees from central Serbia.During the 1717\u20131739 Austrian occupation of northern Serbia, when both banks of the Sava were Austrian, a massive process of construction works in Belgrade began. The goal was to transform Belgrade into the Baroque city, rather than the oriental one. The task of designing the new city was given to Nicolas Doxat de D\u00e9moret. In his plans, Doxat envisioned the proper, star-shaped fortification on the location of modern New Belgrade, across the Belgrade Fortress. Despite the maps printed with the existing fortification, the ramparts in the swamp were never built, though some works on the construction were conducted.In 1810, population census counted 115, mostly Serbian households in Be\u017eanija. By the 1850s, Austrians colonized a large number of Germans in Be\u017eanija. In 1848\u20131849 it was part of the Serbian Vojvodina, an ethnic Serb autonomous region within the Austrian Empire, but in 1849 was again placed under administration of the Military Frontier.\nAs the Frontier was abolished in 1881\u20131882, it became part of the Syrmia County within the autonomous Habsburg kingdom Croatia-Slavonia, which was located within the Hungarian part of the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. In 1910, the largest ethnic group in the village were Serbs, while other sizable ethnic groups were Germans, Hungarians and Croats. After dissolution of Austria-Hungary, in autumn of 1918, Be\u017eanija became part of the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. On 24 November 1918, as part of Syrmia region, the village became part of the Kingdom of Serbia, and on December 1, it became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (future Yugoslavia).\nFrom 1918 to 1922, the village was part of the Syrmia County and from 1922 to 1929 part of the Syrmia Oblast. Be\u017eanija became part of the wider Belgrade area for the first time in 1929 after coup d'\u00e9tat conducted by the king Alexander I of Yugoslavia, who, among other things, draw a new map of Yugoslavia's administrative division creating a new administrative unit Uprava grada Beograda or Administration of the City of Belgrade which comprised Belgrade, Zemun (with Be\u017eanija) and Pan\u010devo.\n\n\n=== Inter-war period ===\nBetween the two world wars of the 20th century, communities sprung up closer to the Sava river in Staro Sajmi\u0161te and Novo Naselje. The idea of building a new settlement across the Sava was officially presented in 1922 and the first urbanization plans for Belgrade's expansion to the Sava's left bank were drawn up in 1923, but a lack of either funds or the manpower needed to drain out the swampy terrain put them on hold indefinitely. The project was conceived by \u0110or\u0111e Kovljanski and it included an idea of creating an island from the Savamala neighborhood (he coined the term \"Sava amphitheatre\") in old Belgrade. He even envisioned the bridge across the northern tip of Ada Ciganlija, across the Sava, which realized in 2012. In 1924 Petar Kokotovi\u0107 opened a kafana on To\u0161in Bunar with the prophetic name Novi Beograd. After 1945 Kokotovi\u0107 was president of the local community of Novo Naselje\u2013Be\u017eanija which later grew into the municipality of Novi Beograd. In 1924 an airport was built in Be\u017eanija and in 1928 the Rogo\u017eerski factory was constructed. In 1934 plans were expanded to include the creation of a new urban tissue which connected Belgrade and Zemun, as Zemun was administratively annexed to the city of Belgrade in 1929, losing separate city status in 1934. A King Alexander Bridge was also built over the Sava River and a tram line connecting Belgrade and Zemun was established. Also, a Zemun airport was built.\nA sandy beach with the cabins, kafanas and barracks, used as sheds by the fishermen, occupied the area of the modern U\u0161\u0107e quay, north of the Branko's Bridge. It was one of the favorite vacation spots of Belgraders during Interbellum. People were transported from the city by small boats and the starting point was a small kafana \"Malo pristani\u0161te\" in Savamala. Occupying the left bank of the Sava, it was on the location of the access ramp for the future King Alexander Bridge so it had to be removed. The objects were demolished manually, including numerous kafanas: \"Ostend\", \"Zdravlje\", \"Abad\u017eija\", \"Jadran\", \"Krf\", \"Dubrovnik\", \"Adrija\", etc. The only one that wasn't demolished was \"Nica\", predecessor of the modern U\u0161\u0107e restaurant. In total, 20 proper objects and 2,000 cabins, barracks, sheds, etc. were demolished, jointly by the municipalities of Zemun and Be\u017eanija, which owned half of the land each, and the proprietors of the objects. The plan was to build an embankment instead. However, the beach itself survived the construction of the bridge in 1934 as it only made access easier. The beach was finally closed in 1938 when the construction of the embankment began. The beach itself was called Nica (Serbian for Nice, in France) after one of the kafanas.A group of Danish investors offered to the city government their project of constructing a new settlement between Belgrade and Zemun, on the left bank of the Sava. In February 1937 they sent a very elaborate proposal with maps to the then mayor of Belgrade, Vlada Ili\u0107. Danes offered to do it for 94 million 1937 dinars and the city administration replied that the project got their fullest attention, but that citizens of Belgrade and Zemun should have a say, too, about this new settlement. In August Danish investors held a meeting with mayor Ili\u0107. This time, they offered to build the entire modern neighborhood for free, but to retain the right to sell the lots to private buyers who are interested into building houses in the neighborhood, in the total amount of over 80 million dinars, while the city would remain the owner of the land. A contract was signed on 24 February 1938. Danish representatives announced that their ships will reach Belgrade by 12 to 15 May 1938. Among them, there was one special ship. It was to dredge the bottom of the Danube in the vicinity of Great War Island and to eject the dredged earthy materials through pipes in the swamp, filling it. It was planned to fill the area on the right side of the Zemun road, which extended across the King Alexander Bridge across the Sava. It was expected that the work, estimated at 30 million dinars, will be finished by 1940 when the area was to become a nice, dried and elevated filled terrain suitable for the start of the construction of the \"newest Belgrade\". The project was described as the \"displacement of the Sava's confluence into the Danube\".On 20 May 1938, president of the Yugoslav government Milan Stojadinovi\u0107, pulled a lever on a Danish excavator, ceremonially starting works on the draining of the land at the confluence. The large \"Sydhavnen\" excavator and was transported by the ship via English Channel, Dardanelles, Bosphorus, Black Sea and Danube. It was reported at the time that this was the first time that an ocean ship was anchored in the port of Belgrade. The draining proved out to be much more expensive than expected. The \"Sydhavnen\" excavator sank to the bottom of the Sava river after the World War II broke out in 1941, but was lifted after the war, repaired and continued to work under the name \"Kolubara\".In 1930s members of Belgrade's affluent elite began to buy land from the villagers of Be\u017eanija, which at that time, administratively spread all the way to the King Alexander Bridge, which was a dividing point between Be\u017eanija and Zemun. From 1933 a settlement, consisting mostly of individual villas, began to develop. Also, a group of White Russian emigrants built several small buildings, mostly rented by the carters who carried goods across the river. As the settlement, which became known as New Belgrade, was built without building permits, authorities threatened to demolish it, but in 1940 government officially \"legalized the informal settlement of New Belgrade\". Prior to that, the city already semi-officially recognized the new settlement, as it helped with building its streets and pathways. By 1939 it already had several thousands inhabitants, a representative in the city hall, and was unofficially called New Belgrade.In 1938, for the purpose of hosting Belgrade Fair, a complex of buildings was erected next to the already existing community. Spread over 15 thousand square metres, it hosted fairs and exhibitions designed to show off the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's developing economy. Also this year, the municipality of Belgrade signed a contract with two Danish construction companies, Kampsax and H\u00f8jgaard & Schultz, to build the new neighbourhood. Engineer Branislav Ne\u0161i\u0107 was entrusted with leading the project. He even continued his involvement on the project after 1941 when the Nazis conquered, occupied, and dissolved the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Because of this, the new communist authorities who came to power after 1945 put Ne\u0161i\u0107 on trial as a collaborator. As the complex never hosted any fairs again and the new Belgrade Fair was built across the river, the area became known as Staro Sajmi\u0161te (\"Old Fairground\").\nOn 22 February 1941, mayor of Belgrade Jovan Tomi\u0107 and architect Dragi\u0161a Bra\u0161ovan held a press conference, announcing plans for the future. The plans were made for New Belgrade and the Sava's bank in \"Old\" Belgrade. The new town was to be built on 6 km2 (2.3 sq mi) and have 500,000 inhabitants, even though the entire Belgrade at that time had a bit over 350,000 people. Tomi\u0107 issued a ban for the private owners to purchase the land, so that all land designated for the future town will remain city owned. He also asked from the state government to banish all private land owners on the Sava's right bank, located between the Belgrade Main railway station and the river and to confiscate the land. Further plans included the filling of the arm of the Danube and turning the Great War Island into the peninsula and erection of the monumental memorial on it. The project also included two new bridges across the Sava, which would connect the old and the new part of the city, one on the location of the modern Gazela bridge (which was built in 1970) and another in the continuation of the Nemanjina Street. Because of the latter bridge, Tomi\u0107 planned to demolish the building of the Belgrade Main railway station and relocate the facility in the neighborhood of Prokop, thus clearing further 1 km2 (0.39 sq mi) of space for the commercial facilities. Construction of the new railway station in Prokop indeed began, but in 1977 and as of 2018 is still not finished, though in 2017 it took over the domestic transportation.\nIn general (excluding Be\u017eanija), on the territory of modern New Belgrade, urbanization between two world wars began on three locations: along the Sava bank, stretching from Sajmi\u0161te to U\u0161\u0107e; workers settlement around Old Airport; informal settlement at To\u0161in Bunar, where modern Studentski Grad is today. Majority of the construction was informal.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nIn 1941, German forces occupied much of Yugoslavia. Nazi secret police, Gestapo, took over the fairgrounds (Sajmi\u0161te). They encircled it with several rings of barbed wire turning it into a \"collection centre\". It eventually became an extermination camp, the Sajmi\u0161te concentration camp. Until May 1942 it was mostly used to kill off Jews from Belgrade and other parts of Serbia, and from April 1942 onwards, it also held political prisoners. Executions of captured prisoners lasted as long as the camp existed. November 1946 report released by the Yugoslav State Commission for Crimes of Occupiers and their Collaborators claims that close to 100,000 prisoners came through the Sajmi\u0161te's gates. It is estimated that around 48,000 people perished inside the camp.\n\n\n=== Rapid development ===\n\nFirst sketches of urbanistic plans were developed by Nikola Dobrovi\u0107 in 1946 and preparations began in 1947. Architect Mihajlo Mitrovi\u0107 called New Belgrade \"an obsessive vision of Dobrovi\u0107\". A monograph on the construction of New Belgrade by Slobodan Ristanovi\u0107 described what the area looked liked before the city was built: \"In the thick reeds and bulrush there were many snakes and frogs, fishes and leeches. Above this swamp, flocks of birds were circling and the swarms of mosquitos and other insects were going up and down. Just few houses and occasional shack in the marsh around the Zemun airport, so as the derelict neighborhood of Staro Sajmi\u0161te attested the human presence in that inhospitable ambience.\"It was on 11 April 1948, three years after World War II ended, that the ground was broken on a huge construction project, which would give birth to what is known today as New Belgrade. During first three years of construction alone, over 200,000 workers and engineers from all over the freshly liberated country took part in the building process. Work brigades, parts of the Youth work actions made up of villagers brought in from rural Serbia provided most of the manual labour. Even high school and university student volunteers took part. It was backbreaking labour that went on day and night. With no notable technological tools to speak of, mixing of concrete and spreading of sand were done by hand with horse carriages only used for extremely heavy lifting. The concept of Youth work actions continued up to 1990 and the objects built this way include the Studentski Grad, Block 7, Block 7a, Paviljoni, Gazela Bridge, Hospital Be\u017eanijska Kosa, SIV, etc.Before the actual construction started, the terrain was evenly covered with sand from the Sava and the Danube rivers in an effort to dry out the land and raise it above the reach of flooding and underground streams. From 1947 to 1950 over 200,000 voluntary workers were employed in the construction of the new city.  The first building which was officially opened was the Workers University, which was opened on 29 November 1949. But the construction of New Belgrade was almost slowed down significantly after 1950 and the ongoing Tito\u2013Stalin split. The full, rapid development continued after 1960.Among the first to go up was the SIV 1 building, which housed the Federal Executive Council (SIV). The building has 75,000 square metres of usable space. Built during the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, it was also used during the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia before its dissolution. The building was renamed to Palace of Serbia, and now houses some departments of the Serbian government.\nFirst buildings for classic residential purposes were built as pavilions close to the area known as To\u0161in Bunar (To\u0161a's Well). Studentski Grad (Student City) complex was also built around the same time to meet the residence needs of the growing University of Belgrade student body that came from other parts of Yugoslavia.\n\nBuildings sprung up one after another and by 1952, New Belgrade was officially a municipality. In 1955 the municipality of Be\u017eanija was annexed to New Belgrade. It was for years the biggest construction site in Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and a huge source of pride for country's communist authorities that oversaw the project.\nOne of the major successes during the construction was the arrangement and planting of the greenery. The main obstacle was the, now sandy, terrain. Still, the planting of the parks began after 1956. In 1961, the Park of Friendship was opened, to commemorate the 1st Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement. Park itself is part of much larger Park U\u0161\u0107e. Also in the 1960s, the arrangement of the promenades along the Sava and the Danube began.In 2010, the first international architectural design competition in almost 30 years was organized for one of the future symbols of Belgrade in Block 39. It was the project of the Center for Promotion of Science. Out of 232 submissions, the work of Wolfgang Tschapeller was selected. The design of an elevated, ethereal building, which was to appear from distance as hovering, was supported by the architects, but not much by the public. Main problem was the price. Initially estimated to cost \u20ac10 million and to be finished by 2014, the projected price skyrocketed to \u20ac65 million and the construction never began. Local architects now called the project a colossal waste of money and in 2015 government scrapped the project all together. In July 2020 it was announced that the massive new police building will be built on the location, which remained undeveloped.Since the 2000s, and especially in the 2010s, the rapid development resumed in the southwest half of the municipality, bounded by the streets To\u0161in Bunar, Vojvo\u0111anska, Milutina Milankovi\u0107a and Sava's left bank. Prior to this. one of the central streets in the neighborhood, Omladinskih Brigada, was urbanized \"here and there\", with buildings humble in both architectural merits or functionality and this section of New Belgrade was considered to be neglected in terms or architecture and urbanism. In one decade, new boulevards were constructed (Heroes of Ko\u0161are Boulevard), while numerous large buildings and objects sprawled along the boulevards, including some entire neighborhoods and residential or business blocks: Airport City Belgrade, Delta City, West 65 (will be 142 m (466 ft) tall), Savada, A Block, Novi Minel, Roda shopping mall, Ekstra shopping mall, hotels, gas stations, many business highrise, etc.By 2020, this urban development was considered mostly positive, as being functional and credited with lifting New Belgrade's business and commercial quality to the highest level in all of Belgrade. Especially commended objects include Airport City, West 65, string of business building along the Omladinskih Brigada street, complex in Block 41-A, Holiday Inn hotel and a bit older headquarters of the municipal Tax Administration. Criticized projects are several buildings, representatives of the \"investors urbanism\", where building was constructed by the wishes of the investors, no matter what (like the building at 11 Milutina Milankovi\u0107a).In general, development of New Belgrade is divided in four major phases, all of which have a landmark buildings constructed in that periods:a) First phase (1948\u20131958)\n\ncompletion of the first residential blocks, 7 and 7a;\nfounding of the first local community \u201cPionor\u201d (now Paviljoni);\ncompletion of the Studentski Grad (1949\u20131955).b) Second phase (1958\u20131968)\n\nFriendship Park and SIV (Palace of Serbia) completed in 1961;\nBuilding of the Municipality of New Belgrade finished (1961\u201364);\nMuseum of Contemporary Art finished in 1965;\nU\u0161\u0107e Tower, completed in 1964\nHotel Jugoslavija Opened 1968c) Third phase (1968\u20132000)\n\nResidential blocks 21, 22, 23, 24, 28, 29, 30, 45 and 70 (first half of the 1970s)\nSava Centar with Hotel Intercontinental (now Crowne Plaza Belgrade) opened in 1977.\nWestern City Gate finished in 1980d) Modern period (from 2000)\n\nBelgrade Arena, finished in 2004\nDelta City, opened in 2007\nBelville Complex, opened in 2009\nSava City Opened in 2009\nAirport City Belgrade\nU\u0161\u0107e Shopping Mall, opened in 2009\nA Block, still in construction\n\n\n== Neighbourhoods ==\n\nJust like other municipalities of Serbia, New Belgrade is further divided into local communities (Serbian: mesna zajednica). Apart from Be\u017eanija and Staro Sajmi\u0161te, no other neighbourhoods have historical or traditional names, as Novi Beograd did not exist as such. However, in the five decades of its existence, some of its parts gradually became known as distinct neighborhoods of their own.\nList of the neighborhoods of New Belgrade:\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe Old Elementary School in Be\u017eanija, at 68 Vojvo\u0111anska Street, was built in 1891. A standard object of its kind, designed by the subdued postulates of the Academism, it was declared a cultural monument in January 2019. It is the oldest preserved building on the territory of the modern municipality of New Belgrade.\n\n\n=== Ikarus building ===\nAs of 2018, one of the oldest surviving buildings in New Belgrade is the former administrative building of the Ikarus company, built in 1938. It is located in the modern Block 9-a, at 3-a Gram\u0161ijeva street. In June 2017 it was announced that the building will be demolished so that private investor can build a highrise instead. Locals organized in an effort to adapt the building into the museum instead. City government, which in 2015 stated that the building will not be demolished, issued a demolition permit in February 2018. Citizen protested, demolished the construction hoarding and physically preventing the investor to destroy the building, so police intervened. Investor then posted a board which showed that the original building will be preserved but vastly expanded and superstructured (total of 8.500 m2 (91.49 sq ft) floor area). Still, a heavy demolition machinery was brought so citizens protested again in March. Inheritors of the pre-World War II owners of the \"Ikarus\" company, which was nationalized after 1945, applied for the restitution.The administrative building of the former airplane factory was a symbol of the industrial development of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia during the Interbellum. Apart from being one of the oldest preserved objects in New Belgrade, it was the only representative of the Art Deco in the municipality. Citizens proposed that the building might be adapted into the Museum of New Belgrade or a branch of the Museum of Aviation. The building was not protected by the law. Still, the building was demolished in July 2018.\n\n\n=== After 1945 ===\n\nArchitects who are most deserving for New Belgrade's development are Uro\u0161 Martinovi\u0107, Milutin Glavi\u010dki, Milosav Miti\u0107, Du\u0161an Milenkovi\u0107 and Leonid Lenar\u010di\u0107. They drafted the city's regulatory plan in 1962 which encompassed all the previous ideas, solutions and propositions.New Belgrade developed on Le Corbusier's principles of the \"sun city\", which includes lots of green areas and infrastructure which can easily be upgraded. In general, city developed in the style of urban modern architecture and is considered to be a major representative of that style, along with Brasilia in Brazil, Chandigarh in India and Velenje in Slovenia.Characteristic for the buildings in New Belgrade is that many of them got nicknames. Best known ones include:\n\"\u0160est kaplara\" (Six corporals), Block 21, as most apartments were settled by the military personnel and their families;\n\"Televizorka\" (TV-screen building), Block 28, due to the look of its windows; on 21 March 2020, a fire broke out on the eight floor, ultimately killing 7 people;\n\"Tri sestre\" (Three sisters), Fontana, three identical buildings;\n\"Potkovica\" (Horseshoe), Block 28, due to its shape;\n\"Pendrek\", \"Sirotica\" and \"Besna kobila\" (Police baton, Poor girl and Mad mare), near Studentski Grad, as the first was populated by the policemen's families, second by the socially endangered and third by the well-to-do members of the Communist party;\n\"Mercedes\", Block 38, three connected buildings in the shape of the car's logo;\n\"Lamela\" or \"Meander\", Block 21; next to \"\u0160est kaplara\", with 972.5 m (3,191 ft) it is the longest residential building in former Yugoslavia. It was built from 1960 to 1966 and officially named \"B-7\";\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nEver since the construction began in 1948, New Belgrade experienced explosive population growth, but this trend stopped during the 1990s and became negative. As of 2014, the municipality of New Belgrade has a population of 214,506 inhabitants.\n\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\n\nThe ethnic composition of the municipality (as of 2011):\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAs all of the socialist governments considered heavy industry to be the driving force of the entire economy, it for decades dominated New Belgrade's economy too: Industry of Machinery and Tractors (IMT), Metallic cast iron factory (FOM), shipyard \"Beograd\" (formerly \"Tito\"), large heating plant in Savski Nasip, \"MINEL\" electro-construction company, etc. All of these complexes will be removed and develop in business and residential areas.\nIn the 1990s with the collapse of gigantic state-owned companies, New Belgrade's local economy bounced back by switching to commercial facilities, with dozens of shopping malls and entire commercial sections such as Mercator Center Belgrade, U\u0161\u0107e Mall, Delta City Belgrade etc. These activities are further enhanced in the 2000s (decade). The 'Open Shopping Mall' or the Belgrade's flea market is also located in New Belgrade.\nNew Belgrade became the main business district in Serbia and one of major in Southeast Europe. Many companies choose New Belgrade for regional centers  such as IKEA, Energoprojekt holding, Delta Holding, MK Group, DHL, Air Serbia, OMV, Siemens, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Telekom Srbija, Telenor Serbia, Unilever, Vip mobile, Yugoimport SDPR, Ericsson, Colliers International, CB Richard Ellis, SNC-Lavalin, Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, Ernst & Young and Arabtec. The Belgrade Stock Exchange is also located in New Belgrade. Other notable structures built not too long afterwards include convention and congress hall Sava Center, Hotel Jugoslavija, Genex condominium, Genex Tower sports and concert venues Hala Sportova and Belgrade Arena, and 4 and 5-star hotels Crowne Plaza Belgrade, Holiday Inn, Hyatt Regency, Tulip Inn etc., with around 1700 rooms,... Many structures are currently under construction like Airport City Belgrade, Elektroprivreda Srbije HQ., West 65 business-residential complex, etc.\nMany IT companies choose New Belgrade as regional center like NCR Corporation, Cisco Systems, SAP AG, Acer, ComTrade Group,\nHewlett-Packard, Huawei, Samsung. One of Microsoft's development centers is also located in New Belgrade.\nCurrently finished projects in New Belgrade are Delta City, Sava City, Univerzitetsko Selo, Ada Bridge, Intesa HQ and U\u0161\u0107e Tower.\nIn 2019. average price of square meter of an apartment in New Belgrade was \u20ac1.650. Average net salary in New Belgrade in December 2019 was $960. It contains also the most expensive areas for buying an apartment in Belgrade as A Blok (2.920 \u20ac) and West 65 (5.000 \u20ac). [3]\n\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of registered people employed in legal entities per their core activity (as of 2018):\n\n\n== Projects under construction in New Belgrade ==\nAirport City Belgrade \u2013 Currently under construction: one 14-storey building with underground garages.

It crosses the Sava River via Gazela Bridge. New Belgrade is served by two more road bridges \u2013 Branko's Bridge and Ada Bridge, and by the road-tram Old Sava Bridge.\nWith services started in 1985, tram transportation plays an important role in New Belgrade transportation, despite it having just two tracks which mostly run along the several kilometers long Jurija Gagarina street. Four tram lines serve the municipality (7, 9, 11 and 13) and there is a tram depot in \u0110or\u0111a Stanojevi\u0107a street.\nSince the 1970s, New Belgrade has been served by two railway lines connecting it to the city center and by one line to Zemun. Virtually the entire length of these lines is on an embankment, with an elevated segment on the approach to the New Railroad Bridge, and a tunnel toward Zemun. Two railway stations exist, the larger being the Novi Beograd which is located above the Antifa\u0161isti\u010dke borbe street and is served by BG Voz and other local and international lines. The other railway station is To\u0161in Bunar which is a 2-track stop located just outside Be\u017eanija tunnel.\nThe international fairway on the Sava runs along the banks of New Belgrade. The only public river transportation is run by two seasonal boat lines from Blok 70 to Ada Ciganlija, and by another one connecting Blok 44 to Ada Me\u0111ica.\nBelgrade's main shipyard is located on New Belgrade's Sava bank. On the Danube, the base of the 2nd River Squadron of Serbian River Flotilla is located next to the confluence of the Sava, which restricts navigation around Little War Island.\nFrom 1927 to 1964 the international Dojno polje Airport was located on the territory of today's New Belgrade.\n\n\n== Politics ==\n\nHistorical Presidents of the Municipal Assembly since 1952:\n1952\u20131953: Stevan Galoga\u017ea\n1953\u20131955: Mile Vukmirovi\u0107\n1955\u20131956: \u017divko Vladisavljevi\u0107\n1956\u20131957: Ilija Radenko\n1957\u20131962: Ljubinko Panteli\u0107\n1962\u20131965: Jova Mari\u0107\n1965\u20131969: Pero Kova\u010devi\u0107 (born 1923)\n1969\u20131979: Novica Blagojevi\u0107 (died 1979)\n1979\u20131982: Milan Komneni\u0107\n1982\u20131986: Andreja Teji\u0107\n1986\u20131989: Toma Markovi\u0107\n1989\u20132000: \u010cedomir \u017ddrnja (born 1936)\n2000\u20132008: \u017deljko O\u017eegovi\u0107 (born 1962)\n2008\u20132012: Nenad Milenkovi\u0107 (born 1972)\n2012\u2013present: Aleksandar \u0160api\u0107 (born 1978)\n\n\n== Culture and education ==\nFor a settlement of such size, New Belgrade has some unusual cultural characteristics, influenced by the Yugoslav communists' ideas how a new and modern city should look like. If it can be understood why there were no churches built, a fact that a city of 250,000 has no theaters and only one museum (out of the residential area) is much less comprehensible, underlying the decades long Belgrader's feel of New Belgrade being nothing more but a big dormitory.\nMuseum of Contemporary Art is located in U\u0161\u0107e which is also projected by the city government as the location of the future Belgrade Opera. The issue became highly controversial in the 2000s (decade) as the general feel of the population, ensemble of the opera and most prominent architects and artists is that it is a very bad location for the opera, while the city government stubbornly insists against the popular wishes.\nFor decades, the only church in the municipality was an old Church of Saint George in Be\u017eanija. Construction of the new church in Be\u017eanijska Kosa, the Church of Saint Basil of Ostrog, began in 1996, while the construction of the Church of Saint Demetrius of Salonica, which is considered the first church in New Belgrade, began in 1998. Both are still not completed.\n\n\n=== Schools ===\n\nEducation fared much better than culture, as there are numerous elementary and high schools, as well as University of Belgrade's residential campus \u2013 Studentski Grad.\nList of schools in New Belgrade:\n\n\n== Night life ==\nNew Belgrade offers rich night life along the banks of Sava and Danube, right up to the point where the two rivers meet. What started mostly as raft-like social clubs for river fishermen in the 1980s expanded into large floats offering food and drink with live turbo folk performances during the 1990s.\nToday, it is unlikely that one would walk a 100-metre (330-foot) stretch along the rivers without encountering a float. Some of them grew into entire entertainment complexes rivaling clubs in Belgrade's downtown core. While most of the floats used to be synonymous with turbo folk in what was essentially a stereotypical kafana setting, a recent trend saw many turned into full-fledged clubs on water with elaborate events involving world-famous DJs spinning live music.\n\n\n== Public image ==\n\nNot much attention was paid to detail and subtlety when New Belgrade was being built during the late 1940s and early 1950s. The objective was clearly to put up as many buildings as fast as possible, in order to accommodate a displaced and growing post-World War II population that was in the middle of a baby boom. This across-the-board brutalist architectural approach led to many apartment buildings and even entire residential blocks looking monumental in an awkward way. Although the problem has been alleviated to certain extent in recent decades by addition of some modern expansion (Hyatt and Intercontinental hotels, luxury Genex condos, U\u0161\u0107e Tower, Belgrade Arena, Delta City, etc.), many still complain about what they see as New Belgrade's \"grayness\" and \"drabness\". They often use the derisive term \"spavaonica\" (\"dormitory\") to underscore their view of New Belgrade as a place that does not inspire creative living nor encourage healthy human interaction, and is only good for overnight sleep at the end of the hard day's work.  This opinion has found its way into Serbian pop culture as well.\nIn an early 1980s track called 'Ne\u0107u da \u017eivim u Bloku 65', popular Serbian band Riblja \u010dorba sings about a depressed individual who hates the world because he's surrounded by the concrete of New Belgrade, while a more recent local cinematic trend sees New Belgrade presented somewhat clumsily as the Serbian version of New York ghettos like those found in Harlem, Brooklyn and The Bronx. The most obvious example of the latter would be 2002 movie 1 na 1, which portrays a bunch of Serbian teenagers who rap, shoot guns, play street basketball and seem to blame many of their woes on living in New Belgrade. Other films like Apsolutnih 100 and The Wounds also implicitly paint New Belgrade in the negative light but they have a more coherent point of view and place their stories within the context of the 1990s when war and international isolation truly did push some Serbs, including those inhabiting New Belgrade, to desperate acts.\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\nNew Belgrade is twinned with the following cities and municipalities:\n Belfort, France\n Karpo\u0161, North Macedonia\n Xanthi, Greece\n Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nAleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107, politician\nZoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107, politician\nNemanja Bjelica, basketballer\nAleksandar \u0160api\u0107, politician, former waterpoloist\nBranka Kati\u0107, actress\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Belgrade neighbourhoods and suburbs\nList of cities in Serbia\nSubdivisions of Belgrade\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nMala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1986), Vol.I; Prosveta; ISBN 86-07-00001-2\nJovan \u0110.

        "wiki": "Stari dvor (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440, \"Old Palace\") was the royal residence of the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty. Today it houses the City Assembly of Belgrade. The palace is located on the corner of Kralja Milana and Dragoslava Jovanovi\u0107a streets in Belgrade, Serbia, opposite Novi dvor (New Palace).\n\n\n== Great military hospital ==\nDuring the Austrian occupation of northern Serbia 1717-39, several hospitals were established in Belgrade, including the Great military hospital. Based on the Austrian plans, the hospital was set outside of the Belgrade Fortress (\"Danubian\" or \"German Belgrade\"), in the Serbian part of the city. As shown on the map of Belgrade by Nicolas Fran\u00e7ois de Spar, the Tsarigrad Road began at the W\u00fcrttemberg Gate (Stambol Gate), at the modern Republic Square, and headed towards \"Marko's cemetery\" in Ta\u0161majdan. The hospital was situated on the road's right side, where the modern Stari Dvor is located. Behind the hospital there was a large garden and further behind it, across the road was the military cemetery. Later \"Marko's market\" developed on the spot and today it is the area surrounding the House of the National Assembly of Serbia. Based on the drawings by de Spar, the hospital was quite big. The building was large, with rectangular base with the risalit type additions on the corners of the southern fa\u00e7ade and large yard with three smaller buildings. It had one floor with numerous rooms. It is not mentioned in the 1728 Census so some historians believed that it was built after that year, but the census counted only the buildings within the fortress. After Austria lost the Austro-Turkish War of 1737\u20131739, the northern Serbia, including Belgrade, was returned to the Turks. One of the provisions of the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade stated that Austria had to demolish all the fortifications and military and civilian buildings it has constructed during the occupation. Many Baroque buildings were demolished. However, Austria didn't demolish the buildings outside of the fortress walls, including the Great military hospital, which, albeit as a ruin, survived until the next Austrian occupation in 1788.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Development of the compound ===\n\nStojan Simi\u0107, a politician and a businessman, member of the influential Simi\u0107 family, notable in the 19th century Serbia both in politics and culture, purchased the lot in the late 1830s. It was a piece of marshland which encompassed the modern features of Old Palace, Pioneers Park and Park Aleksandrov. Simi\u0107 drained the marsh, filled and leveled the terrain and on the northern side of the modern Kralja Milana street constructed a house 1840-1842. The edifice became known as the Old Konak. Development of the first Serbian royal compound began in 1843, when the ruling prince Alexander Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 purchased the konak with the surrounding garden.In the 1850s, additional building was constructed next to Old Konak, to the north, and colloquially called Mali dvor or Mali konak (\"Little Palace\" or \"Little Konak\"). When the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty was restored in 1858, they moved in the residences. As an heir apparent, Prince Michael used the Little Palace. The palaces were surrounded by the auxiliary buildings, servants' quarters, horse stables, etc. Ruling prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107, Michael's father, decided in 1858 to build a new palace for his son, which was built next to the palace's garden, to the south on the location of modern Novi Dvor, which became known as the Dvor sa kulama (\"Palace with towers\"). Upon ascending to the throne in 1860, Michael decided to use the Old Konak, while part of the state administration was located in the Palace with towers (ministries of foreign and internal affairs).Instigated by King Milan, the palace itself was built between 1882 and 1884, according to the design of Aleksandar Bugarski, in the style of academism of the 19th century, with intention to surpass all existing residences of the Serbian rulers. In order to build the new palace, the Little Palace had to be demolished first. Jointly with the new palace, the Marshall's building (Mar\u0161alat) was built behind it. The building was upgraded in 1922, being adapted into the large, semicircular building. The Old Konak, in which the Aleksandar and his wife, Queen Draga were assassinated during the 1903 May Coup, was demolished in 1904.English author Herbert Vivien, who visited the palace by the end of the 19th century, described in detail its interior: \"At the left side, there is a fine ball room, with walls of lemon-yellow colour, with huge white lusters of Venetian glass, glistening nicely during the state festivities, lit by electric light. After passing the large reception hall, you enter the banquet hall. Everything is glistening in that hall: starting from the floor up to the carved mahogany table. Some sixty guests may be seated around that table. Leather-upholstered chairs are of the colour of autumn leaves. What is most impressive, is the good taste characterizing all objects, both those for use and the adornments. The admiration is even more caused by the beautiful carved ceilings, inherited from the Turkish era and fashion.\"\nA number of important events from the time of the political power of the Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty are linked to the Old Palace: the Palace was built when Serbia was proclaimed a Kingdom; in that same building, King Milan abdicated in favor of his son, Aleksandar, on 22 February 1889. Between 1903 and 1914, the Old Palace was the residence of the Karadjordjevi\u0107 dynasty.\n\n\n=== World Wars and Interbellum ===\n\nThe Palace was damaged in both World Wars. After World War I the Palace was repaired, while the first important restoration was done around 1930. The complex, and the royal garden, were entered through monumental, decorative stone arches with gates.In 1919 and 1920, meetings of the Provisional National Assembly took place there. Royal festivities and receptions of foreign guests took place there until 1941. It remained the royal residence until 1922 (King Peter, 1903\u201321, King Alexander, 1921\u201322), until the neighboring Novi Dvor became royal palace in 1922. In order to construct the Novi Dvor, the Palace with the towers had to be demolished.In 1922 the Mar\u0161alat was adapted on the design of architect Momir Korunovi\u0107. The original edifice was modest and ground-level, which hosted the royal guard. Korunovi\u0107's design of the eastern fa\u00e7ade was mostly plain, but the western, facing the court, was richly decorated with ornaments. The Mar\u0161alat, including the Ministry of the Court and royal administration, occupied the central part of the building, while the wings had apartments for royal guests, which partially hastened the construction as it needed to host the guests of the royal wedding between King Alexander and Princess Maria.During World War II, the palace was bombed and partially demolished on the very first day of the German attack, during the bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941. German soldiers were often taking photos in front of the ruined building. First groups of arrested Jews were sent by the Germans to clear the rubble. Soon, the reconstruction of the building began but wasn't finished until October 1944 when the city was liberated as the dome remained demolished.\n\n\n=== After World War II ===\nThe repair and re-arrangement of the Old Palace after World War II lasted until 1947. During that period, the architecture of the building was significantly changed. The two domes facing the garden and the sculptures of eagles were removed, while the fa\u00e7ade facing the present Bulevar kralja Aleksandra was completely changed. Since that time, the building housed the Presidium of the National Assembly, then the federal government, and, since 1961, the City Assembly of Belgrade. The auxiliary buildings were demolished after 1945.After the war, the Mar\u0161alat was adapted into the Ethnographic Museum. In 1952 the museum was relocated to the former Belgrade Stock Exchange building at Studentski Trg, where it is still today. The building of the Mar\u0161alat was demolished in 1957. It is not known why, as it ranked among the most beautiful buildings in Belgrade. There are few stories, considered urban myths today. One is that it was demolished by the Communist authorities on ideological reasons, but there are building which were much more dynastic and royal, but survived. The other is that it bothered one of the top Communist officials and Tito's closest aide, Mo\u0161a Pijade. In 1953-1954 he worked in the Old Palace, as deputy president of the Federal Executive Council (\"vice-president of the government\"), while from 1954 to 1957 he was president of the National Assembly, so the Mar\u0161alat obstructed the view from both buildings. The building was demolished mostl likely as the expansion of the Pioneer's Park, former Royal Garden, began, and the massive gates into the park were already demolished.\n\n\n=== Today ===\nFormer complex today consists of only two buildings, Old Palace and New Palace. Today, the palace is home to the City Assembly of Belgrade. Visitors can take a tour inside the Old Palace. Tourists can sign up to visit the Old Palace at the tourist stands throughout Belgrade.\n\n\n== Architectural design ==\n\nThe Old Palace has almost square foundation of 40x40 m. Its design is classical, with central windowed inner hall. There used to be a greenhouse and richly ornamented oaken stairs added later, and leading onto the first floor (they were designed by a famous architect Jovan Ilki\u0107). Those stairs were destroyed in World War I. Around this central space with columns and galleries there were other rooms of the Palace, the most important of them being the great hall for receptions and balls and the dining room. As parts of the Palace there were also a nicely arranged library and the Palace chapel, which faced the garden. The whole interior equipment of the Palace has been mostly imported from Vienna.\nBy its external architecture the building is one of the most beautiful achievements of academism in Serbia of the 19th century. The facade which faces the garden is most richly made, having projecting balconies which provided closer contact with the garden. The most characteristic motifs of this facade are the caryatids at the first-floor level which, above the balconies at each end of the facade support richly made tympanums of the ending windows. The caryatid are repeated on the facade facing the Kralja Milana street, and the line of Doric columns in beneath them. The Doric columns also appear on the facade against the garden, between richly decorated windows. The other two facades are somewhat simpler. The basement and the corners of the building are rustically designed. The balconies and the attic are balustraded. The three corners of the building used to have proportional domes.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStari dvor \u2013 City of Belgrade website (in Serbian)",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Top\u010dider (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0422\u043e\u043f\u0447\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0440; Serbo-Croatian pronunciation: [t\u0254\u031d\u030cpt\u0361\u0283ide\u031er]) is a forest park and an urban neighborhood of Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is divided between the municipalities of \u010cukarica, Rakovica and Savski Venac. Being close to downtown, it is one of the major locations for relaxation, picnics and fresh air for the citizens of Belgrade.\nAs a result of the 1923 Belgrade's general plan, where one of the main projects regarding the green areas was forestation of the area between Top\u010dider and the city, a continuous green area Senjak-Top\u010didersko Brdo-Hajd Park-Top\u010dider-Ko\u0161utnjak was formed by the 1930s. This continuous forested area makes the largest \"green massif\" in the immediate vicinity of Belgrade's urban tissue.Nobelist author Ivo Andri\u0107 wrote: \"You just hang on to Top\u010dider and Ko\u0161utnjak...Top\u010dider is my favorite place, where I ate bread and drank wine in the sweetest and calmest manner\".\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nGeographically, Top\u010dider covers a much larger area than what people generally refer to as Top\u010dider today. The eastern slopes of Top\u010didersko Brdo (\"Top\u010dider Hill\") begin already at the Mostarska Petlja and the highway. The neighborhood of Senjak is located on the western, and Dedinje on the right side. This is where the street of  Top\u010diderski Venac and the roundabout of Top\u010diderska zvezda (\"Top\u010dider star\") are located. The southern slopes of the hill extends into the valley of the Top\u010diderska reka, a tributary to the Sava river, which has been channeled in this section. This is the area identified with the term Top\u010dider. Top\u010dider Park begins five kilometers south of downtown Belgrade and extends west, east and south into the old Top\u010dider woods which itself extend west into the park-wood of Ko\u0161utnjak. \nIn the upper parts, Ko\u0161utnjak and Top\u010dider forests grow together, while in the lower parts they are divided by the Top\u010diderska reka and a railway passing through the river valley (both Ko\u0161utnjak and Top\u010dider have their own, separate train stations). In the extreme north-west Top\u010dider extends into the neighborhood of Careva \u0106uprija and in the south-east into Lisi\u010dji Potok. It also borders the neighborhood of Kanarevo Brdo in this section.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-19th century ===\nTop\u010dider is mentioned for the first time in the 17th century travelogue of the Ottoman explorer and traveler Evliya \u00c7elebi. In Ottoman records, the village of Muminovac was also mentioned in the Top\u010dider valley.During Ottoman times, the valley of Top\u010diderska reka and the Top\u010dider wood were locations where the Turkish artillery was positioned, intended to defend Belgrade, being distant from the town itself at the time (thus many military barracks to defend the city from later periods, but the town later sprawled tens of kilometers further). This is how the area got its name as in Turkish it means \"artillery men's valley\" (top, cannon; top\u00e7u, artillery man; dere, valley), though it is usually erroneously thought to mean simply the cannon valley.\n\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\nPrince Milo\u0161 specifically chose this location. After Serbia gained autonomy, the Ottomans withdrew to the walled cities. As the range of the cannons from the Belgrade Fortress couldn't reach across the Top\u010diderska reka, the prince selected this area for his future royal compound. The history of the park itself begins in 1830 when the Prince of Serbia Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 started building his personal quarters in the swampy terrain of the Top\u010dider, today one of the major attractions in Belgrade, the famous Milo\u0161ev konak. A stone Top\u010dider church, dedicated to the apostles Peter and Paul, church inn and military complex were also constructed in the 1832-1834 period, so as the various barracks, magazines, ice rooms, meyhane and a guard tower on top of the Top\u010didersko Brdo. There was a wooden pavilion, which served as part of the Russian military hospital during the 1876 Serbian-Ottoman War. Hundreds of workers were employed. At one point, 144 tajfe, or bands of construction workers, were employed. Prince Milo\u0161 paid them heftily, gave them certain privileges, but they had no working hours, and had to work until the job is done.Planting of the surrounding park began at the same time and marked the beginning of the planned green areas in Belgrade as the ensuing park was the first park area in the city. The park was patterned after the English parks. The supervisor of the park's construction was Atanasije Nikoli\u0107, engineer, urbanist and professor at the Belgrade Lyceum, who also arranged the nursery garden, Ko\u0161utnjak Park and avenues along city's main streets and squares (Terazije, Kneza Milo\u0161a Street, modern Bulevar Kneza Aleksandra Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107a), with the seedlings which originated from the Top\u010doder nursery.In 1839, Belgrade merchant Joca \u0110. Jovanovi\u0107 applied for permit to build the first brewery in town. He wanted to build it in Top\u010dider, but the permit was denied. The importance which Top\u010dider gained for the city population can be seen from the fact that in 1884 it got its own railway station even though it was a small settlement at the time and also one of the very first tram lines in Belgrade used to connect Terazije and Top\u010dider, through the Kneza Milo\u0161a street. Starting in downtown, at Prince Mihailo Monument, the tram was allocated the number 3, which it still bears today, though its route is today extended to the neighborhood of Kne\u017eevac.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nThe 1923 Belgrade's general plan envisioned forestation of Top\u010didersko Brdo and Senjak, formation of the new park and establishment of the continuous green area with the Top\u010dider. Project started in 1926 while the Hyde Park was finished in the 1930s. International tender which was supposed to reconstruct Top\u010dider by the standards of the then modern urbanism was halted by World War II.When Serbia began using paper money, the banknotes were printed in France until 1929, when the Banknotes printing office was built in Top\u010dider, close to the railway station. However, the coins were minted on another location, in the privately owned company \"The brothers Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 mint\" in the nearby street, today named Bulevar vojvode Mi\u0161i\u0107a. In the mid-1930s a big affair broke out, concerning the counterfeiting of the coins of 50 dinars, so the Banknotes printing office also took over that job. It was always colloquially called the \"Mint\".After the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 royal family moved in the new Royal Compound in Dedinje in the 1930s, a modern military barracks were built in Top\u010dider, as a headquarters of the royal guard. Additional military objects were also built, including the military farm. Park was partially adapted, with gazebos, bridges, etc. Railway station became the \"royal station\", while after World War II it became the home station of the Josip Broz Tito's famed Blue Train.After 1945 city urbanists considered that the way the Top\u010dider-Ko\u0161utnjak complex had been handled was wrong, especially the expansion of the railway station into the marshalling yard and the construction of Filmski Grad, so Belgrade's General Urbanistic Plan (GUP) in the 1950s projected the complete removal of the railway objects from the Top\u010dider valley, but this was never implemented. In the summer of 1948 a swimming pool was built in the military complex of the Guard. Though within the army complex, it was a public swimming pool, one of only few such venues in Belgrade at the time.\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn the early 2016, a gradual moving of trains from the Belgrade Main railway station to the new Belgrade Centre railway station, colloquially called Prokop station began. In December 2017, all but two national trains were dislocated to \"Belgrade Center\". However, problems arose immediately. The Prokop is still not finished, has no station building nor proper access roads and public transportation connections with the rest of the city. Additionally, it has no facilities for loading and unloading cars from the auto trains nor was ever planned to have one. Still, in January 2018 it was announced that the station will be completely closed for traffic on 1 July 2018, even though none of the projects needed for a complete removal of the railway traffic are finished. The Prokop is incomplete, a projected main freight station in Zemun is not being adapted at all while there is even no project on a Belgrade railway beltway so a series of temporary solutions will have to be applied. One is a defunct and deteriorated Top\u010dider station, which will be revitalized and adapted for auto trains until the goods station Zemun is finished. Top\u010dider station has one major flaw, a bad public transportation connection (only one tram line, No. 3), so the state railway company asked officially for this problem to be solved. A deadline for the Zemun station is 2 years, but the work is not scheduled to begin until the end of 2018. As of July 2019 no construction began.\n\n\n== Administration ==\nBy 1883, Top\u010dider had a population of 767, and though part of Belgrade, it wasn't organized as a quarter of the city, like the central urban area. According to the censuses, the population was 1,675 in 1890, 2,815 in 1895, 2,818 in 1900, 3,534 in 1905 and 3,510 in 1910.After the liberation in World War I in 1918, Top\u010dider came under Belgrade's administrative rule. It was organized as a Top\u010dider-Senjak section of Belgrade, which had a population of 8,476 in 1921.In the second half of the 20th century, the part which was within the Savski Venac municipality was organized as a local community (mesna zajednica), a sub-municipal administrative unit. It was named Top\u010didersko Brdo and had a population of 5,333 in 1981. It was then merged with Senjak again in the Top\u010didersko Brdo-Senjak local community which had a population of 7,757 in 1991, 7,249 in 2002 and 6,344 in 2011.\n\n\n== Wildlife ==\n\n\n=== Plants ===\nTree planting began immediately after the konak construction in the 1830s. In the 19th century it was the first nursery garden in Serbia,. Most abundant species are platanus, black pine, spruce and field maple. The Top\u010dider London Planes (Platanus \u00d7 acerifolia) are today among the oldest ones in Europe. The biggest and oldest specimen was 34 m (112 ft) high in 2008, with the diameter of the deck being 55 m (180 ft), while the shade of its crown covers an area of 1,400 m2 (15,000 sq ft). Some sources claim it was planted in 1834 when prince Milo\u0161 ordered for a seedling to be planted in the lime kiln in front of the konak. Other, more reliable sources say the tree was planted in 1868, when 250 seedlings of Platanus were bought in Vienna, Austro-Hungary, for which a receipt still exist today. In 2015 it measured 37 m (121 ft) in height and was estimated to be 160 years old, while the crown has grown to 1,885 m2 (20,290 sq ft) and is now supported by the 17 metal piles. The tree is declared a natural monument.Even older is the almost 180-year-old pear tree, nicknamed Kru\u0161ka top\u010diderka (\"Pear of Top\u010dider\")  According to popular legend, it was planted by prince Milo\u0161 a few years after the konak was finished. He wanted to redeem himself to his wife princess Ljubica because of his frequent infidelities and in front of the pear seedling swore his loyalty to her. It still bears fruits, so attempts are being made to produce its seedling in the greenhouse. The pear is surrounded by five pedunculate oaks, all of which are over 100 years old.\nSpecial feature in the park is the group of 8 swamp cypresses.In 2015, most of the trees in Top\u010dider were 20 to 70 years old, but a significant number of trees was over 100 years old or from the 19th century.\n\n\n=== Animals ===\nTop\u010dider is home to 26 species of dragonflies, 48 species of orthoptera and 153 species of beetles. Birds include collared dove, white wagtail, common blackbird, typical warbler, grey heron and great spotted woodpecker. Mammals present in the park, among others, are squirrels, moles, hedgehogs, voles and bats.\n\n\n== Monuments and other features ==\n\nTop\u010dider was the first public park outside the central city area. Today, the total area of Top\u010dider is 35 ha (86 acres), out of which 12.8 ha (32 acres) is covered by the park. The entire Ko\u0161utnjak-Top\u010dider forest complex covers an area of 3.46 km2 (1.34 sq mi).  Many other monuments are centered on the konak: the binjekta\u0161 stone (\"hopping stone\") which prince Milo\u0161 used to jump on a horse, the Museum of the First Serbian Uprising (in the konak itself), three public drinking fountains with an additional fourth one with lion's heads which was temporarily moved to Top\u010dider in 1911, but restored in 1976 and returned to its original location in Terazije, and the stone obelisk erected in 1859, one of the first public monuments in Belgrade. A bronze monument to the Swiss doctor and philanthropist Archibald Reiss (by Marko Bre\u017eanin) was erected in 1931.\nThe northern section of Top\u010dider is the location of the Top\u010dider cemetery (with the Orthodox church of Saint Trifun) and the Banknotes printing office (Zavod za izradu nov\u010danica), that is, the mint of the National Bank of Serbia. In the western section, bordering with Dedinje is Beli Dvor, a court of the Serbian former royal dynasty Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and the present residence of the pretender Aleksandar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 and his family.\nNorthwest section of the Top\u010dider is declared a geological natural monument of \"Senonian ridge of Ma\u0161in Majdan\". The location is an archaeological excavation site as the fossils of the Mesozoic fish have been found in the sediment layers from the Late Cretaceous. It was named Ma\u0161in majdan (\"Ma\u0161a's quarry\"), after a quarry owned by Mrs. Ma\u0161a Dimi\u0107 who lived in the house above the quarry. It was operational until the 1920s and the stone from the quarry was used for the villas on Top\u010dider and Dedinje, but also for the construction of the nearby railroad. On the location of the former quarry, the Top\u010dider summer stage was built in 1947. It had 1,800 seats and an excellent acoustics, being embedded into the limestone rocks. A project of Rajko Tati\u0107, despite occasional public actions for its restoration (1999, 2009), by the 2010s the facility was abandoned and deteriorated.\n\n\n== Protection ==\nThe Great Platanus, in front of the konak, was protected as the natural monument in 2001. As the city government declared the entire Top\u010dider Park a natural monument on 23 June 2015, specific protection for the Platanus ceased. In the area of the residential Obrenovi\u0107 dynasty complex, there are six objects which are protected as the cultural monuments: Residence of Prince Milo\u0161, Top\u010dider Church, Church Inn, Obelisk, monument to Archibald Reiss and the \"Woman harvester\" monument.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\n\n\n=== Top\u010dider Tunnel ===\nThere are threats of destroying certain parts of the park because the government is planning to build a tunnel in this area which will connect Autokomanda with this part of the city and hopefully solve many car traffic problems in Belgrade. Some environmental groups protested against this project, but the constructing of this tunnel still hasn't progressed further than the idea stage. During the summer of 2007, a general planning idea will be chosen by a tender held by the city government, and it remains to be seen if this plan will contain a solution for park preservation. Ada Bridge, which is part of the same project (Inner ring road) was built and opened on 1 January 2012, but the construction of the tunnel under Senjak, which should free Top\u010dider from heavy traffic, was postponed due to the heavy costs.\nIn the early 2018, city administration announced that the detailed regulatory plan and the conceptual design are finished, while the invitation to tender for the project was set for later in 2018.The tunnel would start at the large Radni\u010dka interchange, at the beginning of the bridge. That way, it would practically make an extension of the Po\u017ee\u0161ka Street, the main street and commercial area of the neighborhoods of \u010cukarica and Banovo Brdo. The tunnel would then exit at Partizan Stadium, on the other side of Top\u010didersko Brdo, above the Autokomanda. The tunnel will allow for the drivers to circumvent the downtown and to allow faster transit. It is planned as part of Belgrade's Inner magistral semi-ring.\n\n\n=== Lisi\u010dji Potok ===\nThe easternmost section of Top\u010dider is a heavily wooded area, so the expansion of the neighborhood of Lisi\u010dji Potok was limited. In the early 2000s, due to the political changes which caused a vacuum in all levels of government, private entrepreneurs without gaining regular permits cut down over 1,000 trees in the Top\u010dider woods  for the purpose of constructing vast apartment complexes.\n\n\n=== Top\u010dider incident ===\n\nThe vast secret military complex of \"Kara\u0161\" (in Teodora Drajzera street) was built and dug into the hill from 1965 to 1980, with numerous barracks and kilometers of underground passages.\nIn October 2004, two young guards, Dragan Jakovljevi\u0107 and Dra\u017een Milovanovi\u0107, were found shot dead under highly mysterious circumstances. The first official army report stated that the two guards got into a fight; one got shot, and the other one committed suicide. The investigation was so obviously sloppy (videos were made public of investigators walking all over the non-secured crime scene, not using any precaution measures or security protocols, etc.) to the point of absurdity, including the notorious statement of then military prosecutor Vuk Tufegd\u017ei\u0107 who stated that no DNA tests were done because DNA is an \"overrated thing\" and that \"people watch TV too much\". Because of the serious rumours and intense public pressure, a more thorough investigation was initiated, this time headed by Bo\u017eo Prelevi\u0107, former interior minister of Serbia. His commission concluded that the two soldiers were shot by a third party but the exact situation has never been clarified, except that the commission reject almost all findings of the first, internal military investigation. Not having any solid evidence or conclusions, it is widely suggested by the press that the two guards were the witnesses of either a high-profile indictee (as it was suggested at the time, Ratko Mladi\u0107) of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, who was supposedly hiding in the undergrounds of the Top\u010dider complex, or some criminal activities, like smuggling.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBelgrade\nSpatial Cultural-Historical Units of Great Importance\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nMala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; ISBN 86-07-00001-2\nJovan \u0110.

          "Victim of its success, this small museum is full of content which will stimulate your brain with maths, more precisely geometry. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not boring, you\u2019ll not even notice it. It is very fun for kids, from the age of 3 \u2026",
          "It's okay to spend a bit of time , just a small place with some interesting things inside however it has great potential  only need some more work and ideas to be more attractive to visit it. It just craves for more. When improved I can give it more stars.",
          "Suggest going with family or friends. Going alone is no fun. I'd say it's overpriced for such a small museum . 600 Serbian dinars for adults. The staff is nice and helpful and the idea is great. Expand in the future .",
          "To me it was a nice experience to try if you want to do something extra. \nThe place was small with two floors and a couple of illusion rooms. On the walls you find different photos of the most known or seen illusions. But some of the \u2026",

          "Had a great experience at the museum! I loved the fact that it is so interactive and every step I took made me want to explore it even more! I would highly recommend it!",
          "Ok fun for the kids. Not bad, but it's not a huge thrill either. There are big crowds, and even though the staff at the museum are all correlated, they try not to let many people in at once, it leads to a big queue in front of the museum. Overall, a good 3.",
          "Good museum to visit with family. I expected more things to do or learn. Maybe little short for my taste.",
          "Great fun. If you are disappointed in yourself, you can disappoint yourself an infinite amount of times in the infinite mirror room.",
          "Fantastic experience. People who work there are nice and polite. Wonderful and very interesting for the kids.",
          "Great place for kids, not for adults, puzzles are easily solved and majority of things you already know. For all people that say its overpriced, remember Italy, France, and 20e ticket to stand on Romeo and Julieta balcony! Its a far price people.",
          "Not for \u201cpeople\u201d above 5 years old. Nothing special. Staff was really friendly.",
          "Very nice and well kept museum. The attractions are carefully designed and after your experience with them - well explained. And not only by corresponding texts near by, but also by the friendly staff. Having experience from a similar museum in Barcelona I would say that Belgrade one is at least not worse. Good place to visit!",
          "Fantastic place to visit in Belgrade. Its not so big, but there are a lot of attractions. For small kids it will be outstanding experience, and also for the adults. Everybody will find something for themselves. The best thing are the spots from where you can take photo to have illusion effective.",
          "Interesting but small exibition. Tickets are about 5 euros. Quite pricey for the content inside. You can buy interesting souvenirs.",
          "Nice place in Belgrade center.\nInteresting for brain.",
          "Very interesting place, with very cool staff.",
          "Great fun even with young kids. It is a bit small so they control the number of people inside.",
          "Interesting museum with lots of visual illusion and spots for interesting personal pictures",
          "It's so much fun inside there! If you're going alone and you want to take some photos people working there wil help you, they are so nice. Also before going out you can try to solve some puzzles - but be careful because it eats a lot of time :)",
          "Interesting enough... I would like more exhibits but still it worths a visit. Gift shop needs improvement...",
          "The place was fun, but it should be bigger",
          "Perfect experience with my 8 year old daughter",
          "Interesting museum. Mostly optical illusions are on display, majority of which is well known. Kids being a target audience makes the selection quite fine. Staff is very helpfull and eager to explain things. The only downside is the entrance fee, which I find a bit pricey. Newer the less, my son had a great time and was very happy.",
          "Way better than I expected! Kind and patient staff (I was there with 4 kids - age ranging from 3 to 9) and mind twisting exhibits. We had an awesome time!",

          "great fun for kids and young adults,  enough material for several snaps and instagrams or to keep children busy for about 1 hour. I have expected better gift shop",
          "Great place to have fun! \ud83e\udd73\nFor younger generations and families!",
          "Nice place to have some fin and spend time. Mostly the same as the other illusion museums around the globe but the giant room and the vortex bridge are especially fun. Little children will love here!",
          "Great place to spend some time on a rainy day, interesting for children. Worth visiting. It could have been bigger.",
          "Not so bad not so great. It seems like too small with offerings for the city of Belgrade but all in all it's always worth of visit if you've never been in such museum.",
          "Fun place to spend an hour but would have liked to see more stations with interpersonal attractions",
          "Nice place. But awfully crowded with children in the weekend.",
          "Interesting museum. It will challenge your perception and entertain at the same time. However there is not lot of content and it doesn't take more than one hour for a tour. It can be crowded on weekends, which makes a visit quite unpleasant.",
          "Nice setup! Liked it.",
          "Cool place to bring your kids",
          "It was a cool experience. Essentially full of optical illusions and puzzles. There were also a lot of photo opportunities. My only complaint would be that it wasn't exactly mind blowing. I think this would be better if it was targetted towards children.",
          "Great place, fun, friendly stuff.",
          "Fun place! Takes about an hour to see everything.",
          "Actually, it was nothing special. Ticket price is way big. Just nothing special.",
          "So much fun for kids and adults! Warmly recommended!",
          "The interior is very intriguing and almost everything is interactive. Has two floors and interesting tunel which makes you feel dizzy like you are on some drugs \ud83d\ude01 Also, very interesting pics you can make here! Plenty of mirrors!",
          "Very interested museum which you need to visit! Good thing also is that you can buy different logic games",
          "Funy and joyfull experience",
          "A little small, but really worth the visit.",
          "It's a fun place, but too small for such a big city.",
          "Nice place, if you play the mini games you can stay there for more than an hour",
          "Great place to visit no matter how old you are",
          "Top scientific place.. Youse youre senses and intelligence..",

          "Perfect! It's suitable for kids and adults! I had a great time.",
          "Pretty cool, but kind of pricey. Mainly for kids, quickest 600rsd I spent in Serbia.",
          "Overall great museum, but there are only 2 small floors, which gives you about 30 - 45 minutes of entertainment if you take your time to see every illusion. The museum encourages photography with marked spots on the floor for where to stand \u2026",
          "Very good Museum. You can enjoy with different attractions. Definitely a must visit..",

          "It was na nice expirience",
          "most of the items are already seen on the internet. Interesting for the kids but the price is too high for what the museum offers. Elementary kids at  best. not for adults. Price too high. double the national museum which offers far more. bottom line too pricey for the offer",
          "Very interesting for kids and all those young in spirit. Take your time to solve the puzzles.",
          "A small and quite \"old school\" museum, but very very nice and especially for children between 5 to 12. Most of the illusions are optic (mirrors etc.), with short and bright explanations. very recommended.",

          "I really liked it. When you enter, there is a sign that says 'Don't grow up, it's a trap!'. Being here makes you feel, think, and laugh like a kid. Nice museum.",
          "Very nice staff, but the museum itself is way overpriced. The National museum of serbia is two times, two times! Cheaper.",
          "Fun and exciting",

          "Very nice museum for whole family.",
          "If you are fond of NatGeo Brain games than most of the the things inside the museum won't really surprise you. Still it's worth of visit because it will remind you of the fact that your own brain can easily trick you. Bit creepy, isn't it?! \u2026",

Located on the rim of the Old Core of Zemun, it is considered today as one of the symbols of Zemun and one of the most beautiful parks in Belgrade.\n\n\n== Location ==\nThe park is located in the Zemun's neighborhood of Donji Grad. It has an irregular shape and is bounded by the streets Nemanjina on the west, Nikolaja Ostrovskog and 22. Oktobra on the south, Vrtlatska while on the north the border is marked by the Savska street and the complex of the Clinical Hospital \"Zemun\". With the smaller, surrounding green and wooded areas between the buildings and along the streets, it forms a green belt, stretching from Zemunski Kej on the east, across To\u0161in Bunar on the west.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Kontumac ===\nOn the location of modern park, from 1730 to 1871 there was Kontumac, or the quarantine hospital. As Zemun was Austro-Hungarian border town to Serbia, which was administered by the Ottoman Empire to 1815 (de facto; de jure to 1878), the quarantine was built for both the passengers and the goods coming from across the Sava river. List of notables held at Kontumac at various times includes rebellion leader Kara\u0111or\u0111e, linguist Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107, writer Joakim Vuji\u0107, French poet Alphonse de Lamartine and Danish author Hans Christian Andersen.Kontumac was built in 1730 in the southwest corner of the town. Originally, it was subordinated to another Kontumac, in Banovci, Two quarantines were connected with the deeply dug trench, large enough to be travelled by freight and passenger carts. In 1746, empress Maria Theresa ordered expansion of Zemun's Kontumac, which began to develop in the pattern of Roman-style limes, as a system of the hard-built lookouts and cabins. A system of buildings was built inside, water well, stables, etc. The quarantine complex was fortified with the pillars and planks. In 1776, the deep ditch was dug around it. As part of the preparations for the upcoming war with the Ottomans, the complex was further fortified with the high wall, with loopholes and gates, leaving only four entrances into the cantonment. Part of the wall survived at the corner of the Vrtlarska and Gunduli\u0107eva streets.\n\nFrom 1787, Kontumac in Zemun took the primacy from the one in Banovci, which was bit off the main road. All passengers, goods and postal shipments coming from the Ottoman Empire were first checked in the so-called Outer Kontumac. They were checked by the physicians, but without physical touch. Main focus were plague, cholera and smallpox. Those who had symptoms were placed in the isolation in the barrack close to the Danube, which lasted up to 52 days, which was in 1780 reduced to 21. If they had milder symptoms, the patients were placed in the lazaretto, which was located where the modern Zemun Hospital is. Healthy passengers were kept in the quarantine, too, but the length of their containment depended on how close the outbreak of the disease was to the compound. Those who died in Kontumac were buried at the \"plague cemetery\" in Kalvarija.An inn was on the location of present Zemun Gymnasium. It had three rooms, kitchen, taproom, grocery store, lard storage, wine cellar with the capacity of 16 tons, bakery and barn for 12 cattle. Surviving contract from 1818 shows that the innkeeper was allowed to serve food and drink both the citizens of Zemun and residents of Kontumac (Kontuma\u0161i). The Kontuma\u0161i had to pay for food and firewood for themselves. At the location of the modern children's playground, there was parlatoria, built as the log cabin without roof. It was used for talks with the quarantined people during the visitations. A supervisor, called latov was overseeing every conversation, minding the proper distance between the visitors and the quarantined. Latov also had the task of collecting money used by the quarantined to pay for the services. They didn't pay to the innkeeper directly, instead the money was thrown in the vinegar-filled vessel, and latov collected it with slotted spoon. At twilight, the Kontumac guardsmen would close from the outside both the inn and the four gates of the entire complex.Merchandise and post shipments were originally kept in the special storage, before especially picked personnel would check it. Coffee, rice and other grainy goods were unpacked and placed outdoors, under the canopy for three weeks of aeration. Textile wrapping bags were immersed in the water and if they couldn't be cleaned, they were burned. Wool, fur, raw silk, yarn, fabric, leather, etc., were kept up to six weeks as the \"diseases easily caught on it\". The most dangerous was the examination of the cotton. Especially selected workers were immersing naked arms into the cotton as soon as it would arrive, mingling it. They were then kept in the quarantine to see if the disease will develop. Though rare, deaths of the cotton examiners were recorded. Gold and hard objects were rinsed in salt water and soap foam. Letters were cleaned with vinegar at first, but this proved as the bad solution. Instead, the letters were later opened and held above the vinegar vapor which allowed Austrian state to spy on every correspondence claiming quarantine laws.However, being a border town Zemun also became an important trading post. Hence, the area of Kontumac was also a duty free zone between Austria and Turkey, and later Serbia. The zone contained rows of warehouses where goods were stored and sanitized prior to taxation. Apart from lazaretto, it also contained quarters for the people during their stay in the zone. Having large number of people at one place, hospitality and catering services developed around the zone, and numerous kafanas were opened, with colorful names: Kod Zlatnog Krsta (\"At Golden Cross\"), Kod Zlatnog To\u010dka (\"At Golden Wheel\"), Kod Cara (\"At the Emperor\"), Kod Zlatnog Slona (\"At Golden Elephant\"), Kod Zlatnog Sunca (\"At Golden Sun\"), etc.\n\n\n=== Park ===\n\nPartial shutting down of the Kontumac complex began on 1 May 1869. Zemun was granted a free royal city status in 1871 and the Kontumac was officially closed, though successive closing of the quarantine continued until 1883. Majority of the objects within the former complex were demolished in the 1870s and the 1880s. Apart from two surviving churches, two longest surviving buildings later hosted the district administration and gendarmerie. They were demolished in 1953.In 1875 the lot became a municipal property and the decision to turn it into the promenade and the park was made. The park was an idea of Ivan Perkovi\u0107, who also conducted the works on adapting the terrain into the park. The construction began in 1880 when the green area around the Great Realschule (modern Zemun Gymnasium) was formed. Original park was formed in the next 6 years and was officially open in 1886. For a while, it was named Elizabet-Park, after the Elisabeth, Empress consort of Austria, while it got its present name after the World War I. However, the forming of the park into its present size and layout lasted for decades and was finally completed in 1931. The seedlings were supplied by the well known Viscount's Nursery Garden from the town of Ilok.The park was scheduled for reconstruction in 2008  but it was postponed. A thorough reconstruction began in October 2017. The reconstructed area occupies 2.38 ha (5.9 acres) and covered the reconstruction of all pathways, fences and stairways replacement of the benches, decorative lights on additional monuments and construction of another children's playground which will be separated from the rest of the park with the newly formed wall of hedge. The reconstruction was finished on 4 May 2018.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe park covers an area of 7.72 ha (19.1 acres). It is populated by the both deciduous and conifer trees. 15 individual trees are protected by the law. In total, there are 1,300 individual trees in the park.In 1932, the building of the Faculty of Agronomy was constructed in the southern section of the park. A meteorological equipment was also located in the park. The meteorological weather station column was placed in October 1848, predating the park. Apart from being \"an ornament of the park\" later, it was useful for the townspeople as he after the meteorology progressed, gave the basic weather info on daily basis: temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, soil temperature and the Danube's water level. It was damaged in the 1944 allied bombing and was dismantled after October 1944.There are numerous sculptures and monuments in the park. Among them, in 1933 a monument to Lamartine was erected on the location between the two churches in the park. It commemorated Lamartine's stay in the Kontumac in 1833, during his travels to the East which he published in 1835 as the \"Voyage en Orient\". In 1946, two Partisan monuments were erected, commemorating the fightings with the German occupational forces during the World War II: the \"Bombard\" (by Vanja Radau\u0161) and the \"Hostage\" (by Boris Kalin). In front of the Orthodox church, there is a monument named \"Ha\u010dkar\", a gift from the people of Armenia to the people of Yugoslavia after the help from the Yugoslav pilots during the aftermath of the disastrous 1988 Armenian earthquake, which struck on 7 December 1988. In 2004, a bust of poet Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107 was dedicated. Remains of the Roman sarcophagus are exhibited between the gymnasium and the military barrack.There are three drinking fountains in the park and several protected individual trees of European yew and four groups of Caucasian walnuts. There is also one preserved Artesian well.\n\n\n== Buildings ==\n\nApart from Clinical Hospital \"Zemun\" and the Faculty of Agronomy, there are other important Zemun's buildings surrounding the park or within its borders: \"Svetozar Mileti\u0107\" and \"Majka Jugovi\u0107a\" elementary schools, \"Kosta Manojlovi\u0107\" music school, Zemun Gymnasium, Pinki Hall, Franciscan monastery of Saint John the Baptist and monastery of Sisters of Mercy. Within the park, there rare two churches, an Orthodox monastery of the Saint Archangels Michael and Gabriel and Roman Catholic chapel of the Saint Roch. Both churches were built in the temperate Baroque style for the people who were spending time in the Kontumac and were protected as the cultural monuments in 1966.\n\n\n=== Church of the Saint Archangels Michael and Gabriel ===\n\nThe church was built in 1786, on the location of an older, small church. It was built by Teodor To\u0161a Apostolovi\u0107 (1745\u20131810), with his personal funds. Apostolovi\u0107 was a Serbian merchant and philanthropist who donated the land between Be\u017eanija and Zemun to the Serbian church municipality of Zemun, of which he was a president when the church was built. The area and the subsequent neighborhood and the main street in it ar today called To\u0161in Bunar (\"To\u0161a's Well\") after him. After the Kontumac was disbanded, the church lost its importance.\nAfter a large number of Russian White \u00e9migr\u00e9s settled in Yugoslavia in the 1920s, especially in Belgrade and Zemun, the church was revitalized and until 1945 served as a Russian church. Within the new Communist regime after 1945, the church was largely neglected and unkempt. By 1981, the hieromonk Filaret Mi\u0107ovi\u0107 took over the management and restored the church. However, in the process the original frescoes were completely destroyed while the church even served as a weaponry storage. Mi\u0107ovi\u0107 obtained the permit to demolish the church completely and build a new temple covering 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) instead. When Patriarch Pavle was elected as the new head of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1991, he annulled the permit, preserving the old church.\n\n\n=== Church of the Saint Roch ===\nThe church was built in 1836 and, just like its Orthodox counterpart in the park, it was built on the foundation of an older chapel. It was designed by Joseph Felber, who also projected the Zemun's town hall, Magistrate in Zemun and another, Orthodox church of the Holy Trinity. After the Kontumac was turned into the park, and especially after the World War II, the church lost its importance. Today it is operational only occasionally.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==",

It is the most visited tourist attraction in Belgrade, with Skadarlija being the second. Since the admission is free, it is estimated that the total number of visitors (foreign, domestic, citizens of Belgrade) is over 2 million yearly.\n\n\n== Location ==\nBelgrade Fortress is located on top of the 125.5 meter high ending ridge of the \u0160umadija geological bar. The cliff-like ridge overlooks the Great War Island (Serbian: Veliko ratno ostrvo) and the confluence of the Sava river into the Danube, and makes one of the most beautiful natural lookouts in Belgrade. It borders the neighborhoods of Dor\u0107ol (north and north-east), Stari Grad (east) and Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac (Savamala; south). It is bounded by 3 streets: Boulevard of Vojvoda Bojovi\u0107, Tadeu\u0161a Ko\u0161\u0107u\u0161ka, Pariska, plus the railway along the riverside.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Classical Antiquity ===\n\nBelgrade Fortress is the core and the oldest section of the urban area of Belgrade. For centuries, the city population was concentrated only within the walls of the fortress, and thus the history of the fortress, until most recent times, reflects the history of Belgrade itself (see: Timeline of Belgrade history). The first mention of the city is when it was founded in the 3rd century BC as \"Singidunum\" by the Celtic tribe of Scordisci, who had defeated Thracian and Dacian tribes that previously lived in and around the fort. The city-fortress was later conquered by the Romans, was known as Singidunum and became a part of \"the military frontier\", where the Roman Empire bordered \"barbarian Central Europe\". Singidunum was defended by the Roman legion IV Flaviae, which built a fortified camp on a hill at the confluence of the Danube and the Sava rivers. In the period between 378 AD and 441 the Roman camp was repeatedly destroyed in the invasions by the Goths and the Huns. Legend says that Attila's grave lies at the confluence of the Sava and the Danube (under the fortress). In 476 Belgrade again became the border between the empires: the Western Roman Empire and Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire), and the Slav-Avar State in the north.\nThe Celtic fortification was a primitive one, located on top of Terazije ridge, above the confluence of the Sava into the Danube, where the fortress still stands today. Celts also lived in small, open and fortified settlements around the fort, called opidums. Since it is not known for sure where the Celtic fort was, some historians suggest that it was rather close to the necropolises in Karaburma and Rospi \u0106uprija. Celtic settlements belonged to the La T\u00e8ne culture.The original military camp was probably occupied by the soldiers from the Legio VIII Augusta from 46 AD to 69. Early Singidunum reached its height with the arrival of Legio IV Flavia Felix which was transferred to the city in 86 AD and remained there until the mid 5th century. The presence of Legio IV prompted the construction of a square-shaped castrum (fort), which occupied Upper Town of today's fortress. Construction began at the turn of the 2nd century AD as since the early 100s, Legio IV Flavia Felix became permanently stationed in Singidunum. At first, the fortress was set up as earthen bulwarks and wooden palisades, but soon after, it was fortified with stone as the first stone fort in Belgrade's history. The remains can be seen today near the northeastern corner of the acropolis. The legion also constructed a pontoon bridge over the Sava, connecting Singidunum with Taurunum.Rectangular castrum covered what is today the Upper Town and the Kalemegdan Park. The castrum had tall walls, built from the white Ta\u0161majdan limestone and spread over the area of 16 ha (40 acres) to 20 ha (49 acres), being shaped as an irregular rectangle (approximately 570 by 330 m (1,870 by 1,080 ft)).\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nThe Byzantine Emperor Justinian I rebuilt the fortress around 535. In the following centuries the fortress suffered continuous destruction under the Avar sieges. The Slavs (Serbs) and Avars had their \"state union\" north of Belgrade with the Serbs and other Slavic tribes finally settling in the Belgrade area as well as the regions west and south of Belgrade in the beginning of the 7th century. The name Belgrade (or Beograd in Serbian), which, not just in Serbian but in most Slavic languages, means a \"white town\" or a \"white fortress\", was first mentioned in AD 878 by Bulgarians. The fortress kept changing its masters: Bulgaria during three centuries, and then the Byzantines and then again Bulgarians. The fortress remained a Byzantine stronghold until the 12th century when it fell in the hands of the newly emerging Serbian state. It became a border city of the Serbian Kingdom, later Empire with Hungary. The Hungarian king B\u00e9la I gave the fortress to Serbia in the 11th century as a wedding gift (his son married the Serbian princess Jelena), but it remained effectively part of Hungary, except for the period 1282\u20131319.\n\nAfter the Serbian state collapsed following the Battle of Kosovo, Belgrade was chosen as the capital of Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 in 1402. Major work was done to the ramparts which were encircling a big thriving town. The lower town at the banks of the Danube was the main urban center with a new built Orthodox cathedral. The upper town with its castle was defending the city from inland. Belgrade remained in Serbian hands for almost a century. After the Despot's death in 1427, it had to be returned to Hungary. An attempt by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1456 to conquer the fortress was prevented by Janos Hunyadi (Siege of Belgrade), saving Hungary from Ottoman dominion for 70 years.\n\n\n=== Early Modern ===\nIn 1521, 132 years after the Battle of Kosovo, the fortress, like most parts of the Serbian state, was conquered by the Turks and remained (with short periods of the Austrian and Serbian occupation), under the rule of the Ottoman Empire until the year 1867, when the Turks withdrew from Belgrade and Serbia. During the short period of Austrian rule (1718\u20131738), the fortress was largely rebuilt and modernized. It witnessed the Great Serbian Migration in the 17th century and two Serbian Uprisings in the 19th century, during the Turkish Period.\n\nDuring the Austrian occupation of northern Serbia 1717\u201339, several hospitals were established in Belgrade. The City hospital of Saint John was built within the fortress walls, but its exact location is not known. Emperor Charles VI signed the Belgrade City Statute in 1724 (\"Proclamation on organizing German Belgrade\"), which mentions city hospital, city pharmacy, medics and midwives. The German municipality had low incomes so it had to ask the state for help and beneficence. The hospital is mentioned in the 1728 Census. It was a hospital already in 1719, later becoming the residence of Thomas Berger, the head of the hospital. After his death, his daughter continued to reside in the building. The hospital (Stattspital) was moved to another location, into the newly constructed building in 1724. A small church was built next to it. This new hospital was quite small, with only 2 rooms, a kitchen and a basement, so it way not be the same city hospital.Lazaret or a quarantine hospital is not mentioned in the documents, but it is safe to presume that it had to be formed during the viral outbreaks, as was usual in the time. The procedure in case of outbreaks was probably analog to the existing procedure in Buda, the capital of Hungary. Today unidentified disease ravaged Belgrade in 1730. Viral epidemic killed a lot of people. During the course of only two weeks, just the Jesuits buried 220 people and themselves lost 3 missionaries. The extremely massive plague outbreak hit the city in October 1738. As the Austrian army retreated in front of the advancing Turks, numerous civilians fled to the fortress, many of them being contagious. Having so many people in a cramped space, triage was not possible so the plague spread quickly. There are reports of the dead lying in the streets for days as there was no one to bury them. The Austrian garrison was decimated and the corpses of the soldiers who died of plague were burned with their personal properties.\n\nAfter Austria lost the Austro-Turkish War of 1737\u20131739, northern Serbia, including Belgrade, was returned to the Turks. One of the provisions of the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade stated that Austria had to demolish all the fortifications and military and civilian building it had constructed during the occupation. Many Baroque buildings were demolished within the fortress. However, Austria didn't demolish the buildings outside of the fortress walls. That way, the House at 10 Cara Du\u0161ana Street, built 1724\u20131727, in the neighborhood of Dor\u0107ol survived, being today the oldest house in Belgrade.The 1837 plague outbreak almost brought to the war between the ruling prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 and the Ottomans in the fortress. The outbreak began in Ottoman Empire in 1836, which had no medical protocols of any kind at the time, and prince Milo\u0161 blocked the borders immediately imposing the mandatory quarantine. A group of plague infected Ottoman nizams on the way to Belgrade was halted at the border in Aleksinac and placed in the quarantine, but majority of them fled and continued to Belgrade, spreading the plague on its path (Ra\u017eanj, Para\u0107in, Jagodina, \u0106i\u0107evac) and ultimately reaching the fortress in the spring of 1837. The prince ordered full and strong siege of the fortress by the Serbian guardsmen, cutting the fortress off completely for six weeks. The pasha complained and threatened from inside the fortress, initially hiding and denying the disease, but the fortress Ottomans were reluctant to start military skirmish in this condition. The besieging was successful as the plague never spread to Belgrade.Four outer city gates, with the adjoining walls and ramparts were demolished from 1862 (Sava, Vidin and Varo\u0161 gates) to 1866 (Stambol Gate). After the Ottomans fully evacuated the inner fortress in 1867, Serbian troops took over, but as the state was still only autonomous (full independence was achieved in 1878), Serbia was only to \"manage it\" and was not acknowledged as the proprietor of the fortress by the neighboring Austria-Hungary. First action by the Serbian authorities, just 5 days after the Ottomans left in April 1867, was to rebuild the Ru\u017eica Church.After the Ottoman withdrawal, newspapers in Austro-Hungary continuously published stories, backed by the military experts, that the fortress became strategically obsolete and that, having no value of any kind, Austrian army could destroy it in 24 hours. In the autumn of 1867 citizens were awaken by the heavy artillery fire. Ruling prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 sent two batteries to the fortress (where modern Monument of Gratitude to France is) and ordered them to fire at the fortress wall where the old wooden bridge was located. A barrage fire of 300 salvos from De Bange cannons shelled the fortress during the entire day. It remained unclear why the prince ordered this: he decided to demolish the fortress completely, as such stories spread among the citizens; he wanted to show to the Austrians that the fortress has its values and importance, and that it can't be destroyed in a day (despite all the shelling, only 15 m (49 ft) of rampart was destroyed); or he simply did it to spite the Austrians. The shelling also disturbed the citizens of Zemun, across the Sava, which was part of Austro-Hungary at the time, and some of the grenades which missed the target hit Austro-Hungarian soil, so the imperial government sent an official diplomatic note to Serbia, protesting the shelling and reminding the prince he is only a \"caretaker\" of the fortress.After the takeover of the fortress, Serbian forces kept finding parts of the gallows, chains, gibbets and impalement stakes in the dungeons, used previously by the Ottomans to torture the prisoners. Official reports by the Serbian army hold claims by the soldiers of the \"ghoulish, headless and limbless wraiths\" and other abominations roaming the fortress. The army issued an order that, despite there was no enemy anymore, all guards must keep watch \"at least in pairs\". Mihailo's successor, prince and later king Milan Obrenovi\u0107, ordered the leveling of the terrain in the eastern sections of the fortress and planting of the greenery and trees, which in time developed into the Kalemegdan Park.\n\n\n=== Modern ===\nWhile it was inhabited, the fortress formed one of the quarters in the administrative division of Belgrade. It was called Grad, and translated in the foreign languages as \"fortress\". According to the censuses, it had a population of 2,219 in 1890, 2,281 in 1895, 2,777 in 1900, 2,396 in 1905 and 454 in 1910.Kalemegdan was the location of the second airport in Serbia, after one in the neighborhood of Banjica from 1910. A field in the Donji Grad was adapted for planes in January 1911. It was situated along the bank of the Sava river, from the old Turkish bath (modern Planetarium) to the mouth of the Sava into the Danube. One of the flight pioneers, Edvard Rusjan, died in an airplane crash after taking off from this field and being hit by the gust of ko\u0161ava on 9 January 1911. Remains of Rusjan's plane were originally exhibited in Donji Grad and his funeral was one of the largest recorded in Belgrade. Surviving rib of this airplane became the first exhibit in the predecessor of the modern Aeronautical Museum Belgrade. Today, the area is used by the parachutists and paragliders and as the location of the air shows for sports and ultra-light aviation.In 1928, building company \"\u0160umadija\" proposed the construction of the cable car, which they called \"air tram\". The project was planned to connect Zemun to Belgrade Fortress, via Great War Island. The interval of the cabins was set at 2 minutes and the entire route was supposed to last 5 minutes. The project was never realized, but the idea of the cable car was revived in the 21st century.During his visit to the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Yugoslav prime minister Milan Stojadinovi\u0107 was fascinated by the objects built for the games, especially by the grandiose\nOlympic Stadium. He instigated the Yugoslav Olympic Committee to nominate Belgrade as the host of the 1948 Olympics and invited Werner March, architect of the Berlin stadium, to visit Belgrade and design objects for the games. March came to Belgrade in May 1938 and suggested the Fortress' Lower Town as the location for the Olympic complex. Without architectural design competition or bidding, Stojadinovi\u0107's government accepted his idea and gave him carte blanche regarding the design. The project was finished in 1939 and the architectural model was exhibited in October 1940 at the \"Exhibition of the new German architecture\" in the German pavilion at the Belgrade Fair.In the early 1940, March began the preparatory works, as he also planned the partial remodeling of the fortress outside of the sports complex, too. He incited archaeological survey and invited German architectural historian Daniel Krencker to study the excavations. Within the scopes of the Nazi expansion of the megaprojects, and augmentation of the German historic role and importance in this region, Krencker praised March's project as the \"artistic dream, which represents rare and major German cultural act which will contribute to the old German glory of Belgrade\". Just few days after German scientists left the fortress, Germany attacked Yugoslavia on 6 April 1941. Olympic complex was pushed aside, shifting the focus of the Germans to the archaeological exploration of the fortress during the war.The fortress suffered further damage during the First and the Second World Wars. After almost two millennia of continuous sieges, battles and conquests, the fortress is today known as the Belgrade Fortress. The present name of Kalemegdan Park derives from two Turkish words, kale (fortress) and meydan (field), literally meaning \"fortress field\".\nAfter World War II, before skiing facilities were built on the mountains further from Belgrade, the slopes of Kalemegdan (so as of Banovo Brdo, Ko\u0161utnjak and Avala), were used by Belgraders for skiing.\n\n\n== Archaeology ==\n\n\n=== Words War II ===\n\nAlready in April 1941, professor and major Johann von Reiswitz was appointed to the Referat for the Protection of the Cultural Values in Serbia. He saved numerous cultural objects in Serbia, which won him praise even from some Serbian historians after the war. On 20 October 1941 the Lower Town was fenced on his orders of keeping and protecting the fortress. He also began archaeological digging. However, the right to dig in the fortress was asked from both the pseudo-scientific organization Ahnenerbe and the Main Work Group Southeast of the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce. Pressured financially and politically, von Reiswitz felt he must side with one of them, so he arranged the participation of Ahnenerbe with organization's head Walther W\u00fcst in October 1941. Based on this, collaborationist Minister for Education and Religion Velibor Joni\u0107 issued the \"permit on monopoly\" to Ahnenerbe's Secretary General Wolfram Sievers in February 1942.Austrian prehistorian Friedrich Holste was selected to conduct the survey, but he was killed in May 1942 near Kharkiv, Ukraine, before reaching Belgrade. He was replaced with Wilhelm Unverzagt, director of the Berlin's Museum for Prehistory and Early History. Joined by Sievers and Herbert Jankuhn,  Heinrich Himmler's close associate, Unverzagt began targeted digging, searching for the material proof to confirm the German idea of transforming Belgrade into Prinzeugenstadt. He specifically searched for the monumental gate at the entry into the Lower Town, built during the Nicolas Doxat's rebuilding of Belgrade under the orders of Prince Eugene of Savoy in the 1720s and 1730s. The gate was named after the Holy Roman Emperor from that period, Charlies VI. Already on 15 July 1941, secretary in the Reich Ministry of the Interior Wilhelm Stuckart sent memo, asking for Belgrade to be transformed into the \"Reich's Fortress\". It was to be connected military with the copper and gold Bor mines and the Danube's Iron Gates gorge, to create the Banat area protection zone. This zone was intended to become Eugenia, or Prinz Eugen's District, where Danube Swabians were to settle and expand.The digging lasted through 1942 and 1943, when it was stopped after the Allied bombing of Belgrade began. By 1943, the Germans completely rebuilt the Gate of Charles VI, in greatest detail. Reconstruction included the cartouche with the initials of the emperor on the capital from the outer side, and the supposed coat-of-arms of never-existing Tribalia, on the inner side (boar with an arrow pierced through the head). As the motive of this coat-of-arms appeared in medieval Serbian seals and was adopted as part of the Serbian coat-of-arms after First Serbian Uprising in 1804, it was meant to show the incorporation of Serbia into the western empire. The gate was damaged already during the heavy Allied Easter bombing in April 1944.It is not known was Ahnenerbe searching for something specifically or just wanted to falsify the route by which Aryans reached Germany from Middle East. Some surviving documents show that they discovered remains of Celtic and Gothic settlements, a trench from the Roman period and relics from the Austrian rule after the conquest of Eugene of Savoy. Some sources claim that after the bombing started, documentation and part of the artifacts were transported to Lebus, in Germany, and are considered to be lost. Others claim that the entire material was stored in the Belgrade City Museum. What is known for sure is that during the \"terrain cleaning\" in 1941-1942, the Germans completely destroyed the foundations of the Austrian artillery barrack built in the 1723-1736 period.\n\n\n=== Post war ===\nOn 29 February 1952 city adopted the \"Decision on protection, adaptation and maintenance of the people's park of Kalemegdan\" which set the borders of the protected areas as the rivers of Danube and Sava and the streets of Tadeu\u0161a Ko\u0161\u0107u\u0161kog and Pariska. In 1962, Belgrade's Institute for the cultural monuments protection expanded the zone to several blocks across the streets. Detailed plan on Kalemegdan from 1965 provided that, despite the immense archaeological value that lies beneath the fortress ground, basically only what was discovered by that time can be explored, restored or protected. That caused the problem both for the expansion of the park but even more for the further exploration of the fortress' underground. Best example is the Lower Town where neither the park fully developed nor the remains of the former port, which was located there, are visible.The area of the fortress is 66 ha (160 acres). By 2000, only 5% of that area was archaeologically surveyed, and by 2010 that number rose to 12% or 8 ha (20 acres). Based on the findings so far, it is estimated that during the rule of despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 in the first half of the 15th century, when Belgrade became capital of Serbia, the city within the fortress had 5,600 to 12,000 inhabitants. Archaeological examinations were done on the following locations:\nUpper Town in the inner fortress; surveyed 1948\u20132009; found remains belong to the Prehistory, Antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian period\nwaterfront rampart in Lower Town 1963\u20132010; Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian period\nKalemegdan Park 1973\u20132010; antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian period\nBelgrade Zoo 1988; antiquity, Middle Ages and Turkish-Austrian periodIn September 1969 major discoveries were announced. The appearance of the Lower Town was almost completely changed after the excavation. The medieval cobblestone was uncovered, so as the old ramparts and gates. In the process, the Lower Town was made more accessible to the visitors, including the new stairway and reconstruction of the part of the medieval rampart. In the Upper Town, four large, massive pillars from the period of despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 (15th century) were discovered. They are remains of the medieval bridge which was located in front of the main entry into the inner fort of the city. The fort was surrounded by the deep trench. It was previously known that an inner, bascule bridge existed within the fortress, which survived until the 17th century, but its exact location and type of construction were unknown.The explored sections after 2000 include the access downhill path to the Small Staircase in Kalemegdan Park, the bastion on the Sava slope, the gates of King, Sava, Dark and Kara\u0111or\u0111e, the Great Ravelin, etc. During the 2017 reconstruction of the Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107's Fountain, next to Defterdar's Gate in the Gornji Grad, several archaeological discoveries were made. Remnants of the Roman castrum, two urns from the Bronze Age and remains of the Neolithic object were discovered. The findings were conserved and reburied.\n\n\n== Features ==\nBelgrade Fortress is generally divided into four sections. The four sections, two of which make the fortress itself (Donji and Gornji Grad) and two make Kalemegdan park today, were divided by the Tsarigrad Road, on the location of modern pedestrian path next to the Cvijeta Zuzori\u0107 Art Pavilion.\n\n\n=== Lower Town ===\n\nDonji Grad (\u0414\u043e\u045a\u0438 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434); occupies the slope towards the riversides, from the top spot (ridge where \"The Victor\" is). Between the lowest section and the Danube is Kula Neboj\u0161a (\"Impregnable, Fearless, or Daredevil Tower\"), which has been turned into a museum of the Greek revolutionary Rigas Feraios, who was strangled by the Turks in this tower and his corpse thrown into the Danube. Donji Grad, like the neighboring Savamala, frequently suffers from flooding, and Kula Neboj\u0161a suffered extensive damage during the major floods of 2006. The Orthodox churches of Ru\u017eica (former Austrian gun depot) and Sveta Petka are also located in this area, as is the Belgrade Planetarium.\nThe modern church of Sveta Petka was projected by architect Momir Korunovi\u0107. Construction began in the first half of the 1930s, on the location of an old chapel. It was consecrated on 27 October 1937, the feast day of Parascheva of the Balkans, called Petka in Serbian.During the tenure of mayor Dragan \u0110ilas (2008\u201313), the idea of expanding the zoo to Donji Grad, which it occupied prior to the World War II, resurfaced, but the experts were against it. The urban plan for the fortress from 1965 already projected the complete relocation of the zoo outside of the fortress, to some suburban locations, which in later plans included Veliko Blato, Stepin Lug or Jelezovac. The expansion of the zoo would cut the pedestrian communication between the Danube's and Sava's parts of the fortress, which was already cut in 1949 but was restored in 2009 with the reconstruction and opening of the Sava Gate. Also, it would prevent the exploration of Donji Grad, which is still largely unexplored and leave the Gate of Charles VI, a masterpiece of Balthasar Neumann, within the zoo itself. As of 2017, the zoo was not relocated but the idea of expansion was dropped, too.\n\n\n=== Upper Town ===\n\nGornji Grad (\u0413\u043e\u0440\u045a\u0438 \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434), the upper section of fortress, turned into a park, with beautiful promenades and the statue of \"The Victor\" (Serbian: Pobednik), the so-called \"Roman well\" (Serbian: Rimski bunar), actually built by the Austrians, the Popular Observatory (since 1963) in the Despot Stefan Tower, the t\u00fcrbe (tomb) of Damad Ali Pasha, Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107's Fountain, tennis and basketball courts, etc.\n\n\n==== Gunpowder magazine (ca 1720s) ====\nAlso adapted for visits is the Great Austrian gunpowder magazine, built during the Austrian occupation of Belgrade 1718\u201339, after they destroyed the old one during the 1717 Siege of Belgrade. They directly hit the magazine with a cannonball and the explosion which followed allowed the Austrians to capture the city. The object is located below the 7 m (23 ft) tall rampart. The magazine is today embellished with the artifacts from the Roman period which were discovered in or around the fortress: tombstone stelae, monuments, altars and the Sarcophagus of Jonah, which originates from the 3rd century AD. It was arranged and opened for visitors in 2014.One of the  Roman marble monuments, exhibited since 2012, was the so called Herkulanka (after Herculaneum, where first such sculptures were discovered in the 18th century). They were usually honorary representations of important women. Estimated to be work of some local sculptor to represent one of the more important female residents of Singidunum, it was made in c.300 and was found close to the Military Museum. The represented woman is rich, in heavily draped chiton, with the himation mantle wrapped over the arm and head. In May 2020, there was a break in the magazine's lapidarium, and the Herkulanka was vandalized and broken.\n\n\n==== Roman well (ca 1720s) ====\nThe present facility, called the Roman Well, is neither Roman nor a (water) well. It is located along the southwest rampart of the Upper Town, in the vicinity of the Pobednik monument and the \"King's Gate\". An underground object existed during the mediaeval period and is referenced by Constantine of Kostenets during the rule of Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, in the first half of the 15th century. It apparently was a dungeon as it was mentioned during the 1456 Siege of Belgrade when 30 Hungarian conspirators died in it after their scheme to let the Turks into the fortress and surrender the city to them was thwarted. They were to be paid by the Turks, but were discovered and dropped into the pit with ropes. They were left there without food and after they began losing their minds from hunger, they were thrown knives to kill each other. Turkish traveler Evliya \u00c7elebi in 1660 wrote about the object as the grain silo.\n\nAfter the Austrians occupied the northern Serbia in 1717, it was obvious that there is a problem of providing water for the city within the fortress. Main sources were two large rivers, Danube and Sava, but as Belgrade was quite often under siege or a battleground, it wasn't practical as the rivers would become unreachable during the sieges so they searched for an alternative. Within the scopes of a massive construction and reconstruction of Belgrade in the Baroque manner, from 1717 to 1731 a present facility was dug and a complex wooden mechanism was installed to lift the water up from the pit of 50 m (160 ft). It was designed by Balthasar Neumann. Austrians originally intended to dig a proper water well. They descended to 54 m (177 ft), which is below the water level in the Sava, but found no water and actually hit the impervious rock layer. Then they decided to adapt it into the cistern and to conduct all surface water into it. The mechanism was manually operated, worked on the lever principle and had 12 segments, or pistons, which all worked at the same time when operated. Water was then \"climbing\", being poured from one vessel into another. Being made of wood, it got rotten and completely disappeared in time, but sometimes it is mentioned as the beginning of the \"industrial period\" in Belgrade.  The copy of the schematics is still being kept in the library of the Matica Srpska in Novi Sad. Neumann also constructed a double spiral staircase which descends 35 m (115 ft) down the shaft and based it on the staircase in the Saint Peter Well in Orvieto, Italy. The diameter of the shaft is 3.4 m (11 ft). The staircase has 212 steps and there is a small corridor at the bottom which connects two sections of the staircase, but it is usually flooded. On Austrian maps, it is named the Great Well, but when Serbian rebels liberated Belgrade from the Ottomans in the early 19th century they gradually named it the Roman Well as the common belief at the time was that all old buildings were Roman.\nIn 1940 the Yugoslav Royal Army emptied the well, measured it and cleaned it. Because of that, during the World War II an urban myth spread through Belgrade claiming that the gold from the National bank of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was hidden in the well. German occupation forces sent three divers to check the bottom of the well, but all three disappeared. Some of the Yugoslav soldiers apparently carved a number \"1940\" near the bottom of the well.\nIn 1954 a man threw his mistress into the well. Police wanted to prove that he killed her so the divers were dispatched to find the body, but they failed. Still, her body resurfaced ten days later. This story served as an inspiration for Du\u0161an Makavejev when he wrote and directed the movie Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard Operator in 1967. In 1964 Alfred Hitchcock visited the well and praised the \"ambience\". In 1967\u20131968, new exploration of the object was conducted. The divers discovered that the bottom is full of sludge and retrieved a number of skeletons, several animal ones and two human. In 1987 the divers explored whether there is a connection between the well and the Sava, but found no tunnel. The bottom was flat, there was one park bench in the water and a huge number of coins. The Roman Well served as an inspiration for another movie Lavirint, which was nominated by Serbia for an Oscar in 2002. During the 2006 dive, a miniature, 5 mm (0.20 in) long amphipoda, previously undiscovered in Serbia, was found. It was closed in 2007, reconstructed and reopened in March 2014, but as of 2017 the upper section is open for visitors while the descent is forbidden due to the safety reasons.Divers explored it again in November 2017. The bottom wasn't flat anymore as the bench and coins were covered with a thick layer of some 15 m3 (530 cu ft) of construction waste, iron bars, reflector lights, wired trash bins, etc, which all made the well 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in) shallower. Cans, plastic bottles and lids were floating on the water, while a pile of new coins formed. The divers suggested that the well should be cleaned at least once a year. Still, the water was unusually clear, with artificial reflector light it was transparent all the way to the bottom, or 14 m (46 ft) and had a temperature of 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F). After 300 years, speleothems began to form near the bottom of the well.Existence of another water well, sort of a \"twin\" of the Roman well, is not widely known today. This well, built on the same principle and being about the same depth, is located away from the fortress, below the modern Monument to Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107 in the Vukov Spomenik neighborhood.\n\n\n==== Damad Ali Pasha's t\u00fcrbe (1784) ====\n\nThe t\u00fcrbe is located on the central plateau of the Upper Town and is one of the few remaining monuments of Islamic architecture in Belgrade. It was named after Damad Ali Pasha, a Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire 1713\u201316, during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III. The mausoleum, however, is younger. It was built in 1784 over the grave of Izzet Mehmed Pasha, another Grand Vizier and a muhafiz, or governor, of Belgrade. The t\u00fcrbe was badly damaged during the First Serbian Uprising, so the Ottoman governor of Serbia, Marashli Ali Pasha, reconstructed it in 1818\u201319 and dedicated it to Damad Ali Pasha. Another two muhafiz, this time administering only the fortress as Serbia gained autonomy, were buried in the t\u00fcrbe: Selim Sirri Pasha in 1847 and Hasan Pasha in 1850.The mausoleum is made of stone, with a regular hexagonal base. The sides are 4 m (13 ft) long, it is 7 m (23 ft) tall with a diameter of 8 m (26 ft). A thorough renovation began in May 2017 and should be finished by October. The wiring and the roof are replaced, the floor was drained and the inner and outer conservation was done. Old roof tiles were broken so the water poured inside. The roof tiles, which were not the original roof cover, were replaced with the lead cover and new, modern roof tiles, rotten wooden floor was replaced with the brick slabs and the wooden covering of the tomb was also replaced.\n\n\n==== Bunker (1948\u20131949) ====\nIn 1948, after the Informbiro resolution and the ensuing Tito\u2013Stalin split, a construction of the defensive bunker began on the fortress. In the process, the 5 m (16 ft) thick rampart of the original Neboj\u0161a Tower was discovered. It was destroyed and by 1949 the bunker which covers 200 m2 (2,200 sq ft) was finished. The tallest point of the bunker is the cannon dome which was used for the artillery and military units. Abandoned later, it was adapted for the tourists and opened in December 2012. It has parts of the authentic inventory from the 1950s: safety doors, beds, ventilation, water tanks, etc.\n\n\n==== Basketball monument (2018) ====\nOn 12 December 2018, a monument officially called \"Monument to the Founding Fathers of Serbian and Yugoslav Basketball School\" was dedicated. The date was symbolic, as it also marked 95 years since the first basketball arrived in Serbia and 70 years since the founding of the basketball association. The monument is located in a small park area between the basketball courts of \"Partizan\" and \"Crvena Zvezda\".As written on the inscription, the monument is dedicated to the members of the Yugoslavia national basketball team which qualified for the 1950 FIBA World Championship in Argentina. Four players from this team became members of the FIBA Hall of Fame: Neboj\u0161a Popovi\u0107, Aleksandar Nikoli\u0107, Radomir \u0160aper and Borislav Stankovi\u0107. The sculpture was built on the initiative of the former basketball player Nata\u0161a Kova\u010devi\u0107. The monument was designed by sculptor Rado\u0161 Radenkovi\u0107, symbolizes \"fight for global affirmation\" and represents three stylized arms reaching for a basketball.\n\n\n=== Great Kalemegdan Park ===\n\nVeliki Kalemegdanski park (\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a) occupies the southern corner of fortress, with geometrical promenades, the Military Museum, the Museum of Forestry and Hunting, and the Monument of Gratitude to France. At the location of the Monument of Gratitude to France there was a monument to Kara\u0111or\u0111e which was dedicated on 21 August 1913, a work of Pa\u0161ko Vu\u010deti\u0107. There was a relief with various figures on the sides of the pedestal and Kara\u0111or\u0111e's grandson, king Peter I of Serbia attended the dedication. During the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Belgrade in World War I, the Austrians planned to erect the bronze monument to their emperor, Franz Joseph I on that very spot so they melted the Kara\u0111or\u0111e's monument to reuse the bronze. When the Franz Joseph monument was being shipped to Belgrade in 1918, Serbian forces captured the ship and confiscated the statue. It was later melted into three church bells, largest of which still tolls from the belltower of the Ru\u017eica Church today.\n\n\n==== Gondola lift ====\n\nIn August 2017 the construction of the gondola lift, which would connect Kalemegdan with U\u0161\u0107e was announced by the city government for 2018. Construction was confirmed in March 2018 when the idea of a pedestrian bridge was dropped after it has been described as \"complicated\" and \"unstable\". On the Kalemegdan side, the station will be dug into the hill, 1m (3 ft 3in) below the fortress' Sava Promenade. There is a cave 7 m (23 ft) below the projected station, so there is a possibility that the cave will be adapted for visitations and connected to the future gondola station by an elevator. On the U\u0161\u0107\u0435 side, the starting point will be next to the Skate Park, across the U\u0161\u0107e Tower. The entire route is 1 km (0.62 mi) long, of which 300 m (980 ft) will be above the Sava river itself. Estimated cost is \u20ac10 million and duration of works 18 months. Already existing criticism of the project continued, from the officially used name (gondola instead of a traditional Serbian \u017ei\u010dara) and chosen location, to the route, especially the Kalemegdan station which is a collapsible locality above the cave, in the area already prone to mass wasting. Park of the Non-Aligned Countries in the neighborhood of Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac was proposed as the better solution.Cutting of 47 trees in the park, because of the gondola lift began in March 2019. The pine trees were 50 to 60 years old. With an enlarged price of \u20ac15 million and unified opposition to the project by the environmentalists, architects and urbanists, with additional cutting of over 100 trees in U\u0161\u0107e park across the river, this prompted popular protests. Citizens organized and as the city was cutting the trees, they were planting new seedlings. Drilling also began and it was announced that the stone wall will be partially demolished, too. Municipality of Stari Grad also organized protests, demolishing fences on the construction site, filing complaints and fines against city and government officials and announcing 24-hours watch on site and demolition of any structure built in the meantime. Construction of the gondola lift is prohibited by the current Belgrade's General Regulatory Plan from 2016 which stipulates that construction of the \"cables for the alternative transportation and recreation\" is forbidden in the area of the Belgrade Fortress.In March 2020, the fortress was voted one of the Europe\u2019s 7 most endangered heritage sites, specifically due to the planned construction of the gondola lift.\n\n\n=== Little Kalemegdan Park ===\nMali Kalemegdanski park (\u041c\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043a) occupies the area in the eastern section, which borders the urban section of Belgrade. The northern section of Little Kalemegdan Park is occupied by the Belgrade zoo, opened in 1936. The Cvijeta Zuzori\u0107 Art Pavilion is also located here.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nKalemegdan is the most popular park among Belgraders and for many tourists visiting Belgrade because of the park's numerous winding walking paths, shaded benches, picturesque fountains, statues, historical architecture and scenic river views (Sahat kula \u2013 the clock tower; closed in 2007 for the reconstruction, reopened in April 2014, Zindan kapija \u2013 Zindan gate, etc). The former canal which was used for city supplying in the Middle Ages is completely covered by earth but the idea of recreating it resurfaced in the early 2000s. Belgrade Fortress is known for its kilometers-long tunnels, underground corridors and catacombs, which are still largely unexplored. In the true sense, fortress is today the green oasis in the Belgrade's urban area.\nAs a combination of several habitats (parkland with old trees, fortress, landscape view of rivers and forested Veliko Ratno Ostrvo), Kalemegdan may be interesting for overseas tourists-birdwatchers as it provides a snapshot of local bird fauna. It is also important as the resting spot for small passerine birds on migration, before or after crossing the rivers Sava and Danube. Kalemegdan has its own eBird hotspot and associated webpage at Kalemegdan Hotspot\nThe Belgrade Race Through History, an annual 6 km footrace, takes place in the park and fortress as a way of highlighting the history and culture of the area.The Belgrade Fortress was nominated by the Serbian government for the UNESCO's World Heritage Site. Architects and urbanists think that possible inclusion on the list will protect the fortress from \"aggressive transitional construction\". In that case, the outlines of the fortress and a panoramic view on it will have to be preserved. The perceived visual pollution encompasses several objects. A gigantic object, a late 2000s project by the Zaha Hadid's studio, on the northern side of the fortress, down the slope of Danube. The project, despite some preparatory works, still didn't start off. The other was the spiral project \"Cloud\" by Sou Fujimoto, which was to connect the Sava port to the fortress, but the project was scrapped after 2013 when the mayoral tenure of \u0110ilas ended. The third project is controversial Belgrade Waterfront project.\n\nThe fortress in general functions as a major archaeological, artistic and historical treasury. As of 2014 it comprised:\n19 memorial busts of important people from Serbian history, science and arts (Jovan Skerli\u0107, Milo\u0161 Crnjanski, Jovan Du\u010di\u0107, \u0110ura Dani\u010di\u0107, Stevan Mokranjac\n18 registered archaeological digs (horseshoe towers, remnants of the Metropolitan's palace, Roman Castrum, building of the main guards)\n6 monuments and memorials (Pobednik, Monument of Gratitude to France, Despot Stefan Lazarevi\u0107's Monument)\n4 restaurants and coffee shops\n4 sports terrains\n3 sculptures (\"Genius of death\", \"Tired fighter\", \"Partisan with children\")\n2 fountains (\"Awakening\", \"Fisherman\")\n2 drinking fountains (\"Japanese\", \"Mehmed Pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107\")\n2 churches (Ru\u017eica, Saint Petka)\n2 galleries (of the Natural Museum, Inner Stambol Gate)\n2 museums (Military Museum, Neboj\u0161a Tower)\nCvijeta Zuzori\u0107 Art Pavilion, City Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments, Belgrade Planetarium, Luna Park, Belgrade Zoo, People's Observatory, Music Pavilion, Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts' Archaeological Institute's Science and Research Center for the Fortress, Memorial Ossuary for the 1914\u201315 defenders of Belgrade\nTomb of People's Heroes, containing the remains of the Communist party members and war heroes Ivan Milutinovi\u0107, \u0110uro \u0110akovi\u0107, Ivo Lola Ribar and Mo\u0161a Pijade. The tomb was built for the first three in 1948, using the granite slabs intended for the construction of the Church of Saint Sava. Stevan Bodnarov sculptured their busts in 1949. After his death in 1957, Pijade was also buried in the tomb, and his bust, work of Slavoljub Stankovi\u0107, was added in 1959. The complex was declared a cultural monument in 1983. Since the 1990s, the tomb has been frequently vandalized.\n\n\n== Concerts and shows ==\nThe flat grounds below the fortress are occasionally used as open-air concert location during late spring and summer:\n\n3 September 1997: Partibrejkers\nBelgrade Beer Fest, annually from 2003 until 2007\n18 June 2011: Amy Winehouse and Moby\n15 September 2012: Warriors Dance Festival (The Prodigy, Skrillex)\n24 May 2013: \u0110or\u0111e Bala\u0161evi\u0107\n27 May 2013: Green Day (Belgrade Calling Festival, others: Atheist Rap, Superhiks, Hladno Pivo)\n14 June 2013: Whitesnake\n22 June 2013: Bajaga i Instruktori\n17 June 2014: Iron Maiden (Maiden England World Tour, opening act: Ghost)\n13 August 2017: Interpol\n27 August 2018: Jessie Ware\n8 September 2018: 2CellosFurthermore, KK Partizan and Red Star concrete basketball courts on the fortress have been used for concerts:\n\n26 June 2009: Simply Red (@KK Partizan court)\n11 July 2011: MTV Free Concert (@KK Partizan court, Rob Garza from Thievery Corporation, Philippe Cohen Solal from Gotan Project, and Gramophonedzie)\n26 May 2018: Hladno Pivo (@KK Partizan court)Additionally, a small walled-in part of the fortress near its bottom is known as Barutana.

        "wiki": "The National Museum in Belgrade (Serbian: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458 \u0443 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443 / Narodni muzej \u0443 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443) is the largest and oldest museum in Belgrade, Serbia. It is located in the central zone of Belgrade on a square plot between the Republic Square, formerly Theatre Square, and three streets: \u010cika Ljubina, Vasina and Laze Pa\u010dua. Its main facade is on the Republic Square and the official address ia 1a Republic Square.The museum was established on 10 May 1844. It moved into the present building in 1950, with the grand opening of the venue on 23 May 1952. Since its founding, the museum's collection has grown to over 400,000 objects, including many foreign masterpieces.The National Museum in Belgrade  building was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1979.\n\n\n== History ==\nBefore the erection of the building of the National Museum on this place was a famous tavern called \"Dardanelles\", meeting point of the cultural and artistic elite of the time. Demolition of the old tavern signified the beginning of the transformation of The Republic Square. The building which housed the most important museum of the Republic of Serbia today originally was built from 1902 to 1903, for the purpose of Fund Mortgage Bank, one of the oldest banking institutions of Belgrade. The building was constructed according to the design of architects Andra Stevanovi\u0107 and Nikola Nestorovi\u0107 after a competition on which they received the first prize. It was one of the first buildings in which was used some form of reinforced concrete for the foundation. Actually, during the digging foundation trenches, the various pits, wells and basements were encountered because of the proximity of the former Stambol Gate. The newly built two-storeyed building was a real palace of its time. Its volume conception designed in the form of a long solid block with domes over the central and lateral Rizal sites and academic fa\u00e7ade shape was based on the principles of neo-Renaissance style with neo-baroque elements on the domes. The greatest attention was given to the monumental staircase and the hall with bank windows which as the basic premises of a bank was given secondary importance. Almost three decades later, the increased development of Mortgage Bank, influenced a need for a reconstruction of the building. The extension was made without competition by architect Vojin Petrovi\u0107, who designed the added wing and atrium facing the street Laze Pa\u010du. The new part of the building contained the same elements of interior as the old part, and in the final image, the building got two monumental staircases and two halls with bank windows while only the upper floors form the continuous line of offices. During World War II Mortgage Bank building was bombed and the central part with the dome was destroyed. After the war, the building got a completely new purpose when one of the most important national cultural institutions moved in.\n\nSince its establishment during the Constitutionalist, until the end of the Second World War, the National Museum changed location several times. At a beginning, it was placed in Captain Mi\u0161a's building (1863) and soon after it was moved into two adjacent buildings which were destroyed during World War I. At the same time, the museum art collections were seized and looted by the invaders. During the interwar period, the Museum didn't get its own building. The museum was located in a rented private house at 58 Kneza Milo\u0161a street. In 1935 the New Royal Palac\u0435 became the residence of the museum and named the Royal Museum. Subsequently, it was renamed into the Museum of Prince Paul which consisted of Historical Museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art (founded in 1929), which merged in 1935. In 1948 the New Palace was restored and became the administrative seat of the Republic. For that purpose, the Museum was transferred into a building of the former Stock Exchange on Student Square, and partly to the Palace of Princess Ljubica.\nThe first architectural competition for the proper National Museum building planned to be on Ta\u0161majdan was announced the following year.\nThe author of the design was an architect Miladin Prljevic but the Cominiform disapproved of this idea. Then the museum was transferred into the building of Mortgage Bank. After World War II, the first renovation of the bank building was done by architect Dobroslav Pavlovic in 1950 but the overall reconstruction of the building was made 1965-1966 by architects Alexander Deroko, Petar Anagnosti and Zoran Petrovi\u0107. The central dome was restored and the central tract with offices and workspaces was lifted. After an adaptation, the original hall with bank windows was converted into a library. The originally main and monumental three-way staircase entrance from the Republic Square received an internal character while the other entrance from Vasina street became the main entrance to the Museum, which is connected directly to the other hall with bank windows was. In a functional arrangement, the building underwent upgrading doubling space and communications, while in terms of design, maintained the characteristic elements of 1902 and in terms of art as an integral unity. Interior renovation from the sixties of the 20th century was done in such a manner that it is not visible from the outside and it doesn't disturb the communications inside the museum.\n\n\n=== 2003\u20132018 reconstruction ===\nIn 2003, the permanent exhibition was dismantled and the building was closed for the impending reconstruction, but the process dragged on for years, including the gaps when nothing was done at all, and by January 2018 the museum was still not open.On 25 January 2012, after ten years of the National Museum in Belgrade being closed to the public, Vladimir Bogdanovi\u0107 of the leading Serbian newspaper/website Press wrote an article called A decade of cultural genocide against the Serbs, commenting on the need and importance of a working national museum. He also criticized the preservation of the art in the museum. The fa\u00e7ade was finished in 2015 and had to be reconstructed to its original look as the building is under the state protection. In mid-2016 the works on the interiors began. The entrance into the museum from the Vasina Street will remain the main entry point, while the exit doors that lead to the Square of the Republic, with its architectural staircase, will be adapted to be the exit point.The new permanent exhibit will represent the cultural development in this part of Europe from prehistory to the 20th century, with an emphasis on the Serbian cultural heritage. The 18th and 19th centuries art will be exhibited on the first floor, so as the 20th-century Yugoslav art. In the atrium of the building, there are vaults, left from the period when the venue served as a bank, which will be adapted into the exhibition depots. The look of the vault will be preserved and will serve for the presentation of the museum numismatic collection, from the beginning of the coin minting to the 20th century. In addition, a collection of the medallion art will be exhibited here, too.\n\nThe construction works should be finished by March 2018, when the preparation and setting of the collections should start.On 18 June 2018, 10 days before the scheduled opening, reporters from the daily Politika visited the museum. They reported that the venue doesn't look like something to be open in several days, and the employees confirmed that it would take at least six more months to complete everything, but that the museum will be open as scheduled. The reporters were not allowed to photograph everything. Even though the reconstruction projects, by architects Milan Rako\u010devi\u0107 and Vladimir Lojanica, envisioned several major changes (including the reconstruction of the glass roof and a dome destroyed during the heavy 1944 Allied Easter bombing of Belgrade), nothing was actually changed so after 15 years the building wasn't thoroughly reconstructed as announced, but only refurbished. This way the capacity of the exhibition space wasn't enlarged, so the permanent exhibition will have 3,000 pieces, out of 400,000.The large mural by Mladen Josi\u0107, painted in the 1930s and located on the wall of the mezzanine, was preserved. Josi\u0107 painted another mural, close to the former dome, but was destroyed in the 1944 bombing.  One of the remnants of the 1966 reconstruction, when the museum was managed by Lazar Trifunovi\u0107,  is a window decorated with the wrought iron. The window was originally facing outside until 1933 when the annex was added to the building.\n\n\n=== Re-opening ===\nThe National Museum was officially re-opened on 28 June 2018. The grand re-opening ceremony included projections on the building's facade, as well as a promotional video featuring famous Ukrainian ballet dancer Sergei Polunin.\n\n\n=== Today ===\nThe National Museum in Belgrade is a representative public building, monumental in size and volume, as well as its external shape and style. That is especially visible in the entrance area with twin columns and magnificent dome. All the facades characterized by polychrome ornaments neo-Renaissance origin. Monumentality is also reflected in the interior with rich decoration done by famous artists of the time: Andrea Domenico (also known as a painter of decorative wall painting that is in the interior of the building of the Old Palace), Franz Valdman and Bora Kovacevic.\nBecause of its architectural and cultural, urban and historical value building of the National Museum in Belgrade is established for the cultural heritage monument of great importance for the Republic of Serbia.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nThe Museum has 34 archeological, numismatic, artistic and historical collections today.\n\n\n=== Archeological collections ===\nThe main collection consists of sculptures from Vinca (6th\u20135th millennium BC) such as Lady of Vin\u010da and Lepenski Vir (7th millennium BC).\nThere are also numerous sculptures, weapons, helmets and other items from ancient Rome, 1005 items from ancient Greece and various items of Celtic origin.

Erih \u0160lomovi\u0107, a young Belgrader born at the turn of the 20th century, became in his youth the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the world's biggest art merchant, Ambroise Vollard. The connection led him to develop his own collection, comprising a total of 600 pieces by 1941.

      "name": "Branko's bridge",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Branko's bridge (Serbian: \u0411\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442, romanized: Brankov most) is the second-largest bridge (after Gazela) of Belgrade, Serbia, connecting the city center with New Belgrade across Sava river. Built in 1956 on the foundations of the 1934 King Alexander Bridge, which was destroyed in World War II, it reconnected Belgrade and Zemun as the only motorway bridge at the time. After several official and unofficial names, the present name stuck after the Brankova Street, which extends into the bridge from the direction of the old section of Belgrade.\n\n\n== Location ==\nOn the right (eastern) bank, the bridge starts at the Sava Port, above the Kara\u0111or\u0111eva Street, central street in the neighborhood of Savamala. The bridge is an extension of the Brankova Street, which delineates it from the neighborhood of Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac on the north and Zeleni Venac on the south. Through the Terazije tunnel, the Brankova connects it directly to downtown. On the left (western) bank, the bridge enters New Belgrade between the neighborhoods of Staro Sajmi\u0161te, on the south, and U\u0161\u0107e, on the north. It extends into the Bulevar Mihajla Pupina which, passing between the U\u0161\u0107e Tower and Hyatt Regency Belgrade Hotel, connects it with New Belgrade and continues to the neighborhood of Zemun.\n\n\n== Name ==\nOfficial name of the bridge during the communist rule was \"Brotherhood and unity bridge\" (Most bratstva i jedinstva), but that name never caught on. Citizens referred to it as the \"Savski most\" (Sava bridge), \"Zemunski most\" (Zemun bridge) and the \"bridge in Branko's street\", as the bridge is an extension of the Brankova street, named after Branko Radi\u010devi\u0107, Serbian romanticist poet. The latter name was colloquially shortened to Brankov most (Branko's bridge) and the name prevailed. Urban myth is that the bridge got its name after the writer, Branko \u0106opi\u0107, committed a suicide by jumping from the bridge in 1984.The official, administrative name is: Bridge across Sava in extension of Brankova Street.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe bridge was built in 1956, replacing the former chain-stayed King Alexander Bridge (built by a joint venture of Gutehoffnungsh\u00fctte and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Construction des Batignolles) that was opened on 16 December 1934 and blown up in 1941. The bridge actually uses lower parts of the former bridge's pylons (decorated by Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 with two couples of reinforced concrete in Serbo-Byzantium style) as outer constraints for its two secondary spans. It is 450 m (1,480 ft) long, made as continuous steel box girder, with central span of 261 m (856 ft) and side spans of 81 m (266 ft) each. It is crossed by nearly 90,000 vehicles daily, and traffic congestions are frequent.German company MAN is behind the original project of the bridge. Belgrade-based \"Mostprojekt\" company executed the project of doubling the bridge capacity in the 1970s. Head of the project team was Danilo Dragojevi\u0107. Since the works were finished in 1979, the bridge has dual carriageway with three lanes in both directions and actually consists of two separate constructions in each direction.In the Interbellum, the trams connected Belgrade to Zemun via King Alexander I bridge. After the war, in the 1950s, the general idea was that trolleybuses should take over the major role in the public transportation. Line to Zemun was opened in 1956, and in time three lines over the bridge were formed: Line 14 \u2013 Zeleni Venac-Gornji Grad (Zemun)  (which was considered a successor line to the pre-war tram line), Line 15 \u2013 Zeleni Venac-Novi Grad (Zemun) and Line 16 \u2013 Zeleni Venac-Pohorska, New Belgrade. The lines were closed in 1973. However, as of 2017, over 25 bus lines of public transport crosses the bridge.\n\n\n=== 2010s reconstruction ===\nIn the summer of 2013, the left pedestrian and bicycle path began to show signs of deterioration. Soon, the path was completely closed. City government for several years ignored the protests of citizens who wanted for the path to be repaired and open again. The administration claimed that there are no funds in the budget and that it appears the path can't be simply repaired. Instead, the entire left side had to be completely renovated. In the summer of 2015, Mayor of Belgrade Sini\u0161a Mali announced that city will fix the problem but the tender was announced in October 2016 and in November the \"Mostogradnja\" company was chosen.In the late February 2017 a 210 million dinars (\u20ac1.75 million) contract was signed with Mostogradnja. Mali claimed that the study was done in 2014 and that it showed the situation was worse than previously thought. However, only in June 2017, Mali announced \"preparatory works\". Deadline was set at 260 days since the beginning of the \"proper\" works. The repair began in early July 2017, four years after the path was closed, and the deadline was shortened to 180 days, but the mayor then shortened it even more, saying it will be finished by October or November 2017.Mali also announced that three shifts will be organized. Still in August, a month later, it was obvious that not much was happening on the bridge. Mali said that the city displaced the permit, but after the criticism, reconstruction was fastened. Mali announced new deadline, end of 2017, but few days later again changed it to 2\u20132,5 months. Despite the speedup, by October it was obvious that the bridge will not be finished by the end of the year. That same month, city manager Goran Vesi\u0107 announced that the bridge will be completely finished by the end of March 2018, or the originally planned 9 months. In the end, all lanes were open on 9 February 2018,, and, after five years, the works were fully finished and the pedestrian and bicycle path was open on 31 May 2018.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe decorative elements by Nikolay Krasnov on the remaining pylons from the King Alexander's Bridge survived both bombings, but were removed in the 1960s by the new authorities. In June 2020 it was announced that the decorative coats of arms will be recreated on the pylons.The bridge gained an infamous reputation as the suicide bridge. Some 40 people try to commit suicide jumping of the Branko's Bridge every year.\n\n\n=== House of Architecture ===\nIn the late 2010s, city administration announced plans for the Spanish House building, which is located almost under the bridge on the old Belgrade side, to be adapted into the House of Architecture. In 2019 the building was returned to its pre-World War II owners in the restitution process, so the city decided to use the massive pylon of the bridge instead. Inside the pylon, there is room for an exhibition space and artistic workshops on 400 m2 (4,300 sq ft) of space, on two levels.\n\n\n=== Police garage ===\nUnder the New Belgrade side of the bridge, there is an open air garage for the vehicles of the Ministry of the Interior. The parking lot covers an area of 3,000 m2 (32,000 sq ft) and is mostly used for the overused vehicles. In September 2019 it was announced that the area will be adapted into the Museum of the automobiles and the Museum of the Ministry of the Interior. Museum of the automobiles is currently located in downtown Belgrade, in the Majke Jevrosime Street, but the building in which it is located will be returned to the pre-World War II owners in the process of the Restitution.The larger area will allow for more than 50 cars to be exhibited, which is the number at the present museum. As the streets and paths in the neighboring U\u0161\u0107e neighborhood have been used for the rally races, they can be used also for the revue races organized by the museum. The new garage will be owned jointly by the city and the state. It is still not known whether the present garage embedded under the bridge will be just adapted or completely demolished and some other object will be built instead.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of bridges in Serbia\nTransport in Belgrade\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFanovi \"Stonsa\" opasno zaljuljali Brankov most Blic, 17 July 2007\nPolicija nije dala da ve\u010deraju na Brankovom mostu",

        "wiki": "The Monument to the Unknown Hero (Serbian: \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041d\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443 / Spomenik Neznanom junaku) is a World War I memorial located atop Mount Avala, south-east of Belgrade, Serbia, and designed by the sculptor Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107. Memorial was built in 1934-1938 on the place where an unknown Serbian World War I soldier was buried. It is similar to many other tombs of the unknown soldier built by the allies after the war. The \u017drnov fortress was previously located on the same place.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nOn the night of 13/14 October 1915, Combined squad of the Belgrade's Defense, held the line Avala-Zuce, defending it from the joint Austro-Hungarian and German offensive. Austro-Hungarian 9th Hill brigade of the 59th Division took the front rim of Avala on 16 October, with an assignment to push Serbian forces from the mountain. Austro-Hungarians were reinforced with one German half-battalion. However, one Serbian battalion successfully defended the top of Avala against the Austro-Hungarian battalions of the 49th and 84th regiments, aided by the 204th German reserve infantry regiment. On the same day, the command of the Belgrade's Defense ordered the retreat to the new positions so on 17 October occupational forces reached the southern section of Avala, conquering the entire mountain. Their soldiers then buried Serbian combatants who were killed in action. In the valley, below \u017drnov, on the grave of one of them, they placed a wooden cross with the inscription in German: \"One unknown Serbian soldier\".\n\n\n== Predecessor ==\nIn the late 1920, a popular news topic in Serbia was the burial of the French \"unknown soldier\" in Panth\u00e9on. As the French influence was very strong on Serbian army since the mid-19th century, the idea of doing the same spread among the veterans and social associations, reaching the National Assembly. Existing commemorative cross from 1915 was known only locally and to the Avala visitors. In the first half of 1921 the initiative to build a more dignified commemorative mark gained momentum. On 24 June 1921, president of the Constitutional Assembly, Ivan Ribar, summoned state dignitaries to the meeting with the agenda of constructing the monument. Present at the meeting, among others, were the general and the former defense minister Mihailo Ra\u0161i\u0107, Rector of the University of Belgrade Bogdan Gavrilovi\u0107, mayor of Belgrade Dobra Mitrovi\u0107 and manager of the National Theatre in Belgrade Milan Grol. It was decided that the future monument will be \"dignified...but humble\".First step was to determine whether it was indeed a Serbian soldier in the grave under the wooden cross. An exhumation was conducted by the commission on 23 November 1921. Parts of the grenade are found under the skull, almost as a pillow, while the skeleton had the blown left side of the chest, so it is estimated that he was killed by the Austro-Hungarian howitzer while he was watching from the lookout. He was apparently buried in the crater formed by the explosion of the very grenade that killed him. Other objects found in the grave include: parts of the military blouse, Serbian bandolier (belt with fi\u0161eklijas, the powder pockets, full of ammunition), knapsack, military boots with telephone wires instead of the shoe laces, a wallet with three coins: two 1904 Serbian coins of 2 dinars, with the profile of King Peter I of Serbia, and one coin of 1 groschen (that is, 20 paras from 1912) and a piece of paper, barely recognizable, which is suspected to be a 10 dinars banknote from 1908. The soldier had no identity badge which suggests that he was either member of the Third Call regiments (with soldiers over 38 years old) or was drafted immediately prior to the battle which is probably correct as  the skeletal remains pointed out to a very young male, no older than 19-20 years. Some sources actually claim he was only 15. It was said that his skull was \"small, like of a boy\" and that skeleton was petite, of a boyish, thin stature. The ammunition was Russian (Tula Arms Plant, 1906), 7.62 mm \u00d7 57 mm (0.300 in \u00d7 2.244 in), which means that he used the riffle Mosin\u2013Nagant M1891. The boots were American, M-1910, mostly distributed to the members of the Personnel department and, to the lesser extent, to the regiments of the First Call (which drafted the youngest soldiers, up to 31 years old). The commission concluded that the remains do belong to the Serbian soldier and reburied him, with the grenade parts, while his personal belongings were taken to the cabinet of the president of the assembly for safekeeping.Assembly Board organized many events in 1922 in order to gather the funding for the monument, but also used the other means for the promotional purposes, like the cinema shows. Also, some more prominent events are used, like the Christmas money collecting by the Patriarch Dimitrije or the wedding of King Alexander I and Queen Maria on 8 June 1922. Not having much faith in the politicians and expecting that they would drag the process, local administration organized the construction in 1922. As the railway was being built in the area (Top\u010dider-Mala Krsna), the Yugoslav Railways donated all the needed materials. When the Board found out that the locals are building their own monument, conceptually completely different from their idea, Ivan Ribar held talks with the local administration and an agreement was reached that this monument will be a \"temporary solution\". The monument was built near the place where an earlier monument to the unknown soldier was built. It was projected by Milan Mini\u0107 and the construction began on 1 April 1922. The monument was built by the local villagers, aided by the engineers and workers from the Rakovica railway section. The monument was finished on 14 May 1922 and publicly dedicated on 1 June 1922. The base was a two-leveled square pedestal with a regular, four-sided pyramid made of the roughly dressed stone. The base of the pyramid was 3 m \u00d7 3 m (9.8 ft \u00d7 9.8 ft) and it was 5 m (16 ft) tall. Four jardini\u00e8res were leaned on each side of the pyramid, with the seedlings of the common box. They were hexagonally shaped and also made of the roughly dressed stone. On top of the pyramid a six-armed cross was placed. On the eastern side of the pedestal a plate was placed with the inscription: \"To the fallen heroes in the wars for liberation and unification 1912-1918, this monument is erected by the thankful people of the Vra\u010dar District. Consecrated on 1 June 1922\". On the other three side the inscriptions simply said \"cross (made) of Carrara marble\". On the western side of the horizontal arm of the cross another inscription read: \"Unknown Serbian soldier confirmed by the commission on 29 November 1921\". The monument was encircled by 16 short stone pillars, 4 on each side, connected with chains. Remains of the unknown soldier were placed in the metal coffin and walled in the monument, together with the small wooden case in the colors of the Serbian flag containing the grenade parts, and remains of another three unidentified soldiers which were discovered in the foothills of Avala. Among the dignitaries at the dedication of the monument were Ivan Ribar, other senior politicians from the Assembly, presidents of the surrounding municipalities and districts and several government ministers. King Alexander visited the location later that same day.On 28 June 1938, when the new monument was finished, the remains of the unknown soldier were taken from the old coffin, washed in white wine, wrapped in white linen and placed in the new metal coffin which was moved to the crypt inside the new monument. Remains of the other three soldiers were placed in the memorial ossuary in Belgrade Fortress. Personal belongings of the soldier were handed over to the Military Museum, also on the Fortress, but they disappeared later. The old monument was completely demolished, except for the six-armed cross which was moved to the churchyard of the Church of Saint Mary Magdalene in Beli Potok, where it is still located.\n\n\n== Monument ==\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe construction of the new monument was ordered by King Alexander to commemorate the victims of the Balkan Wars (1912\u20131913) and the World War I (1914-1918). The monument was designed by Croatian sculptor Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107, and the main engineer was Stevan \u017divanovi\u0107. Members of the Yugoslav Royal Army and Navy took part in processing and mounting the blocks. King Alexander I of Yugoslavia laid the foundation stone for the new monument on 28 June 1934, just few months before he was assassinated in Marseilles. Before the construction of the new monument started in 1934, the ancient fortified town of \u017drnov was located atop the Avala mountain. It was then demolished by dynamite to free the space for the new monument.The building of the new monument wasn't without the controversy. Public was against the demolition of the old \u017drnov town, while the especially vocal was the author Branislav  Nu\u0161i\u0107. He also protested that the monument is so distant from Belgrade, which would prevent the citizens to pay their respect. Nu\u0161i\u0107 wrote: \"to Avala go only the wealthy men who have cars, bringing their mistresses with them\". However, King Alexander was adamant that the monument has to be built on Avala, stating \"either there or nowhere\", while Nu\u0161i\u0107 proposed one of the central city squares, Republic Square, close to the modern Staklenac shopping center. Ironically, on that section of the square, today known as the Plateau of Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107, actually the monument to Branislav  Nu\u0161i\u0107 was erected.The Monument to the Unknown Hero was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1987, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. The surrounding area around the monument was landscaped in 2006.The decorative lights were out of use since the early 1990s. Reconstruction of the light system is to be finished in late February 2019. Over 100 lanterns will be placed around the monument, access paths and the plateau surrounding the monument. Of those, 14 are reflectors lighting the monument itself. They are arranged based on the original project by Me\u0161trovi\u0107. Following his ideas from 1938, the poles will be decorated later in the year, to resemble the burning torch-shaped candelabra.\n\n\n=== Design ===\nThe monument is in the form of a sarcophagus made of black granite from Jablanica. The sarcophagus in surrounded by caryatids representing all the peoples of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. They represent Bosnian, Montenegrin, Dalmatian, Croatian, Slovenian, Vojvodina\u2019s, Serbian and South Serbian women. The top of the sarcophagus is marked with an inscription reading \"Alexander I King of Yugoslavia to the Unknown Hero\". The monument is 14.5 metres (48 ft) high, and 36 metres (118 ft) in length, while the stairs from the approaching side are 93 metres (305 ft) long. The tomb with the remains of the unknown hero is located in the crypt (underground room) in the base of the monument. The tomb is marked only by the date \"1912-1918\", the duration of the Balkan Wars and World War I.\n\nThere is also a deeper symbolism of the complex. The monument is placed on the five-step pyramid, which symbolizes five centuries of Ottoman occupation of Serbia. Caryatids actually represent mothers of the fallen soldiers, who are keeping the peace and sanctity of the burial place. The monument is also one of the rare such venues which is located outside of the town center. King Alexander wanted to transform the top of the Avala into the replica of the Kajmak\u010dalan mountain which gained almost mythical importance after the 1916 Battle of Kaymakchalan between Serbia and Bulgaria, and was euphemistically called \"Gate of the Homeland\" or the \"Altar of the Motherland\". The monument was to represent the relocated commemorative chapel from Kajmak\u010dalan and even plants which grow on that mountain, or resemble it, were planted around the monument. During the 1934-1938 period when the monument was built, the surrounding area was also forested with the specific species of conifers. They were specifically ordered from the botanical garden in Munich, Germany. A certain number of trees was donated to Yugoslavia personally by Adolf Hitler.\n\n\n== Identity speculation ==\nBased on the examination in 1921 and the properties discovered, it wasn't possible to identify the soldier or even to conclude in which unit he served. Several historians from Belgrade and Sarajevo have claimed that the unknown hero is a Bosniak named Sulejman Bali\u0107, a soldier from Duga Poljana, a town between Novi Pazar and Sjenica, that fought in the Serbian army against Austria-Hungary. But as the evidence suggest, the soldier was drafted immediately prior to the battle in October 1915, as he didn't receive the ID badge, so this claim is unlikely.\n\n\n== Ceremonies ==\nThe monument is used for the official commemorations of the important historic dates. The President, Prime Minister and other officials visit the monument for the wreath-laying ceremony on dates like the Statehood Day (15 February), Victory Day (9 May), and 15 September, the date when the Macedonian front was broken through in 1918.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMonument of Culture of Exceptional Importance\nTourism in Serbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External sources ==\nTuci\u0107, Hajna (2008).

        "wiki": "Belgrade ( BEL-grayd; Serbian: Beograd / \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, lit. 'White City', pronounced [be\u01d2\u0261rad] (listen); names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of Serbia. It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula. Nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade, a quarter of the total population of Serbia.One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vin\u010da culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and, after 279 BC, Celts settled the city, naming it Singid\u016bn. It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284. Belgrade served as capital of the Serbian Despotate during the reign of Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, and then his successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the Ottoman Empire during the siege in 1456 have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars. \nIn the period after the Serbian Revolution, Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when it was attached to the city, due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming the part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes after World War I. Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia from its creation in 1918 to its dissolution in 2006. In a fatally strategic position, the city has been battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times, being bombed five times and besieged many times.Being Serbia's primate city, Belgrade has special administrative status within Serbia. It is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and government ministries, as well as home of almost all of the largest Serbian companies, media, and scientific institutions. Belgrade is classified as a Beta-Global City. The city is home to the Clinical Centre of Serbia, one of the hospital complexes with the largest capacity in the world, and the Church of Saint Sava, one of the largest Orthodox church buildings. Belgrade hosted major international events such as the first Non-Aligned Movement Summit (1961), the first major gathering of the OSCE (1977\u20131978), Eurovision Song Contest (2008), as well as sports events such as the first FINA World Aquatics Championships (1973), UEFA Euro (1976), Summer Universiade (2009) and EuroBasket three-times.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nChipped stone tools found in Zemun show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools are of Mousterian industry\u2014belonging to Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered near the area, indicating some settlement between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic Star\u010devo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Star\u010devo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Star\u010devo. The Star\u010devo culture was succeeded by the Vin\u010da culture (5500\u20134500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Star\u010devo settlements and also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo). The Vin\u010da culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe. Also associated with the Vin\u010da culture are anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vin\u010da, the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe, and a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans known as the Old European script, which dates back to around 5300 BC. Within the city proper, on Cetinjska Street, a skull of a Paleolithic human was discovered in 1890. The skull is dated to before 5000 BC.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nEvidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from a variety of ancient myths and legends. The ridge overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, for example, has been identified as one of the places in the story of Jason and the Argonauts. In the time of antiquity, too, the area was populated by Paleo-Balkan tribes, including the Thracians and the Dacians, who ruled much of Belgrade's surroundings. Specifically, Belgrade was at one point inhabited by the Thraco-Dacian tribe Singi; following Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci wrested the city from their hands, naming it Singid\u016bn (d|\u016bn, fortress). In 34\u201333 BC, the Roman army, led by Silanus, reached Belgrade. It became the romanised Singidunum in the 1st century AD and, by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a municipium by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged colonia (the highest city class) by the end of the century. While the first Christian Emperor of Rome \u2014Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great\u2014was born in the territory of Naissus to the city's south, Roman Christianity's champion, Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), was born in Singidunum. Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate. In 395 AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun); the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 442, the area was ravaged by Attila the Hun. In 471, it was taken by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, who continued into Italy. As the Ostrogoths left, another Germanic tribe, the Gepids, invaded the city. In 539 it was retaken by the Byzantines. In 577, some 100,000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum, pillaging cities and more permanently settling the region. The Avars, under Bayan I, conquered the whole region and its new Slavic population by 582. Following Byzantine reconquest, the Byzantine chronicle De Administrando Imperio mentions the White Serbs, who had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home, asking the strategos for lands; they received provinces in the west, towards the Adriatic, which they would rule as subjects to Heraclius (610\u2013641). In 829, Khan Omurtag was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire.The first record of the name Belograd appeared on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal missive to Bulgarian ruler Boris I. This name would appear in several variants: Alba Bulgarica in Latin, Griechisch Weissenburg in High German, N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, and Castelbianco in Venetian, among other names, all variations of 'white fortress'. For about four centuries, the city would become a battleground between the Byzantine Empire, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and the Bulgarian Empire. Basil II (976\u20131025) installed a garrison in Belgrade. The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade, but, while passing through during the Third Crusade, Frederick Barbarossa and his 190,000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins.\nKing Stefan Dragutin (r. 1276\u20131282) received Belgrade from his father-in-law, Stephen V of Hungary, in 1284, and it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Syrmia, a vassal state to the Kingdom of Hungary. Dragutin (Hungarian: Dragutin Istv\u00e1n) is regarded as the first Serbian king to rule over Belgrade.Following the battles of Maritsa (1371) and Kosovo field (1389), Moravian Serbia, to Belgrade's south, began to fall to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe northern sections of what is now Serbia persisted as the Serbian Despotate, with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, the son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107. Lazarevi\u0107 built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and the west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist Ottoman conquest for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 people.In 1427, Stefan's successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107, returning Belgrade to the Hungarian king, made Smederevo his new capital. Even though the Ottomans had captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456. As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule and Austrian invasions ===\n\nSeven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by Suleiman the Magnificent, 250,000 Turkish soldiers, and over 100 ships. Subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest. Belgrade was made the seat of the Pashalik of Belgrade (also known as the Sanjak of Smederevo), and quickly became the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople. Ottoman rule introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, and the city was resurrected\u2014now by Oriental influences. In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vra\u010dar plateau; in the 20th century, the church of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.Occupied by the Habsburgs three times (1688\u20131690, 1717\u20131739, 1789\u20131791), headed by the Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy, and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon, respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time. During this period, the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations, in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by two Serbian Patriarchs, retreated together with the Austrian soldiers into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's Vojvodina and Slavonia.\n\n\n=== Principality of Serbia ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population. Traces of Ottoman rule and architecture\u2014such as mosques and bazaars, were to remain a prominent part of Belgrade's townscape into the 19th century; several decades, even, after Serbia was granted autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.During the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans. After the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Serbia achieved some sort of sovereignty, which was formally recognised by the Porte in 1830.The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of neoclassicist and baroque buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by St Michael's Cathedral (Serbian: Saborna crkva), completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular Romanticism, along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an eclecticist style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.\n\nIn 1841, Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 moved the capital of the Principality of Serbia from Kragujevac to Belgrade. During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (mahalas). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pa\u0161ina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pa\u0161ina, Bajram-begova and Laz Had\u017ei-Mahmudova. Following the \u010cukur Fountain incident, Belgrade was bombed by the Ottomans.On 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from Kalemegdan. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's de facto independence dates from this event. In the following years, urban planner Emilijan Josimovi\u0107 had a significant impact on Belgrade. He conceptualised a regulation plan for the city in 1867, in which he proposed the replacement of the town's crooked streets with a grid plan. Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimovi\u0107's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul\u2014the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia de jure still belonged\u2014underwent similar changes.In May 1868, knez Mihailo was assassinated with his cousin Anka Konstantinovi\u0107 while riding in a carriage in his country residence.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Serbia ===\n\nWith the Principality's full independence in 1878 and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly. Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to Ni\u0161, Serbia's second city. In 1900, the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants (at the time Serbia numbered 2.5 million). Still, by 1905, the population had grown to more than 80,000 and, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, disregarding Zemun, which still belonged to Austria-Hungary.The first-ever projection of motion pictures in the Balkans and Central Europe was held in Belgrade in June 1896 by Andr\u00e9 Carr, a representative of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers. He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have not been preserved. The first permanent cinema was opened in 1909 in Belgrade.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nThe First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. Austro-Hungarian monitors shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the Austro-Hungarian Army under General Oskar Potiorek on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by Serbian troops under Marshal Radomir Putnik. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, starting on 6 October 1915, Belgrade fell to German and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen on 9 October of the same year. The city was liberated by Serbian and French troops on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey of France and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Belgrade, decimated as a front-line city, lost the title of largest city in the Kingdom to Subotica for some time.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n\nAfter the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom was split into banovinas and Belgrade, together with Zemun and Pan\u010devo, formed a separate administrative unit.During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (with the inclusion of Zemun), and to 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in 1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. The Pan\u010devo Bridge, which crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935, while King Alexander Bridge over the Sava was opened in 1934. On 3 September 1939 the first Belgrade Grand Prix, the last Grand Prix motor racing race before the outbreak of World War II, was held around the Belgrade Fortress and was followed by 80,000 spectators. The winner was Tazio Nuvolari.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 25 March 1941, the government of regent Crown Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'\u00e9tat led by Air Force commander General Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107, who proclaimed King Peter II to be of age to rule the realm. As a result, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941, killing up to 2,274 people. Yugoslavia was then invaded by German, Italian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian forces. Belgrade was captured by subterfuge, with six German soldiers led by their officer Fritz Klingenberg feigning threatening size, forcing the city to capitulate. Belgrade was more directly occupied by the German Army in the same month and became the seat of the puppet Nedi\u0107 regime, headed by its namesake general. Some of today's parts of Belgrade were incorporated in the Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslavia, another puppet state, where Ustashe regime  carried out the Genocide of Serbs.During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz B\u00f6hme, the German Military Governor of Serbia. B\u00f6hme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. Belgrade became the first city in Europe to be declared by the Nazi occupation forces to be Judenfrei. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major \u017darko Todorovi\u0107 from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.Just like Rotterdam, which was devastated twice by both German and Allied bombing, Belgrade was bombed once more during World War II, this time by the Allies on 16 April 1944, killing at least 1,100 people. This bombing fell on the Orthodox Christian Easter. Most of the city remained under German occupation until 20 October 1944, when it was liberated by the Red Army and the Communist Yugoslav Partisans. On 29 November 1945, Marshal Josip Broz Tito proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade (later to be renamed to Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 7 April 1963). Higher estimates from the former secret police place the victim count of political persecutions in Belgrade at 10,000.\n\n\n=== Socialist Yugoslavia ===\nWhen the war ended, the city was left with 11,500 demolished housing units. During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the renewed Yugoslavia, developing as a major industrial centre. In 1948, construction of New Belgrade started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of Non-Aligned Countries was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built. In 1968, major student protests led to several street clashes between students and the police.In 1972, Belgrade faced smallpox outbreak, the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe since World War II. Between October 1977 and March 1978, the city hosted the first major gathering of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe with the aim of implementing the Helsinki Accords from, while in 1980 Belgrade hosted the UNESCO General Conference. Josip Broz Tito died in May 1980 and his funeral in Belgrade was attended by high officials and state delegations from 128 of the 154 members of the United Nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain, based on which it became one of the largest funerals in history.\n\n\n=== Breakup of Yugoslavia ===\n\nOn 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 were held in the city against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets to restore order. Many anti-war protests were held in Belgrade, while the most massive protests was dedicated to solidarity with the victims from the besieged Sarajevo. Further anti-government protests were held in Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud in local elections. These protests brought Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who did not belong to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia.In 1999, during the Kosovo War, NATO bombings caused damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were various ministry buildings, the RTS building, hospitals, Hotel Jugoslavija, the Central Committee building, Avala Tower, and the Chinese embassy. After the Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe, while more than third settled in Belgrade.After the 2000 presidential elections, Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people on the streets. These demonstrations resulted in the ousting of president Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as a part of the Otpor! movement.\n\n\n=== Modern Belgrade ===\n\nIn 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, an urban renewal project, was initiated by the Government of Serbia and its Emirati partner, Eagle Hills Properties. Aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy, the project hopes to revitalise the Sava amphitheatre, a neglected expanse on the right bank of the Sava river between the Belgrade Fair and the former Belgrade Main railway station. Around \u20ac3.5 billion will be jointly invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and the envisioned 'Belgrade Tower'. The project is, however, quite controversial\u2014there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, and its architecture's arguable lack of harmony with the rest of the city.\nApart from Belgrade Waterfront, the city is under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of Novi Beograd, where many apartment and office buildings are under construction to support the burgeoning IT sector, now one of Serbia's largest economic players.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBelgrade lies 116.75 metres (383.0 ft) above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, Kalemegdan, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, New Belgrade was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like Krnja\u010da, Kote\u017e and Bor\u010da, also merged with the city, while Pan\u010devo, a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of 360 square kilometres (140 sq mi), while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223 km2 (1,244 sq mi).\nOn the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m (994 ft). The mountains of Avala (511 m (1,677 ft)) and Kosmaj (628 m (2,060 ft)) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus.One of the characteristics of the city terrain is mass wasting. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. Downhill creeps are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the clay or loam soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in Karaburma, Zvezdara, Vi\u0161njica, Vin\u010da and Ritopek, in the Danube valley, and Umka, and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire Terazije slope above the Sava (Kalemegdan, Savamala), which can be seen by the inclination of the Pobednik monument and the tower of the Cathedral Church, and the Vo\u017edovac section, between Banjica and Autokomanda.\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardo\u0161, \u0106ukovac and Kalvarija. \n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBelgrade has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), according to K\u00f6ppen climate classification, with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from 1.4 \u00b0C (34.5 \u00b0F) in January to 23.0 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.5 \u00b0C (54.5 \u00b0F). There are, on average, 31 days a year when the temperature is above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and 95 days when the temperature is above 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Belgrade receives about 691 millimetres (27 in) of precipitation a year, with late spring being wettest. The average annual number of sunny hours is 2,112.\nThe highest officially recorded temperature in Belgrade was 43.6 \u00b0C (110.5 \u00b0F) on 24 July 2007, while on the other end, the lowest temperature was \u221226.2 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) on 10 January 1893.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nBelgrade is a separate territorial unit in Serbia, with its own autonomous city authority. The Assembly of the City of Belgrade has 110 members, elected on four-year terms. A 13-member City Council, elected by the Assembly and presided over by the mayor and his deputy, has the control and supervision of the city administration, which manages day-to-day administrative affairs. It is divided into 14 Secretariats, each having a specific portfolio such as traffic or health care, and several professional services, agencies and institutes.The 2014 Belgrade City Assembly election was won by the Serbian Progressive Party, which formed a ruling coalition with the Socialist Party of Serbia. This election ended the long-time rule of the Democratic Party, which was in power from 2004 to 2013.As the capital city, Belgrade is seat of all Serbian state authorities \u2013 executive, legislative, judiciary, and the headquarters of almost all national political parties as well as 75 diplomatic missions. This includes the National Assembly, the Presidency, the Government of Serbia and all the ministries, Supreme Court of Cassation and the Constitutional Court.\n\n\n=== Municipalities ===\n\nThe city is divided into 17 municipalities. Previously, they were classified into 10 urban (lying completely or partially within borders of the city proper) and 7 suburban municipalities, whose centres are smaller towns. With the new 2010 City statute, they were all given equal status, with the proviso that suburban ones (except Sur\u010din) have certain autonomous powers, chiefly related with construction, infrastructure and public utilities.Most of the municipalities are situated on the southern side of the Danube and Sava rivers, in the \u0160umadija region. Three municipalities (Zemun, Novi Beograd, and Sur\u010din), are on the northern bank of the Sava in the Syrmia region and the municipality of Palilula, spanning the Danube, is in both the \u0160umadija and Banat regions.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, the city has a population of 1,166,763, while the urban area of Belgrade (with adjacent urban settlements of Bor\u010da, Ov\u010da, and Sur\u010din included) has 1,233,796 inhabitants, and the population of the metropolitan area (the administrative area of the City of Belgrade) stands at 1,659,440 people.\nBelgrade is home to many ethnicities from across the former Yugoslavia and the wider Balkans region. The main ethnic groups are: Serbs (1,505,448), Roma (27,325), Montenegrins (9,902), Yugoslavs (8,061), Croats (7,752), Macedonians (6,970), and Muslims by nationality (3,996). Many people came to the city as economic migrants from smaller towns and the countryside, while tens of thousands arrived as refugees from Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, as a result of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.Between 10,000 and 20,000 Chinese people are estimated to live in Belgrade and, since their arrival in the mid-1990s, Block 70 in New Belgrade has been known colloquially as the Chinese quarter. Many Middle Easterners, mainly from Syria, Iran, Jordan and Iraq, arrived in order to pursue their studies during the 1970s and 1980s, and have remained in the city. Throughout the 19th and early 20th century, small communities of Aromanians, Czechs, Greeks, Germans, Hungarians, Jews, Turks, Armenians and Russian White \u00e9migr\u00e9s also existed in Belgrade. There are two suburban settlements with significant minority population today: Ov\u010da and the village of Boljevci, both with about one quarter of their population being Romanians and Slovaks, respectively.\n\n Although there are several historic religious communities in Belgrade, the religious makeup of the city is relatively homogeneous. The Serbian Orthodox community is by far the largest, with 1,475,168 adherents. There are also 31,914 Muslims, 13,720 Roman Catholics, and 3,128 Protestants.\nThere once was a significant Jewish community in Belgrade but, following the World War II Nazi occupation of the city and subsequent Jewish emigration, their numbers have fallen from over 10,000 to just 295. Belgrade also used to have one of the largest Buddhist colonies in Europe outside Russia when some 400 mostly Buddhist Kalmyks settled on the outskirts of Belgrade following the Russian Civil War. Most of them moved away after the World War II and their temple, Belgrade pagoda, was abandoned and eventually demolished.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n \nBelgrade is the financial centre of Serbia and Southeast Europe, with a total of 17 million square metres (180 million square feet) of office space. It is also home to the country's Central Bank. Over 700,000 people are employed in 120,286 companies, 60,000 enterprises and 50,000 shops. The City of Belgrade itself owns 267,147 square metres (2,875,550 square feet) of rentable office space.\n\nAs of 2019, Belgrade contained 31.4% of Serbia's employed population and generated over 40.4% of its GDP. The city's nominal GDP in 2014 was estimated at 16.97 billion USD, amounting to 859,329 RSD ($10,086) per capita. City GDP in 2019 at purchasing power parity was estimated at $52.1bn USD, which was $32,572 per capita in terms of purchasing power parity.New Belgrade is the country's Central business district and one of Southeastern Europe's financial centres. It offers a range of facilities, such as hotels, congress halls (e.g. Sava Centar), Class A and B office buildings, and business parks (e.g. Airport City Belgrade). Over  1.2 million square metres (13 million square feet) of land is under construction in New Belgrade, with the value of planned construction over the next three years estimated at over 1.5 billion euros. The Belgrade Stock Exchange is also located in New Belgrade, and has a market capitalisation of \u20ac6.5 billion (US$7.1 billion).\nWith 6,924 companies in the IT sector (according to 2013 data), Belgrade is one of the foremost information technology hubs in Southeast Europe. Microsoft's 'Development Center Serbia', located in Belgrade was, at the time of its establishment, the fifth such programme on the globe. Many global IT companies choose Belgrade as their European or regional centre of operations, such as Asus, Intel, Dell, Huawei, Nutanix, NCR etc. The most famous Belgrade IT startups, among others, are Nordeus, ComTrade Group, MicroE, FishingBooker, and Endava. IT facilities in the city include the Mihajlo Pupin Institute and the ILR, as well as the brand-new IT Park Zvezdara. Many prominent IT innovators began their careers in Belgrade, including Voja Antoni\u0107 and Veselin Jevrosimovi\u0107.\nIn September 2013, the average Belgrade monthly salary stood at 53,564 RSD ($635) in net terms, with the gross equivalent at 73,970 RSD ($877). The 2013 Annual Economist Intelligence Unit Survey ranked Belgrade the 86th most expensive out of 131 world cities. According to the 2015 Survey, 73% of the city's households owned a computer, 65.8% had a broadband internet connection and 73.9% had pay television services.According Cushman & Wakefield, Knez Mihajlova street is 36th most expensive retail street in the world in terms of renting commercial space.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nLong cut off from the international movements, Belgrade is a hub for contemporary art in Europe once again. According to BBC, Belgrade is one of five most creative cities in the world.\nBelgrade hosts many annual international cultural events, including the Film Festival, Theatre Festival, Summer Festival, BEMUS, Belgrade Early Music Festival, Book Fair, Eurovision Song Contest 2008, and the Beer Fest. The Nobel Prize winning author Ivo Andri\u0107 wrote his most famous work, The Bridge on the Drina, in Belgrade. Other prominent Belgrade authors include Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107, Milo\u0161 Crnjanski, Borislav Peki\u0107, Milorad Pavi\u0107 and Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107. The most internationally prominent artists from Belgrade are Charles Simic, Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Milovan Destil Markovi\u0107.\nMost of Serbia's film industry is based in Belgrade. FEST is an annual film festival that held since 1971, and, through 2013, had been attended by four million people and had presented almost 4,000 films.The city was one of the main centres of the Yugoslav new wave in the 1980s: VIS Idoli, Ekatarina Velika, \u0160arlo Akrobata and Elektri\u010dni Orgazam were all from Belgrade. Other notable Belgrade rock acts include Riblja \u010corba, Bajaga i Instruktori and Partibrejkers. Today, it is the centre of the Serbian hip hop scene, with acts such as Beogradski Sindikat, \u0160kabo, Mar\u010delo, and most of the Bassivity Music stable hailing from or living in the city. There are numerous theatres, the most prominent of which are National Theatre, Theatre on Terazije, Yugoslav Drama Theatre, Zvezdara Theatre, and Atelier 212. The Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts is also based in Belgrade, as well as the National Library of Serbia. Other major libraries include the Belgrade City Library and the Belgrade University Library. Belgrade's two opera houses are: National Theatre and Madlenianum Opera House.There are many foreign cultural institutions in Belgrade, including the Spanish Instituto Cervantes, the German Goethe-Institut and the French Institut fran\u00e7ais, which are all located in the central pedestrian area of Knez Mihailova Street.

The museum was closed in 2007, but has since been reopened in 2017 to focus on the modern as well as on the Yugoslav art scenes.\nArtist Marina Abramovi\u0107, who was born in Belgrade, held an exhibition in the Museum of Contemporary Art, which the New York Times described as one of the most important cultural happenings in the world in 2019. The exhibition was seen by almost 100,000 visitors. Marina Abramovi\u0107 made a stage speech and performance in front of 20,000 people.The Military Museum, established in 1878 in Kalemegdan, houses a wide range of more than 25,000 military objects dating from the prehistoric to the medieval to the modern eras. Notable items include Turkish and oriental arms, national banners, and Yugoslav Partisan regalia.The Museum of Aviation in Belgrade located near Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport has more than 200 aircraft, of which about 50 are on display, and a few of which are the only surviving examples of their type, such as the Fiat G.50.

The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions.\n\nThe oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish t\u00fcrbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dor\u0107ol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Serbo-Byzantine Revival are present in buildings such as House of Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gra\u010danica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.In the socialist period, housing was built quickly and cheaply for the huge influx of people fleeing the countryside following World War II, sometimes resulting in the brutalist architecture of the blokovi ('blocks') of New Belgrade; a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Trade Union Hall. However, in the mid-1950s, modernist trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture.\nBelgrade has the second oldest sewer system in Europe. The Clinical Centre of Serbia spreads over 34 hectares and consists of about 50 buildings, while also has 3,150 beds considered to be the highest number in Europe, and among highest in the world.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nLying on the main artery connecting Europe and Asia, as well as, eventually, the Orient Express, Belgrade has been a popular place for travellers through the centuries. \nIn 1843, on Dubrova\u010dka Street (today Kralj Petar Street ), Serbia's knez Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 built a large edifice which became the first hotel in Belgrade: Kod jelena ('at the deer's'), in the neighbourhood of Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac. Many criticised the move at the time due to the cost and the size of the building, and it soon became the gathering point of the Principality's wealthiest citizens. Colloquially, the building was also referred to as the staro zdanje, or the 'old edifice'. It remained a hotel until 1903 before being demolished in 1938. After the staro zdanje, numerous hotels were built in the second half of the 19th century: Nacional and Grand, also in Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac, Srpski Kralj, Srpska Kruna, Gr\u010dka Kraljica near Kalemegdan, Balkan and Pariz in Terazije, London, etc.As Belgrade became connected via steamboats and railway (after 1884), the number of visitors grew and new hotels were open with the ever luxurious commodities. In Savamala, the hotels Bosna and Bristol were opened. Other hotels included Solun and Orient, which was built near the Financial Park. Tourists which arrived by the Orient Express mostly stayed at the Petrograd Hotel in Wilson Square. Hotel Srpski Kralj, at the corner of Uzun Mirkova and Pariska Street was considered the best hotel in Belgrade during the Interbellum. It was destroyed during World War II.The historic areas and buildings of Belgrade are among the city's premier attractions. They include Skadarlija, the National Museum and adjacent National Theatre, Zemun, Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 Square, Terazije, Students' Square, the Kalemegdan Fortress, Knez Mihailova Street, the Parliament, the Church of Saint Sava, and the Old Palace. On top of this, there are many parks, monuments, museums, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and shops on both sides of the river. The hilltop Avala Monument and Avala Tower offer views over the city. According The Guuardian, Dorcol is the one of top ten coolest suburbs and in Europe.Elite neighbourhood of Dedinje is situated near the Top\u010dider and Ko\u0161utnjak parks. The Beli dvor (White Palace), house of royal family Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, is open for visitors. The palace has many valuable artworks. Nearby, Josip Broz Tito's mausoleum, called The House of Flowers, documents the life of the former Yugoslav president.\n\nAda Ciganlija is a former island on the Sava River, and Belgrade's biggest sports and recreational complex. Today it is connected with the right bank of the Sava via two causeways, creating an artificial lake. It is the most popular destination for Belgraders during the city's hot summers. There are 7 kilometres (4 miles) of long beaches and sports facilities for various sports including golf, football, basketball, volleyball, rugby union, baseball, and tennis. During summer there are between 200,000 and 300,000 bathers daily.\n\nExtreme sports are available, such as bungee jumping, water skiing, and paintballing. There are numerous tracks on the island, where it is possible to ride a bike, go for a walk, or go jogging. Apart from Ada, Belgrade has total of 16 islands on the rivers, many still unused. Among them, the Great War Island, at the confluence of Sava, stands out as an oasis of unshattered wildlife (especially birds). These areas, along with nearby Small War Island, are protected by the city's government as a nature preserve. There are 37 protected natural resources in the Belgrade urban area, among which eight are geo-heritage sites, i.e. Stra\u017eevica profile, Ma\u0161in Majdan-Top\u010dider, Profile at the Kalemegdan Fortress, Abandoned quarry in Barajevo, Karaga\u010da valley, Artesian well in Ov\u010da, Kapela loess profile, and Lake in Srem\u010dica. Other 29 places are biodiversity sites.Tourist income in 2016 amounted to nearly one billion euros; with a visit of almost a million registered tourists. Of those, in 2019 more than 100,000 tourists arrived by 742 river cruisers. Average annual growth is between 13% and 14%.As of 2018, there are three officially designated camp grounds in Belgrade. The oldest one is located in Batajnica, along the Batajnica Road. Named \"Dunav\", it is one of the most visited campsites in the country. Second one is situated within the complex of the ethno-household \"Zorni\u0107's House\" in the village of Ba\u0107evac, while the third is located in Ripanj, on the slopes of the Avala mountain. In 2017 some 15,000 overnights were recorded in camps.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nBelgrade has a reputation for vibrant nightlife; many clubs that are open until dawn can be found throughout the city. The most recognisable nightlife features of Belgrade are the barges (splav) spread along the banks of the Sava and Danube Rivers.Many weekend visitors\u2014particularly from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia\u2014prefer Belgrade nightlife to that of their own capitals due to its perceived friendly atmosphere, plentiful clubs and bars, cheap drinks, lack of significant language barriers, and a lack of night life regulation.\nOne of the most famous sites for alternative cultural happenings in the city is the SKC (Student Cultural Centre), located right across from Belgrade's highrise landmark, the Belgrade Palace tower. Concerts featuring famous local and foreign bands are often held at the centre. SKC is also the site of various art exhibitions, as well as public debates and discussions.A more traditional Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied by traditional music known as Starogradska (roughly translated as Old Town Music), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in Skadarlija, the city's old bohemian neighbourhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade gathered in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called kafanas in Serbian), which date back to that period. At one end of the neighbourhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded in the first half of the 19th century. One of the city's oldest kafanas is the Znak pitanja ('?').The Times reported that Europe's best nightlife can be found in Belgrade. In the Lonely Planet 1000 Ultimate Experiences guide of 2009, Belgrade was placed at the 1st spot among the top 10 party cities in the world.\n\n\n=== Sport and recreation ===\n\nThere are approximately one-thousand sports facilities in Belgrade, many of which are capable of serving all levels of sporting events.Ada Ciganlija island, lake and beaches are one the most important recreational areas in the city. With total of 8 km beaches, with lot of bars, caffe's, restaurants and sport facilities, Ada Ciganlija attracts many visitors especially in summertime.\nKo\u0161utnjak park forest with numerous running and bike trails, sport facilities for all sports with indoor and outdoor pools is also very popular. Located only 2 km from Ada Ciganlija.\nDuring the 60s and 70s Belgrade held a number of major international events such as the first ever World Aquatics Championships in 1973, 1976 European Football Championship and 1973 European Cup Final, European Athletics Championships in 1962 and European Indoor Games in 1969, European Basketball Championships in 1961 and 1975, European Volleyball Championship for men and women in 1975 and World Amateur Boxing Championships in 1978.\nSince the early 2000s Belgrade again hosts major sporting events nearly every year. Some of these include EuroBasket 2005, European Handball Championship (men's and women's) in 2012, World Handball Championship for women in 2013, European Volleyball Championships for men in 2005 for men and 2011 for women, the 2006 and 2016 European Water Polo Championship, the European Youth Olympic Festival 2007 and the 2009 Summer Universiade. More recently, Belgrade hosted European Athletics Indoor Championships in 2017 and the basketball EuroLeague Final Four tournament in 2018. Global and continental championships in other sports such as tennis, futsal, judo, karate, wrestling, rowing, kickboxing, table tennis and chess have also been held in recent years.\nThe city is home to Serbia's two biggest and most successful football clubs, Red Star Belgrade and Partizan Belgrade. Red Star won the UEFA Champions League (European Cup) in 1991, and Partizan was runner-up in 1966. The two major stadiums in Belgrade are the Marakana (Red Star Stadium) and the Partizan Stadium. The Eternal derby is between Red Star and Partizan.\n\u0160tark Arena with capacity of 19,384 spectators is one of the largest indoor arenas in Europe. It is used for major sporting events and large concerts. In May 2008 it was the venue for the 53rd Eurovision Song Contest. The Aleksandar Nikoli\u0107 Hall is the main venue of basketball clubs KK Partizan, European champion of 1992, and KK Crvena zvezda.In recent years, Belgrade has also given rise to several world-class tennis players such as Ana Ivanovic, Jelena Jankovi\u0107 and Novak Djokovic. Ivanovic and Djokovic are the first female and male Belgraders, respectively, to win Grand Slam singles titles and been ATP number 1 with Jelena Jankovi\u0107. The Serbian national team won the 2010 Davis Cup, beating the French team in the finals played in the Belgrade Arena.Belgrade Marathon is held annually since 1988. Belgrade was a candidate to host 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympic Games.\n\n\n=== Fashion and design ===\n\nSince 1996, semiannual (autumn/winter and spring/summer seasons) fashion weeks are held citywide. Numerous Serbian and foreign designers and fashion brands have their shows during Belgrade Fashion Week. The festival, which collaborates with London Fashion Week, has helped launch the international careers of local talents such as George Styler and Ana Ljubinkovi\u0107. British fashion designer Roksanda Ilincic, who was born in the city, also frequently presents her runway shows in Belgrade.\nIn addition to fashion, there are two major design shows held in Belgrade every year which attract international architects and industrial designers such as Karim Rashid, Daniel Libeskind, Patricia Urquiola, and Konstantin Grcic.  Both the Mikser Festival and Belgrade Design Week feature lectures, exhibits and competitions. Furthermore, international designers like Sacha Lakic, Ana Kra\u0161, Bojana Sentaler, and Marek Djordjevic are originally from Belgrade.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nBelgrade is the most important media hub in Serbia. The city is home to the main headquarters of the national broadcaster Radio Television Serbia (RTS), which is a public service broadcaster. The most popular commercial broadcaster is RTV Pink, a Serbian media multinational, known for its popular entertainment programmes. One of the most popular commercial broadcasters is B92, another media company, which has its own TV station, radio station, and music and book publishing arms, as well as the most popular website on the Serbian internet. Other TV stations broadcasting from Belgrade include 1Prva (formerly Fox televizija), Nova, N1 and others which only cover the greater Belgrade municipal area, such as Studio B.\nHigh-circulation daily newspapers published in Belgrade include Politika, Blic, Alo!, Kurir and Danas. There are 2 sporting dailies, Sportski \u017eurnal and Sport, and one economic daily, Privredni pregled. A new free distribution daily, 24 sata, was founded in the autumn of 2006. Also, Serbian editions of licensed magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Cosmopolitan, National Geographic, Men's Health, Grazia and others have their headquarters in the city.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nBelgrade has two state universities and several private institutions of higher education. The University of Belgrade, founded in 1808 as a grande \u00e9cole, is the oldest institution of higher learning in Serbia. Having developed with much of the rest of the city in the 19th century, several university buildings are recognised as forming a constituent part of Belgrade's architecture and cultural heritage. With enrolment numbers of nearly 90,000 students, the university is one of Europe's largest.The city is also home to 195 primary (elementary) schools and 85 secondary schools. The primary school system has 162 regular schools, 14 special schools, 15 art schools, and 4 adult schools, while the secondary school system has 51 vocational schools, 21 gymnasiums, 8 art schools and 5 special schools. The 230,000 pupils are managed by 22,000 employees in over 500 buildings, covering around 1.1 million square metres (12 million square feet).\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n \n\nBelgrade has an extensive public transport system consisting of buses (118 urban lines and more than 300 suburban lines), trams (12 lines), trolleybuses (8 lines) and S-Train BG Voz (6 lines). Buses, trolleybuses and trams are run by GSP Beograd and SP Lasta in cooperation with private companies on some bus routes. The S-train network, BG Voz, run by city government in cooperation with Serbian Railways, is a part of the integrated transport system, and has three lines (Batajnica-Ov\u010da and Ov\u010da-Resnik and Belgrade centre-Mladenovac), with more announced. The BusPlus ticketing system based on contactless smart cards began operating in February 2012. Daily connections link the capital to other towns in Serbia and many other European destinations through the city's central bus station.\nBeovoz was the suburban/commuter railway network that provided mass-transit services in the city, similar to Paris's RER and Toronto's GO Transit. The main usage of system was to connect the suburbs with the city centre. Beovoz was operated by Serbian Railways. However, this system was abolished back in 2013, mostly due to introduction of more efficient BG Voz. Belgrade is one of the last big European capitals and cities with over a million people to have no metro or subway or other rapid transit system, though Belgrade Metro is in its planning stages.\n\nThe new Belgrade Centre railway station is the hub for almost all the national and international trains. The high-speed rail that will connect Belgrade with Novi Sad, Subotica and Budapest is under construction, with the first half of 2020s planned for its beginning of operation.\nThe city is placed along the Pan-European corridors X and VII. The motorway system provides for easy access to Novi Sad and Budapest to the north, Ni\u0161 to the south, and Zagreb to the west. Expressway is also toward Pan\u010devo and new Expressway construction toward Obrenovac (Montenegro) is scheduled for March 2017. Belgrade bypass is connecting the E70 and E75 motorways and is under construction.Situated at the confluence of two major rivers, the Danube and the Sava, Belgrade has 11 bridges, the most important of which are Branko's bridge, the Ada Bridge, Pupin Bridge and the Gazela Bridge, the last two of which connect the core of the city to New Belgrade. In addition, an 'inner magistral semi-ring' is almost done and include a new Ada Bridge across the Sava river and a new Pupin Bridge across Danube river, which eased commuting within the city and unload the Gazela and Branko's bridge traffic.The Port of Belgrade is on the Danube, and allows the city to receive goods by river. The city is also served by Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) west of the city centre, near Sur\u010din. At its peak in 1986, almost 3 million passengers travelled through the airport, though that number dwindled to a trickle in the 1990s. Following renewed growth in 2000, the number of passengers reached approximately 2 million in 2004 and 2005, over 2.6 million passengers in 2008, reaching over 3 million passengers. All-time peak, with over 4 million passengers, was accomplished in 2014, when Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport became the second fastest growing major airport in Europe.\n\n\n== International cooperation and honours ==\n\nList of Belgrade's sister and twin cities:\n Coventry, UK, since 1957\n Chicago, USA, since 2005\n Ljubljana, Slovenia, since 2010\n Skopje, North Macedonia, since 2012\n Shanghai, China, since 2018Other friendships and cooperations, protocols, memorandums:\n\nSome of the city's municipalities are also twinned to small cities or districts of other big cities; for details see their respective articles.\nBelgrade has received various domestic and international honours, including the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur (proclaimed 21 December 1920; Belgrade is one of four cities outside France, alongside Li\u00e8ge, Luxembourg and Volgograd, to receive this honour), the Czechoslovak War Cross (awarded 8 October 1925), the Yugoslavian Order of the Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star (awarded 18 May 1939) and the Yugoslavian Order of the People's Hero (proclaimed on 20 October 1974, the 30th anniversary of the overthrow of Nazi German occupation during World War II).

        "wiki": "The National Theatre (Serbian: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435, romanized: Narodno pozori\u0161te) is a theatre located in Belgrade, Serbia.\nFounded in the later half of the 19th century, it is located on the Republic Square, at the corner of Vasina and Francuska Street. With the raising of this building as well as with the implementation of the Regulations Plan of Town in Trench by Josimovi\u0107 from 1867, the conditions were made for the formation of today's main Republic Square in Belgrade. Built back in 1868, the National Theatre, following the fate of its own people and the country, went through different phases of the architectural and artistic development, surviving as a symbol of Serbian culture, tradition and spirituality. Today, under its roof, there are three artistic ensembles: opera, ballet, and drama.\nThe National Theatre was declared a Monument of Culture of Great Importance in 1983, and it is protected by the Republic of Serbia.\n\n\n== Origin ==\n\nIn 1868, the Serbian National Theatre from Novi Sad (then the capital of Serbian culture in Austria-Hungary) performed in Belgrade (then the capital of the Principality of Serbia). Prince Michael, impressed by the performances he experienced, invited Jovan \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 (the founder of the Novi Sad Serbian National Theatre) to found a similar institution in Serbia. Having accepted, Jovan \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 came to Belgrade with half of his company of actors and founded the National Theatre in Belgrade, seven years after having founded the Novi Sad theatre.\nThe prince chose the location, on the present Republic Square. The area was cleared earlier, after the prince ordered the demolition of the Stambol Gate in 1866, one of the four outer gates into the Belgrade Fortress.\n\n\n== Building ==\n\n\n=== History ===\n\nThough some preparatory works have begun, the prince didn't live to see the full blown construction. He was assassinated in Ko\u0161utnjak on 10 June 1868 and the foundation stone was laid by his successor, prince Milan, on 31 August 1868. On that day the Metropolitanate of Belgrade Mihailo Jovanovi\u0107 consecrated the foundations. The building was roofed the next January and ceremonially opened on 12 November 1869.The National Theatre was built according to the design of Aleksandar Bugarski, the most productive architect of Belgrade in the 19th century. The building was a typical theatre building at the time and was particularly reminiscent of La Scala, in Milan, with regard to its Renaissance conception and the decorative finish. Beside theatrical purposes, the hall has been used for charity balls and concerts during the 19th century.\nThe edifice was built on the location of the former Stambol Gate. The theatrical company moved into the new building in 1869 and the first alterations and annexing happened already the next year. In 1870, the relatively small stage was upgraded and extended. The Great Constitutional Assembly adopted the famous 1888 Constitution in this building.\nStill, the condition of the stage and utility rooms caused further problems, so in 1911 a decision was made to do another reconstruction of the building. Works began, but due to the World War I had to be halted. The reconstruction continued in 1919 and was finished by 1922. The project was drafted by architect Josif Bukavac. After the reconstruction was finished, the outer appearance of the building lost its unity of decorative styles and the unison original concept of the Vienna Secession and Baroque architecture blend. The auditorium was enlarged to 944 seats, the stage was enlarged and deepened and the rotational round stage was added.As the building was additionally damaged during the fighting in the war, during the reconstruction the ensemble performed in one of the buildings within the Royal Cavalry Guard complex, where the Manje\u017e park was later built. The first performance in this new, temporary venue, was held in January 1920. Even though the reconstruction of the theatre was finished by July 1922, the offshoot at Manje\u017e continued under the name of Theatre at Cvetni Trg, until 1927 when the old, wooden former horse stable burned to the ground. On that location today is situated the Yugoslav Drama Theatre.The theatre building was damaged during the German bombing of Belgrade on 6 April 1941. Ministry of the construction in the German-installed Serbian Government of National Salvation began the repairs by the end of 1941. The building was again enlarged and another annex was added adjoining the lower side of the edifice. This way, the monumental, symmetrical building, as it appeared in 1922, completely lost its architectural harmony. The reconstruction plans during the war were drafted by architect Gojko Todi\u0107 and later by his colleague Dragan Gudovi\u0107. Company of another architect, Milan Sekuli\u0107, was the general contractor. The building was also hit during the heavy \"Easter Bombing\" of Belgrade by the Allies on 16 April 1944.After the 1964-1965 season ended, another reconstruction began, based on the plan of the architect Nikola \u0160ercer. It included minor refurbishments of the Main Stage. In 1986, the National Theatre and the City of Belgrade opted for the new, necessary and detailed reconstruction of the, by now, almost completely unusable venue. The main architects who headed the project were Ljubomir Zdravkovi\u0107 and Slobodan Drinjakovi\u0107. The interior was designed by Milan Pali\u0161a\u0161ki, fa\u00e7ade and ornamental plastic was done by Branka Bremec, Dimitrije Ivan\u010devi\u0107 and Zoran Badnjevi\u0107, while the engineer Milenko Popovi\u0107 was entrusted with solving the problem with statics. The reconstruction lasted for 3 years and cost $4,5 million.The building was reopened in 1989, 120 years since it became operational. The building was fully reconstructed while the new annex was built in the direction of the Bra\u0107e Jugovi\u0107a Street, doubling the floor venue of the edifice. While the annex was built in the modern, glass style, the old section of the theatre actually regained its 1922 appearance. The annex has 5 floors above and 2 floors below the ground. The total floor area of the building is 18,500 m2 (199,000 sq ft), of which 17,000 m2 (180,000 sq ft) can be used. The architects projected special places for the future connections between the annex, now called the Working Building, and the possible new Opera and Ballet building on the Square Republic, across the Francuska Street.In August 2018 another reconstruction began. The fa\u00e7ade will be reconstructed (removal of the parts prone to falling off, filling of the holes and damaged sections with the fa\u00e7ade stone, replacement of the glass panels, etc.). Additionally, some interior works will be done, too, mostly concerning the reparation of the chairs and seats. The works should be finished by January 2019.\n\n\n=== Performance facilities ===\nThe National Theatre Belgrade has 2 halls for performing arts.\n\nMain StageThe Grand Hall has 3 levels. The ground level has 219 seats in total with the seats at the front being most expensive. There are 3 balconies in the theatre with the first one being the most expensive.\nLarge operas, dramas and ballets are presented at the Grand Hall.\n\nRa\u0161a Plaovi\u0107 StageRa\u0161a Plaovi\u0107 has 281 seats and with no balconies. It is much smaller and less beautiful then the Grand Hall. Smaller scale dramas are played out on this stage.\n\n\n=== The events of 1999 ===\nDuring one of the toughest times in Serbian history, which is the 1999 NATO bombing, this theatre was the only one to open its doors to the public during the 78-day air raids. For only 1 dinar, opera, plays and ballets were performed to the public. The performance times were very unusual, from 15:00 to 18:00. It was done because in that period of time there were not NATO air strikes on Belgrade. World well-known opera conductor, maestro Alberto Zedda, said once that during those horrible days Belgrade Opera was proudly writing the most dignified pages of history of world opera.\n\n\n== Drama, opera, ballet ==\n\n\n=== Drama ===\nThe activity of Drama of the National Theatre can be viewed as a development in four stages: from 1868 till 1914, from 1918 till 1941, from 1945 until 1991, and from 1991 till today. The first stage is marked by many tragedies and enactments inspired by medieval and modern history, like The Death of Uro\u0161 V by Stefan Stefanovi\u0107. The characteristic of the repertoire of the National Theatre, especially at the end of the 19th century were plays with singing like dramatizations of Stevan Sremac\u2019s popular short stories: Zona Zamfirova and Ivkova Slava.\nIn the first two decades of the 20th century the broadening of subject matters was noticeable. Beside Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107 others like Simo Matavulj, Vojislav Jovanovi\u0107 Marambo, Nikola \u017divkovi\u0107 Mirabo and Milivoj Predi\u0107 must be mentioned. Ko\u0161tana by Borisav Stankovi\u0107 was first shown at the very beginning of the 20th century and it has remained the cult performance of this theatre till this day. In the first stage on the repertoire of the National Theatre were plays written by the most significant writers of all periods: from the earliest (Sophocles), to William Shakespeare, Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, Moli\u00e8re, Jean Racine, Carlo Goldoni, Edmond Rostand, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Henrik Ibsen, August Strindberg, Nikolai Gogol, Aleksandr Ostrovsky, Anton Chekhov and Maxim Gorky.\n\nBetween the two world wars, speaking of domestic dramaturgy, the plays of Jovan Sterija Popovi\u0107, Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107, Milutin Boji\u0107, Borisav Stankovi\u0107, Ivo Vojnovi\u0107, Milan Begovi\u0107, Ivan Cankar and Todor Manojlovi\u0107 were staged.\nIn the period from 1945 till 1953 the plays with clear political message were played. Political changes and certain liberalization characterise the relationship towards the foreign dramaturgy and discovering of the American drama and the works of Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco and Samuel Beckett.\nThe seventies and eighties were marked by plays of Borislav Mihajlovi\u0107 Mihiz, Aleksandar Popovi\u0107 (playwright), \u017darko Komanin, Ljubomir Simovi\u0107 and Jovan Hristi\u0107. The National Theatre opened its door to the contemporary world dramaturgy. Plays by Martin McDonagh, \u00c9ric-Emmanuel Schmitt, Nina Valsa, Yasmina Reza, Pavel Kohout are played and plays by Serbian contemporary writers Sini\u0161a Kova\u010devi\u0107, Vida Ognjenovi\u0107, Jelena Kajgo, Milo\u0161 Nikoli\u0107, Stevan Pe\u0161i\u0107 can be seen on the stage of the National Theatre.\n\n\n=== Opera ===\nThe music ensemble of the National Theatre in Belgrade worked towards being a professional opera ensemble from 1882. The present chief conductor is Dejan Savi\u0107, and the principal concertmaster is Edit Makedonska.\nAs an independent ensemble, the Opera of the National Theatre began its work in 1919. On 11 February 1919, under the leadership of the first music director of the Opera Section of the National Theatre, Stanislav Bini\u010dki, a conductor, the opera Madam Butterfly by Giacomo Puccini, was performed. The first opera performances were received very favourably, most of them were operas by Italian composers (Gioacchino Rossini, Giuseppe Verdi), while Serbian music was represented by the works of Stevan Hristi\u0107 (The Sunset), and Petar Konjovi\u0107 (Prince of Zeta).\n\nIn the ten years 1924 to 1933 Stevan Hristi\u0107 was the director of the Belgrade Opera. This period marked an expansion of the repertoire and the first tour abroad. Conductors such as Lovro Mata\u010di\u0107, Ivan Brezov\u0161ek, directors Branko Gavella and Josip Kulund\u017ei\u0107 were notable in the period between the two wars. Russian singers prevailed in the ensemble, but there were also Serbian singers such as Zdenka Zikova, Melanija Bugarinovi\u0107 and Nikola Cveji\u0107; as well as Bosnian singers such as Bahrija Nuri Had\u017ei\u0107.\nAfter the Second World War, conductor Oskar Danon quickly renewed the activities of the Opera as its general manager. Special attention was dedicated to the domestic opera composers.\nThe golden period of the Belgrade Opera saw significant development and international affirmation of the Serbian operatic art. Starting in 1954 with a very successful performance of Boris Godunov by Modest Mussorgsky in Switzerland as a part of a concert cycle \"Clubhouse\", and gramophone recordings of seven major Russian operas for Decca. The Decca series was supported by Gerald Severn, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 White Russian. The venue found in the then Yugoslav capital for the first batch of recordings was the cinema in the Dom Kulture (\"House of culture\") complex, but which could only be used after the last film of the day (around 11 p.m.) so sessions took place at night. Prince Igor and Khovanschina were recorded in February 1955, with Eugene Onegin, Life for the Tsar, Snow Maiden and Queen of Spades in September and October that year, all among the early Decca stereo records. The company's recording of Boris Godunov took place in Zagreb between the other sets of sessions.The culmination of this \"golden period\" was an outstanding production of Mazeppa by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky on the stage of the Theater des Westens in West Berlin. The most eminent foreign critics pointed out the wholeness of the performance, good teamwork and the beauty of the performing, outstanding soloist creations, acoustic superiority, the homogeneity of the choir and the professional playing of the orchestra of the National Theatre from Belgrade. The opera has attracted talented musicians, including S\u00e1ndor Szab\u00f3 and others.\n\n\n=== Ballet ===\nBallet has always been a great part of the National Theatre Belgrade. One of its most important and most watched ballet performances is the Swan Lake. Ballet of the National Theatre is very well known by its world premieres. One of the titles national Ballet is proud the most is Anna Karenina by Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin, as well as The Legend of Ohrid by Serbian composer Stevan Hristi\u0107.\n\n\n== List of directors ==\nThis is a list of directors of the National Theatre in Belgrade with their term years:\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of theatres in Serbia\nList of directors of the National Theatre in Belgrade\nMonuments of Culture of Great Importance\nTourism in Serbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "The Avala Tower (Serbian: \u0410\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430\u045a, romanized: Avalski toranj) is a 204.68 m (672 ft) tall telecommunications tower located on Mount Avala, in Belgrade. The original tower was finished in 1965, but was destroyed on 29 April 1999, during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The tower's reconstruction commenced on 21 December 2006 and it was officially opened on 21 April 2010.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origin ===\nThe tower was designed by architects Uglje\u0161a Bogunovi\u0107 and Slobodan Janji\u0107, and engineer Milan Krsti\u0107. Contractor was the \"Rad\" construction company. Construction started on 14 October 1961 and was completed four years later, in 1965. The tower weighed 4,000 tonnes (3,900 long tons; 4,400 short tons). Between 102 m (335 ft) and 135 m (443 ft), there was an enclosed observation deck, entered at 122 m (400 ft) and reached via two quick elevators. It was the only tower in the world to have an equilateral triangle as its cross section, and one of very few towers not perched directly into the ground, but standing on its legs. The legs formed a tripod, the symbol of Serbian tripod chair (trono\u017eac). It is one of the small number of towers to be constructed in that manner.\nThe tower was surmounted by an antenna, which was at first used for black and white television transmission. In 1971 the antenna was replaced by a new one for color TV transmission and the emitting of the TV Belgrade's Second program in color began on 31 December 1971. Also, the first digital terrestrial television in Serbia was emitted from the tower.The project, which was of high risk, was finished without any worker injuries or deaths, which was unusual for a project of its size.\n\n\n=== 1999 bombing ===\nThe Avala Tower was destroyed on 29 April 1999 by NATO bombardment. Previously the power supply to the station was destroyed, but a senior military officer installed a backup generator. The intent of the bombing was to put Radio Television Serbia (RTS) permanently off the air for the duration of the war; however RTS was relayed on a network of local TV stations which relayed its programming throughout the whole of Serbia. The Avala Tower was a symbol of pride and a famous landmark, not only of Belgrade and Serbia, but of the former Yugoslavia too. The tower was one of the last buildings to be destroyed before the end of the NATO operation. The tower was destroyed by two GBU-27s that hit one leg of the tower, causing its collapse.\n\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\nIn 2004, Radio Television Serbia commenced a series of fund-raising events in order to collect money to construct the building once again at the same place it was destroyed. In 2005, clearing of the site where the tower was destroyed began and on 21 December 2006 the construction of a new Avala Tower commenced. An agreement regarding its construction was signed by Du\u0161an Basara, director of the construction sector of the Ratko Mitrovi\u0107 Company \u2014 which was in charge of the construction of the tower \u2014 and general director of RTS, Aleksandar Tijani\u0107. Many fund-raising events have been held for the collection of funds so a new tower can be constructed. One of the first was a match between Serbian grand slam-winning tennis players Ana Ivanovic and Novak Djokovic. All the proceeds went to the Avala Tower fund. Ceca Ra\u017enatovi\u0107 (a Serbian folk singer) held a concert on 15 June 2006, with all the proceeds going to the Avala Tower fund. Radio Television Serbia ran commercials for donations to rebuild the tower. According to a December 2006 report, when it was announced that the construction of a new Avala Tower would commence that same month, over \u20ac1 million was collected through fund-raising and donations.\nInitially, completion of the new tower was expected in August 2008, but construction works were severely delayed. The opening date was pushed back to 29 April 2009, the tenth anniversary of its destruction. Radio Television Serbia reported on 23 October 2009 that the tower had been completed. The rebuilt tower was opened on 21 April 2010 and with 204.68 m (671.5 ft), it is 2 m (6 ft 7 in) higher than the demolished one. Materials used include 5,880 tons of concrete and 500 tons of reinforcement bars.\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe tower had 137,000 visitors in 2016, 155,000 in 2017 and 185,000 in 2018. In June 2017 the tourist complex was opened at the base of the tower. It includes, among other facilities, a restaurant, ethno-gallery, souvenir shop, sports fields and outdoor gym. By August 2017, a 105 cement prints of the people who helped the reconstruction were displayed, including those of tennis players Novak Djokovic and Ana Ivanovic and a new lift, for the parents with children and the disabled, have been constructed.In 2018 the children area at the base was expanded with the elf village, consisting of houses connected by a small bridge. A classroom in the open was set in the pine forest and the artificial climbing rock was built. On 19 October 2018, a colorful decorative light on the entire tower became operational.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Radio and TV frequencies ==\nFM radio:\n\n95.3 MHz \u2013 Radio Belgrade 1\n97.6 MHz \u2013 Radio Belgrade 2/3\n98.5 MHz \u2013 Hit FM\n104.0 MHz \u2013 Radio Belgrade 202DVB-T2 digital television:\n\nUHF channel 22 \u2013 MUX 1 (national):\nRTS1\nRTS2\nRTS3\nRTV Pink\nO2 TV\nPrva Srpska Televizija\nHappy TV\nUHF channel 28 \u2013 MUX 2:\nregional and local TV stations, including Studio B\nUHF channel 45 \u2013 MUX 3:\npay TV services\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of tallest buildings in Serbia\nArchitecture of Belgrade\nList of towers\nList of masts These are also often used as for TV broadcasts.\nList of tallest structures in former Yugoslavia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBeobuild Archive : Rebuilding phases and photos of Avala Tower\nNew tower fireworks dedication\nAvala Tower Fans Association\nAvala Tower at skyscraperpage.com\nVirtual tour @ Avala Tower\nMount Avala Tower at Structurae",

          "Not much to do here other than views. The caf\u00e9 at the top is disappointing, you will only get 1 free nasty coffee drink even if you're two people. If you go here, take the least expensive ticket. Bad: No taxis Bad atmosphere inside tower. Good: Outside surroundings. Tips:",
          "On hot days opt for the VIP ticket which includes a dirnk at the air conditioned cafe and affords you the same views as seen form upper level (both through glass windows). DON'T forget to purches tickets near the parking lot, it's a shame climbing up to the door to find tickets",

          "The tower itself is a nice structural building on three legs. Quite avantgarde. The scenery is ok, but you do not see anything extraordinary. Did not visit the cafe/restaurant, but it does not inspire one to eat there unless you are really hungry. The drive up to Avala tower is",
          "For only 400 rsd you buy a ticket to the top of the tower (a drink in the caf\u00e9 at the top is included!). On a mountain and then over 120 meters of the tower itself is pretty spectacular. Having a cafe latte with a view of whole belgrade is pretty amazing.",

          "We visited the Avala Tower, known also as the Avalski toranj na Avali with friends the previous year. I find it a typical Soviet-style structure. This TV tower offers spectacular panoramic views and it is considered a top landmark. It is at a height of 205 meters and the",

          "Little drive up the mountain, and fairly reasonable price to take elevator to the top of the TV tower. Little coffee shop at top of the tower where you can enjoy the somewhat limited view. You can come down to the next level, where you have a more fluid view around the tower",

          "This mausoleum is located on the mountain Avala near Belgrade. This is the work of art of national artist Mestrovic. Lot of people used to come here for a relaxation and for a daily picnic. Very popular place for escaping the city crowd with plenty pedestrian paths for walking.",
          "In my opinion you won't miss anything if you don't go there. It is a quiet place and not crowded but it is somehow depressing. You can visit this Monument to unknown hero and that tower that was rebuilt. The view from the tower isn't fascinating at all, you look at fields all",
          "Mountain Avala has been located not so far from Belgrade, but it provides very nice alternative to the stressful life in Belgrade. Here you can find spot for picnic, but at the same time you can visit new TV tower built exactly on the same spot where stood the old TV tower",

          "The Avala tower sits on top of Avala mountain. You can park directly beneath the tower. We had to wait in line for tickets and lifts for quite some time. Then you take the lift to the small restaurant and viewing deck. It was pretty crowded and quite hard to take good pictures.",
          "The new tower is nicely constructed after NATO blew up the previous one. None of the staff seemed to speak English but that is not a problem. The admission fee is a bargain. Unfortunately the only negative is the view from the top. Although you can see for miles it is not",

          "We visited by car one week day in summer and there weren't many other visitors around. I believe you can also come here by organized tour on weekends and it appeared as if there is a regular bus service also. The tower visit itself is a little strange - first you go to the caf\u00e9",
          "Having settled in Toronto I am used to CN Tower queues. We took a short trip out to Avala and had a lovely time with no queues in sight. The scenery is fantastic, the tower is new, clean and well-operated. The service, food and drinks at the restaurant at the top were enjoyable",

We also went on Avala tower but it is nothing special because Beograd is too far away and you can't see",
          "Use sunny day and take trip to the Avala mountain. Of course, don't miss The Tower. Master piece of architects Uros Bogdanovi and Slobodan Janjic. During nato bombing it was seriously harmed but now its like the old one or even better :) The ticket is cca 3eur depends on if you",

Her parents were wealthy landowners.\nA church, dedicated to her, had been built in Selimpa\u015fa on the spot where her house of birth once stood. The oldest testimony regarding the church dates back to the year 1200. It was written by the Russian voyager Anthony, Bishop of Novgorod. In August 1817 the church was completely destroyed by a great fire, and it was rebuilt in 1820, with the financial support of the citizens of Constantinople and the Prince of Moldo-Wallahia, Alexander Kallimachi. In 1885 the Community demolished the old church in order to construct a much bigger one on the same place. The building was completed after 6 years, for which parts of the Byzantine tower of Duke Alexis Apokaukos (1327\u201341) were re-used as building material. It was the biggest church in the whole of Eastern Thrace (16 m height, 26 m width and 30 m length), a real jewel that could be seen from kilometres away. It was completely demolished in the spring of 1979, and now in the same place there is a park.\nLegend says that when she was a child, Paraskeva heard in a church the Lord's words: \"Whoever wants to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.\" (Mark 8, 34). These words would determine her to give her rich clothes away to the poor and flee to Constantinople.  Her parents, who did not support her decision to follow an ascetic, religious life, looked for her in various cities.  Paraskeva fled to Chalcedon, and afterwards lived at the church of the Most Holy Theotokos in Heraclea Pontica.  She lived an austere life, experiencing visions of the Virgin Mary. Her voyages took her to Jerusalem, wishing to spend the rest of her life there. After seeing Jerusalem, she settled in a convent in the desert near the river Jordan.\nWhen she was 25, an angel appeared, telling her to return to her homeland.  She returned to Constantinople, and then when she was 25, lived in the village of Kallikrateia, in the church of the Holy Apostles. She died at the age of 27.\n\n\n== Veneration ==\nChristian tradition states that after an old sinner was buried near Paraskeva\u2019s grave, the saint protested by appearing in a dream to a local monk.  The vision informed the monk where the saint had been buried; when the body was unearthed, it was found to be incorrupt.  The relics were translated to the church of the Holy Apostles in Kallikrateia.The cult of Saint Parascheva spread in the 14th century from Bulgaria northwards into the Romanian principalities, Wallachia and Moldavia. In this period, Bishop Evtimiy of Tarnovo (1332-1402) wrote  the biography of Saint Parascheva - \"Hagiography of Saint Petka of Tarnovo\u201d. The bishop's work was inspired from the Greek Bios of deacon Basilikos, written in the year 1150 by request of Constantinople Patriarch Nicholas IV Mouzelon.\nSometimes, Saint Parascheva of Thrace(St.Petka) is named The New. There are two other saints with her name, Saint Paraskevi of Rome (2nd century) and Saint Paraskevi of Iconium.\nFor some scholars is a certain disambiguation concerning these three saints. Also confusion can be made with some folk tales characters.    \nParaskeva\u2019s cult and attributes became confused with that of other saints with the same name as well as pre-Christian deities of the Slavs.This confusion was made because the Greek name of St Parascheva was \u201cparaskevi\u201d, meaning \u201cFriday\u201d.  The translation in languages as Romanian or Serbian was \u201cSf\u00e2nta Vineri\u201d or \u201cSveta Petka\u201d meaning Saint Friday. \nThe translation from Greek language to Romanian, Serbian or Bulgarian language was sometimes misunderstood by some scholars who connected the translated name of Saint Parascheva, Saint Friday, with a certain character from folk tales having a similar name.\nAs one scholar asks:\n\nWas Parasceve, or Paraskeva, an early Christian maiden named in honor of the day of the Crucifixion?  Or was she a personification of that day, pictured cross in hand to assist the fervor of the faithful?  And was the Paraskeva of the South Slavs the same who made her appearance in northern Russia?\nThe answer is that there is a complete separation between the 10th-century Christian Saint Parascheva The New (called \"of the Balkans\") and folk character derived perhaps by pre-Christian mystical beliefs. \nThe separation is made by rich biography and iconography transferred from the 10th century to 21st, all this information and studies being connected to a real person who lived in that period.\nHagiographies of Saint Parascheva (Petka) were written by : deacon Basilikos in 1150, bishop Evtimiy of Tarnovo in ca. 1385, metropolitan Matei of Mira in 1605, metropolitan Varlaam of Moldova in 1643, Saint Nikodimos the Athonite (19th century), Romanian Bishop Melchisedec of Roman in 1889.The cults of Paraskevi of Iconium (Paraskeva-Pyatnitsa) and Paraskeva of the Balkans were conflated with that of a Slavic deity associated with Friday, alternatively known as Petka, Pyatnitsa, or Zhiva.  \nAttributes, such as the association with spinning, were also merged into the cult of these saints.Any confusion was clarified after Romanian Orthodox Church decided on 28 February 1950 to generalise the cult of Saint Parascheva The New.  \nThe generalisation of the cult was celebrated on 14 October 1955 in Iasi Cathedral with the presence of high rank clerics from Bulgaria and Russia.\nSome modern Romanian theologians published studies about Saint Parascheva: Pr. Gh. P\u0103v\u0103loiu (1935), Arhim. Varahil Jitaru (1942), D. St\u0103nescu (1938), Pr. M. \u021aesan (1955), Pr. Scarlat Porcescu, Pr. Prof. Mircea P\u0103curariu.\n\n\n== Relics ==\nIn subsequent years, Paraskevi\u2019s relics were transferred to various churches in the region.In 1238, the relics were transferred from Kallikrateia to Veliko Tarnovo, capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire.In 1393, they were transferred to Belgrade, specifically the Ru\u017eica Church.  When Belgrade fell to Ottoman forces in 1521, the relics were transferred to Constantinople.  In 1641, the relics were transferred to Trei Ierarhi Monastery, in Ia\u015fi, Moldavia (nowadays, eastern part of Romania).  In 1888, they were transferred to the Metropolitan Cathedral of Ia\u015fi.A severe drought in 1946-47 affected Moldavia, adding to the misery left by the war. Metropolitan Justinian Marina permitted the first procession featuring the coffin containing the relics of Saint Paraskevi, kept at Ia\u015fi since then. The relics wended their way through the drought-deserted villages of Ia\u015fi, Vaslui, Roman, Bac\u0103u, Putna, Neam\u0163, Baia and Boto\u015fani Counties. The offerings collected on this occasion were distributed, based on Metropolitan Justinian's decisions, to orphans, widows, invalids, school cafeterias, churches under construction, and to monasteries in order to feed the sick, and old or feeble monks.\n\n\n== Ia\u015fi Pilgrimage ==\nPilgrimage at the shrines located in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Ia\u015fi has become one of the major religious events in Romania. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims gather each year in Ia\u015fi in the second weekend of October to commemorate St. Parascheva, while the city itself established its Celebration Days at the same time.\n\n\n== Noteworthy churches ==\n\nMetropolitan Cathedral, Ia\u015fi, Romania\nChurch of Saint Paraskevi (\u1f49\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u1fc6\u03c2), Neoi Epivates, Greece\nChurch of Saint Stefanos and Saint Paraskeva (\u1f09\u03b3\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f49\u03c3\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u1fc6\u03c2), Ptolemaida, Greece\nChurch of St. Petka, Breznik, Bulgaria\nChurch of St Paraskeva, Nesebar, Bulgaria\nChurch of St Petka of the Saddlers, Sofia, Bulgaria\nChurch of St Petka, Ruse, Bulgaria\nChurch of St Petka, Vukovo, Bulgaria\nSt Petka of Bulgaria, Baba Vanga's Church, Rupite, Bulgaria\nChurch of St. Petka, Dolno Orizari, Bitola, North Macedonia\nChurch of Pious Paraskeva, Dese\u0219ti, Romania\nChurch of Saint Paraskevi, Paloumba, Greece.\nChurch of Pious Parascheva, Poienile Izei, Romania\nChurch of Saint Parascheva (17th century), Majs, Hungary\nWooden Church of Saint Paraskevi of Serbia (1820) with a belfry in Bohorodchany Raion, Ukraine\nChurch of St Petka, Belgrade, Serbia\nChurch of St Petka, Dubica, Bosna i Hercegovina\nChurch of Saint Parascheva, Slabinja, Croatia\nSt. Petka's Church, Banovci, Croatia\nSaint Petka Serbian Orthodox Church, Maidstone, Ontario\nChurch of St. Paraskevia, Ukraine, Ivano-Frankivsk, Opryshivtsi \nSaint Petka Serbian Orthodox Church in Windsor-Lakeshore, Ontario, Canada.\nSt Parascheva Church, Leni\u0161te, North Macedonia\nSt. James the Apostel and St. Paraskeva - [The Hague] The Netherlands\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "The Bajrakli Mosque (Serbian: \u0411\u0430\u0458\u0440\u0430\u043a\u043b\u0438 \u045f\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0458\u0430 / Bajrakli d\u017eamija; named in Turkish as Bayrakl\u0131, bayrak is Turkish for \"flag\" and Bayrakl\u0131 means \"with flag\") is a mosque in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is located in Gospodar Jevremova Street in the neighbourhood of Dor\u0107ol. It was built around 1575, and is the only mosque in the city out of the 273 that had existed during the time of the Ottoman Empire's rule of Serbia.\nDuring the occupation of Serbia by the Austrians (between 1717 and 1739), it was converted into a Roman Catholic church; but after the Ottomans retook Belgrade, it was returned to its original function.\nIt was damaged after being set on fire on 18 March 2004, during that year's unrest in Kosovo, in violent protest to the burning of Serbian churches in Kosovo, but it was later repaired.\n\n\n== History ==\nOut  of  former  more  than  200 mosques  and  many  small  Islamic places  of  worship  the  so  called  mesdzid,  the  Bajrakli  Mosque  in 11,  Gospodar  Jevremova  Street  is the  only  remaining and  active  example  of  Islamic  religious  architecture  in  Belgrade. It is situated on a slope towards the Danube River, near the junction with Kralja Petra Street. Once it dominated in the atmosphere of  mostly  ground  floor  houses  in  the  busy  commercial  and  craft town district of Belgrade, the so-called Zerek.\nDescriptions of Belgrade of the 17th century were preserved by Ottoman travel writer Evliya Celebi in which he vividly described the  appearance  of  the  town  in  the  period  of  Turkish  rule,  with various  buildings  of  Islamic  architecture.  In  the  second  half  of the 19th century the Bajrakli Mosque was described by historians and travel writers Konstantin Jire\u010dek, Giuseppe Barbanti Brodano,as  well  as  by  archaeologist  and  ethnologist Felix Kanitz. It  is  assumed  that  today's  Bajrakli  Mosque was  built  on  the  place  of  an  older  mesdzid,  probably in the second half of the 17th century, as the endowment of the Turkish ruler Sultan Suleiman II (1687\u20141691). It was originally named after former renewers, \u010cohad\u017ei-Hajji Alija's and  later Hussein \u0106ehaja's mosque, while the current name was given in the late 18th  or in the early 19th century. In it, as in the main mosque, there was the muvekit, the man  who  calculated  the  exact  time  of  AH  according  to  the  Islamic  calendar  (which  began  in  622, i.e.  in  the  year  of  Hijra,  the  year  during  which  the emigration of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca  to  Medina) occurred  to  determine  sacred  days, regulated clock mechanism and put the flag on the minaret,  to  signal  the  simultaneous  beginning  of the prayer to other Islamic places of worship in the town of Belgrade. Between 1717 and 1739, during the Austrian rule, it served as a cathedral Catholic church,  but  its  original  function  was  renewed  in 1741  when  the  Ottomans  returned  to  Belgrade. The  mosque  was  renewed  in  the  19th  century  by the rulers of the Obrenovic dynasty, Prince Mihailo and King Aleksandar Obrenovi\u0107.\nIn  1868,  The  Minister  of  Education  and  Church Affairs  was  ordered  by  Prince  Mihailo  Obrenovic to choose one of the existing mosques and enable it  for  the  performance  of  Muslim  religious  rites, when  besides  the  mosque  was  repaired  even  the courtyard  building  next  to  it. The  Minister  of  Education and Church Affairs sent to the State Council of the Principality of Serbia a document dated May 10, 1868, with the following content: \"In order for Mohammedans, who are on their business in Belgrade, not to be without religious consolation, His Excellency ordered the one of the local mosques to be repaired for their place of  worship.  Due  to  this  high  order, \"Bajrak\"  mosque  was  chosen as  the  most  appropriate  one  and  the  Minister  of Construction  as at my request sent the professional people to examine the same mosque, and a house next to it, where the mullahs will reside....\"\nBy the Decree of Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 from May 1868, The Minister of Education and Church Affairs was authorized to \"give to khoja  240,  and  a  muezzin  120  talirs  a  year\",  and  the  servants of the mosque had even income from real estate - waqf property. The first imam and the muezzin at the Bajrakli Mosque were appointed in 1868.\nBetween the two world wars, the mosque was restored even by the  Municipality  of  Belgrade, when  in 1935  it  was  protected  for the first time by the Regulation on the Protection of Antiquities in \nBelgrade. The restoration was performed several times and after the Second World War  by  the  National  Committee  of  the  City  of Belgrade and by the Cultural Heritage Preservation and Scientific Research  Institute  and,  from  the  mid  sixties  of  the 20th century even by the Cultural Heritage Preservation Institute of Belgrade. After  the  recent  damage  in  2004  conservation  works  on  rehabilitation and restoration of stone facades with the restoration of window openings were carried out.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\nThe  architecture  of  the  mosque  belongs  to  the  type  of  one-storey cubic building with a  dome  and minaret.  With  massive  walls  and small  openings,  it  was  built  of  stone,  and  some  segments  were  carried out in brick and stone. The building has the square plan, while the octagonal  dome  is  supported  by  oriental  domed  arches  and  niches -trompes,  with  modest  decoration  of consoles. The  number  of  windows on the facades is uneven, while the one is located on each side of the tambour of the dome. Dome supporting elements and all the openings  on  the  building  end  in  characteristic  ogee  oriental  arches. Minaret - a thin tower with conical roof, with a circular terrace at the top,  from  which  the  faithful  are  called  to  prayer  by  the muezzin -  is located on the northwest exterior side. Opposite the entrance, in the interior of the mosque, there is the most sacred space - the mihrab, a shallow niche with elaborate vault decoration, set in the direction of the holy city of Mecca to the southeast, while the raised wooden pulpit (minber or mimbar) is set to the right of the mihrab, in the south-west  corner.  Above  the  entrance,  there  is  a  wooden  gallery (mahfil) from which one can come to the serefa, terrace on the minaret.Interior decoration of the mosque is very modest. The walls are without  plaster  with  shallow  moldings,  rare  stylized  floral  and geometrical motifs and calligraphic inscriptions of verses from the \nMuslim  holy  book  Koran,  then  with  the  names  of  the  first  righteous  religious  leaders caliphs,  as  well  as  of  the  God's  i.e. Allah's magnificent properties and names written in Arabic letters on a specially decorated carved panels levhas. At the entrance to the mosque there was an  arched  arcade  porch  with  three  small  domes.

        "wiki": "Belgrade ( BEL-grayd; Serbian: Beograd / \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, lit. 'White City', pronounced [be\u01d2\u0261rad] (listen); names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of Serbia. It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula. Nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade, a quarter of the total population of Serbia.One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vin\u010da culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and, after 279 BC, Celts settled the city, naming it Singid\u016bn. It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284. Belgrade served as capital of the Serbian Despotate during the reign of Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, and then his successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the Ottoman Empire during the siege in 1456 have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars. \nIn the period after the Serbian Revolution, Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when it was attached to the city, due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming the part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes after World War I. Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia from its creation in 1918 to its dissolution in 2006. In a fatally strategic position, the city has been battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times, being bombed five times and besieged many times.Being Serbia's primate city, Belgrade has special administrative status within Serbia. It is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and government ministries, as well as home of almost all of the largest Serbian companies, media, and scientific institutions. Belgrade is classified as a Beta-Global City. The city is home to the Clinical Centre of Serbia, one of the hospital complexes with the largest capacity in the world, and the Church of Saint Sava, one of the largest Orthodox church buildings. Belgrade hosted major international events such as the first Non-Aligned Movement Summit (1961), the first major gathering of the OSCE (1977\u20131978), Eurovision Song Contest (2008), as well as sports events such as the first FINA World Aquatics Championships (1973), UEFA Euro (1976), Summer Universiade (2009) and EuroBasket three-times.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nChipped stone tools found in Zemun show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools are of Mousterian industry\u2014belonging to Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered near the area, indicating some settlement between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic Star\u010devo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Star\u010devo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Star\u010devo. The Star\u010devo culture was succeeded by the Vin\u010da culture (5500\u20134500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Star\u010devo settlements and also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo). The Vin\u010da culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe. Also associated with the Vin\u010da culture are anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vin\u010da, the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe, and a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans known as the Old European script, which dates back to around 5300 BC. Within the city proper, on Cetinjska Street, a skull of a Paleolithic human was discovered in 1890. The skull is dated to before 5000 BC.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nEvidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from a variety of ancient myths and legends. The ridge overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, for example, has been identified as one of the places in the story of Jason and the Argonauts. In the time of antiquity, too, the area was populated by Paleo-Balkan tribes, including the Thracians and the Dacians, who ruled much of Belgrade's surroundings. Specifically, Belgrade was at one point inhabited by the Thraco-Dacian tribe Singi; following Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci wrested the city from their hands, naming it Singid\u016bn (d|\u016bn, fortress). In 34\u201333 BC, the Roman army, led by Silanus, reached Belgrade. It became the romanised Singidunum in the 1st century AD and, by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a municipium by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged colonia (the highest city class) by the end of the century. While the first Christian Emperor of Rome \u2014Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great\u2014was born in the territory of Naissus to the city's south, Roman Christianity's champion, Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), was born in Singidunum. Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate. In 395 AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun); the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 442, the area was ravaged by Attila the Hun. In 471, it was taken by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, who continued into Italy. As the Ostrogoths left, another Germanic tribe, the Gepids, invaded the city. In 539 it was retaken by the Byzantines. In 577, some 100,000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum, pillaging cities and more permanently settling the region. The Avars, under Bayan I, conquered the whole region and its new Slavic population by 582. Following Byzantine reconquest, the Byzantine chronicle De Administrando Imperio mentions the White Serbs, who had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home, asking the strategos for lands; they received provinces in the west, towards the Adriatic, which they would rule as subjects to Heraclius (610\u2013641). In 829, Khan Omurtag was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire.The first record of the name Belograd appeared on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal missive to Bulgarian ruler Boris I. This name would appear in several variants: Alba Bulgarica in Latin, Griechisch Weissenburg in High German, N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, and Castelbianco in Venetian, among other names, all variations of 'white fortress'. For about four centuries, the city would become a battleground between the Byzantine Empire, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and the Bulgarian Empire. Basil II (976\u20131025) installed a garrison in Belgrade. The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade, but, while passing through during the Third Crusade, Frederick Barbarossa and his 190,000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins.\nKing Stefan Dragutin (r. 1276\u20131282) received Belgrade from his father-in-law, Stephen V of Hungary, in 1284, and it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Syrmia, a vassal state to the Kingdom of Hungary. Dragutin (Hungarian: Dragutin Istv\u00e1n) is regarded as the first Serbian king to rule over Belgrade.Following the battles of Maritsa (1371) and Kosovo field (1389), Moravian Serbia, to Belgrade's south, began to fall to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe northern sections of what is now Serbia persisted as the Serbian Despotate, with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, the son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107. Lazarevi\u0107 built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and the west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist Ottoman conquest for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 people.In 1427, Stefan's successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107, returning Belgrade to the Hungarian king, made Smederevo his new capital. Even though the Ottomans had captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456. As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule and Austrian invasions ===\n\nSeven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by Suleiman the Magnificent, 250,000 Turkish soldiers, and over 100 ships. Subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest. Belgrade was made the seat of the Pashalik of Belgrade (also known as the Sanjak of Smederevo), and quickly became the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople. Ottoman rule introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, and the city was resurrected\u2014now by Oriental influences. In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vra\u010dar plateau; in the 20th century, the church of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.Occupied by the Habsburgs three times (1688\u20131690, 1717\u20131739, 1789\u20131791), headed by the Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy, and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon, respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time. During this period, the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations, in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by two Serbian Patriarchs, retreated together with the Austrian soldiers into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's Vojvodina and Slavonia.\n\n\n=== Principality of Serbia ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population. Traces of Ottoman rule and architecture\u2014such as mosques and bazaars, were to remain a prominent part of Belgrade's townscape into the 19th century; several decades, even, after Serbia was granted autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.During the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans. After the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Serbia achieved some sort of sovereignty, which was formally recognised by the Porte in 1830.The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of neoclassicist and baroque buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by St Michael's Cathedral (Serbian: Saborna crkva), completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular Romanticism, along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an eclecticist style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.\n\nIn 1841, Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 moved the capital of the Principality of Serbia from Kragujevac to Belgrade. During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (mahalas). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pa\u0161ina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pa\u0161ina, Bajram-begova and Laz Had\u017ei-Mahmudova. Following the \u010cukur Fountain incident, Belgrade was bombed by the Ottomans.On 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from Kalemegdan. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's de facto independence dates from this event. In the following years, urban planner Emilijan Josimovi\u0107 had a significant impact on Belgrade. He conceptualised a regulation plan for the city in 1867, in which he proposed the replacement of the town's crooked streets with a grid plan. Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimovi\u0107's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul\u2014the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia de jure still belonged\u2014underwent similar changes.In May 1868, knez Mihailo was assassinated with his cousin Anka Konstantinovi\u0107 while riding in a carriage in his country residence.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Serbia ===\n\nWith the Principality's full independence in 1878 and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly. Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to Ni\u0161, Serbia's second city. In 1900, the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants (at the time Serbia numbered 2.5 million). Still, by 1905, the population had grown to more than 80,000 and, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, disregarding Zemun, which still belonged to Austria-Hungary.The first-ever projection of motion pictures in the Balkans and Central Europe was held in Belgrade in June 1896 by Andr\u00e9 Carr, a representative of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers. He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have not been preserved. The first permanent cinema was opened in 1909 in Belgrade.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nThe First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. Austro-Hungarian monitors shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the Austro-Hungarian Army under General Oskar Potiorek on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by Serbian troops under Marshal Radomir Putnik. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, starting on 6 October 1915, Belgrade fell to German and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen on 9 October of the same year. The city was liberated by Serbian and French troops on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey of France and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Belgrade, decimated as a front-line city, lost the title of largest city in the Kingdom to Subotica for some time.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n\nAfter the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom was split into banovinas and Belgrade, together with Zemun and Pan\u010devo, formed a separate administrative unit.During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (with the inclusion of Zemun), and to 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in 1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. The Pan\u010devo Bridge, which crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935, while King Alexander Bridge over the Sava was opened in 1934. On 3 September 1939 the first Belgrade Grand Prix, the last Grand Prix motor racing race before the outbreak of World War II, was held around the Belgrade Fortress and was followed by 80,000 spectators. The winner was Tazio Nuvolari.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 25 March 1941, the government of regent Crown Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'\u00e9tat led by Air Force commander General Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107, who proclaimed King Peter II to be of age to rule the realm. As a result, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941, killing up to 2,274 people. Yugoslavia was then invaded by German, Italian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian forces. Belgrade was captured by subterfuge, with six German soldiers led by their officer Fritz Klingenberg feigning threatening size, forcing the city to capitulate. Belgrade was more directly occupied by the German Army in the same month and became the seat of the puppet Nedi\u0107 regime, headed by its namesake general. Some of today's parts of Belgrade were incorporated in the Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslavia, another puppet state, where Ustashe regime  carried out the Genocide of Serbs.During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz B\u00f6hme, the German Military Governor of Serbia. B\u00f6hme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. Belgrade became the first city in Europe to be declared by the Nazi occupation forces to be Judenfrei. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major \u017darko Todorovi\u0107 from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.Just like Rotterdam, which was devastated twice by both German and Allied bombing, Belgrade was bombed once more during World War II, this time by the Allies on 16 April 1944, killing at least 1,100 people. This bombing fell on the Orthodox Christian Easter. Most of the city remained under German occupation until 20 October 1944, when it was liberated by the Red Army and the Communist Yugoslav Partisans. On 29 November 1945, Marshal Josip Broz Tito proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade (later to be renamed to Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 7 April 1963). Higher estimates from the former secret police place the victim count of political persecutions in Belgrade at 10,000.\n\n\n=== Socialist Yugoslavia ===\nWhen the war ended, the city was left with 11,500 demolished housing units. During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the renewed Yugoslavia, developing as a major industrial centre. In 1948, construction of New Belgrade started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of Non-Aligned Countries was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built. In 1968, major student protests led to several street clashes between students and the police.In 1972, Belgrade faced smallpox outbreak, the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe since World War II. Between October 1977 and March 1978, the city hosted the first major gathering of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe with the aim of implementing the Helsinki Accords from, while in 1980 Belgrade hosted the UNESCO General Conference. Josip Broz Tito died in May 1980 and his funeral in Belgrade was attended by high officials and state delegations from 128 of the 154 members of the United Nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain, based on which it became one of the largest funerals in history.\n\n\n=== Breakup of Yugoslavia ===\n\nOn 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 were held in the city against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets to restore order. Many anti-war protests were held in Belgrade, while the most massive protests was dedicated to solidarity with the victims from the besieged Sarajevo. Further anti-government protests were held in Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud in local elections. These protests brought Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who did not belong to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia.In 1999, during the Kosovo War, NATO bombings caused damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were various ministry buildings, the RTS building, hospitals, Hotel Jugoslavija, the Central Committee building, Avala Tower, and the Chinese embassy. After the Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe, while more than third settled in Belgrade.After the 2000 presidential elections, Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people on the streets. These demonstrations resulted in the ousting of president Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as a part of the Otpor! movement.\n\n\n=== Modern Belgrade ===\n\nIn 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, an urban renewal project, was initiated by the Government of Serbia and its Emirati partner, Eagle Hills Properties. Aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy, the project hopes to revitalise the Sava amphitheatre, a neglected expanse on the right bank of the Sava river between the Belgrade Fair and the former Belgrade Main railway station. Around \u20ac3.5 billion will be jointly invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and the envisioned 'Belgrade Tower'. The project is, however, quite controversial\u2014there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, and its architecture's arguable lack of harmony with the rest of the city.\nApart from Belgrade Waterfront, the city is under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of Novi Beograd, where many apartment and office buildings are under construction to support the burgeoning IT sector, now one of Serbia's largest economic players.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBelgrade lies 116.75 metres (383.0 ft) above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, Kalemegdan, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, New Belgrade was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like Krnja\u010da, Kote\u017e and Bor\u010da, also merged with the city, while Pan\u010devo, a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of 360 square kilometres (140 sq mi), while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223 km2 (1,244 sq mi).\nOn the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m (994 ft). The mountains of Avala (511 m (1,677 ft)) and Kosmaj (628 m (2,060 ft)) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus.One of the characteristics of the city terrain is mass wasting. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. Downhill creeps are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the clay or loam soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in Karaburma, Zvezdara, Vi\u0161njica, Vin\u010da and Ritopek, in the Danube valley, and Umka, and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire Terazije slope above the Sava (Kalemegdan, Savamala), which can be seen by the inclination of the Pobednik monument and the tower of the Cathedral Church, and the Vo\u017edovac section, between Banjica and Autokomanda.\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardo\u0161, \u0106ukovac and Kalvarija. \n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBelgrade has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), according to K\u00f6ppen climate classification, with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from 1.4 \u00b0C (34.5 \u00b0F) in January to 23.0 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.5 \u00b0C (54.5 \u00b0F). There are, on average, 31 days a year when the temperature is above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and 95 days when the temperature is above 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F).

The Assembly of the City of Belgrade has 110 members, elected on four-year terms. A 13-member City Council, elected by the Assembly and presided over by the mayor and his deputy, has the control and supervision of the city administration, which manages day-to-day administrative affairs. It is divided into 14 Secretariats, each having a specific portfolio such as traffic or health care, and several professional services, agencies and institutes.The 2014 Belgrade City Assembly election was won by the Serbian Progressive Party, which formed a ruling coalition with the Socialist Party of Serbia.

The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions.\n\nThe oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish t\u00fcrbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dor\u0107ol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Serbo-Byzantine Revival are present in buildings such as House of Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gra\u010danica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.In the socialist period, housing was built quickly and cheaply for the huge influx of people fleeing the countryside following World War II, sometimes resulting in the brutalist architecture of the blokovi ('blocks') of New Belgrade; a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Trade Union Hall. However, in the mid-1950s, modernist trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture.\nBelgrade has the second oldest sewer system in Europe.

Many criticised the move at the time due to the cost and the size of the building, and it soon became the gathering point of the Principality's wealthiest citizens. Colloquially, the building was also referred to as the staro zdanje, or the 'old edifice'. It remained a hotel until 1903 before being demolished in 1938. After the staro zdanje, numerous hotels were built in the second half of the 19th century: Nacional and Grand, also in Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac, Srpski Kralj, Srpska Kruna, Gr\u010dka Kraljica near Kalemegdan, Balkan and Pariz in Terazije, London, etc.As Belgrade became connected via steamboats and railway (after 1884), the number of visitors grew and new hotels were open with the ever luxurious commodities. In Savamala, the hotels Bosna and Bristol were opened. Other hotels included Solun and Orient, which was built near the Financial Park. Tourists which arrived by the Orient Express mostly stayed at the Petrograd Hotel in Wilson Square. Hotel Srpski Kralj, at the corner of Uzun Mirkova and Pariska Street was considered the best hotel in Belgrade during the Interbellum. It was destroyed during World War II.The historic areas and buildings of Belgrade are among the city's premier attractions.

The BusPlus ticketing system based on contactless smart cards began operating in February 2012. Daily connections link the capital to other towns in Serbia and many other European destinations through the city's central bus station.\nBeovoz was the suburban/commuter railway network that provided mass-transit services in the city, similar to Paris's RER and Toronto's GO Transit. The main usage of system was to connect the suburbs with the city centre. Beovoz was operated by Serbian Railways. However, this system was abolished back in 2013, mostly due to introduction of more efficient BG Voz. Belgrade is one of the last big European capitals and cities with over a million people to have no metro or subway or other rapid transit system, though Belgrade Metro is in its planning stages.\n\nThe new Belgrade Centre railway station is the hub for almost all the national and international trains. The high-speed rail that will connect Belgrade with Novi Sad, Subotica and Budapest is under construction, with the first half of 2020s planned for its beginning of operation.\nThe city is placed along the Pan-European corridors X and VII. The motorway system provides for easy access to Novi Sad and Budapest to the north, Ni\u0161 to the south, and Zagreb to the west. Expressway is also toward Pan\u010devo and new Expressway construction toward Obrenovac (Montenegro) is scheduled for March 2017. Belgrade bypass is connecting the E70 and E75 motorways and is under construction.Situated at the confluence of two major rivers, the Danube and the Sava, Belgrade has 11 bridges, the most important of which are Branko's bridge, the Ada Bridge, Pupin Bridge and the Gazela Bridge, the last two of which connect the core of the city to New Belgrade. In addition, an 'inner magistral semi-ring' is almost done and include a new Ada Bridge across the Sava river and a new Pupin Bridge across Danube river, which eased commuting within the city and unload the Gazela and Branko's bridge traffic.The Port of Belgrade is on the Danube, and allows the city to receive goods by river. The city is also served by Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) west of the city centre, near Sur\u010din. At its peak in 1986, almost 3 million passengers travelled through the airport, though that number dwindled to a trickle in the 1990s. Following renewed growth in 2000, the number of passengers reached approximately 2 million in 2004 and 2005, over 2.6 million passengers in 2008, reaching over 3 million passengers. All-time peak, with over 4 million passengers, was accomplished in 2014, when Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport became the second fastest growing major airport in Europe.\n\n\n== International cooperation and honours ==\n\nList of Belgrade's sister and twin cities:\n Coventry, UK, since 1957\n Chicago, USA, since 2005\n Ljubljana, Slovenia, since 2010\n Skopje, North Macedonia, since 2012\n Shanghai, China, since 2018Other friendships and cooperations, protocols, memorandums:\n\nSome of the city's municipalities are also twinned to small cities or districts of other big cities; for details see their respective articles.\nBelgrade has received various domestic and international honours, including the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur (proclaimed 21 December 1920; Belgrade is one of four cities outside France, alongside Li\u00e8ge, Luxembourg and Volgograd, to receive this honour), the Czechoslovak War Cross (awarded 8 October 1925), the Yugoslavian Order of the Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star (awarded 18 May 1939) and the Yugoslavian Order of the People's Hero (proclaimed on 20 October 1974, the 30th anniversary of the overthrow of Nazi German occupation during World War II).

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Ada Bridge (Serbian: \u041c\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0410\u0434\u0438, romanized: Most na Adi) is a cable-stayed bridge over the Sava river in Belgrade, Serbia. The bridge crosses the tip of Ada Ciganlija island, connecting the municipalities of \u010cukarica and New Belgrade. The bridge pylon is located on the tip of the island, which has been reinforced with large amounts of concrete and has been slightly enlarged to provide stronger foundations. Construction began in 2008, and the bridge opened on 1 January 2012. Adjoining roads were completed in 2013.Immediately after the design has been announced, it polarized both the professionals and politicians. Those who were in favor of the bridge claimed it is the most beautiful and the most functional of all Belgrade bridges, while those against it called it a megalomaniacal, too expensive and unnecessary. Still, since its opening in 2012, the bridge became one of the symbols of the city and \"inescapable d\u00e9cor in music videos and movies\", but also in video cards, commercials, etc. It is referred to as the \"most representative bridge in the capital\".\n\n\n== Location ==\nAda Bridge is the most upstream Belgrade bridge over the Sava river within the urban area. The bridge provides the only direct connection between the New Belgrade (Blokovi) and \u010cukarica (Banovo Brdo) municipalities. The bridge pylon is located on the tip of the Ada Ciganlija island.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1923, architect \u0110or\u0111e Kovaljevski created the first urbanization plan of the area that envisaged a bridge over Ada Ciganlija. The initial idea of what is today known as the Belgrade Inner City Semi-Ring Road, to which the bridge is an important part, were created at that time. This road was part of several plans under different names such as the Main Ring Road, Transverse Road, Eastern Tangent Road, each with slightly different routes. All the plans had one thing in common: the Ada Ciganlija Bridge. In early plans the bridge was placed closer to the Lake while the final project placed the bridge on the very tip of the island due to ecological concerns over the lake.After World War II, when Belgrade was left without any motorway bridges over the Sava, this route had no precedence, as narrower and closer to downtown locations had a priority. The project was pushed aside until the early 2000s.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name was chosen by the popular vote, though the name Most na Adi (literally, Bridge on Ada) became a colloquial name for the bridge already during its construction. Novi most (New bridge) is a frequently used unofficial name for the bridge. Among the other proposed names was Harfa (the harp), because of its look. Some of the linguists asserted that the only correct version can be only Most preko Ade (Bridge across, or over, Ada) but their other colleagues said that this version is correct, too.\n\n\n== Design ==\n\nThe competition for the preliminary design of the bridge was held in 2004. Twelve companies submitted bids, with the winning design by the Slovenian company Ponting. The bridge designers were the architects Viktor Markelj and Peter Gabrijel\u010di\u010d. The winning conceptual design was unanimously selected by the jury which was chaired by Nikola Hajdin, President of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts and the architect of the New Railroad Bridge. The Belgrade Association of Architects also endorsed the project, assessing it as contemporary and relevant to the future skyline of Belgrade. The design was awarded the first prize by the Hajdin's jury in 2005 and was officially selected in 2006.The bridge is a cable-stayed design with a single pylon. The foundation for the pylon is a circular diaphragm wall with 113 bored piles. The main span is constructed from 8,600 tons of bridge construction steel (grade S355J2+N), supported by 80 stay cables, and is counterbalanced by a post-tensioned, reinforced concrete back span of 200 m (660 ft). The approach towards New Belgrade is constructed as a 388m post-tensioned, reinforced concrete side span as continuous beam box girder with a similar arrangement of deck as the back span. Component parts of the deck were manufactured in China and delivered in transportable units on a sea and river-route via Rotterdam through the Rhine\u2013Main\u2013Danube Canal to the pre-assembly yard next to the construction site at Mala Ciganlija in Belgrade. The stay cables used to support the bridge deck have a maximum length of approximately 373 m (1,224 ft), and in total 1280 tons of high grade steel is used for the 80 cables with up to 91 strands.The bridge is designed to significantly reduce traffic passing through the city centre, up to 40%, and the older Gazela Bridge. The traffic over the bridge is projected at 12,000 vehicles per hour. There is also a possibility that it will be used for the future Belgrade Metro lines. It is also planned to be part of the future Belgrade Inner City Semi-Ring Road. It will have three road lanes and a tram (light rail) track in each direction.\n\n\n== Construction ==\n\n\n=== Bridge ===\n\nAccording to the original, \"most optimistic\" plans, the bridge was to be finished in 2008. However, it was a year when the construction began. In December 2008 the main works started on the right bank of the Sava, when the testing piers for the first pillar, out of seven in total. The deadline was 40 months and the projected cost \u20ac118 million. It soon became apparent that the price will be higher while the problems showed on the ground. Several constructors went bankrupt and it appeared that the deadline might be extended a lot. However, the construction continued as planned and the two sides of the bridge were connected in August 2011. Later that year the construction ended and the bridge was opened to public traffic on 1 January 2012 at 00:00, when crowds of citizens and tourists gathered, crossing over it.The design envisioned the grid-like cone to be placed on top of the pylon, but as of September 2018 it appears that the idea was scrapped altogether. In May 2012, the placement of the cone carried by a helicopter was attempted, but due to the strong winds the operation was aborted and rescheduled for some other time. After the government change in 2013, it was claimed that the entire new paperwork was needed to install the top, but nothing has been done.\n\n\n=== Other parts of the project ===\nThough in use since January 2012, by December 2017 the official exploitation permit still hasn't been issued for the bridge. In the summer of 2017, the bridge was connected to the To\u0161in Bunar Street, via the newly constructed boulevard which was named after the combatants in the 1998 Battle of Ko\u0161are. As of January 2018 there are still three major construction undertakings for the bridge to become fully functional as projected and to fulfill its intended purpose. The ventures include the tram tracks laying, construction of the road connections towards the neighborhood of Rakovica and drilling of the Top\u010dider tunnel.In 2016, city officials announced that the first trams will cross over the bridge in 2017. But a request for tender, concerning the construction of the tram tracks over the bridge, was distributed by the city government only in December 2016, and it failed. It was repeated in December 2017. The project included 2.7 km (1.7 mi) of a new, dual gauge tracks, with connections to the existing routes in New Belgrade and Banovo Brdo. Deadline for the tender was January 2018, so the trams should become operational in 2019. From the New Belgrade side, the connection was made at the \u0110or\u0111a Stanojevi\u0107a Street, continuing over the embankment and the northern access road to the center of the bridge. On \u010cukarica side, it was connected to the existing route at the border of Banovo Brdo and Rakovica. Places for the future additional tram stations, right at the ending points of the bridge, were already allocated. Among the other additional works, the already existing elevated track across the Top\u010diderka river, was removed but the pillars were preserved and used for the new track bridge. Some preparatory works began in March 2018 and later that month city signed a contract with \"Energoprojekt holding\", which won the bidding. Construction was to last for 420 days. After a month-long testing, the tram traffic across the bridge started on 4 July 2019. Initially, two lines crossed the bridge: No. 11L (Ta\u0161majdan-Block 45) and No. 13 (Banovo Brdo-Block 45). However, six months after the opening, works on the tracks continued, while the new tender in December 2019 revealed numerous flaws in the previous project, citing \"incomprehensible reasons\".The construction of the road connection with Rakovica includes the relocation of the Top\u010diderka riverbed for 1 km (0.62 mi), construction of a new bridge across the Pere Velimirovi\u0107a Steeet in Rakovica's neighborhood of Kanarevo Brdo and reconstruction and widening of the Bulevar patrijarha Pavla which is designated to be the most important traffic route in this part of Belgrade. It is envisioned as the main transit corridor which would connect the European route E75 (Belgrade-Ni\u0161 highway), New Belgrade, Ada Bridge, Patrijarha Dimitrija Street, Ibar Highway, Kru\u017eni put and the Belgrade bypass. As of January 2018, the timeline of this project is unknown, as only a partial request for tendering was announced. The works on the relocation of the river began on 1 March 2018, and the road bridge became operational on 22 March 2019.For the Top\u010dider tunnel, which would directly connect the bridge with Autokomanda interchange on the European route E75, the detailed regulatory plan and the conceptual design are finished and the tendering for the project was announced for later in 2018. The bridge was finally granted the exploitation permit in December 2019, after already being in use for 8 years.\n\n\n=== Contractors ===\nThe construction was commissioned by the Belgrade Land Development Public Agency and co-financed by the City of Belgrade, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank and several private financiers.The contract for a Project Manager and Engineer was awarded to Louis Berger Group. Their job was to provide support to the City of Belgrade in all aspects of project cycle management, including design review, preparation of works documentation, procurement, works supervision and contract administration.Engineering and construction of the bridge was awarded to a consortium of three companies, Porr AG from Austria, Slovenija ceste Tehnika from Slovenia and DSD Br\u00fcckenbau GmbH from Germany. The consortium engaged several subcontractors, including Leonhardt, Andr\u00e4 und Partner from Germany, China Railway Shanhaiguan Bridge Group from China, Vorspann Technik from Germany, BBR from Switzerland, the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Mining and Geology, Eusani-Hortmanns-Zahlten Ingenieurgesellschaft from Germany, Ponting from Slovenia, BBV from Germany and the Institute Kirilo Savi\u0107 from Belgrade. The North Approach Road's detailed design was by Hidroprojekt \u2013 saobra\u0107aj from Belgrade. the South Approach Road's detailed design was by Centar za puteve Vojvodine from Novi Sad, and the Pa\u0161troviceva Street detailed design was by IM Projekt from Belgrade.\n\n\n== Controversies ==\nAs soon as the design was revealed, the criticism of the project began. Everything about the bridge was disapproved, starting with the location itself, which some labeled as wrong. The environmentalist claimed it will destroy the habitat of the pygmy cormorant, which winters in great numbers on the Ada Ciganlija and the \u010cukarica Bay. The size was also denounced and the bridge was labeled as a megalomaniacal project. The general appearance and the price of the bridge were blasted with questions being asked about the design (why it has a 200 m (660 ft) high pylon or the stays) or it has been proclaimed as unnecessary in general.Only when it was open for traffic, it was announced that the total costs of the project, including the access roads and interchanges will be over \u20ac400 million. Also, it was clear that the bridge won't work in its full capacity for a long time as numerous other parts of the projects remained unfinished or just on the paper.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nAda bridge was featured in the fifth episode, season nine of the Discovery Channel documentary television series Build It Bigger.The bridge became one of the symbols of Belgrade. It became a \"must\" in the music videos, TV serials or movies shot in Belgrade. It is filmed in numerous commercials, video cards and photo shoots.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBridges of Belgrade\nList of bridges in Serbia\nList of road\u2013rail bridges\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSava Bridge project official website\nProject calendar\nBelgrade Land Development Public Agency\nDecorative illuminations of Ada Bridge on 30 December\nVideo from the bridge opening, New Year's Eve 2011/2012",

        "wiki": "The Military Museum (Serbian Latin: Vojni muzej) is a museum located in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. Founded in 1878, the museum has over 3,000 ancient and modern items. These include Roman swords and helmets, Greek helmets and daggers, Serbian heavy knight's armor, axes, shields, helmets, crossbows, armoured gloves, as well as Western medieval weapons. There are also more modern guns, firearms, and elements of soldier's uniforms and equipment. Dioramas, plaques, and displays illustrate the use and historical context of the museum's collection.\n\nInside the museum's main building, the exhibits are found in a single long hall progressing from ancient through medieval and then towards modern. All exhibits are labeled in the Serbian Language in both Cyrillic and Latin, as well as English. Outside the museum's main building, there are numerous tanks, howitzers, and armoured cars of many types. Some were acquired during World War II, when they were captured by the Red Army and Yugoslav Partisans from retreating Nazi and Axis forces (Belgrade Offensive). These decommissioned tanks and artillery pieces line the walls and paths leading into the Military Museum from two directions. Recent exhibits address NATO actions against Serbia in 1999, including the controversial use of cluster bombs, depleted uranium, and graphite bombs, some of which are claimed to be in violation of international law. A well-known exhibit features parts of a US F-117 stealth aircraft which was downed by a Serbian S-125 Neva/Pechora.\nThe Military Museum is located inside the walls of the historic Belgrade Fortress, situated at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. The Belgrade Fortress is located within a popular park known as the Kalemegdan Park, near the center of the city.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n=== Outer Exhibition ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Inside Exhibition ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

          "it has a nice collection of cars but its rather small ... and cold inside..the coffee shop inside was closed..its ok for a visit if you have children",
          "I\u2019ve been to car museums all over the world, and this one is the most lacking in information. Some of the cars didn\u2019t even say what model they were- but there was paint on the floor. I would have liked to know what make, model and year at a MINIMUM! And additional information",
          "This is a great car museum with a lot of many old and lovely cars! The ticket price was only about 2 Euro. The only thing that could have been better was the entrance that could have been more visible. It's a small door and barely no sign outside which made us think it was close",
          "This is one of the most interesting car museums we have visited. Great collection of cars, motorcycles and memorabilia.",
          "Small and cosy museum, but very interesting if you like old cars. Very low entrance fee.It worths the visit.",
          "In the hearth of the Belgrade there is a place that you \"must\" visit if you are fan of the old cars . It is amasing collection of the old cars from the the early days of the autombile industry. All exibits are nicely displayed with short description and technical data. For small",
          "A very interesting place, especially for families with male kids. The museum hosts vehicles from different eras. The three-wheeled car driven by the midwives in the 60s was fun to see. Also loved seeing some old models from the early automobile industry.",
          "This place had unexpected combination of things to do in Automobile Museum. We were there to see a theater show. Show selection and ambiance for it great. Very personal and very close coupled with audience. Display of old vehicles you would never expect to find in Belgrade, and",
          "A wonderful display of various cars...both for racing and everyday use that spans a good chunk of the 20th century...great for any car enthusiast:-)",
          "My boyfriend found this place while looking the google maps so we said to check it. We finded easily through navigator and because the ticket costed only 200 dinars we went inside. It is a personal collection actuallyand not very big but the cars are in a very good condition and",
          "Heaven for all car lovers. Thanks to Mr. Perica Lukovi\u0107, presently there is, beside gasoline cars dating from the beginning of 20th century, the exhibition of history of electric cars.",
          "Why this title? Well, it\u2019s a small museum with an interesting car collection, but the museum is not well maintained. Put it another place and it will be much more appreciated. And I don\u2019t think it has 100 car unless some are not on display.",
          "The museum has a collection of some 100 cars not more. Considering it was part f a private collection, and that most of the restoration was done by enthusiastic efforts of the people running the museum It is a vary intersting collection. The cars on display range from early 20",
          "It was a small museum but if you like cars specially the classic ones, you will enjoy it. Most of the cars were in good shape and there are different types of cars from different time periods. I think its worth to visit.",

        "wiki": "Belgrade ( BEL-grayd; Serbian: Beograd / \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, lit. 'White City', pronounced [be\u01d2\u0261rad] (listen); names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of Serbia. It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula. Nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade, a quarter of the total population of Serbia.One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vin\u010da culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and, after 279 BC, Celts settled the city, naming it Singid\u016bn. It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284. Belgrade served as capital of the Serbian Despotate during the reign of Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, and then his successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the Ottoman Empire during the siege in 1456 have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars. \nIn the period after the Serbian Revolution, Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when it was attached to the city, due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming the part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes after World War I. Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia from its creation in 1918 to its dissolution in 2006. In a fatally strategic position, the city has been battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times, being bombed five times and besieged many times.Being Serbia's primate city, Belgrade has special administrative status within Serbia. It is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and government ministries, as well as home of almost all of the largest Serbian companies, media, and scientific institutions. Belgrade is classified as a Beta-Global City. The city is home to the Clinical Centre of Serbia, one of the hospital complexes with the largest capacity in the world, and the Church of Saint Sava, one of the largest Orthodox church buildings. Belgrade hosted major international events such as the first Non-Aligned Movement Summit (1961), the first major gathering of the OSCE (1977\u20131978), Eurovision Song Contest (2008), as well as sports events such as the first FINA World Aquatics Championships (1973), UEFA Euro (1976), Summer Universiade (2009) and EuroBasket three-times.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nChipped stone tools found in Zemun show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools are of Mousterian industry\u2014belonging to Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered near the area, indicating some settlement between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic Star\u010devo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Star\u010devo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Star\u010devo. The Star\u010devo culture was succeeded by the Vin\u010da culture (5500\u20134500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Star\u010devo settlements and also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo). The Vin\u010da culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe. Also associated with the Vin\u010da culture are anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vin\u010da, the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe, and a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans known as the Old European script, which dates back to around 5300 BC. Within the city proper, on Cetinjska Street, a skull of a Paleolithic human was discovered in 1890. The skull is dated to before 5000 BC.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nEvidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from a variety of ancient myths and legends. The ridge overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, for example, has been identified as one of the places in the story of Jason and the Argonauts. In the time of antiquity, too, the area was populated by Paleo-Balkan tribes, including the Thracians and the Dacians, who ruled much of Belgrade's surroundings. Specifically, Belgrade was at one point inhabited by the Thraco-Dacian tribe Singi; following Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci wrested the city from their hands, naming it Singid\u016bn (d|\u016bn, fortress). In 34\u201333 BC, the Roman army, led by Silanus, reached Belgrade. It became the romanised Singidunum in the 1st century AD and, by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a municipium by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged colonia (the highest city class) by the end of the century. While the first Christian Emperor of Rome \u2014Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great\u2014was born in the territory of Naissus to the city's south, Roman Christianity's champion, Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), was born in Singidunum. Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate. In 395 AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun); the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 442, the area was ravaged by Attila the Hun. In 471, it was taken by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, who continued into Italy. As the Ostrogoths left, another Germanic tribe, the Gepids, invaded the city. In 539 it was retaken by the Byzantines. In 577, some 100,000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum, pillaging cities and more permanently settling the region. The Avars, under Bayan I, conquered the whole region and its new Slavic population by 582. Following Byzantine reconquest, the Byzantine chronicle De Administrando Imperio mentions the White Serbs, who had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home, asking the strategos for lands; they received provinces in the west, towards the Adriatic, which they would rule as subjects to Heraclius (610\u2013641). In 829, Khan Omurtag was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire.The first record of the name Belograd appeared on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal missive to Bulgarian ruler Boris I. This name would appear in several variants: Alba Bulgarica in Latin, Griechisch Weissenburg in High German, N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, and Castelbianco in Venetian, among other names, all variations of 'white fortress'. For about four centuries, the city would become a battleground between the Byzantine Empire, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and the Bulgarian Empire. Basil II (976\u20131025) installed a garrison in Belgrade. The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade, but, while passing through during the Third Crusade, Frederick Barbarossa and his 190,000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins.\nKing Stefan Dragutin (r. 1276\u20131282) received Belgrade from his father-in-law, Stephen V of Hungary, in 1284, and it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Syrmia, a vassal state to the Kingdom of Hungary. Dragutin (Hungarian: Dragutin Istv\u00e1n) is regarded as the first Serbian king to rule over Belgrade.Following the battles of Maritsa (1371) and Kosovo field (1389), Moravian Serbia, to Belgrade's south, began to fall to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe northern sections of what is now Serbia persisted as the Serbian Despotate, with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, the son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107. Lazarevi\u0107 built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and the west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist Ottoman conquest for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 people.In 1427, Stefan's successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107, returning Belgrade to the Hungarian king, made Smederevo his new capital. Even though the Ottomans had captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456. As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule and Austrian invasions ===\n\nSeven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by Suleiman the Magnificent, 250,000 Turkish soldiers, and over 100 ships. Subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest. Belgrade was made the seat of the Pashalik of Belgrade (also known as the Sanjak of Smederevo), and quickly became the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople. Ottoman rule introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, and the city was resurrected\u2014now by Oriental influences. In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vra\u010dar plateau; in the 20th century, the church of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.Occupied by the Habsburgs three times (1688\u20131690, 1717\u20131739, 1789\u20131791), headed by the Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy, and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon, respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time. During this period, the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations, in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by two Serbian Patriarchs, retreated together with the Austrian soldiers into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's Vojvodina and Slavonia.\n\n\n=== Principality of Serbia ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population. Traces of Ottoman rule and architecture\u2014such as mosques and bazaars, were to remain a prominent part of Belgrade's townscape into the 19th century; several decades, even, after Serbia was granted autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.During the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans. After the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Serbia achieved some sort of sovereignty, which was formally recognised by the Porte in 1830.The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of neoclassicist and baroque buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by St Michael's Cathedral (Serbian: Saborna crkva), completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular Romanticism, along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an eclecticist style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.\n\nIn 1841, Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 moved the capital of the Principality of Serbia from Kragujevac to Belgrade. During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (mahalas). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pa\u0161ina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pa\u0161ina, Bajram-begova and Laz Had\u017ei-Mahmudova. Following the \u010cukur Fountain incident, Belgrade was bombed by the Ottomans.On 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from Kalemegdan. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's de facto independence dates from this event. In the following years, urban planner Emilijan Josimovi\u0107 had a significant impact on Belgrade. He conceptualised a regulation plan for the city in 1867, in which he proposed the replacement of the town's crooked streets with a grid plan. Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimovi\u0107's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul\u2014the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia de jure still belonged\u2014underwent similar changes.In May 1868, knez Mihailo was assassinated with his cousin Anka Konstantinovi\u0107 while riding in a carriage in his country residence.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Serbia ===\n\nWith the Principality's full independence in 1878 and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly. Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to Ni\u0161, Serbia's second city. In 1900, the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants (at the time Serbia numbered 2.5 million). Still, by 1905, the population had grown to more than 80,000 and, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, disregarding Zemun, which still belonged to Austria-Hungary.The first-ever projection of motion pictures in the Balkans and Central Europe was held in Belgrade in June 1896 by Andr\u00e9 Carr, a representative of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers. He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have not been preserved. The first permanent cinema was opened in 1909 in Belgrade.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nThe First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. Austro-Hungarian monitors shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the Austro-Hungarian Army under General Oskar Potiorek on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by Serbian troops under Marshal Radomir Putnik. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, starting on 6 October 1915, Belgrade fell to German and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen on 9 October of the same year. The city was liberated by Serbian and French troops on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey of France and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Belgrade, decimated as a front-line city, lost the title of largest city in the Kingdom to Subotica for some time.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n\nAfter the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom was split into banovinas and Belgrade, together with Zemun and Pan\u010devo, formed a separate administrative unit.During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (with the inclusion of Zemun), and to 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in 1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. The Pan\u010devo Bridge, which crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935, while King Alexander Bridge over the Sava was opened in 1934. On 3 September 1939 the first Belgrade Grand Prix, the last Grand Prix motor racing race before the outbreak of World War II, was held around the Belgrade Fortress and was followed by 80,000 spectators. The winner was Tazio Nuvolari.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 25 March 1941, the government of regent Crown Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'\u00e9tat led by Air Force commander General Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107, who proclaimed King Peter II to be of age to rule the realm. As a result, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941, killing up to 2,274 people. Yugoslavia was then invaded by German, Italian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian forces. Belgrade was captured by subterfuge, with six German soldiers led by their officer Fritz Klingenberg feigning threatening size, forcing the city to capitulate. Belgrade was more directly occupied by the German Army in the same month and became the seat of the puppet Nedi\u0107 regime, headed by its namesake general. Some of today's parts of Belgrade were incorporated in the Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslavia, another puppet state, where Ustashe regime  carried out the Genocide of Serbs.During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz B\u00f6hme, the German Military Governor of Serbia. B\u00f6hme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. Belgrade became the first city in Europe to be declared by the Nazi occupation forces to be Judenfrei. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major \u017darko Todorovi\u0107 from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.Just like Rotterdam, which was devastated twice by both German and Allied bombing, Belgrade was bombed once more during World War II, this time by the Allies on 16 April 1944, killing at least 1,100 people. This bombing fell on the Orthodox Christian Easter. Most of the city remained under German occupation until 20 October 1944, when it was liberated by the Red Army and the Communist Yugoslav Partisans. On 29 November 1945, Marshal Josip Broz Tito proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade (later to be renamed to Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 7 April 1963). Higher estimates from the former secret police place the victim count of political persecutions in Belgrade at 10,000.\n\n\n=== Socialist Yugoslavia ===\nWhen the war ended, the city was left with 11,500 demolished housing units. During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the renewed Yugoslavia, developing as a major industrial centre. In 1948, construction of New Belgrade started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of Non-Aligned Countries was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built. In 1968, major student protests led to several street clashes between students and the police.In 1972, Belgrade faced smallpox outbreak, the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe since World War II. Between October 1977 and March 1978, the city hosted the first major gathering of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe with the aim of implementing the Helsinki Accords from, while in 1980 Belgrade hosted the UNESCO General Conference. Josip Broz Tito died in May 1980 and his funeral in Belgrade was attended by high officials and state delegations from 128 of the 154 members of the United Nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain, based on which it became one of the largest funerals in history.\n\n\n=== Breakup of Yugoslavia ===\n\nOn 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 were held in the city against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets to restore order. Many anti-war protests were held in Belgrade, while the most massive protests was dedicated to solidarity with the victims from the besieged Sarajevo. Further anti-government protests were held in Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud in local elections. These protests brought Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who did not belong to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia.In 1999, during the Kosovo War, NATO bombings caused damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were various ministry buildings, the RTS building, hospitals, Hotel Jugoslavija, the Central Committee building, Avala Tower, and the Chinese embassy. After the Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe, while more than third settled in Belgrade.After the 2000 presidential elections, Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people on the streets. These demonstrations resulted in the ousting of president Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as a part of the Otpor! movement.\n\n\n=== Modern Belgrade ===\n\nIn 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, an urban renewal project, was initiated by the Government of Serbia and its Emirati partner, Eagle Hills Properties. Aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy, the project hopes to revitalise the Sava amphitheatre, a neglected expanse on the right bank of the Sava river between the Belgrade Fair and the former Belgrade Main railway station. Around \u20ac3.5 billion will be jointly invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and the envisioned 'Belgrade Tower'. The project is, however, quite controversial\u2014there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, and its architecture's arguable lack of harmony with the rest of the city.\nApart from Belgrade Waterfront, the city is under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of Novi Beograd, where many apartment and office buildings are under construction to support the burgeoning IT sector, now one of Serbia's largest economic players.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBelgrade lies 116.75 metres (383.0 ft) above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, Kalemegdan, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, New Belgrade was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like Krnja\u010da, Kote\u017e and Bor\u010da, also merged with the city, while Pan\u010devo, a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of 360 square kilometres (140 sq mi), while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223 km2 (1,244 sq mi).\nOn the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m (994 ft). The mountains of Avala (511 m (1,677 ft)) and Kosmaj (628 m (2,060 ft)) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus.One of the characteristics of the city terrain is mass wasting. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. Downhill creeps are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the clay or loam soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in Karaburma, Zvezdara, Vi\u0161njica, Vin\u010da and Ritopek, in the Danube valley, and Umka, and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire Terazije slope above the Sava (Kalemegdan, Savamala), which can be seen by the inclination of the Pobednik monument and the tower of the Cathedral Church, and the Vo\u017edovac section, between Banjica and Autokomanda.\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardo\u0161, \u0106ukovac and Kalvarija. \n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBelgrade has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), according to K\u00f6ppen climate classification, with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from 1.4 \u00b0C (34.5 \u00b0F) in January to 23.0 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.5 \u00b0C (54.5 \u00b0F).

The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions.\n\nThe oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish t\u00fcrbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dor\u0107ol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Serbo-Byzantine Revival are present in buildings such as House of Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gra\u010danica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.In the socialist period, housing was built quickly and cheaply for the huge influx of people fleeing the countryside following World War II, sometimes resulting in the brutalist architecture of the blokovi ('blocks') of New Belgrade; a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Trade Union Hall. However, in the mid-1950s, modernist trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture.\nBelgrade has the second oldest sewer system in Europe.

Many criticised the move at the time due to the cost and the size of the building, and it soon became the gathering point of the Principality's wealthiest citizens. Colloquially, the building was also referred to as the staro zdanje, or the 'old edifice'. It remained a hotel until 1903 before being demolished in 1938. After the staro zdanje, numerous hotels were built in the second half of the 19th century: Nacional and Grand, also in Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac, Srpski Kralj, Srpska Kruna, Gr\u010dka Kraljica near Kalemegdan, Balkan and Pariz in Terazije, London, etc.As Belgrade became connected via steamboats and railway (after 1884), the number of visitors grew and new hotels were open with the ever luxurious commodities. In Savamala, the hotels Bosna and Bristol were opened. Other hotels included Solun and Orient, which was built near the Financial Park. Tourists which arrived by the Orient Express mostly stayed at the Petrograd Hotel in Wilson Square. Hotel Srpski Kralj, at the corner of Uzun Mirkova and Pariska Street was considered the best hotel in Belgrade during the Interbellum.

In addition, an 'inner magistral semi-ring' is almost done and include a new Ada Bridge across the Sava river and a new Pupin Bridge across Danube river, which eased commuting within the city and unload the Gazela and Branko's bridge traffic.The Port of Belgrade is on the Danube, and allows the city to receive goods by river. The city is also served by Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport, 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) west of the city centre, near Sur\u010din. At its peak in 1986, almost 3 million passengers travelled through the airport, though that number dwindled to a trickle in the 1990s. Following renewed growth in 2000, the number of passengers reached approximately 2 million in 2004 and 2005, over 2.6 million passengers in 2008, reaching over 3 million passengers. All-time peak, with over 4 million passengers, was accomplished in 2014, when Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport became the second fastest growing major airport in Europe.\n\n\n== International cooperation and honours ==\n\nList of Belgrade's sister and twin cities:\n Coventry, UK, since 1957\n Chicago, USA, since 2005\n Ljubljana, Slovenia, since 2010\n Skopje, North Macedonia, since 2012\n Shanghai, China, since 2018Other friendships and cooperations, protocols, memorandums:\n\nSome of the city's municipalities are also twinned to small cities or districts of other big cities; for details see their respective articles.\nBelgrade has received various domestic and international honours, including the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur (proclaimed 21 December 1920; Belgrade is one of four cities outside France, alongside Li\u00e8ge, Luxembourg and Volgograd, to receive this honour), the Czechoslovak War Cross (awarded 8 October 1925), the Yugoslavian Order of the Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star (awarded 18 May 1939) and the Yugoslavian Order of the People's Hero (proclaimed on 20 October 1974, the 30th anniversary of the overthrow of Nazi German occupation during World War II).

        "wiki": "Beo zoo vrt (Serbian: \u0411\u0435\u043e \u0437\u043e\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0442), also known as Vrt dobre nade (Garden of good hope), is a zoo located in Kalemegdan Park, downtown of Belgrade, Serbia. Founded on July, 12 1936, it is considered to be one of the oldest public zoos in southeastern Europe. The zoo covers 7 hectares (17 acres) and it houses a collection of approximately 150 animal species, with close to 2,000 individuals, making it the largest collection in Serbia. It's also recognized as one of the most visited tourist attractions in Belgrade.Belgrade zoo officially applied for EAZA membership in 2017.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Belgrade Zoological Garden was officially opened on 12 July 1936 by the mayor of Belgrade, Vlada Ili\u0107. The zoo was initially no larger than 3.5 hectares (8.6 acres), but was eventually expanded to about 14 hectares. It quickly became one of the most popular places with the locals and even members of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty, who were regulars at the zoo. First group of animals was purchased by mayor Ili\u0107 himself.During the Second World War, the zoo was bombed twice, by the Nazis in 1941 and by the Allies in 1944, heavily damaging the infrastructure and killing most of the animals. The zoo also lost seven hectares of land. The 1941 bombing of the zoo was described in Winston Churchill's The Second World War and Emir Kusturica's 1995 film Underground. Miodrag Savkovi\u0107, manager of the zoo during the World War II occupation, was arrested right away by the new Communist authorities, and shot, even though the charges against him nor his resting place are known.The zoo recovered over time but again faced tough times in the eighties. Animals were neglected and living in bad conditions. In 1984 the zoo received a pair of black rhinoceroses as a gift from the Prime Minister Robert Mugabe and the country of Zimbabwe. Unfortunately, they lived for just a couple of months due to bad care and lack of knowledge about this species. In 1989 Muammar Gaddafi also gave six of his Arabian camels. The government, under the pressure of real estate groups also unsuccessfully tried to appropriate the space to build luxurious hotels, casinos and nightclubs. Belgrade zoo was preserved thank to efforts from sculptor Vuk Bojovi\u0107, who served as the zoo's director between May 1, 1986 and his death on September 17, 2014. He received substantial recognition for his work through out the region. Bojovi\u0107 made various improvements to the living conditions of animals, brought numerous new species to the animal collection - most notably great apes, white tigers, and lions - changed the zoo's bad management, and made it a profitable business.\nDuring the tenure of mayor Dragan \u0110ilas (2008\u201313), the idea of expanding the zoo to Donji Grad, which it occupied prior to the World War II, resurfaced, but the experts and Bojovi\u0107 himself were against it. The urban plan for the fortress from 1965 already projected the complete relocation of the zoo outside of the fortress, on some of the suburban locations, which in later plans included Veliko Blato, Stepin Lug or Jelezovac. The expansion of the zoo would block the pedestrian pathways between the Danube's and Sava's parts of the fortress, which had been blocked in 1949 but then restored in 2009 with the reconstruction and opening of the Sava Gate. Also, it would prevent the exploration of Donji Grad, which is still largely unexplored and leave the Gate of Charles VI, a masterpiece of Balthasar Neumann, within the zoo itself. By 2017, the zoo had not relocated and the idea of expansion was dropped.\n\n\n== Animals and exhibits ==\nBelgrade zoo holds more than 1,700 animals of around 150 species. One of its biggest attractions are albino and white animals, which were collected by the former director Vuk Bojovi\u0107. In 2005, Belgrade zoo received white lions from Kruger National Park and since then has managed to successfully breed these animals. In 2007, Belgrade also became the only city in Europe to house a white buffalo. In June 2018, a white buffalo calf was born. A pair of white tigers can be seen at the zoo as well.The zoo is also active in conservation and species-preservation efforts of the endangered local fauna such as Balkan lynx and bearded vulture. In September 2018, the zoo reintroduced its first griffon vulture to the wild.\nIn late May of 2019, the zoo opened its penguinarium for seventeen newly arrived Humboldt penguins, which was the first time in thirty years that these birds were on a display in Belgrade.Other notable animal species in Belgrade zoo include:\n\nMammals such as red kangaroo, Parma wallaby, Asian elephant, Barbary macaque, silvery marmoset, Bornean orangutan, common chimpanzee, ring-tailed lemur, hippopotamus, Rothschild's giraffe, Bactrian camel, llama, alpaca, American bison, yak, dorcas gazelle, eland, red deer, fallow deer, reindeer, Himalayan thar, Siberian ibex, Barbary sheep, muflon, Grant's zebra, Brazilian tapir, Indian crested porcupine, Patagonian mara, spotted hyena, binturong, raccoon, white-nosed coati, jaguar, cheetah, serval, jungle cat, Arctic wolf, fennec fox, meerkat, honey badger, Oriental small-clawed otter, polar bear, Cape fur seal and harbor seal\nBirds such as ostrich, southern cassowary, emu, rhea, southern screamer, southern ground hornbill, trumpeter hornbill, black-necked aracari, burrowing parrot, grey parrot, red-and-green macaw, blue-and-yellow macaw, white-throated toucan, marabou stork, black swan, white spoonbill, American flamingo, several species of pheasant, guineafowl, Eurasian eagle-owl, white-tailed eagle, Steller's sea eagle, bearded vulture and Andean condor\nReptiles such as Cuban crocodile, spectacled caiman, leopard tortoise, rock monitor, Nile monitor, green iguana, boa constrictor, green anaconda, Burmese python, boa constrictor, emerald tree boa\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Notable animals ===\n\nThroughout its history, the zoo has had several residents, well known for their scientific importance or for being beloved by the public.\nSammy the chimpanzee was the first great ape to be displayed in the zoo. He received widespread public attention when he escaped from his cage just a month following his arrival in 1988. After an hour of wandering through Belgrade's downtown streets, Sammy was calmed down by the zoo's manager, Vuk Bojovi\u0107, who then placed him in his personal car and drove him back to his cage. The ape managed to escape again, just two days later, but was this time caught by using a tranquilizer gun.\nGabi was a German shepherd that saved her partner, a night guard, from an escaped jaguar. Though she was seriously wounded during the fight with the feline, she eventually recovered and continued her night guard duty.\nMuja is considered to be the world's oldest living alligator. He was transferred to Belgrade as an adult from an undocumented zoo in Germany in 1937.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPali\u0107 Zoo\nTourism in Serbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website (in Serbian)",

          "Went to the zoo and had a good time. Especially enjoyed the otters found them funny how they played with coin and were communicating to us humans in there way. Prehaps only improvement would be to make some of the smaller enclosures bigger as some of the animals looked a little",
          "The zoo is very nice with a good variety of animals. The enclosures though in many of them are extremely small. It's a outrageous. I felt very bad for many of the animals. They should try and copy other European zoo that respect more the animals in captivity.",

          "I haven\u2019t been. I decided I may check it out then came on here to look at reviews and am definitely not going to support this place. Don\u2019t go. Word of mouth is most important in these situations",
          "In every part of the world, I dislike the zoos. Because they give limited spaces to the animals. I visited this zoo in 2013 or earlier. I prefer protected natural parks.",
          "In short: don't go there. Though the ticket is only 500 RSD, I soon regretted attributing economically to this place. The living conditions for some of these animals were outright appalling. Cages were way to small, looked old and rusty and very dirty. A lot of the animals",
          "Visited with kids ages 8 & 10. They had a good variety of animals, and they appeared well cared for and healthy. The kids loved the monkeys and the kangaroos. My daughter even wanted to go back again the next day. There\u2019s a ropes course there that\u2019s worth doing for the kids.",

          "I have been at quite a few zoo's but this was awful. The cages are all rusted, rotten and very dirty. Far to small for most animals as well. Most animals are very distressed and some were showing open wounds! Never seen anything so dirty, the smell from some cages was awful.",
          "To be honest, I am very suprised that this place is still running. Whoever is managing the facility surely has other motivations than animal well-being. Some of them are kept in insensitive conditions, and I'd like to point out, highly intelligent animals. The primates are",

          "The zoo is very big and it has many animals, but anyway when my friends and I arrived in some cages there was no animals.. I think that it should be cleaner because for example in some cages I saw dead chickens..( Eagles killed them) Definitelly they need to work more on it.",
          "I have never seen sadder animals. The zoo stunk terribly, all the water we saw was filthy, including the seal\u2019s swimming pool, a lot of the animals looked ill and were in cages far too small and dirty. I hated it. It should be closed.",
          "The Belgrade Zoo is situating int he entry of Kalemegdan the most know park in Belgrade in which is situated also the Frtress od Kalemegdan. So, if you have enough time to visit the Fortress. the Millitary Museum (that is also there), you may spend some lovely time in Belgrade",
          "In generaly I don't like ZOOs, and I don't think it is fair to take animals from the nature and keep then in cages. So, I am for sure not objective. However, we visited ZOO in Zagreb few months ago and, comparing just to that place, this ZOO is terrible :( Animals live in",

          "We enjoyed it for around 90 minutes, walking slowly down the alleys. Many different animals, with English names and details for most of them. We enjoyed also an exhibition of cartoons with animals. Several food stalls to choose from (cotton candy, drinks etc). Available (free)",
          "There is a huge variety of animals, but especially cages for the wolves were way too small. Still you got the impression that the animals were well looked after by the staff. It's a bit strange seeing dead rats at the snake's enclosures, even though it's just their food. Overall",

          "What a pleasant surprise. Being FROM Africa we are accustomed to seeing a lot of animals and have teethed on game reserves and nature reserves. This would prove challenging to impress, by any measure for any zoo. Since the zoo in Dubai was a disgrace we had our doubts...but were",
          "The Belgrade zoo is situated next to Belgrade Fortress. Entrance ticket to the zoo was 500 RSD and although small and confined to a hill the zoo had a good collection of different animal and bird species.Among mammals spotted the Arctic wolf which resembled a overgrown albino",
          "We were all looking forward to a day out at the zoo,unfortunately it was not a day that I would wish to repeat soon. The enclosures were under repair and renovation, some.were completely empty. The signage is poor, the zoo unfortunately is not up to a European standard. I will",

          "Almost didn't visit the zoo as people said it's not woth it. How wrong they were! Possiblt the highlight of the trip to Belgrade, the zoo is located in Kalemegdan Park and is deceptive in its size and scope. A large range of animals that you can really get up close to for great",
          "Not the best zoo in the world for sure but for Serbia it will do I guess. Good for first timers to visit.",
          "This is a nice zoo with a good collection of animals. Kids enjoyed feeding the elephant ! The white tiger and lions were amazing Kids enjoyed a lot !",
          "Nice place to walk and see the animals. Most of them where out. They looked well feed. The sea lions were active swimmers.",
          "It looked great. Most of the abimals were out. The whole tour has been excelent where yoh couldn't tell if we or our youngest enjoy it more. Only thing is that there should be more zookeepers as there were some idiots feeding elephant with chip bag wrap.",
          "I maybe can\u2019t be objective because I practically grown up at Belgrade Zoo. A nice, cosy, clean place, with a lot of threes. There are few cafes placed in the deep shadows. The Zoo is not so big ,but large enough. A ticket is cheap and if we talk about value for money, you",

          "This zoo is small. You can walk around the entire thing in a couple hours. Lots of bird exhibits and some other animals. I think some of the enclosures don't give enough room for the animals though. Still worth checking out.",
          "First of all there was people walking around while eating popcorn and throwing food or stones at the animals if they were sleeping or not behaving like the audience was expecting. Regarding the area, there were too many animals and the small cages were situated precisely next",
          "Well if you like zoos, this one is close to the center of Belgrad and the Fortress. Cheep to get in and extend your walk in the city. Ok variety on spieses.",

          "When you first enter youre met with many birds of prey, falcons and even big eagles, in small cages. It gets better on later, but a lot of animals are in really small enclosures. There are a lot of different kinds of animals, they cover most of the things a zoo must have. Not",
          "Located in the center of the city, suitable for visit without transport, the zoo is attractive and exciting but nothing special comparing to big european cities",

          "The Belgrade zoo is one of the worst zoos in Europe. The animals are starving or some of them are totally sick. They should increase the price of the entrance and make sure that the animals are well taken care of. It's a pity affair to see these animals suffering :(",

          "It was very good time we spent in zoo. I was there with my mom and niece (11, 34 and 59 years old) we all liked it very much. Many interesting animals and birds. I recommend this place to all people who visit Belgrade (it doesn't matter with children or not).",
          "Great diversity of species. Clean, well maintained area for animals, especially for white tigers. Decent habitats for all other animals. You can't expect more if you take in consideration location of the Zoo. No anacondas, cobras, polar and grizzly bears :( Great Burmese albino",
          "A great zoo, with beautiful animal habitats. Every day there it's activities with the animals, they feeds them, plays with them and visitors enjoy it. There are rare species of animals. Albino Lion and Albino Tiger and many other interesting animals. It's worth visiting.",
          "I used to Take my Daughter there Very Often,when She was Little - She Loved it and I enjoined it Too!!!",
          "When looked at the map the zoo is small, but inside has a lot of animals. Unfortunately, this is because some of the animals have too small cages.",
          "excellent zoo , top 5 activite in Belgrade , children [ and not only ] will love it...... you 'll see WHITE lions ....",
          "This was the only place in Belgrade I completely disliked. The zoo is old and has little space. Most animals are kept in very small cages without any distraction. While some big cats have been moved to newer and better enclosures most animals are kept in an unworthy manner:",
          "This was the only place I disliked in Belgrade. It is an old zoo, located in the center of the city and both lack of space and outdated facilities mean that the poor animals located here have a horrible life. While some of the bigger cats have been moved to newer enclosures most",
          "The zoo was so dirty and the enclosures were the worst I\u2019ve ever seen. Badly maintained areas for the animals and such such small places for them to be kept in. There was hardly any grass or shade for them to sit on and it was stinking hot...all of the animals truly looked so",
          "You don't need kids to go and visit the zoo. It has a lot of animals. I liked the giraffes. It has coffee shops and benches for a rest. You will enjoy there!!!",
          "There are a lot of interesting and cute animals to see that kids will love such as meerkats, otters, seals and wallabies. Sure, the primates look a bit pitiful, I don't think they smeared faeces on the walls as a way to have fun... But, overall, the animals looked well taken",
          "The zoo was dirty and the caged animals seem to suffer and bored. We have seen many zoos around europe but this one was the dirtiest and the animals especially in the cages seemed miserable. I still think of that poor gorilla looking at the door searching for light and life.Rare",
          "Visited the zoo and walked the entire ground. The views of the animals were very good as you cold get very close to most of the animals",
          "There are so many different and interesting rare animals in the zoo. But their behaviours and physchology made us upset. Staying in a cage for a life time... They behave in a repeated, same mood.",
          "A dissapointing experience! I expected a well-kept zoo with plenty of space for the animals to wander around. Instead , we found smelly , confined cages with miserable animals , restricted in unhealthy conditions.",
          "This zoo is placed in old Kalemegdan fortres, with alot of white lions and othere rare animals. If you are tourist in Belgrade with children, you simply must go here, kids whill gona love it!",
          "So if u like animals zoo is of course place for u. Its very nice in a heart of Kalemegdan with a lot of animals and placec to enjoy in a family day or day with a friends. Kids just love Belgrade zoo because this is place with so much fun.",
          "We went to the Beligrad Zoo, which located in the fortress park, on January 2018 and although it was very cold and some of the animal cages were either getting renovated or were empty, still there were some very interesting animals to see and the nice thing about it was that for",
          "A pretty good zoo. Animals seem well taken care of and fed. The place is good for people of all ages. Yes, it is not good for an animal to live in cage but these cages look big enough.",
          "I was impressed to see animals from many and different species hosted in this small but very neat and tidy zoo. It is scarce to meet animals from such a great variety of species in a zoo! Unfortunately, the cages are very small! It is torture, a cruelty, to see a male lion",
          "Nearby there is also an amusement park and Kalemegdan fortress, and inside the zoo kids can also ride a pony.",
          "This place should be closed down , the abject misery the animals live in is criminal. I felt tearful and I left feeling very sad.",
          "It is beside Belgrade fortress , so you can visit them together. It is a small zoo but good one. You can feel so near to the animals and it is not crowded . A nice place for families with kids.",
          "small but they have gother many rare animals and there is good space for them,kinds friendly and well organized",
          "My boyfriend and I visited this zoo seeing mixed reviews but wanted to go with open minds, after visiting we were absolutely appalled by the enclosure standards for the animals. There was not one enclosure that was adequately sized for the animals inside. I hope there is some",
          "We were all shocked to see imprisoned animal living and eating within their impurities. Animals are dirty, malnourished and hungry. noone is watching as anyone can through pop corns and food into the cages. The cages are extremely small. Specifically at chimpanzees the cages",
          "The Belgrade zoo has a large variety of animals but they are kept in tiny cages that look like jail cells. This is animal abuse. They should lower the number of animals and improve the living conditions of the ones that are left. A lot of animals are depressed and \"pacing\" (a",
          "Very good Zoo. They have many kind of animals, the boxes are very small, but the animals they look good healthy, have two white pairs of lions, white tigers, and a lot of other animals that were more of a species. they also made new places for other animals. we were very pleased.",
          "The zoo is situated at the very centre of the city, in Kalemegdan Park. Beo zoo vrt was founded in 1936 and is one of the oldest zoos in Europe. It is near the Knez Mihailova street and shopping zone. It has about  1,700 animals and more than 150 different species. Open:",
          "Serbia doesn't have the money to do a lot of the things that a zoo would like to do for the animals, but - it is one of the oldest zoos in Europe and since the zoo is basically inside the Kalemagden fortress it has a great setting.",
          "Almost central city, nice place, various animal, family friendly, same price ice cream, close to bus station. suggest to watch",
          "Although zoo looks clean and well cared I don't think its very comfortable for animals. Most cages are very small and have concrete surface. Zoo is also small but has many types of animals. Animals are close to visitors.",
          "Well organized, very clean cages, although not too spacious, kids play areas, souvenir shop (that should have a bigger range of products), coffee shops and toilets.",
          "I slept 1 night in Belgrade..you need to have a guide to visit this city...capital of Serbia... Me, I want to see the Zoo. I liked .especially white tigers and wolfs.. There are some place to rest, to have a coffee or beer... I recommend to be visited this touristic point..",
          "The ZOO is located inside the city not far from the main road and traffic. As such it's not the best place to keep animals at. I'd also add that these animals (from what I've seen) are taken as best as possible given the circumstances; but they should be put in a reservation in",
          "This place should be closed and the animals sent somewhere or mercy -shot. Smallest cages I have ever seen, totally unnatural. I wanted to flog the people responsible but only found a poor cleaner.",
          "Some of the species in this zoo are really unusual and special - white lions, white tigers, white panters. But most of the animals have really small cages, and are definitely unhappy there. And it's not a surprise if the zoo is only 7ha big. I think they should decrease amount",
          "Always a little anxious to visit a Zoo in this part of Europe... but in Belgrade even if some of the cage look too small in overall it is a well maintained zoo with a varied range of wildlife.",
          "There are a lot of different animals including cheetah and white lions, and also a lot of different beautiful birds. The cages for most animals are small and it is painful to see:( monkey are mostly in the building, behind cage and a glass so it is hard to even see them:( but",
          "the entrance is free for this- there are also some dinosaur plastic mummies some move others make noise-it is something great for kids",
          "This zoo is placed in Kalemegdan area, it has a lot of animals and most of them seem good taken care of (I've felt sorry for some birds and monkeys because of not to big space they're in). If you visit every animal you'll spend there couple of hours. Most of animals can be seen",
          "You will see variety of animals, not wide variety, but some of them yes. You will have nice moments to record, especially in Baby Zoo part. There everything is cute. So, i recommend you too visit it. Entrance fee is 300rsd (cca 2.6eur) for elders and 200rsd (cca 1.7eur) for",
          "Bg zoo is excellent. Every year on summer i go with me little son. This year day was rainy \ud83d\ude41,but you must visit it.",
          "A few of the enclosures seemed adequate. But the bigger animals like the lions and hippos are a disgrace. Came away feeling sad for the animals having to live on all that concrete. Best avoided if you have visited good zoos before.",
          "That's the name of our Zoo. Green zone in the middle of the center of the town, on Kalemegdan. Many animal species, treated perfectly, I have no complaints. Still, I hope there will be no Zoos in the world. Animals should live vhere they belong. In the meantime, enjoy our Zoo.",
          "I didn't like Belgrade very much, but the zoo was quite nice. Perfectly placed, in the heart of the city, it has a varied range of species, that you can see very closely, because in Serbia EU rules about cage sizes do not apply. Wich is good for visitors, but probably opposite",
          "The oldest citizen in the Zoo is krokodile! He rimember a lot, but speak a little ... ofcourse, there are many others who are talkative! Enjoy stories!",
          "If you're looking for a big zoo, with a lot of animals, starting with birds, eagles to elephants, seals, camels etc then this is the place for you. The adult ticket is 500 Dinars. It's located in the Kalemegdan Park and from there in 5 min you reach the fortress ( free entry and",
          "The zoo is small and some of the enclosures are far too small but it makes for a pleasant couple of hours close to the city but away from the traffic.",
          "We loved how many different animal species there is and everything is very clean and neat. There are a few coffee places with good and cheap coffee wich is great. Also, many ice cream standa were all arond the ZOO. What we didn't like was the fact that not all animal cages had",
          "This zoo in Belgrade, surprised me a lot, with the presence of so many animals. This was beyond expectation. They have, tigers, lions, bears, kangaroos, wolves and what not. Good experience.",
          "There is lots to see and loads of baby animals being born this time of year but all the big animals seemed to be in the smallest enclousures. I know some e.g. the bear enclosure was being upgraded but even with the extension they still would have a small enclosure. I was",
          "I've been at the Zoo with my wonderful little sisters and the day was amazing! It was a hot day but we could rest under the trees were there were a lot of ice sellers. Beautiful animals and a really nice ZOO!",
          "This is one of my favorite places in Belgrade. Unfortunately it should be dislocated since the position for this zoo is not the best one. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "The animals were kept in very small enclosures. 3 hippos were kept in an enclosure of c.200 m squared. The animals looked depressed. Awful.",
          "All the animals seemed either overweight(they probably feed the big ones like the lions too much, so they won't want to run inside those small cages) or starving. A jaguar was limited on an actual cage the same size for a porcupine! The bears, the fox, monkeys and wolves all run",
          "My partner wanted to go see the difference between last time his family went 7yrs ago to now so we went it was good but quite small cages which was sad but over all good variety of animals",
          "We had a really good morning there despite the rain. Not sure about some of the sizes of the enclosures but a very enjoyable visit",
          "Belgrade Zoo is on of the pritiest in the Europe. It is located 5 min walk from the city center, within Kalemegdan fotress, so you can imagine how beautiful it is. It's big and with many animals surounded by beautiful nature. There are also few coffee shops so you enjoy the",
          "The Zoo has different species - giraffs, zebras etc. Most of the exhibits are pretty big, and the animals seem to feel ok. We were there on a hot day and the keepers had a hose with water to sprinkle them.The bear enjoyed it :) It's better than the Zoo we have here in Sofia.",
          "The ZOO is a part of fotress complex. Its not very big, has got lot of birds (eagles), but also traditional animals (white lion :-), giraffes, camels, elephants etc). We saw feeding of seals - children loved it. In time of our visit there was a small hippo. After the fortress",
          "This is the worst zoo i have ever visited. Its very obvious that so many of the animals are stressed out. There was a small Brown bear with a broken leg stuck on a ledge limping back and Forth. There was another bear in a Tiny enclosure pacing back and forth panting so hard",
          "Visiting this zoo really upset me. The standards for the animals are so much lower than any zoo I've ever been to. The horses were kept in an enclosure of brick and looked very skinny. I cried when we left here because the animals seemed like they had gone crazy and were",
          "It is very well taken care of, with plenty of animals, the children will be delighted. Do not miss it when visiting Kalemegdan.",
          "Don't visit this zoo.. don't waste your money. You will see depressed animals confined in really really small cages, while people are allowed to mess with them. No guards around. There are really better parks in Europe. Visit anyone else",
          "I visited the zoo with my wife and little child the price of the ticket is very cheap and there are a lot of special animals there . When visiting in Belgrade with children you must go to the zoo !",
          "The cost of the zoo only works out around \u00a33, however enclosures are so small! Only a couple of animals had grass and the rest had grey, miserable looking concrete enclosures with not enough space to run around. We saw a serval with a small cage, and it was a cage. I don't know",
          "Visited the zoo last month with my son. He was quite happy to see all the animals and play in the park and garden around them. Great family time.",
          "This zoo should be closed and someone should be put in charge of remodeling. It lacks room for the animals, dirty, and not enough different kinds of animals. I had never been to a zoo where ordinary dogs were in cages and promoted as zoo animals.",
          "This zoo includes many different kinds of animal, but must of the animals are so mistreated! There are no space for them and several of them have hurts!",
          "This is a very depressing zoo with way too many animals in the smallest cages you could imagine!!! The only thing I could think of during my visit, was how I could release these animals so they could get a better life!! Most of the animals had wounds and were alone in their",
          "The children really like the zoo with all the animals but there is some room for improvement! Great though for the kids to take their minds off so you can relax :)",
          "A beautiful zoo with many animals in a beautiful place in the Kalemegdan park. It a must see object. You can see an elefant who eat from your hand, a monkey who spits on you.",
          "I have mixed feelings about the zoo. Some birds have way to little space, they can barely move around. Same story is with hippos. We can see many species like lion, cheetah, bear, goat, zebra, wolf, girraphe, and others. Zoo is relatively big very crowded so you really have to",
          "Could be better. Children liked it. A large range of animals. No bad smell. U can see elephants .lions and tigers. I liked it",
          "My 7 year old liked it. It was clean and the animals appeared to be cared for. Not much for a gift shop. Lots of interesting birds and the lions are nice to see.",
          "Good, clean zoo, lot of animals, takes 2 hours to see everything. Located in the park near Fortress.",
          "Super cheap day out, tons of animals of all sizes - and 99% of them seemed really well cared for and happy. The sign isn't in English. But if you go see the Alligator it's worth knowing not only is he the oldest living in captivity - but also has one less leg because he got a",
          "The Belgrade Zoo is ok. I visited him in 2012 and now after 5 years is in much better condition. Most animals have good living conditions, and for the rest of the animal cages are in renovations. Characteristic for the zoo are the white lions, tigers and kangaroos, typically for",
          "We had amazing time today at Belgrade Zoo. Must visit. Dont miss baby zoo where you can feed the cutest sweetest goatlings.",
          "Situated just by the fortress with a playground outside. Some ongoing construction work inside but overall a small and well organised zoo. Friendly interactive staffs.",
          "This is nice place to visit, specially with kids. Great walk and enjoyment of many animals. Depending from what part of the world people come might see zoo as great to terrible, but as someone from Belgrade find it one of good and attractive place where somebody can spend",
          "A nice zoo. If you visit Belgrade with your family I recommend visiting the zoo. It's a 2-3 hours (with at least one coffee break) visit. It is not very big and some of the animals have too small cages, but it is still nice in a way.",
          "If you have children, if you are alone and seek for a nice walk go streight to the Zoo. It is the place where you can meet some famous people who live in Belgrade and love the Belgrade Zoo.",
          "I didn't regret visiting the zoo, it was very interesting and the variety of animals and birds was very big! Be prepared to spend some time there, because it is quite big!",
          "A lot of species, but they have very little space and look very sad.. Some of the animals were hurt, others was walking back and forth or in circles - showing signs of mental issues. The entrance ticket was really cheap, but it was really not worth it. Me and my mom was left",
          "there is a beautiful wall around the zoo with hundreds of tiles painted/fired with the different zoo animals.",
          "The conditions in this zoo are very poor. A lot of animals are not in an environment that is suitable for them",
          "Wonderful zoo with cute animals and dozens of birds!!!! They are everywhere, some of them walk in the zoo. The animals are cute and there is was no one there;)",
          "This zoo could be so much better. It has some good spaces but has so many animals crammed in that only very few of them have the bare minimum space they need, others (like the Hippos) are in ridiculous small enclosures and there is obviously not enough budget for proper",
          "I was extremely pleased to see how many animals there were to see at the zoo! It was a lovely warm day and so nice to wander slowly around Zoo and take it all in. My favourite was the Giraffes and the Elephant.",
          "that was the worst zoo I've ever seen. animals looked really unhappy. they have too little place to live, and noone was there. most of the places were icy. and there were electrical fences around dangerous animals which I think was 50 year-old. I didn't know those kind of places",
          "Not the biggest of enclosures for some of the animals, with lots of them pacing. Didn't get a good vibe about the place at all.",

          "We've been there for 3 hours and I can say one of the weakest zoo we ever visited was Belgrade zoo. Dirty place and I think animals are not happy there.",
          "There were a lot of animals and all of them healthy and well fed. I particularly liked the white lions and the seals. What made a bad impression was all the dead chicks on the ground in the cages of the birds of prey.",
          "We liked it very much,nice and clean.animals choised well and nature is super.We had nice walk trough park and great time with animals",
          "This is the worst Zoo I have ever visited! Most of big animals are kept in small, inadequate cages, looking frustrated and the hygiene is really bad. Living conditions of animals that require water are even worse!",
          "the Belgrade Zoo is really sad, the animals are kept in tiny enclosures with little to no comfort, you can see the animals pacing around acting distressed especially the monkeys! Lions that have no grass at all in the enclosure and wolves that have less than a few square metres",
          "Belgrade zoo is a recreational and entertainment center and zoo located in very nice place of Belgrade. This is not large zoo (as in Austria) but it's certain you can spend an hour and a half with some animal species. facility is specific - located on a hill - so you will have",

          "Everyone who came to Belgrade should stop by the Garden of Good Hope , located in a beautiful Kalemegdan fortress . Children have a lot to look forward to , and their parents to teach them how beautiful it is to love animals and to preserve all living species and their",
          "The zoo it's self is not so big but there are a lot of different animals. It's clean and looks like they're taking good care of the animals and their habitats.",
          "The zoo is small, but very pretty and full of trees. There are many different animals to see, and the place is very bautiful. And the placement is excellent, in the middle of Kalemegdan fortress.",
          "I love visiting the zoo, and my absolute favorite is the otter. There is a tiny gap in the glass cage where if you put your finger, the otter will come caress you (thinking you have food). But it's the softest velvet touch ever, I always look forward to it!",
          "Many kinds of animals well taken care of! The only problem I spotted is that some of them should have a larger place.",
          "I never thought that I could see so many wild magnificent beasts for about 3 euros. This zoo it's a must. Elephants, crocodiles, hippos, giraffes, zebras, white tigers, lions, leppards, cheetahs, seals and more are waiting for you. They were all well taken care of as much as i",
          "Too many animals on a too small place. It almost made me cry when I saw the the wolves in the smallest cages ever. I love Belgrade but the ZOO is a place I will not be visiting again.",
          "Felt so sorry for the animals really small cages and no shadow! The inclosures were made in concrete, only a few animals had grass. Many animals for such a small zoo!",
          "In the city center, wonderful place to visit. Many animals and good place for children. Good to see.",
          "The animals were plenty to visit but most of them did not have plenty of space to move around aprt fom the seals no english description of what animals we were looking at.",
          "This place has a lot of different animal spieces, but I was so sad seeing them in small cages. This may be good for some people who never explored any other ZOO or safari, but seeing this I just felt very sorry.",
          "Small concrete, steel and barbed wire enclosures. Minimal access to fresh water, shade or softer resting locations. Impossible for most animals to withdraw from screaming kids who will batter cages and scream to provoke reactions and movement from the animals. I normally don't",
          "We were so surprised how much we loved this zoo. The huge variety of animals created a special expereince. The zoo had white lions, tigers, arctic wolves, wolves, bears, polar bears leopards, cheetahs, lots of birds and other great animals. While the grounds are not as pretty",
          "My 2-year-old loved the zoo, made animal sounds to the animals and got to see many he had never before seen in person. But the concrete cages are quite small and sparse and the animals show signs of stress (patches of fur chewed/scratched off). The experience was quite",
          "The best in Europe, if you are a tourist you must visit this place. Nice place to enjoy and to drink a coffe with peacock at cafe \"Razvigor\" next to giraffe.",
          "Animals are not supposed to be in zoos and if they are, the areas should be large, imitating their natural habitat. This zoo is old and a bit run down.",
          "The albino lions have a peculiar inbreeding history of a few hundred years, and the lion has an AMAZING mane. Funny ? Wait until you realize that all animals stay most of the day OIT of their shelters as there is plenty of shade, and the cages are not opressive at all, I don't",
          "It was a little tricky wandering around the Fort to find the entrance, but once we did, it was a pretty impressive collection for a smaller zoo. Loved the kangaroos. None of the signs are in English though. They also have lions, zebras, a giraffe, and a baby elephant.",
          "I enjoyed a lot this zoo!It is big and it has animals which,personally,I hadn't seen before. The animals have quite big places to stay,close to their natural environment. The entrance is 400 dinars/person.",
          "I think the zoo is great, the have many different species of animals to see. Great place for nature lovers to spend a day.",
          "Belgrade zoo is situated in so-called lower Kalemegdan which is an old fortress and now city park. I have never seen a zoo within a fortress. Maybe it's not optimal for animal captivity but it's great for spending few ours with kids or friends there. You can even organize a",
          "It is located in the heart of the Kalemegdan fortress making it interesting not just because of the animals. It was obviously well managed for years, since there are many species and some of them bred in the zoo (like white lions), It was excitment for kids!",
          "We had a nice afternoon in the Belgrade zoo. The newer section is awesome. The older section a bit sad though. All up worth a visit! Cheers",
          "The animals are kept in tiny enclosures, without the possibility to hide. It was such a sad impression, that we had to leave after 15 minutes. One pays 400 dinars for the feeling that we belong to a sadistic cold-blooded species.",
          "If you intend to stay at Belgrade town, the zoo is a must see, it includes many animals and could be reached by bus or tramway.",
          "Generally, zoo is good, clean and relatively rich, but keeping of some animals are really bad, for instance wolves and other canides, there is no need for that. They are placed in empty concrete boxes, and they are resignated and in bad condition.",
          "I don't know if its the nature of all Zoos around the world that bothers me but I certainly have the say that looking at the way the animals were kept in such small spaces upset me a lot.",
          "The zoo was nice, i imagined It bigger, the children were amazed so that was nice. The park around It is great for children to play in. I didn't like that some animals were not cleaned well. A good thing is that It didn't smell awfull like in the majority of zoo's",
          "The Zoo can be a little depressing (personally) as the animals are quite old and some of the enclosures don't seem suited or kept up to a standard befitting the animal. That being said, there is a wide selection of animals to see, relatively good priced entry and some history to",
          "great for families with small children, the visit can last from a few hours till full day. in the city centre",
          "Although not very big, this zoo is a very cute place to spend 3 - 4 hours with your kids. The animals are kept in good conditions - lions have a big territory to enjoy life, as well as the elephant and many others. All the animals are very relaxed and nosy, which means they come",
          "a very good place for a family or a couple to spend a day at, lots of interesting animals, to distract your mind from problems",
          "We had such a great time visiting this zoo, very interesting and fun for the kids, big variety of animals. The prices are ok, although we were a large family of 12 adults and kids and they don't have family package prices. Some animals need more space and all the tags are in",
          "Great place to spend a relaxing afternoon with kids...ZOO itself is quite small but animals are well kept and interesting...Great fun!",
          "Cool atmosphere,u can go and enjoy in animal world ,cool ambient ,good vibe, u will have a beautiful day with your family and kids, it is for people who love animals and nature.Enjoy!",
          "The zoo is very nice, although on the smaller side. Admission fees are very reasonable. They have a nice variety of animals and they all seem to have a decent amount of space in their pens. I was a bit worried the lion pen fences were not high enough to stop them from jumping",
          "A very big selection of animals, but smal spaces for almost all the animals. The birds showed the biggest sign of stress, with a rather bad feathercoat. A lonely female elephant, and one giraffe. The hippo enclosure was ridiculously small. If you can overlook all of this, I'm",
          "In for a half day of surprise in the heart of Belgrade ! Visit the Zoo. It was truly a nice experience having 3 children exited and thrilled with a variety of animal most zoo will be hoping for. Plenty of opportunity for refreshment both for adult and children. Be prepared",
          "Had a great time, so many animals...I was surprised to see domestic dogs in cage, and I wasn't really happy about that!!!Monkeys were so cute!!!Lions are my favourite!!! It was really hot that day, so animals were in a sleepy mood, so they didn't show off.",
          "It is in Belgrade city center, near Kalemegdan fortress! Is open in 1936 and it is one of the oldest zoos in Europe. At the beginning was smaller, only 3.5 ha, then expanded to 14 hectares, but in World War period was 2 times bombed and damaged in part, at which time and lost 7",
          "Didn't feel comfortable, zoo was dirty and animals looked pretty depressed. Maybe we are too spoiled in Western Zoo's but just didn't feel right!",
          "a very big zoo which takes you three days to see all the animals. also i had the information that this is the only zoo in europe who has white lions and there had been borned a lot of babys white lions.",
          "Vuk Bojovic was the best man in Zoo.35 years ago he made everything there.He gave his life for Zoo.Today Belgrade have the best Zoo in Europe.",
          "Centraly located Belgrade zoo is near other attractions-Kalemegdan fortress, Knez Mihajlova pedestrian street...Zoo is big enough with decent number of animal species Definitly worth of visit.",
          "A nice zoo in the center of the city. It's huge and you can spend hours in it. Take your walking shoes with you. Some really interresting animals there like the white tiger and white lions with cubs. 400 rsd is not much for the tickets.",
          "We thought the zoo was tiny, but as we walked around, it seemed to go on forever. The grounds and cages were immaculate. There was a tremendous variety of animals. Some of the cages were small, but overall we had a very nice experience.",
          "Such a pitty that all those animals where kept in so small cages... some of them where alone and looked unhappy... others where too anxious of the people that were watching them... beautifull animals and endangered species...",
          "For us, prople who live in Belgrade, Zoo has special place in hart. It is not the bigest Zoo and they do not has the bigest number of animals. Zoo has very i teresting history. Zoo lead very long period good men Vuk (Wolf) Bojovic, with love. For that period, more than 15-20",
          "Kalemegdan Fortress is a location that can attract your attention all day long. Historical building located in one of the largest parks in Belgrade, with a beautiful lookout point at the confluence of two rivers. Zoo who completely blends the beauty of the fortress and the park",
          "Okay, it's not as big as ZOOs I've visited in some other cities but still I wasn't so impressed by it. Ticket is bit pricey, not so many animals but I guess if you are fan of zoos you should visit it anyway.",
          "Great variety of animals, one of the largest Zoo parks in Europe, nice for kids and adults as well. Very chip tickets compared to other parks around the world!",
          "educational place, fun, there is a lot of interesting animals, the best and must to see is baby zoo, near the amusment park, on Kalimegdan, realy a place full of good energy, for couples and family",
          "It's not the best zoo I visited. There are not many animals. If you have more time, spend it for shopping or visiting museums. Nothing interesting for me",
          "I was really wondering of Belgrade zoo but I did not like very much. Maybe from the weather because it was really cold and snowy. I was happy to see Leon, deer, buffalo and colorful birds. If you are in Belgrade you must visit. It could be funny for your holiday. Have a good",
          "No space for wild animals, most of them have gotten mad. An absolutely depressing view on how humans treat animals in the 21st century!",
          "I don't do zoos as a thing, but I could not venture in as it was so smelly. We went to the castle instead and loved it.",
          "In the Heart of the city you can't imagine what you can find!!! A Zoo!! Even though it's a small zoo the Lions and the Elephant are fantastic.. There are of course other animals... You can see Hippo's , Sea Wales, Birds and other... It's a good place to visit and spent or drink",
          "I don't understand how this hell hole has any positive reviews. If I could give it zero I would. Yes it has lots of animals. But they are all kept in tiny bare concrete cages (at first I thought it was temporary they are that small), often with no water, to slowly whither away",
          "The Belgrade zoo carries an animal species hard to find in other zoos: white lions and tigers! They are so pretty and fierce! The whole zoo is integrated within an old fortress and it is very interesting to walk around. Definitely plan at least a few hours when you go visit.",
          "Belgrade Zoo is place which should be seen. Situated in Belgrade fortress with lot of animals and birds. Some of them are very rare (white lions). Two nice restaurants in shadow of big trees are place where you can rest.",
          "I am not some crazy animal lover. And I enjoyed visits to some other zoos (like Stuttgart, Vienna). But this visit disgusted me. If you want to see animals going crazy in unhealthy environment, than this is zoo for you. Like bear in cage barely bigger then him going from side to",
          "Zoo is very good place to take time with friends and to look animals lifestyle. Different types of animals. The price is good.",
          "The zoo is a remarkable place to visit,a lot of different species to see and a perfect place to rest and relax.This is also a wonderful place to bring children,and to get away from the regular crowd.The tickets are not so expensive,and you can stay as long as you want. :)",
          "Almost one year ago in Belgrade came my family from Australia. We went to Zoo because they have 2 small children. It was a great time in one of best Zoo i the world when we are talking about animal species in it. A place you must visit when you are in Belgrade!!!",
          "Located at the centre of Belgrade, with lot of animals, clean and nice, great for the kids!!! Must see Bg Zoo",
          "I did not just like the Zoo...i loved it!! There you can see a really wide range of wild and not only animals like tigers, hippos, elephant, kangaroos, flamingos, lions, wolves, monkeys, snakes..maybe everything that you can imagine!! Must see for sure!! Especially for children",
          "Good sized and well maintained. Variety of animals like zoos in most big European cities, if not better. Very, very children friendly. There is a large area where lambs and small dogs run free (supervised, of course) and can be greeted and played with. And they won`t kick you",
          "It was ok but pretty much in a depleted state,animals are not fed well,they do have a good collection,the location is near by pedestrian zone,just finish the pedestrian zone and go right then go left you are onto the zoo,visitor fees are around euro6 .",
          "It`s a very good zoo. You can see the animals so close and the conditions of their life are good, though it is in the city. It is very clean and organized very convenient for the visit.",
          "This is a great zoo! Lots of great animals and well maintained grounds. Shame there wasn't better refreshments etc. We had a great time anyway. Highly recommended.",
          "I came back to the Bg ZOO after 25 years and nothing realy changed. The ZOO is clean and there are many different tipes of animals but the atmosphere is just so sad, and animals need more space for living and moving, and I just dont feel like going there again :( There is caffe",
          "If you blame me when I writing this review for the others. But, I would like to get that point: I hate to see the animals kept in cabin covered with windows, especially monkeys! Let them free in their real life. The human being always kept for their entertainment and for sure",
          "For thise who like long walks, it is definitely a place to relax, see interesting animals and enjoy. Nice place in the centre of the town.",
          "Lovely Zoo. Kids simply adore it. One of the most important Zoos for white lions population in the world. Home of the oldest living aligator. The only problem is that it's on the small area. It should be extended to lower part of Belgrade fortress.",
          "We decided to check out the zoo because it was right next to the Belgrade Fortress, which should easily be the #1 destination for tourists. The entry fee is quite reasonable (400 dinars per adult) and the zoo itself is clean and nice. It's a small place and you could walk it in",
          "Is a nice zoo with many animals to see but was not very clean. And some cages are smell not so nice. The ticket was 400 RSD not so expensive.",
          "Zoo in the heart of the city and Kalemegdan fortress. Nice attraction for kids where they can see plenty of live animals. The Zoo is quite old and doesn't have any free space where it could expand so the number of animals is limited and some of the animals are put in relatively",
          "Animal lovers don't go in here. It's great that you can see a lot of animals, birds, but as an animal lover, for me was heart breaking. I can't stand to see animals in cages, stressed by children. I went just because I had to babysit and parents bought me a ticket. The zoo is",
          "The zoo was very clean, but the cages are small; most animals have to live on a cement floor. Lots of interesting and beautiful animals, but they are way too confined. Sad.",
          "I liked too much this zoo,there are a lot of animals (not too much)but the park is clean and if you follow the number you will watch all the animals without to lose yourself. There is white tiger white lion white cangoor... Deserve to visit Beutifull atmosphere around the",
          "One of the most lovely places in Belgrade. So many interesting animals, great location ( at Kalemegdan fortress), very nice \ud83d\ude03",
          "I felt sorry for the animals. They didn't have enough room to move and they seemed to be stressed in small cages. This was heartbreaking for me! I like animals in their natural habitat. If I visit a Zoo, the animals should have a like-natural environment, where they can run,",
          "What bothers me the most is that you need to download the application from the zoo web page to see what species are you looking at.",
          "The zoo is not as clean as in other places I've visited. It has beautiful animals and there is a lot to see.",
          "So Belgrade got a zoo, and some nice stuff in the zoo (wolf so used to human that they lick you like dogs, white lions) but animals seem suffering of so few money coming there from the town or the states\u2026 it's a pity",
          "We visited this place during our 5 days stay in Belgrade. Some of the animals were impressive to see and observe particularly the lions and the giraffes. We were not impressed with the general cleanliness and upkeep of the Zoo.",
          "We have had a most pleasing trip for more then three hours a round the areas of the zoo. The zoo is at the end of big city park where you can also find playground and small luna park.",
          "Must see..relatively cheap,lots of animals,and most of them are in pleasant enviroment.visit,and see for yourself",
          "Nice zoo but the most wild dangerous animals was sleeping or lazy... And another wrong was that there were no signs on all the cages so you can know what animal is that you seeing...but still a very nice zoo!!!",
          "Fantastic location however unfortunately the zoo is very tired - habitats are not to today's standards and funding appears to be low to support the well being of the animals. Please donate to the zoo to help it improve the standard of living for the animals",
          "This zoo has a lot of white animals as the name of Belgrade contain white color in its name. Animals are treated very well. Worth seeing it.",
          "The Belgrade Zoo is in some of the views in comparison to our zoos very old fashioned. But it looks like the animals are treated well. The lions and birds look good and healthy. And the negative on the area for the animals is also something very nice on the other hand, as it",
          "That so called \"zoo\" is a disgrace. If Serbia enters the EU, the facilities will be shut down immediately. Insanely small cages for the animals, no effort whatsever to recreate the animals' natural habitat. Most of the cages didnt even have soil, it was either cement or bricks!",
          "The cages are TOO SMALL. Is a jail for lions, wolfs, and many many animals. This Zoo must not be available to accept visitors. Must close immetiatly. Shame on you Serbia. Shame on you Belgrade...",
          "The so-called zoo is a disgrace to the well being of the animals within. The \"zoo\" is an antiquated prison where many animals wander endlessly in cages. It should be shut down.",
          "The zoo has appriximately 2000 animals but in a too small area. The wolves live into a tiny paved space, as well as the hippos and the bears. Also some lions are into poor conditions. However we saw some animals we never had seen before such as white tigers, anaconda, buffalos,",
          "I love to check every Zoo in every city where I go. And I love each one! It is small, but nice and clean, and placed in the old fortress.",
          "It's a surprising rich collection of animals in that Zoo. + Cool for audience: you've never been as close to animals then here. one wire fence between you and most of the animals... - not cool for the animals: the cages are very small - the standards are old and by far not",
          "This is not a zoo, it is a prison for animals. Not only do some of the cages look suspiciously insecure, but most of them are far too small for the animals. The wolves and monkeys were literally in concrete boxes like a prison, and there were two sad looking hippos in a tiny",
          "Amazing animals in the smallest cages. The vast majority of exhibits are just concrete jail cells for the animals. Not even grass or dirt. The animals all look in pain. The cages are also so dirty. The monkeys exhibit was horribly run down and their cells were filled with broken",
          "Needs closed down Poor animals shouldn't be kept in such poor conditions. Not enough space, water. Basic things",
          "As animal lovers fasted zoos dozens of cities in the world and I have to admit that if our Belgrade zoo replaced at least in the area they cover really is specially arranged , with beautiful mosaic,located at the unique place Belgrade fortress and all the animals in it are",
          "Just the pictures alone can show you how awful this place is. Lions pacing up and down on concrete with no grass in small cages. It really is anything but an attraction, more just a prison for animals to live out the rest of their lives in horrible conditions. Close the place",
          "The zoo is not big. a lot of things are old. Animals were kept in very small place within cages and walls. They didn't look happy. Zoo management should provide as good condition as possible for animals.",
          "Was really excited to visit this zoo for 400 Dina an Adult. It had 4/5 stars on here and I had read it was one of the oldest Zoos in Europe. It turned out to be a really sad and depressing experience. The enclosures are extremely small and mostly bare concrete. All of the large",
          "I went to that zoo two days ago - the whole experience was awful. As I went for a drink in one of the bars of the fortress, I looked down over the fence and saw that lion in a tiny dirty cage (2mx 3 m, if not less). he looked so sad and distressed, he kept going in circles and",
          "Worst zoo I have ever visited! The zoo is home to apparently 2000 animals, bearing in mind it's tiny. There are elephants, lions, tigers, wolves even domesticated dogs in cages. Most enclosures don't have grass just concrete. I'm not animal behaviorist but I saw numerous signs",
          "This zoo is poorly maintained. Some cages are in bad condition as well as its habitants. Animals look depressed, so does staff. It is not hygienic and it looks really neglected. Location is a historic landmark, but it needs investments, and a lot of them.",
          "Compared to American zoos, this is a poor, but the white lions do have a fairly decent exhibit. Hopefully the zoo continues to improve. It is a long standing Belgrade tradition at the edge of the huge, Roman fortress.",
          "Wen i was kid it was my favorite place. Now, situation is same. No matter how old you are this perfect place to visit!",
          "This is a terrible zoo, and the animals suffer in the cages. We did not have a good time in there, and i will not recommend others to go there, and support the place. This review is created by a dane, and i put it up against the Zoo in Copenhagen, which i think is taking very",
          "The zoo is surrounded by a wonderful wall full of animal images made out of tiny stones, a mosaic. It must have taken them ages to finish it and it is wonderful! It is a must see building placed on the side of a heel so it has ups and downs. I never entered the zoo though!",
          "Every year we return to this special place in the heart of the city. And we spent great time there walking and learning about the animals. Kids simply adore it.",
          "Zoos are not to everyone's liking and this zoo wont convert anyone but I found the Citadel and park a bit underwhelming - the zoo is adjacent and worth a look . We were killing a few hours in Belgrade before catching an overnight train . The zoo is a very good diversion and",
          "It's a nice place, a nice park but ONLY for humans.. I felt terrible seeing the animals in so small cages...I remember the wolves were in very small cages, they looked miserable. Also it was too hot for some animals. There was a poor bear she was breathing heavily under the hot",
          "Not very clean and not so comfortable for all animals. The location is great for people, because it only takes 10 minutes on foot from the main square, but the street next to the Zoo is very noisy, so it's not that great for animals whose cages are close to the street... Other,",
          "Some of the cages are small and uncomfortable. I was suprised, that in cages were dogs (?) and water was somewhere dirty. You can find here a lot of kinds of animals and its nice place for walk.",
          "I am entirely against zoos and therefore I give this one a 3. This is the place that I frequented with my family while I was a kid and we had amazing times there. The veriaty of animals is great and what adds more fun is the fact that the zoo is situated in the Kalemegdan",
          "The zoo isn't anything special, a bit smell, however my daughter loved it and the walk through Kalemegdan is breathtaking",
          "It is a very friendly Zoo, situated in old fortress its very quiet with a lot tracks for walking, animals are very adjusted to people so they dont hide in cages and you can get a good look at every species. Non dangerous animals walk free through zoo such as some birds or lambs,",
          "This zoo is inside kalemegdan. We asked for it nobody help us,finally from the smell we found it. Its big zoo and we spent more yhan 3 hours. We saw the tiger,lion,panther monkeys,buffalo,crocodile,giraffe elephant,dolphin and other too many animals. If you have time dont miss",
          "I went to visit the Zoo because I was curious about the facility... To me, as an animal lover and a veterinary doctor, it was awful! I have never seen such small cages, so many behaviour disorders and painful animals as I have seen there. I am glad I have seen a thing like this",
          "cool place, a lot of different animals, I recommend this zoo to everyone who visits Belgrade ... ...",
          "It was a nice place to visit. A lot of animals to see and the price of the ticket is cheap. I liked it and I recommend it.",
          "As a resident of Belgrade, I normally, whenever I've got the chance and time to spend, go to visit and see the beautiful animals and plants in Belgrade's Zooligical Garden. We here in Belgrade, have got one of the oldest zoos in Europe, that was founded in 1936.The main entrance",
          "This is the worst Zoo I have ever visited (and I have been to quite a lot). I will never ever visit a zoo again after this experience. Belgrade zoo is old, missmanaged and there are many exotic animals here that are suffer in small cages and enclosures. Absolutely horrible. I",
          "We visited this zoo on a rather wet day. It is a little old and run down but the animals appeared to be well fed and looked after. There doesn't seem to be many places to eat but perhaps due to the weather stalls etc were closed. We spent a couple of hours here and for the entry",
          "I love this place, and it is always nice to go there. Zoo is medium size, and it is worth to see all thing that it is offering. There are few things that can be better, but nothing too important.",

          "I remember this place when I was a kid. It was a joke and all those animals were, at least said, unhappy. Now, it is completely changed but remained small. I find it as a nice place to spend a day. Some animals should be having some more space, better place to live but it is as",
          "Well this was a first for me - couple of different races of normal dogs in a zoo? Some of the animals looked a bit sad if you ask me. I felt bad for the animals after visiting this zoo. Earlier same week I visites the zoo in Ljubljana which left me with much better impression.",
          "We all loved it. Not so big but there are a lot of interesting animals. Especially the white ones ;) The animals are very close.",
          "Nice small zoo very close to all animals your support is appreciated by the animals take some apples for elephant so close to big cats you can touch many of them if you are crazy enough lots of birds",
          "Even if it is one of the oldest zoos from Europe, most of the cages are small and the animals are cramped into the cages. I visit it before 8 o'clock PM, when they started to get inside the animals. I was very disappointed to see that the animals struggle to live into that small",
          "Last week we visited Belgrade ZOO. Location is perfect for visitors, but not for animals. it is under the fortress of Kalemegdan in the centre of the city. There are many various tipes of animals, they are in good condition, but some cages are not suitable for them. There is",
          "The zoo is terrible, it needs recostruction, some animals like the white tigers and few lions have a nice cage, but most cages are horrible! I got really sad when I saw some animals (2 lions) in cages without grass or trees. Most of the time I was thinking of the poor animals",
          "The ZOO is nice, it used to be better, but it's still OK. It's clean, the animals are well kept and fed in large habitats. I've seen better ZOOs, but i'd come back to this one for sure.",

          "Wolves are sad. Lions need more space. It needs to be moved elsewhere. In the middle of the zoo they have restaurants and bunch of unecessary things, yet some of the animals really suffer in the bad habitats.",

          "The entrance fee was cheap. They have plenty of different animals, though it's kind of sad to see that some of them needs more spacious cages. Felt a bit sad about the black panter in the 5x5m big cage. Over all, good experience... For us... But not for the poor animals.",
          "I visited the zoo several times before. The location is nice and there is a variety of animals to be seen, but as I got older it started feeling sad (my personal feelings about the locked up animals in relatively small spaces.)",

          "This zoo worths a visit after visiting the fortress. My impression is that it was a little bit abandoned. It has though many variety of animals but many of them are in small cages .It worth the visit overall.",

          "I love animals very much,and do not like to see them in the cages,but in every ZOO animals are the prisoners.Still,I love to see them. Belgrade ZOO is not great comparing to some greatest European ZOOs,but,with its 250 species,it is one of the best in the region.We spent a nice",

          "Aside from the goats, peacocks, and chickens that seem to be wandering all over the grounds, the caged animals all pretty much look like they've got nothing to live for. Very sad looking and all in steel cages with a concrete floor. Such a pity not to have some grass or trees",
          "I really loved this Zoo when I was a kid. It seems that was the last time they did some cleaning though... Most of the cages are too small and stinky, six eagles are settled in a 6 cubic metres! Girafe was clearly dragging her leg and most of the flesh eating animals look",
          "They bill this place as a \"zoo and garden\" and that's the best way to enjoy it. Facilities can't compare to world-class zoos but they have lots of cute white tigers and other surprises. A breathe of fresh air in Belgrade, a welcome break from the urban mayhem.",
          "THis is not a place for a Zoo. It needs a new location with no delay, for the sake of both animals and visitors.",
          "Going to the zoo is a nice way to spend the morning or the afternoon if you are looking for something special to do with your family. There are a lot of different animals in a very green area, that makes the stroll inside the zoo very pleasant.",
          "The Belgrade Zoo was a bit disappointing. While it only cost about 400 dinar to get in, the duck pond had no water, the alligator had no sun, and the polar bears swam in dirty water with no shade when it was hotter than fried h*ll outside. The white lions and white kangaroos",
          "What you expect when you hear a word 'zoo'? In Belgrad zoo, you can renew your image of zoo. The zoo in hillside. the zoo you can touch to most of the animals, you can see bears and tigers from unexpected point of view...and white animals series. It will be a nice weekend spot",
          "We visited the Belgrade Zoo July 2012 and we were shocked. Most of the animals were cramped into very tiny spaces. Some of the cages were so small that the animals went mad, such as the dogs (dogs in a zoo?!) and guinea pigs (hundreds of them on a space of a little over 50",
          "The zoo has a very wide variety of animals packed into a pretty small area literally built into the old castle walls. A lot of fun for the kids and adults alike. And the people are fun to watch as well, amazing outfits can be seen. Similar to the \"people of Walmart\" website.",
          "This is home to the oldest alligator who is nearly 50 yrs old and survived wars and fires, escaped from the zoo and eventually recaptured. Also, there was a legendary monkey (a statue of it stands) as it had escaped from the zoo during the wars and found walking down the famous",
          "the fee is 400 dinars person or something less than 4 euros. in the hearth of the town , near the Fortress Kalemegdan. A lot of animals, in very good condition and you can spend at least 2 hours.",
          "It is situated within Kalemegdan, and it gives it a special flavour. Not the best zoo there is in any way, but certainly very charming.",
          "A small zoo - all very close and packed in. The majority of the animals have good sized enclosures, expect the hippo's, wolfs and Owls. All in all very good. Excellent cafe inside. It was 4EUR to enter. We would recommend a stroll round for an hour. It is set in a beautiful park",
          "a lovely small zoo, has everything youd want to see in a zoo including an english pitbull. the white lions are spectacular and werth a hundred photos, absolutely lovely zoo in a great spot",
          "Having in mind that the Zoo is very close to Kalemegdan is good to be visited. Don't expect too much but generaly you will spent nice 1 hour.",
          "I thought zoos like this one had died out years ago. Such beautiful animals kept in such cramped conditions. The lion was housed on concrete slabs in a small enclosure on the ramparts of the fort and he seemed to be roaring in frustration at the music coming from a party in the",
          "I would agree to some extent with martinus34, we have also found conditions in which some animals are kept to be problematic at best ... there was a number of ideas to move the zoo to a larger and more modern location unfortunatelly they were not succesfull .. not to mention",
          "Take tram no. 5 to reach the zoo. Tickets are around 100 to 200RSD",
          "The condition these animals are kept in is illegal and I have selected to write to several organisations denouncing them. My son and daughter were very upset after visiting this, wolves trapped in cages that were barely 10m2 ants lions in horrible conditions..",
          "Good to visit from time to time, best in autumn because can be cold in winter time and also in summer is nice when small animals are out. Nice to go with children and spend a day with animals.",
          "It's the ideal place to spend a weekend day with the family, it's unbelievable how many animals are present in the belgrade's zoo. There is also a kid's area where some little animals are free so that you can touch them. Really clean and well organized.",
          "It feels really different visiting a zoo in the ruins of a castle. Unfortunately, the animals really don't have enough space. It would be a really great zoo if they would only choose smaller animals to fit in the limited space.",
          "So much to see and do, a great day out for everyone, one of the best zoo's I have visited in Europe",
          "Unique locatio for a zoo and some of the cages are walled by the old fortress walls. Very interesting to see. We visited this zoo after Vienna (where there is a fantastic zoo) and although very different in design and size, we enjoyed this one just as much. Plenty of things",
          "When you come inside you feel like that you are young again and you are full of positive feelings",
          "Last year, the zoo got some rear animals, like the white tiger, the white lion, cassowary and some very rare types of birds. But nice to visit in spring, beginning of fall and not so hot summer. Grat and beautiful!!!! :D",
          "The zoo has an excellent selection of animals from all over the world. It is a shame the presentation is not better. Tucked into the side of (and actually within) the Belgrade fortress, the grounds are smaller than one would expect for the size of the collection. There were",
          "I really enjoyed my visit to this relatively small, but still very impressive zoo. Its location is amazing in Kalemegdan Park, next to the famous Belgrade Fortress. I went there in the autumn, and the colourful leaves made my visit even more memorable. The Zoo has some really",
          "Belgrade zoo is very small due to their location in the parts of the Belgrade fortress. Variety and care for the animals is on the high level even do it does not look like cages are big enough. They have lots of young animals being born there, especially white lions. I believe",
          "Great zoo located at the Belgrade fortress Kalimegdan. Shame it is not a bit larger. No doubt the kids will enjoy.",
          "You will find Belgrade Zoo at Kalemegdan Fortress. I like animals but what bothers me are small cages where some animals are kept (bears for example). During past few years it has been renovated in some parts but still, I think, some animals deserve better treatment.Anyway, zoo",

          "The best way to spend your family is visit to Kalemegdan. There is no some entrance, and you dont have to pay any tickets. Amasing nature with lot of people. There are two amasing churches, you have to visit them. Also good entertainment for young. Many exhibitions in the open",

          "Great way to see the real history of Belgrade walking around..there is also a Army Museum",

          "you can see history here, only it's not restorated as it should be. Anyway, we're working on it!",
          "The entire area surrounding the fortress is a must-see. Popular destination among tourist and locals, area is easily accessible by streetcar or bus. I have visited this place many times over the years and it never ceases to amaze me. The fortress is surrounded by a large park",
          "The first question people ask you when you come back from Belgrade - did you go to Kalemegdan? This is more then just a park. Also a great zoo! Make sure you don't miss it!!",
          "Beautiful nature, great views, fascinating fortress. Recommendation!",
          "Visited January 2012. After all the TripAdvisor reviews I was looking forward to the number one sight in Belgrade. It is easy to find, at the end of one of the main city pedestrian streets. A line of cannons welcome you to what is simply a dry park. With large holes in",
          "The fortress is amazing, especially by night. Park area has enough benches so you can sit down and relax, enjoying the view. You can sit on fortress walls and admire the view. No playground for kids, so you can really enjoy without kids running and screaming... The kid",

Nice cafes where you can rest, and a pretty cool playground for children with a mini adrenalin park.Toilet was acceptably clean.",

          "Everything is good, in fact i gave 5 stars rating 3 months ago. And i was impressed with the kid/petting zoo. But today i went again with my boy and it was crowded. What triggered me to place 1 star today is beside the kid playground/kid \u2026",

          "A great variety of animals on display as well as a lovely ambiance that will keep you entertained for hours. The zoo setup is very interesting and cross different levels, making you feel as like an explorer. The only downside is that the animal scent at times can be somewhat overpowering...",

          "The animals are mostly sad or stressed. The keepers could really invest some time or plants and creativity to make their cages more nice more natural. I dont recomend spending your money here.",
          "Beautifull place in city.",
          "There was a dead tapir in the cage. It seemed that animals, like every zoo, were not psychologically healthy.",

          "It feels much better then before.",
          "I am sad. Really sad. I worked here a part time job during '90. Condition of 70% of buildongs and cages is really bad. Animals look starved and sick. Deers, lions and elephant are not looking well at all. Apes look sick, and cockroaches are \u2026",

          "Some unique animals such as white Lions however the zoo is extremely run down. I got the feeling that while the animals were not mistreated, they were not all cared for as they should be. Perhaps being in such a poor Country, there is a great need for us all to donate to the facility and care of the animals.",
          "Amazing and very beautiful place with a lot of interesting animals, enjoying the time there.",

          "Just real and amazing place, really nice most renavated and place for kids to play",
          "There is a lot of space for improvement. There are animals (i.e. lions) with day/night clubs over their heads with music on all the time. They should do something about this. In general, moving the zoo from Kalemegdan would be the best solution.",
          "The zoo is a nice day out especially if you have kids. The ticket prices are really cheap. Parking isn't great however. And the spaces for the lions and tigers is tiny, the place really needs some renovation. Some of the animals are in \u2026",

          "First zoo as I ever seen, animals there don't look poor! Area isn't big, but 2 hours is minimal time to see all!",
          "Animal torture, especially carnivores. I saw several obviously sick animals. If there were only several animals in the same area , the place would look nice enough.",

          "Exceptional collection of animals in the center of the city. Make sure to see the white lions. Interactive and educational entertainment is still missing",

          "This zoo is poorly maintained.  The monkey exhibit was particularly appalling.  It was clear that the cages we're not being cleaned regularly.  Overall shabby place.  The reptile exhibit was a joke.  Zoo needs more funding.",
          "very nice zoo , my kids loved it a lot",
          "One of the best Zoo's I've been too",
          "This zoo isn\u2019t too big which is great for little kids and families with a short amount of time\u2014 maybe not so great for the animals as some of the enclosures seemed much too small. There were some fascinating aspects of the zoo and overall a lovely visit.",
          "Lovely place to come and hace animals look at you for the animal you are. Basicaly the zoo is you and animals are enjoying it",

          "Perfect for adults and children but expensive. Clear fantastic view",
          "Great place, lots of animal species but conditions for animals are quite low and area where it's located is small, animals should be in an area which is much wider. But tickets are not expensive and all in all not bad. There is ice-cream,  food and coffee shop near by.",

We have practical exercises during the whole October and May each year (from 1998 onwards)..\nSo, I feel fully competent to recommend the Belgrade Zoo to anyone who wants to spend nice time at nice place \ud83d\ude00",
          "Very nice zoo, medium sized, a lots of birds, all kinds, but very small amount of wild animals l..",
          "I was sad seeing eagle i 3 m2 cage and wolwes in small cages so they cant run. Orangutang och chimpmanse in small metall rooms. There was nothing in animal cages to activate them. To many animals and no space... : (",
          "Very unique zoo where you can get up close and personal with the animals. They have all the usual suspects here, but then add white tigers, white lions, and a pair of cheetahs that on occasion seemed to not be in their enclosure. For timing, I would budget 60-90 minutes to take a good lap.",
          "It is no doubt one of the nicest Zoo's I have been to. They feature some interesting animals like white tigers, and the oldest crocodiles living in captivity. The Zoo is accessible on foot from the city centre but it also has close parking space.",
          "Big part of my childhood and now of my kids too.",
          "Animals supposed to be in wild not in zoo's, I haven't been there just walked next to it",
          "Very good zoo :)",
          "A great zoo, with beautiful animal habitats. Every day there it's activities with the animals, they feeds them, plays with them and visitors enjoy it. There are rare species of animals. Albino Lion and Albino Tiger and many other interesting animals. It's worth visiting.",

          "This is a great little zoo right in the middle of the city. The animals were all out and some you could even see up close! Great place to spend part of the day with the kids!",
          "I had an OK time. It's a bit sad seeing all the animals in cages, but that's a zoo, right. Anyways, I would suggest they raise the ticket prices to 1500din and pay more attention to the conditions of the cages and the animals. \nIt's a nice zoo, but could be better, definitely.",
          "They should provide more space for animals.",
          "A wonderful place to spend a couple of hours with your family.",
          "Located at the Kalemegdan fortress, Belgrade Zoo is almost at the city center. That makes it easily accessable for the visitors and rather interesting due to ancient scenery. On the other hand, not all the animals have the sufficient space for their basic needs (birds in the first place) which is not a pleasant sight.",
          "A zoo which can't be compared with its West-European (Dutch in this case) counterparts. The exhibits are shabby, often animals walk on concrete floors and a lot of animals are alone or in cages too small for them. Large birds of prey in \u2026",

          "Great family day, nice atmosphere, a lot of content and animals to be seen",
          "DO NOT GO HERE. Animals are in small rusted cages. Visitors are kicking goats and tormenting the monkeys. Hippos had no water. Elephants foot was literally falling apart. I literally left the zoo crying. Horrible experience.",
          "Interesting zoo, good price. We had sometimes the impression the animals are not treated so well :(",
          "In center of Belgrade, to spend some time",
          "The place pro is that it is in the city center in an old fortress, making it unique ambient, however animals are in confined spaces making you to feel sorry for them. Nice thing is also that you can see white lion.",
          "Serbian people respect and love animals so you cross dogs everywhere...So no wonder that you see each animal in Belgrade zoo treated the best way in order to make him feel somehow not in capture...We spend there more than 3 hours admiring all the wild animals and their amazing homes...",
          "Fun day trip. Never before I saw animals that close up. Usually at other zoo animals are far and can\u2019t see them that well. It\u2019s definitely uniq experience.",
          "Large zoo, lots of white animals...You got to see white wolf, lion, tiger,  leopard,  piton\n...",
          "There is a large variety of species but a lot of them are missing. Also the cages are not so new and nature-alike.",

          "It's really sad to see the animals that clearly have health issues (physical and mental) and nobody cares about them.\nCages are dirty, employees are nowhere to be found, animals look depressed.\nIf you are a child, you will have the time of \u2026",
          "What a nice and relaxed environment. It's nice to be so close to some if the coolest animals. I had a peacock litterally jump in front of me and spread his feathers and show me both the front and back. It was amazing. It was a place I wanted to be sure to see in Belgrade and I'd have to say it's been my favorite by far!",
          "really great place for meeting animals and spending time with family",
          "Lovely old zoo",
          "It needs to be renovated...",
          "Very nice place to visit when you are in Belgrade. \nIt is not a expensive zoo to go. \nThey have a lot of animals. \nFrom the outside it seems so small but when you go inside it is so big and complex :)",
          "Pretty bad conditions for animals. Big zoo, but sad",
          "It's not really big, but it's a good place to visit if you're a tourist or for families. Also they if you're a student you have a discount. The animals are into cages (most of them) and as long as I was here I didn't see someone who could give me more information .",
          "Clean place.\nThere is no signs where to turn in to the zoo from the main street.\n There is no enough room for all the animals...seems they are trapped specially the wildlife.\nRestaurant is good enough.\nPeople that work in the zoo are very friendly and professional.",

          "Zoo is a great place to see a lot of different breeds at once but a huge prison for those animals as well.i",
          "Better than it was, was at lunch time, fun to see animals eat.",
          "That so called \"zoo\" is a disgrace. If Serbia enters the EU, the facilities will be shut down immediately. Insanely small cages for the animals, no effort whatsever to recreate the animals' natural habitat. Most of the cages didnt even have \u2026",
          "Lots of animals and new ones added!",
          "Amazing",
          "Average Zoo with so-so variety. We visited it in the mid-summer season and to our disappointment almost third of the facilities were being renovated, so no animals were in sight. We even couldn't see any bears, which should be pretty common animal in the Balkans.",
          "this is one of the best places to visit with kids, zoo is clean, there are several coffee shops where you can buy snacks amd drinks for the kids, toilets are very clean. outside the zoo there is a huge park so it s easily a whole day trip around this area if you are not in a rush",

          "Its great place for family time.",
          "Terrible. Animals were confined to tiny spaces which were dirty and falling apart. It did not look like it had been cleaned in days. None of the animals looked lively and was actually shocking witnessing how they live. I don\u2019t doubt they \u2026",
          "Number of stars is the ratio of animals you will see to animals you think you'll see. Ticket price is not adjusted to outside conditions but hey... this is the way things work around here.",

          "I went to this zoo a few days ago. I didn\u2019t think the animals seemed very happy and noticed there definitely wasn\u2019t enough space for many types of animals there. The birds don\u2019t really have anywhere to fly or much to do. The chimpanzee enclosure was probably the saddest. Hippo in nasty stagnant water.",

      "name": "Ada Ciganlija",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "Ada Ciganlija (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0410\u0434\u0430 \u0426\u0438\u0433\u0430\u043d\u043b\u0438\u0458\u0430; pronounced [\u02c8\u01ce\u02d0da tsi\u02c8\u0261\u01cenlija]), colloquially shortened to Ada, is a river island that has artificially been turned into a peninsula, located in the Sava River's course through central Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. The name can also refer to the adjoining artificial Lake Sava and its beach. To take advantage of its central location, over the past few decades, it was turned into an immensely popular recreational zone, most notable for its beaches and sports facilities, which, during summer seasons, can have over 100,000 visitors daily  and up to 300,000 visitors over the weekend. Owing to this popularity, Ada Ciganlija has been commonly nicknamed \"More Beograda\" (\"Belgrade's Sea\"), which was officially accepted as an advertising slogan in 2008, stylised as More BeogrADA.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\nAda Ciganlija is located on the southern bank of the Sava River, 4 km away from its mouth, and entirely belongs to Belgrade's municipality of \u010cukarica. Its eastern tip roughly borders the urban neighborhood of Senjak on the west (across an inlet called \u010cukarica Bay), and the body of the peninsula borders the neighborhoods of \u010cukarica and Maki\u0161 (both across Lake Sava). Across the river, Ada Ciganlija borders Novi Beograd (specifically residential bloks and the urban neighborhoods of Savski Nasip) and another artificial peninsula called Mala Ciganlija (\"Little Ciganlija\"). Between Ada Ciganlija and Novi Beograd lies Ada Me\u0111ica, a wholly insulated river island.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nFormerly an island, Ada Ciganlija is now an elongated peninsula, stretching for 6 km from west to east and 700 m from north to south at its widest, and covering an area of 2.7 km2. The entire Ada Ciganlija ecological complex, which stretches into the municipality of Novi Beograd, covers an area of 8 km2, including the islands of Ada Ciganlija and Ada Me\u0111ica, waterways between the two Adas and Lake Sava, and some of Maki\u0161 itself. Lake Sava, formerly a branch of the Sava, was turned into a lake with two dams, while the remaining section on the northeast was turned into \u010cukarica Bay. There is another small lake on Ada Ciganlija itself, known as Ada Safari.\nThanks to the combination of factors, Ada Ciganlija is privileged with a microclimate. Situated between a river, an artificial flowing lake, various islands, and a heavily wooded area, air humidity is heightened compared to the rest of the city, helping to nullify Belgrade's high temperatures during summer.\n\n\n=== Hydrology ===\n\n\n==== Lake Sava ====\n\nLake Sava (Serbian: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0458\u0435\u0437\u0435\u0440\u043e, Savsko jezero), often also referred to as Ada, was created from the right arm of the Sava with the building of two dams near the northern and southern tips of the island in 1967. The lake is 4.2 km (2.6 mi) long, has an average width of 200 m (660 ft) and is 4 to 6 m (13 to 20 ft) deep. It covers and area of  0.86 km2 (0.33 sq mi) and is 78 m (256 ft) above sea level, one of the lowest areas of Belgrade. 7 km (4.3 mi) of its shores on both sides have been transformed into a gravel beach. The water regularly reaches 24 \u00b0C (75 \u00b0F) during summer.\nBoth dams allow water to flow through tubes and pumps. This way, the main body of the lake is connected to the smaller body of water on the southwest, which is itself separated from the river by the third dam. This mini \"buffer\" lake called Talo\u017enik (\"depository\") is used as a purifier for the waters of both Lake Sava and city waterworks, which also use this water. Filtered water is constantly being pumped into the lake while on the northeast, the water is pumped out by electrically powered pumps through another dam into \u010cukarica Bay. In this way, an artificial flow of water through the lake is created. Because the water is also used for drinking, sanitation and environmental protection of the lake are imperative and the lake is under rigorous environmental protection. Weeds are groomed on the lake's bottom to purify the water by bonding phosphorus, nitrogen and dirt. Use of motorboats is strictly prohibited in the lake and dogs are not allowed on the beach.Wildlife in the lake mostly consists of the fish species which were introduced since the 1950s. The most common fish in the lake are the introduced silver carp and grass carp, but large autochthonous wels catfish, weighting over 100 kg (220 lb), can also be found, causing concern among the swimmers so the authorities issued a statement that they are harmless. In March 2019, a 2 m (6 ft 7 in) long catfish was caught in the lake. Catfish of this size is a rarity and, as required by the law, it was returned in to the lake. Other catfishes of this size were reported by the divers in previous years, but they lay lazily on the bottom of the lake, not swimming to the surface.There are 20 to 25 fish species in the lake, including the autochthonous carp, northern pike, zander, common bream, asp and European perch, and the imported, and highly invasive brown bullhead, Prussian carp and pumpkinseed. There are also crayfish and crabs, and since 2010s, the red-eared slider inhabits the lake, too, probably being released in the lake by the owners who kept them as pets.The freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta sowerbyi was discovered in 2008, garnering much attention for the lake. These anthomedusae begin their life as polyps and develop into jellyfish only if conditions, such as purity and water temperature over 25 \u00b0C, are right. However, authorities claim that these harmless and almost invisible jellyfish (they are only 3 mm (0.12 in) to 5 mm (0.20 in) wide, bell is 12 mm (0.47 in) in diameter and have no sting cells) actually have been present in the lake for over 20 years. The first specimens were discovered in 1994 and they can also be found in the Danube. They live only for several days.\n\n\n==== Ada Safari ====\nAda Safari (Serbian: \u0410\u0434\u0430 \u0421\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0440\u0438) is a small, irregularly shaped lake on the northern tip of Ada Ciganlija, primarily used for fishing. In the late 1960s, the hole was formed as the sand was dug to construct the permanent embankment which connected Ada Ciganlija to the mainland, turning it into the peninsula by 1974.It was the last remaining marshy area during the transformation Ada Ciganlija, infested by undergrowth and reeds, until its conversion into a lake in 1994, 235 m (771 ft) long, with an area of 6 ha (15 acres). It was officially opened in 1995. The water pumps are used to fill the lake, bringing water from the Sava Lake. Rare species of fish were introduced in order to create a fishing resort, which now consists of 300 numbered fishing seats around the lake with an obligatory special permit for fishing. Fish species include common carp, grass carp, crucian carp, wels catfish, Prussian carp, zander and tench, which is rare in Serbia. Fish are mostly released back into the lake as fishermen can keep their catch in case if the fish is lighter than 10 kg (22 lb), if they pay extra and if it is not a tench, which is protected by the law.Some animals roam freely in the area, like rabbits, ducks, geese and swans. A small zoo has been built next to the lake, chiefly containing swamp birds, as well as more exotic animals such as peacocks, pheasants and pygmy goats. There is also a restaurant on the shore and a typical Serbian 18th century house from \u0160umadija which was deconstructed from the Central Serbia and transferred here. The house was originally built around 1735 in the village of Junkovac, near Topola. There is also a \"Magical forest\", an area for the kids with reproductions of the fairytale characters: Evil Witch, Cinderella, Wolf and the Three Little Pigs, Little Red Riding Hood, the Scarecrow and the Tin Man, etc. There is a small stream over which the bridge and the cross, both made from timber, have been constructed. Fish are especially prepared for the winter in the process of \"winter carp bathing\". In the second week of November each year, fish (up to 9 tonnes in total) are taken from the lake to the shore by the professional fishermen. The lake is then emptied and the largest fish specimens are \"bathed\" in the small bathtubs with the water mixed with the medical, healing ingredients.\n\n\n==== \u010cukarica Bay ====\nWhen Ada was connected to the mainland via the embankments in 1967, northern section of the arm of the Sava river which separated the island (\u010cukarica Arm, \u0427\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0440\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0446) from the mainland was transformed into the \u010cukarica Bay (\u0427\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0432), though the previous name survived. The arm is elongated in the southwest-northeast direction, bounded by the northern tip of Ada Ciganlija, the embankment and the right bank of the Sava (neighborhoods of Careva \u0106uprija and southern stretch of Bara Venecija, formerly known as \u0160est Topola). This is where the Top\u010diderka river flows into the Sava. Near the connection point with the main flow of the Sava, the bay is today crossed by the Ada Bridge.The bay is used for the sports and leisure activities as the kayaking clubs were located in it, so as the marina for small boats, while the banks are encircled with the bicycle paths. The bay is 1.3 km (0.81 mi) long and 120 to 160 m (390 to 520 ft) wide. Surface of the bay itself is 16 ha (40 acres), but the area which city administration included in the bay locality includes and additional 5.8 ha (14 acres) of aquatorium and 20.8 ha (51 acres) of the surrounding land. In March 2018 city announced an urban design competition for the adaptation of the total bay area (42.6 ha (105 acres)). The forested area on the mainland, at the entrance into the bay, administratively belongs to the municipality of Savski Venac and covers 3.61 ha (8.9 acres).Since the early 1980s there is a constant ecological problem due to the massive pollution of the bay as a result of the polluted waters of the Top\u010diderka river. The garbage and highly polluted silt fills the bay and creates shoals. During low-tide, the bay is unusable for the boats in the marina, located in the middle of the bay or for the kayakers of Partizan and Crvena Zvezda who use the bay for practice. The silt is up to 5 m (16 ft) thick, smells bad and is poisonous so the swimming in the bay is forbidden.\nIn 2011 the estimated amount of garbage sludge in the bay was 120,000 m3 (4,200,000 cu ft). The sludge cannot simply be dredged and thrown in the Sava further downstream due to the toxicity. The plan  to build a treatment plant on the bank near the Belgrade Fair which would detoxicate the sludge and produce fertilizer from it was scrapped due to the high costs. For now, the silt is being dredged and vegetation cut just enough to make it navigable for the small boats in the marina.The pollution of the bay continued, including two atmospheric precipitation collectors which overspill into the bay, to which the fecal sewage is illegally connected, and the bay was described as the ecological time bomb. In December 2019 the winning project was announced. It includes the transformation of the bay into the artificial whitewater and the proper marina. A project by Aleksandar Nedeljkovi\u0107, named \"Flight of the gull\" envisions the reconstruction and elevation of all embankments along the bay's banks, turning them into the vertical retaining walls. Pumps for the creation of the whitewater by day, would be used to purify the water by night and prevent the sludge from depositing on the bottom. Proposed name for the marina and sports center is \"Whitewater Arena\". However, this project, just like some others from the competition (conducting the Top\u010diderka directly into the main Sava riverbed by the pipes) does not tackle the problem of the already existing sludge deposits or the toxicity of the waste. Also, it was outright labeled as way too expensive, even by its authors (up to \u20ac70 million).\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\nAda Ciganlija has a unique ecosystem, creating an oasis in the urban area. Most of the peninsula is forested. The original, thick deciduous forest mainly consists of oaks, elms, birches and willows. In the mid 20th century, further planned forestation of Ada Ciganlija included the planting of American poplars and green ash. In 2010, total forested area covered 1.79 km2 (0.69 sq mi), or two thirds of the island. This characteristic of Ada gives its visitors an illusion of being in complete wilderness, aided by the fact that city ambient noise is completely muted by the thick forest.\nMost of the forest on the island is protected, including the entire central, northern and western sections. These parts of the peninsula are entirely wild with uncultivated vegetation and very little or no human presence, making it unique compared to other European city islands and peninsulas.Part of the Ada's central forested complex was declared a protected habitat \"Fungi of Ada Ciganlija\" by the city on 29 November 2013. Apart from the wood fauna characterized for the wet soils, it hosts 250 species of fungi, many of which are listed on Serbian and international lists of rare or endangered species. It is the only known habitat in Serbia of Myriostoma coliforme.\n\nIn terms of fauna, besides having numerous amphibians and insects, Ada Ciganlija contains several mammal species, considered special due to the setting of the peninsula in an urban area. Foxes, hares and roe deer inhabit the peninsula. However, with environmentalists warning that the island's biocoenosis has been overly affected, a new population of 60 hares and 100 pheasants was introduced into the ecosystem in 2006.\nBird species include more common lapwings, mallards, quails and pheasants. Common woodland and parkland birds during the nesting season include great tit, blue tit, long-tailed tit, Eurasian nuthatch, European green woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, golden oriole, nightingale, blackcap, common chaffinch, hooded crow, European magpie, common wood pigeon, feral pigeon, white wagtail and barn swallow.\nAda is also the wintering ground for some threatened migratory birds, most notably the pygmy cormorant which winters in Belgrade in large numbers. Pygmy cormorant inhabited the Pan\u010deva\u010dki Rit marshland, just north of Belgrade, in the early 20th century, but after that area was drained and urbanized, they disappeared. Several hundreds of birds in the early 1990s began spending winters on the Malo Ratno Ostrvo, in the Danube. When their number exceeded 1,000, they resettled to three new locations: first at the willow grove on the Sava's bank (Belgrade Fair) and then to the area near the tip of Ada and the neighboring Mala Ciganlija. Their number rose every year to 6,750 in 2007/08, but since then is generally reducing and in 2015 it was 3,850 which is still 5,4% of the European and 2% of the world's pygmy cormorant population. There were concerns that the building of the new Ada Bridge in 2008-12 would disturb the habitat, but the birds endured it well. Their habitat was protected by law in 2008. Any destruction, clearing or pruning of the vegetation is forbidden, so as scaring, disturbing or killing of the birds.\n\n\n=== Settlements ===\n\n\n==== Partizan ====\nThe only settlement on Ada Ciganlija is in its northern section, located behind another dam. It is called Partizan, because of the nearby Partizan rowing club. City authorities plan to relocate the settlement. During the 2006 European floods, city authorities urged them to move to the mainland from the settlement, which was located almost 8 m (26 ft) below the dam, as the Sava reached a record height of 723 cm (285 in). The wall of the dam, on the brink of collapse, was hastily strengthened and elevated in an effort to prevent catastrophe, but even in these conditions, the populace refused to relocate, claiming the city to just be using the situation to relocate them.\nIn 1959 the construction of the settlement was suggested and the first houses were built in 1960. Those were small, serial weekend houses with an area of 12 m2 (130 sq ft). Most of the original construction was finished from 1964 to 1966. As the nearby Ada Safari wasn't adapted yet and was a marshland, original settlers, who were from the upper classes, were leaving and instead the workers who migrated from the interior of Serbia settled in. Additional boost was an influx of refugees from the Yugoslav Wars since 1991.\nAs their families grew, inhabitants expanded the houses. As of 2016 Partizan had some 1,000 inhabitants in 260 houses covering an area of 14 ha (35 acres). By the latest urbanistic plans, the settlement is still to be evacuated as it is built without any permits and is located in the zone of the sanitary protection.\n\n\n==== Old Bath ====\nClose to the northern tip, as the northeastern extension of Partizan settlement, there is an Old Bath \"Partizan\" (Staro Kupatilo). Since 1983 it has been a location of an artistic colony, occupied by the painters and sculptors. In the 1980s the venue organized many artistic exhibitions. After the 2006 floods a project of reconstruction of the embankment to prevent the flooding was introduced. The embankment, which was to prevent 25 Renney water wells from being flooded, passes right through the bath building which was to be demolished so that this gap in the embankment can be filled. The gap, which is considered the weakest section of the entire embankment system on the island is just 100 m (330 ft) from the Partizan settlement. Next to the building is the parking for the communal vehicles used for the works on Ada. In 2011, the management ordered the artists to move out. As of 2017, the building still stands.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Nomenclature ===\nThe etymology of the name could be Celtic in origin, which probably is the most likely scenario. Some believe that it is derived by some form of the word for Romani (cigani, \"gypsies\"), attested in 1717 as German: Zigeuner-Insel when it was mentioned as a depopulated village after the Austrian takeover of Belgrade.An Italian work from 1788 mentions it as Isola degli Zingari. The original toponym might have been singalia, from Celtic Singi (cf. Singidunum). During World War II it was renamed \"Serbian Ada\" (Srpska ada). The first part of Ada Ciganlija's name, ada, means \"river island\" in Serbian, a word of Turkish origin (meaning \"island\"), but in landlocked Serbia it specifically denotes river islands, beside the already existing Serbian word for island, ostrvo. A river island can also be referred to as ostrvo (e.g. Veliko Ratno Ostrvo) but never vice versa.\n\n\n=== Human history ===\n\n\n==== Antiquity ====\nThe remains belonging to the Scordisci, a Celtic  tribe which founded Singidunum and Taurunum, the predecessors of Belgrade and Zemun, respectively, were found.\n\n\n==== 1680s-1914 ====\n\nArea of Ostru\u017enica, near the southern tip of Ada Ciganlija, was a location of the Long Bridge, the first permanent bridge in Belgrade's history. As the opposing, Syrmian side across the Sava was a vast marsh at the time (modern New Belgrade), the bridge didn't stop at the bank but continued for some length above the swamp. Because of that, the people also called it the Bridge above the marsh (Most preko mo\u010dvare). The bridge was built by the Austrians to help them conquer Belgrade from the Ottomans during the 1688 Siege of Belgrade. According to the records, a seasoned Belgrade master craftsman \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 \"in only one month, with the help of his 400 workers, built the Long Bridge, using 2,000 tree trunks, 1,100 wooden piles, 15,500 bundles of palings and 12,000 palisade pickets.\" Right next to it, bit closer to Ada Ciganlija, the Austrians constructed another, classical pontoon bridge, which \"leaned on the Long Bridge\".The Romani settlement which existed on Ada in the 17th century was displaced from the island to the Sava's right bank, at the mouth of the Top\u010diderka, before the Austrian occupation of Belgrade from 1717 to 1739. It is not known whether it happened some time before or during the fighting from 1716 to 1718. One map from the Austrian period shows a Romani settlement with 24 houses at the mouth of Top\u010diderka. Maps also show that the settlement existed during the next Austrian occupation from 1788 to 1791.When the Austrian army attacked Belgrade in the 18th century, the Ottomans expelled Serbian population from the city, so they temporarily settled on Ada. When Belgrade was liberated by the Serbian rebels in the First Serbian Uprising, leader of the uprising, Kara\u0111or\u0111e, granted the island to Mladen Milovanovi\u0107, the first city chief. After the collapse of the uprising, Milovanovi\u0107 fled to Hungary, but returned in 1813 and unsuccessfully tried to find the gold which he has dug and hidden somewhere on Ada.The importance of Ada Ciganlija can be traced back to 1821, when it was declared a protected public domain by then Prince of Serbia, Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107. The first official urban plan for Belgrade was drafted in 1867. It was a work of Emilijan Josimovi\u0107, the first Serbian trained urbanist. He envisioned Ada as the main sports' center of Belgrade and was to be transformed in the \"source of fresh air\", a term Josimovi\u0107 used for large forests. Neglected since then, Ada came to the spotlight in 1908 when the Society of the Belgrade's journalists organized the first journalists' ball on the lower tip of Ada. In 1911, the first Serbian feature-length motion picture, The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Vo\u017ed Kara\u0111or\u0111e was filmed on the island.\n\n\n==== World War I ====\nOn 28 July 1914, when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, thus triggering the World War I, Serbian forces spread over the island to prevent Austrians to use it as the starting point of entering Serbia. Two major battles ensued, on 22\u201324 September 1914 and in September 1915. In an effort to exploit the withdrawal of the Serbian army from Syrmia in September 1914, Austro-Hungarian Lieutenant field marshal Kasimir von L\u00fctgendorf decided to conduct the feint attack on the Sava rivers (Ciganlija and Me\u0111ica) which was to be followed by the landing operation on the Serbian side of the river, conquering of the neighborhoods of Banovo Brdo and Top\u010dider and then, using the western route, entering downtown Belgrade. Attack began on 22 September when the first group of the Austrians attempted to land on the southern tip of Ada. The location was defended from the blockhouse \"He-goat\", across the river in the Maki\u0161 forest. Under strong fire from the blockhouse, Austrians landed more to the north, in the area which Serbs didn't even defend because it was the plain marsh and it was thought that no one will land there. That way, Austrians successfully landed on the island without much resistance. Major Dobrivoje Mojsilovi\u0107, acting commander of the Ada's defense, engaged the Austrians in an effort to force them to retreat across the river. Serbian reserve was sent to the battle and major Mojsilovi\u0107, who was wounded, was replaced by major Svetomir \u0110uki\u0107. After several charges which resulted in hand-to-hand combat, Serbs cornered Austrians on the Ada's northern tip. During that time, behind Serbian back, Austria landed more troops from Me\u0111ica so the Serbian forces ended being encircled. They managed to break out but by that time they were attacked from the flank by the new Austrian forces. Serbs retreated to the easternmost section of the island and started to dig in. On 23 September Austrians conducted three charges on Serbian positions, coming close to only 30 steps from the trenches, but were backed off. As Austrian army had problems with the invasion of western Serbia and attack on \u0160abac, General Alfred Krau\u00df asked from the commander of the forces for the entire Balkans, Oskar Potiorek, to send him two regiments from L\u00fctgendorf. Potiorek not only agreed but he ordered L\u00fctgendorf to reroute all forces to \u0160abac. On 24 September the Austrians withdrew. Serbs followed them to make sure it is not another ploy, but the withdrawal was complete. Serbs lost 1 officer and 17 soldiers, while the Austrian fatalities included 4 officers and 310 soldiers.There was a year long shootout between the two armies, with long calm periods in between, before the German army interfered and began non-stop heavy artillery beating of the island in the late September 1915. Hand-to-hand battle ensued and the German fighters pushed the Serbs from the island. Serbian loses were heavy, turning effectively Ada into an open graveyard, earning a moniker \"Island of death\".\n\n\n==== Interbellum ====\nDuring Interbellum, Ada wasn't the most popular recreational area as the major beach area was across its northern tip, in the Gospodarska Mehana section of the Senjak  neighborhood. Still, even then, one of major Serbian writers Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107, nicknamed it Vodeni cvet (watery flower) because of its beauty.In 1920 city decided to arrange the Ada as part of the international design competition concerning the arrangement and expansion of Belgrade. Competition was announced in 1921. One of the submitted works,  titled Urbs Magna (\"Great City\"), proposed construction of the large, multi-functional stadium and transformation of the island into the sports park. First facilities of the swimming and rowing clubs on the island were built after that. In 1936 city government adopted a new general urban plan which projected Ada as the \"sports island\".\n\n\n==== World War II and after ====\nUntil 1941, a prison was located on Ada Ciganlija. On the night of July 17, 1946, new Communist authorities executed a number of former politicians on Ada Ciganlija, while military officers were tried as collaborators with the Nazis during World War II, including Chetniks leaders Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 and Kosta Mu\u0161icki, and ministers in the government of Milan Nedi\u0107: Tanasije-Tasa Dini\u0107, \u0110ura Doki\u0107 and Velibor Joni\u0107. Despite other plans, Ada was a prison from 1928 to 1954 and was nicknamed the \"Little Serbian Alcatraz\". It was established on the notion of the king Alexander I of Yugoslavia and the prisoners include Milovan \u0110ilas, Mo\u0161a Pijade and Borislav Peki\u0107.In 1947, a public swimming pool was built behind the premises of the \"Crvena Zvezda\" rowing club. Known as the \"Sever pool\" (Severov bazen), it became quite popular as it was one of the rare such venues in Belgrade in those days. Many swimmers held preparations for the Olympic games in it.In 1957 city government decided to put in order the neglected, feral island. The beach was gradually prolonged as the overgrowth and trees were cut and cleared, under the strict control by the experts from the University of Belgrade Forestry Faculty. Works on transforming the island began in 1960. By September 1961 an embankment on the outer side of the island was finished. It is 6 km (3.7 mi) long, 8 m (26 ft) wide at the crown and prevented the Sava to flood the island every spring, like it used to do. Already at the time, Ada was the largest and the most visited swimming and excursion site. Milan Pe\u0107inar, engineer and a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts suggested the dual solution for Ada, as both the source of the drinking water and a sports and recreation center. His plan was conducted by 1967 when Ada was connected to the mainland on both the north and south tips, and the Sava Lake and the settling basin Talo\u017enik. An underground pipeline was built in 1969 which conducted water from the river into the newly formed lake. The water is being purified in the Talo\u017enik, before being conducted further into the lake and to the Belgrade's major water facility in Maki\u0161.In the late 1960s and early 1970s the first sporting championships were organized, such as the kayaking championships in 1971, prompting the construction of special facilities. The popularity of Ada was further increased in the 1980s with the music and entertainment show Leto na Adi (\"Summer on Ada\"), televised live by the Radio Television of Serbia. Also in the 1980s, partial clearing of the wood on the Maki\u0161 side began, so as the filling of the beach on that side. In time, a continuous, over 7 km (4.3 mi) long beach around the entire lake was formed. Maki\u0161 side was officially declared a swimming area in the season of 2010. In June 2017 construction of two new pipelines which would increase the amount of water transferred from the Talo\u017enik to the water treatment facility in Maki\u0161 began. As a result, during the works in the off-season 2018-2019, the lake level was significantly lowered.Ada Ciganlija is today managed by the municipal government via the Public Enterprise \"Ada Ciganlija\" (JP \"Ada Ciganlija\"), which maintains the grounds of the recreational areas and, especially, the beach and Lake Sava.  It is responsible for cleanliness, maintenance such as trimming of the underwater algae, public safety (lifeguards), and so on. Even though the island is a public asset, the island itself is not exclusively managed and owned by the city.  There are numerous private entities that administer businesses and recreation facilities, such as the golf course. Notably, many famous Serbian sports personalities have invested in the area.\n\n\n== Facilities, activities and tourism ==\n\nApart from the sport facilities, a 7 kilometer-long beach of Lake Sava has a closely supervised, fenced-off children's swimming area. Ada Ciganlija features a tall sports observation tower and bleachers on multiple levels which is its most prominent structure as well and one of very few permanent solid structures. One of those structures is the \"Jezero\" hotel at the entrance.\nThe northern edge of the island is lined with attached floating barges, or houses on the water owned by many inhabitants of Belgrade as a weekend refuge given the peninsula's exceptionally quiet and green environment. In addition, many city dwellers come to enjoy fishing excursions, picnics and barbecues.\nFrom the beach, stunning views of central Belgrade can be seen, and sunsets are particularly beautiful when viewed from here.\n\n\n=== Sport ===\n\nThe island has been conceptualised as Belgrade's focal point for mass sporting activity and recreation. As such, it features a great number of facilities, which get more numerous every year. They include:\n\nAmerican footballAda Ciganlija has in the past been a host to a number of local and international water sporting events such as competitions in rowing and kayaking. The very first golf course in Serbia has been built on this island in recent years along with a golf club house, a golfing store, golfing school and a practice range. This golf course is also the seat of the first and so far only Serbian golfing association. Also there is a separated cycling and rollerblading path that goes full circle around the lake (approximately 8 km long) and is connected to the path that goes all the way by the Sava river in downtown.\nThe island is home to the \"Rowing Sport Club\" and several rowing societies like VK Partizan, VK Crvena Zvezda, and VK Grafi\u010dar. A sailing school and club, in addition to all accompanying sailing facilities, can be found on Ada Ciganlija.\n\n\n=== Restaurants and nightlife ===\n\nFor decades, Ada Ciganlija was popular among loners and fishermen, including the famous actor Pavle Vujisi\u0107. After his death in 1988, it was proposed that the access road to Ada should be named after him, but another street in the new neighborhood of Altina in Zemun was later named after him. Other famous bohemians which dwelled occasionally on Ada after the 1960s were actor Dragan Nikoli\u0107, writers Momo Kapor and Zuko D\u017eumhur and opera singers \u017divan Saramandi\u0107 and Milka Stojanovi\u0107. Nobelist author Ivo Andri\u0107 called Ada the \"Boka Kotorska of Belgrade\" and the \"Green jewel of our Pannonian rivers\".Number of splavovi (float barges) began to grow by the late 1970s and the visitors began to include the members of the political and business elite also, including mayor \u017divorad Kova\u010devi\u0107. One of the first barges was \"JAT\", opened in the late 1970s. It was originally intended only for the employees of the JAT Airways, but soon became a gathering place for the regular clientele, becoming a famous venue in the city. It was derelict by the 2000s, when it was sold to a private owner. Before it was renovated, the barge detached and was taken by the river downstream. The owner took only emergency measures to keep it afloat, but in January 2019 it sank under the heavy snowfall. The barge itself was considered one of the best on the river. \"Argument\", the first restaurant on splav in Belgrade was opened in 1983. It looked like a \"railroad car\", without any specificities. In the 1990s it was relocated to the neighborhood of U\u0161\u0107e. At the time, Ada wasn't that well connected to the rest of the city which gave this venues a certain aura of exclusivity. Splav \"Sara\" was the very first venue in Belgrade with solely electronic music. It was opened only for a year in 1994.Belgrade has a reputation for offering a vibrant nightlife, and many clubs that are open until dawn can be found throughout the city. The most recognizable nightlife features of Belgrade are the splavovi, spread along the banks of the Sava and Danube Rivers. The island has over 70 restaurants, bars and caf\u00e9s as well as a caf\u00e9-cinema.\n\n\n=== Ada Mall ===\nFirst ideas of building a shopping mall on \u010cukarica side, across the Ada Ciganlija entrance where the former \"Minel Dinamo\" company was, appeared in 2007. Construction began in March 2017 and the object was opened on 24 May 2019, under the name of Ada Mall (Ada Mol). It has 5 floors, total floor area of over 90,000 m2 (970,000 sq ft) and atypical, attractive design, compared to the usual box-shaped malls in Belgrade: it has wavy fa\u00e7ade with terraces and step-like floors.Construction itself was already problematic, both financially (connections with the mayor Sini\u0161a Mali) and in terms of building process. After a while, investor reached a bedrock and decided to use dynamite. As the mall is embedded into the cliff which is fully urbanized on top, and dynamite explosions were used for almost a year, houses and buildings of the residents cracked in time. The roof tiles were falling off, while window frames separated from the walls. In the end, the residents received no support from either the investor or the city government, as municipal inspector concluded that the cracks on dozen houses are not caused by the explosions below.As the opening of the facility was hurried, so that it could be opened ceremonially by the politicians, it wasn't fully finished when it was opened. Some sections were empty, dirty and covered in dust, the walls were naked, without panels, floor panels were badly placed, and electric wires were protruding into the corridors. The fa\u00e7ade wasn't completely finished either, while some works on the access paths and the building itself have been reported as \"slack\". In the next several months, streak of bad luck for the object continued. Already in June it was evacuated two times in just couple of days, after it got flooded during the heavy rains. This gave the facility a nickname \"Kada Mol\" (kada, Serbian for bathtub). In July it was evacuated again because of the faulty alarm system, and in September due to the sabotage of the same system.The original project also envisioned a footbridge (pasarela), which would directly connect the mall with the pedestrian section of the Radni\u010dka Street. The footbridge hasn't been constructed, but the investor, who estimated the cost of the short pedestrian bridge to \u20ac1 million, promised it will be built by the end of 2019. Construction of the footbridge began in May 2020. It is not going to only connect the mall with the bus stop across the Pa\u0161trovi\u0107eva Street, as originally planned, but will continue from there across the Radni\u010dka Street, reaching the entrance area of Ada Ciganlija. Deadline was set for September 2020.In June 2020, construction of another footbridge to Ada Ciganlija was announced, a bit further from the Ada Moll. It will directly connect the neighborhood of \u010cukari\u010dka Padina with hypermarket Tempo Centar, and further with Ada Ciganlija, over the 8-lane Obrenovac Road. Deadline is set for June 2021.\n\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n\nOne of the island's most noted landmarks is the fountain, based on the famous  Jet d'Eau (water-jet), situated in Lake Geneva. The Belgrade one is also 140 metres high and it was installed in 1996. The fountain operates during the day all year round, except in case there is frost or a particularly strong wind. It also operates in the evening between spring and autumn and is lit by a set of lights. During the summer months in the later hours, the island stages a special laser light spectacle for those still present at the beach.\nThis Island also has an artistic sculpture workshop located at the eastern end in the direction of the city. Ada Ciganlija also has a children's theatre featuring scheduled performances, as well as a Robinson Crusoe-themed entertainment feature that stages themed performances.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nAlthough there are land routes leading to the island across the artificial dams, they are seldom used due to poor accessibility to the city's main roads and public transport system. Numerous routes of the city's public transport (GSP Beograd) pass close to the eastern entrance: bus routes 23, 37, 51, 52, 53, 56, 56L, 57, 58, 88, 89, 91, 92, 511, 551 and 552, while tram lines 12 and 13 also pass relatively nearby. Due to the ever-larger number of visitors, GSP Beograd introduced special seasonal bus lines, specifically designated for transport to Ada Ciganlija from distant parts of Belgrade. They have been expanding in recent years: Ada1 (Central Belgrade and Vidikovac), Ada2 (Zemun, Blokovi), Ada3 (Konjarnik), Ada4 (Mirijevo), Ada5 (Be\u017eanijska Kosa, Novi Beograd).There are regular ferry services to take people from Belgrade's river banks onto the island. In 2008, experimental introduction of public transport by boat began, one of whose routes is from Blok 44 (Novi Beograd)-Ada Ciganlija. There is also a small electric road vehicle that tours the island called the \"tourist train\". There is also an impromptu recreational marina on the island's downstream end. There are plans to expand this marina and make it permanent. Boating in the lake, as well as car traffic on land, is strictly forbidden. There is a large parking lot on the Maki\u0161 side of the river.\nIn 1922 company \"\u010cavlina and Sladoljev\" from Zagreb drafted the project of connecting two banks of the Sava river by the cable car. In 1928, building company \"\u0160umadija\" again proposed the construction of the cable car, which they called \"air tram\" but this project was planned to connect Zemun to Kalemegdan on Belgrade Fortress, via Great War Island. The interval of the cabins was set at 2 minutes and the entire route was supposed to last 5 minutes. The project never realized. Engineer and CEO of the Yugoslav institute for urbanism and dwelling \"Juginus\", Mirko Radovanac, revived the idea in the 1990s. After conducting extensive surveys (traffic analysis, interviews with the commuters, climatic, geological, urban and other researches), \"Juginus\" presented the project in 1993. They proposed that the terminuses should be at the Sports Center Ko\u0161utnjak and Block 44 in the neighborhood of Savski Blokovi in New Belgrade, across the Sava. Stops in between would include the major public transportation roundabout in Banovo Brdo, Maki\u0161 and Ada Ciganlija, five in total. They called it the \"ideal route\". The plan also included construction of commercial areas around the terminuses, which would cover 2,000 m2 (22,000 sq ft) and help with the profitability of the project. Apart from being ecological and an attraction, it was estimated that it would shorten the trip for 45 minutes. City government included the project into the city's General Urban Plan, which envisioned the construction in phases, the first being a 1,000 m (3,300 ft) long section Block 44-Ada Ciganlija. It would lay on 8 steel pillars, 35 m (115 ft) above the ground and the trip would last for 3 minutes. The cabins were projected to receive not just the commuters, but also the bicycles, skateboards, sledges and skis, as the cableway was planned to work year-round. The complete facility would have of 27 pillars, it would be 5 km (3.1 mi) long which would be travelled in 15 minutes by 2,000 commuters per hour. Despite the project has been publicly revived by the mayors Dragan \u0110ilas (2008\u20132013) and Sini\u0161a Mali (2013-2018), it is still on hold.\n\n\n=== Bridges ===\n\n\n==== Ada Bridge ====\n\nA new cable-stayed bridge is being built across the Sava, over the eastern tip of the Ada Ciganlija. The bridge is set to be a future landmark due to its height and grandeur. The central abutment is to be 200 meters tall, carrying hundreds of cables suspending the bridge. It will provide a direct land link to the island via the elevators as well as a planned light rail station that will stop mid-bridge to service passengers to and from the island.\n\n\n==== Ada Bridge II ====\nWhen plans were made for the Ada Bridge, one of the proposals was the location on the opposite, upstream tip of Ada Ciganlija, instead of the downstream one, where it was built in the end. It would connect Maki\u0161 on the right, and Savski Nasip on the left bank of the Sava. When Ada Bridge was close to be finished, architects suggested this other location as the place where the next Belgrade bridge might or should be built.\n\n\n==== New Belgrade-Ada Ciganlija Bridge ====\nIn March 2020, it was announced that the construction of the first pedestrian-cyclist bridge in Belgrade will commence in 2021. It will connect New Belgrade with the island of Ada Ciganlija across the Sava, as the continuation of the Omladinskih Brigada street in Block 70. Public, partially underground garage with 300 parking spots will be built at the end of the street. This is the second part of the project city administration alleged is the result of citizens' online voting (first part is relocation of the Old Sava Bridge on dry land, in the Park U\u0161\u0107e to become an \"attraction\"). Reporters and public distanced from the voting or debunked it as being rigged.\n\n\n== Social aspect ==\nEver since Ada Ciganlija began gaining popularity, there have been varying views of its importance. During the economic hardship of the 1980s and subsequent wars of the 1990s, it was often regarded as an \"necessary evil\", as the only resort available to masses of economically disadvantaged people. Use of this recreation area has always been free of charge, leading to it often being overcrowded and regarded as having poor hygiene, because, for decades, Ada had no proper facilities or institutionalised care. That has changed however, and the zone is today properly maintained, and has suitable infrastructure and appropriate commercial and recreational content. It is now possible to play sports that were not even invented when transformation of Ada began and it has become a highly popular gathering place, especially among youth, and a must-see destination for foreign tourists visiting Belgrade.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSava\nBelgrade\nAda Bridge\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe island's official website (Serbian only)\nCity of Belgrade's Ada Ciganlija Page (Serbian, English, German and French)\nPicture gallery of Ada Ciganlija (Serbian only)\nBelgrade Golf Club, school and association (Serbian and English)\nImages of the new planned bridge over Ada \u2014 Belgrade's Land Development Agency\nAn interactive map of Ada \u2014 detailed (Serbian only)\nAn address book to help you find your way \u2014 detailed (Serbian only)\nAda 360\u00b0 Virtual tour (Serbian only)",

        "wiki": "The Ethnographic Museum (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0415\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458) is a museum located in Belgrade, the capital of Serbia. It is one of the oldest museums in the Balkans. The Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade fulfills its mission together with the efforts of various stakeholders in the domain of presentation, revitalization and development of crafts in Serbia.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe Ethnographic Museum in Belgrade was founded in 1901, when the Ethnographic Department was separated from the National Museum of Serbia. The inauguration of the first permanent exhibition of the museum was organized on 20 September 1904, during the centennial of the First Serbian Uprising. During the first years of its work, the activities of the Ethnographic Museum were focused on the purchase of museum items and the presentation of the Kingdom of Serbia abroad.\nIn World War I, a large number of museum items were destroyed, as well as the documentation and the library. The museum library was re-established in 1920. Today, its holdings contain about 60,000 publications: 33,000 books and about 27,000 journals dealing with ethnology, anthropology and related scholarly disciplines.\nDuring World War II, museum objects were packed and removed from the building in which the museum was housed at that time. After the war, the museum was moved into the building of the Belgrade Stock Exchange at No. 13 Studentski Trg (Square).\nThe museum collections currently contain about 200,000 items, 56,000 of which are ethnographic objects.\n\n\n== Building of the Museum ==\nAfter repeatedly changing location - from the home of Stev\u010de Mihajlovi\u0107 which is located at the corner of Kneza Milo\u0161a and Bir\u010daninova Street and the building at the corner of Njego\u0161eva and Knjeginje Zorke Street (1938) to the adapted building of the guards of the court complex on Terazije (1945-1948) \u2013 the Museum in 1951 moved into the building on the corner of 13, Studentski trg and 2, Uzun Mirkova, which was built during 1933 and 1934, and it was designed by architect Aleksandar \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107. It was built for the needs of the former BSE, as a building for business and residential purposes. According to its architectural features, the building belongs to mature modernist concept, while the accented verticalism carries foreign, mostly German influences. Erected as a five-story building in a prominent position within the surroundings of the Academic park in the immediate vicinity of higher education buildings (building of Advanced School - today the Rectorate of the Belgrade University, building of the New University - today the Faculty of Philology), cultural institutions (building of Kolarac National University) and city administration buildings (the building of the Belgrade municipality \u2013 today the Yugoslav Cinematheque, city police) immediately after the construction, it was recognized as a piece of extraordinary value, and it is valorized today as an important part of the art deco architecture in Serbia. It had its original purpose of the stock market until the beginning of the Second World War and after the end of the war, one part of the building changed its purpose. At the beginning of the 1950s, a part of the basement, the ground floor, the mezzanine, the first and the second floor were ceded to the Ethnographic Museum. In the period from 1951 to 1954, renovation work of this part of the building was carried out for the purpose of placing museum collections and funds and organizing exhibition activities, and with the forthcoming adaptation conducted during 1983-1984, the building was tailored to the museum almost completely, on all five floors. Adaptations of the building are primarily related to customizing the interior to the new function, while the authenticity of its facade and monumental entrance area was preserved. As a work of urban-architectural, cultural and historical values within which there is a cultural institution which cherishes a rich ethnographic heritage, the Ethnographic Museum was established in 1984 as a cultural monument.\n\n\n== The Museum today ==\nUntil today, eight permanent exhibitions and about 300 temporary exhibitions were opened in the Ethnographic Museum. The permanent exhibition occupies three levels of the building. Today, the Ethnographic Museum houses a large number of ethnographic objects, distributed in private collections (furniture, jewelry, traditions, costumes, folk architecture, industry, animal husbandry, transport, cult objects, etc.), has one of the richest specialized libraries in the Balkans and publishes professional publications, has a great conservation service that handles virtually all types of materials, has a large exhibition space, organizes extensive ethnographic research and has a lot of will and knowledge to carry out an ethnological and anthropological study of the 19th century. \nOn June 7, 2013, in the Ethnographical Museum, a list of intangible cultural heritage of Serbia was presented, which consists of 27 elements.\n\n\n== Sources ==\n1.\tJump up\u2191 \u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430, \u0434\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435 \u0415\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458; \u0417.\u041c., \u201e\u0415\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0458 \u0443 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443\u201c, \u0413\u041c\u0413\u0411 1, 1954, 316\u2013321.\n2.\tJump up\u2191 \u0417\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0437\u0430 \u0437\u0430\u0448\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443 \u0441\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0435 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0430, \u0447\u0430\u0441\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441 \u041d\u0430\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0452\u0435, \u041c\u0438\u043b\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043d, \u0413\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0459\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043e\u043f\u0443\u0441 \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0435 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u0402\u043e\u0440\u0452\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b\u0430 (1890-1952) http://beogradskonasledje.rs/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/7/9_milan_prosen.pdf accessed 30.01.2017.\n3.\tJump up\u2191 Belgrade City Institute for the Protection of Cultural Monuments /Ethnographic Museum\n4.\tJump up\u2191 http://beogradskonasledje.rs/kd/zavod/stari_grad/kapetan_misino_zdanje.html accessed 30.01.2017.\n5.\tJump up\u2191 http://beogradskonasledje.rs/kd/zavod/stari_grad/zgrada_kolarcevog_narodnog_univerziteta.html accessed 30.01.2017.\n6.\tJump up\u2191 http://beogradskonasledje.rs/kd/zavod/stari_grad/zgrada_beogradske_opstine.html accessed 30.01.2017.\n7.\tJump up\u2191 \u041c\u0438\u043b\u0430\u043d \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0435\u043d, \u0410\u0440 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u043e \u0443 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438, \u0440\u0443\u043a\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441 \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0434\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0431\u0440\u0430\u045a\u0435\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u041e\u0434\u0435\u0459\u0435\u045a\u0443 \u0437\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0443 \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u0424\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0444\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0443 \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443 2014. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435, 335-336.\n8.\tJump up\u2191 Serbian intangible heritage includes...

        "wiki": "Rajko Miti\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0420\u0430\u0458\u043a\u043e \u041c\u0438\u0442\u0438\u045b, pronounced [r\u01ce\u02d0jko m\u01d0\u02d0tit\u0255]; 19 November 1922 \u2013 29 March 2008) was a Serbian footballer, coach, executive and journalist.\nMiti\u0107 is considered one of the most important players in the history of Red Star Belgrade as he is the first out of only five players to have been awarded the Zvezdina zvezda.\nIn December 2014, Red Star Stadium, the principal stadium in Serbia, was officially renamed after him.\n\n\n== Playing career ==\n\n\n=== Club career ===\n\n\n==== Ko\u0161utnjak and BSK ====\nBefore becoming the first successful player of Red Star Belgrade, Miti\u0107 started his career in 1937 on the football fields of Ko\u0161utnjak. In May 1938, he was transferred to BSK Belgrade where he played from 1938\u20131944. For BSK, he became a member of the junior team of the then-champion. Two years later, in 1940, he had his debut as a striker for the first team, where he scored two goals.\nThe Second World War halted his football development, but he continued playing in 1944 for the engineer squadron under which he fought along with fellow future Yugoslav national team players Predrag \u0110aji\u0107 and Jovan Jezerki\u0107.\n\n\n==== Red Star Belgrade ====\nShort after Red Star Belgrade was founded on 4 March 1945, Miti\u0107 became the captain of the team, and wore the red and white uniform for fourteen seasons. In Red Star's uniform, he scored 262 goals in 572 matches in total. His popularity in the early fifties surpassed Belgrade and reached out to other cities and towns as well.\nAs captain and leader of the team, he won five league titles (1951, 1953, 1956, 1957, and 1959) and four national cup titles (1948, 1949, 1950, and 1958). One of his fondest memories was the first championship title, won in a dramatic finish, when the first place Dinamo Zagreb lost their lead by slipping in the last three rounds. This allowed Red Star to win by a better goal ratio of 0.018 goals. He almost never missed a match, except in 1947, when he had to go to rehabilitation after a knee meniscus operation.\nAs a captain, he most frequently remembered two of his decisions that had divided the football public. First, when he sent his best friend Branko Stankovi\u0107 to the dressing room because of inappropriate conduct. The second came on 7 April 1957 against Hajduk in Split, when he pulled the entire team off the pitch after a stone thrown from a disgruntled Red Star fan in the stands hit Bora Kosti\u0107 in the head.\nIn the 71st minute of the aforementioned match, the result was 1\u20131. The disciplinary committee of the Football Association of Yugoslavia suspended all the players of Red Star (except Vladimir Beara and Kosti\u0107) for a month. The club did not appeal against the decision, and Rajko Miti\u0107 made the most positive impression possible on the shocked football public.\nAs a big opponent of unfair play, he never pulled his opponent by the shirt, or tripped his opponents on purpose. There were plenty of better players in his time when it came to attractiveness and skill, but Rajko Miti\u0107 was unique because of his extraordinary people skills and sportsmanship.\nOn 29 November 1958, he officially retired from football at the age of 36, after Red Star\u2019s convincing Cup win of 4\u20130 against Vele\u017e.\n\n\n=== International career ===\nFor Yugoslavia, Miti\u0107 won 59 caps (in which he was captain 34 times), and scored 32 goals. He scored his first goal for the national team in his debut on 9 May 1946 in Prague, when Yugoslavia outplayed Czechoslovakia 2\u20130. In his national team career, he scored three hat-tricks. The first against Denmark in 1950 (the final score being 5\u20131), the second against India in 1952 (10\u20131), and finally in Belgrade against Wales (5\u20132) in 1953.\nHe often said that he never missed a chance to remind himself of his favourite goal in the national team uniform, against England in Belgrade, in 1954. Yugoslavia won 1\u20130 as Miti\u0107 scored the decisive goal in the dying minutes of the match.\nHe took part in two Olympic tournaments: London 1948 and Helsinki 1952 where he captained the Yugoslavia squad that included many notable players of that era. He earned the silver medal both times. There were two dramatic matches against the Soviet Union (in the second of which Miti\u0107 scored the first goal, and paved the way for an important 3\u20131 win). He also took part in two World Cups (Brazil 1950 and Switzerland 1954), but none of these were pleasant. Before the match against Brazil at the Maracan\u00e3 in Rio, while he was entering the pitch from the tunnel, he lifted his head suddenly and hit a medal lid. Due to the large cut and bleeding, he was forced to ask for medical attention and couldn't play the first 20 minutes of the match, so he didn't see Ademir's goal in the 3rd minute and wasn't aware of Brazil's lead until he was informed of it by his teammates during halftime. Since, in those days, there were no substitutions, the team was handicapped and finally lost the match 2\u20130.\nHe celebrated his 50th match with the national team during the 1954 World Cup against West Germany (who went on to become World Champion), but lost 2\u20130. He played his last match for the national team on 29 November 1957, in Bucharest against Romania, as a 35-year-old striker. The final score of the match was 1\u20131.\n\n\n== Post-playing career, death and legacy ==\n\nHe was part of the coaching staff at Red Star from 1960 until 1966 when he became a member of the national team selection committee which consisted of Miti\u0107 and Aleksandar Tirnani\u0107, Miljan Miljani\u0107, Vujadin Bo\u0161kov and Branko Stankovi\u0107. In 1967, he was promoted to head coach of the national team and he remained in that role until 1970. His biggest achievement as a coach was at the 1968 UEFA European Football Championship held in Italy, when the national team (led by Dragan D\u017eaji\u0107) won the silver medal.\nWhen he retired in 1983, he applied himself actively as a volunteer in Red Star. He was a member of the team's leadership for a long time (including two mandates as vice president of the club).\nEven as an active player in the early fifties, he was a sportswriter for the daily newspaper Sport. Later on, for a long series of years until his retirement, he wrote for the weekly sports magazine Tempo.\nIn a 2006 interview with Prvoslav Vuj\u010di\u0107, fellow Red Star legend Dragoslav \u0160ekularac was critical of Red Star's forgetting of Miti\u0107 in his later years.Mitic died on 29 March 2008, aged 85. He was interred in a family plot in the Belgrade New Cemetery on 2 April 2008.Until his death, he was active in the Council of Veterans together with the stars from his and later generations. Miti\u0107 is considered one of the most important players in the history of Red Star as he is the first out of only five players to have been awarded the Zvezdina zvezda. In December 2014, Red Star Stadium, the principal stadium in Belgrade, was officially renamed after him.\n\n\n== Career statistics ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nRajko Miti\u0107 Stadium\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nReprezentacija.rs profile (in Serbian)",

JHM) is a museum located to the southeast of Kalemegdan, Stari Grad, Belgrade. Founded in 1948, it is the only Jewish museum in Serbia. The museum is situated in a building constructed in 1928 for the Sefardic community. The museum\u2019s collection is comprehensive and also complex in its content, with exhibits arranged thematically.\nIt focuses on Belgradian Jews from the 2nd century until World War II, encompassing the lives of Jews who lived in Serbia and Yugoslavia. There is a predominance of memorial displays  as well as a large collection of documents and photographs which attest to the Holocaust in which many Jewish families were totally decimated.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe museum is located in a building designed by Samuel Sumbul in 1928 for the Jewish Sephardic community; an inscription near the top of the building states: \"The Home of the Jewish Religious-School Community\". The Jewish Historical Museum was founded in 1948. The Federation of Jewish Communities had the intention to establish a museum to cover some 2,000 years of history from the earliest history of Belgrade.In 2005, the museum donated a thematic collection to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum International Archives Project Division. It contained documents regarding \"arrests and persecutions of, and reprisals against, Jews, members of antifascist movements, communists, and the general population\" as well as documents regarding concentration camps in the former Yugoslavia.Unlike the Jewish museum in Sarajevo, which is administered by the city, the Belgrade museum falls under the auspices of the Federation of Jewish Communities. Milica Mihajlovi\u0107, daughter of General Herbert Kraus, Minister of Health, served as curator (1964\u201390) and director (1990\u201306) before retiring in 2007. The current director is Vojislava Radovanovi\u0107.\n\n\n== Features ==\nA rich collection of items, documents and photographs on the history of the Jews in Yugoslavia is in the possession of the museum.  There are 1,000 ethnological items including books and historical and Holocaust collections, as well as paintings and drawings. The museum has documents related to the Zemun Jews. The archives in the museum also contain several of the annotated documents related to the sufferings of the Jews of Yugoslavia written  by Jasa Almuli, former president of the Belgrade Jewish Community. The museum's embroidery and costume collection was displayed in 1978 in London at the International Centenary Conference of the Folklore Society. In September 2013, a new exhibition opened called \"Synagogical Ritual Items\", containing deported items which were never displayed previously. In addition to the museum, the building houses a children\u2019s theater, the Jewish Community Belgrade (second floor), and the Federation of Jewish Communities of Serbia (third floor).\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe Jewish Historical Museum has published numerous books including \"Studije i gradja o Jevrejima Dubrovnika\" which contains studies and documents related to Jews who lived in Dubrovnik. Since the 1960s, the museum has published a historical magazine, Zbornik.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of the Jews in Serbia\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBibliographyAlbahari, David (28 April 2011).

The museum opened in 1932 and by 1937 had amassed a collection of 630 objects. The original collection was confiscated, and many of the objects were destroyed during World War II. Only a few of the original items made their way back to the collection. The JHM reopened in 1955 and began its collection anew, emphasizing the history and culture of Dutch Jews.The museum initially occupied only the top floor of the historical Waag (Weigh House) but grew to encompass the entire building. In 1987 the collection moved to a complex of restored synagogues located in Amsterdam\u2019s former Jewish quarter. The oldest building in this complex is the Great Synagogue (Grote Synagoge), established by the city\u2019s Ashkenazi Jews and consecrated in 1671, or, by the Jewish calendar, 5431. Jewish tradition and religion, as well as the early history of Jews in the Netherlands, are the featured subjects of the displays in this part of the museum. Soon after the Great Synagogue was completed, it became clear that a larger gallery space was necessary, and construction of the Obbene (\u201cUpper\u201d) Shul was completed in 1686. It now contains a children\u2019s museum. The Dritt (\u201cThird\u201d) Shul (dedicated 1778) replaced two houses that had served as additional synagogue space since about 1700. Since its renovation as part of the JHM, this building holds museum offices and is not open to the public. The continued growth of the Jewish community prompted the building of a fourth structure, the New Synagogue (Nieuwe Synagoge), dedicated in 1752. The first floor houses the museum\u2019s temporary exhibits, while the second contains a permanent exhibit on Jews in the 20th century.Today the museum contains more than 30,000 objects, documents, and photos and more than 11,000 ceremonial artifacts and artworks. Highlights of the collection include more than 1,300 gouaches from the painting series Life? or Theatre? by the German Jewish artist Charlotte Salomon (1917\u201343). The museum also displays a number of items, such as diaries, letters, portraits, and personal belongings, that document the personal, individualized experience of the Dutch Jews.

        "wiki": "Belgrade, Serbia has an abundance of religious architecture. The city has numerous Serbian Orthodox churches and temples and it is also the seat of the Patriarch of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Its two most prominent Orthodox Christian places of worship are the Saborna Crkva (the Cathedral Church) and the Temple of St. Sava, the largest Eastern Orthodox church in the world.\nOther notable Belgrade churches include St. Mark's Church, in which rests the body of the first Serbian Emperor, Stefan Du\u0161an. The architecture of this church was greatly inspired by the Gra\u010danica monastery in the province of Kosovo. The church of Sveta Ru\u017eica in the Kalemegdan Fortress is one of the holiest places in Belgrade for Serbian Orthodox Christians since this was the site where the body of St. Paraskeva was preserved for several years after the Ottoman conquest, before being taken to Romania where it still rests today. St. Paraskeva (Sv. Petka) is one of the most important saints to the Eastern Orthodox Christians.\nBelgrade is the seat of a Catholic archdiocese, with a small Catholic community and several Catholic churches. One of these, St Anthony's, was designed by the noted Slovenian architect Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik.\nThere is also a Muslim community in Belgrade and only one mosque, the Bajrakli Mosque built in 1526 by the Ottoman Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent.  It is one of the oldest surviving structures in contemporary Belgrade.\nThe Jewish community is served by the Belgrade Synagogue, which is the only currently active Jewish place of worship in the entire country, although not the only such structure within the city limits.\nBelgrade also had an active Buddhist temple in the first half of the 20th century.  It was built by East Russian expatriates fleeing the outcome of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.\n\n\n== Orthodox ==\n\nChurch of St. Alexander Nevsky, Dor\u0107ol\nChurch of St. Basil of Ostrog, Be\u017eanija\nChurch of St. Nicholas, Zvezdara\nChurch of St. George, Banovo Brdo\nChurch of St. George, Oplenac\nChurch of St. Jovan Vladimir, Vo\u017edovac\nChurch of St. Tryphon, \u010cukarica\nChurch of Saint Sava, Vra\u010dar\nChurch of the Convocation of Serbian Saints, Palilula\nChurch of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, Top\u010dider\nChurch of the Holy Father Nikolaj, Zemun, built in 1725\u20131731\nChurch of the Holy Trinity, Vo\u017edovac\nChurch of the Holy Trinity, Vra\u010dar\nChurch of the Holy Trinity, Zemun\nRussian Church of the Holy Trinity\nChurch of the Holy Emperor Lazar\nChurch of the Nativity of the Most Holy Mother of God, Zemun, built in 1780\nChurch of the Nativity of the Most Holy Mother of God, Zvezdara\nChurch of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist, Vo\u017edovac\nRu\u017eica Church, Kalemegdan\nSt. Michael's Cathedral\nSt. Mark's Church\nMonastery of St. Archangel Gabriel, Zemun, its church was built in 1786, on a site of older church\nCrkva Svetog Dimitrija (Zemun)\nCrkva Svetog djakona Avakuma i igumana Pajsija (Zemun)\nRajinovac monastery\nNew Cemetery Church\n\n\n== Roman Catholic ==\nCo-cathedral of Christ the King in Belgrade, built in 1927\nChurch of St. Anthony of Padua, Belgrade\nCrkva uznesenja bla\u017eene djevice Marije (Zemun), built in 1795, Roman Catholic, built on a site of previous mosque\nCrkva svetog Roka (Zemun), built in 1836, Roman Catholic\nSamostan Svetog Ivana Krstitelja i Antuna (Zemun), built in 1750-1752, Franciscan/Roman Catholic\n\n\n== Islamic ==\nBajrakli Mosque, Belgrade\n\n\n== Protestant ==\nEvangelical Church, Zemun, built in 1920s, Evangelical\n\n\n== Synagogues ==\nThe Sukkat Shalom Belgrade Synagogue\nZemun Synagogue, built in early 20th century, sold to a restaurant owner during Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's rule, but the Jewish Municipality of Zemun is trying to recuperate the building.\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchitecture of Serbia\n\n\n== References ==",

        "wiki": "Belgrade ( BEL-grayd; Serbian: Beograd / \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, lit. 'White City', pronounced [be\u01d2\u0261rad] (listen); names in other languages) is the capital and largest city of Serbia. It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula. Nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade, a quarter of the total population of Serbia.One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vin\u010da culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and, after 279 BC, Celts settled the city, naming it Singid\u016bn. It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284. Belgrade served as capital of the Serbian Despotate during the reign of Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, and then his successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the Ottoman Empire during the siege in 1456 have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Austro-Ottoman wars. \nIn the period after the Serbian Revolution, Belgrade was again named the capital of Serbia in 1841. Northern Belgrade remained the southernmost Habsburg post until 1918, when it was attached to the city, due to former Austro-Hungarian territories becoming the part of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes after World War I. Belgrade was the capital of Yugoslavia from its creation in 1918 to its dissolution in 2006. In a fatally strategic position, the city has been battled over in 115 wars and razed 44 times, being bombed five times and besieged many times.Being Serbia's primate city, Belgrade has special administrative status within Serbia. It is the seat of the central government, administrative bodies, and government ministries, as well as home of almost all of the largest Serbian companies, media, and scientific institutions. Belgrade is classified as a Beta-Global City. The city is home to the Clinical Centre of Serbia, one of the hospital complexes with the largest capacity in the world, and the Church of Saint Sava, one of the largest Orthodox church buildings. Belgrade hosted major international events such as the first Non-Aligned Movement Summit (1961), the first major gathering of the OSCE (1977\u20131978), Eurovision Song Contest (2008), as well as sports events such as the first FINA World Aquatics Championships (1973), UEFA Euro (1976), Summer Universiade (2009) and EuroBasket three-times.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n\nChipped stone tools found in Zemun show that the area around Belgrade was inhabited by nomadic foragers in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic eras. Some of these tools are of Mousterian industry\u2014belonging to Neanderthals rather than modern humans. Aurignacian and Gravettian tools have also been discovered near the area, indicating some settlement between 50,000 and 20,000 years ago.The first farming people to settle in the region are associated with the Neolithic Star\u010devo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Star\u010devo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Star\u010devo. The Star\u010devo culture was succeeded by the Vin\u010da culture (5500\u20134500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that grew out of the earlier Star\u010devo settlements and also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo). The Vin\u010da culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe. Also associated with the Vin\u010da culture are anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vin\u010da, the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe, and a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans known as the Old European script, which dates back to around 5300 BC. Within the city proper, on Cetinjska Street, a skull of a Paleolithic human was discovered in 1890. The skull is dated to before 5000 BC.\n\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\nEvidence of early knowledge about Belgrade's geographical location comes from a variety of ancient myths and legends. The ridge overlooking the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers, for example, has been identified as one of the places in the story of Jason and the Argonauts. In the time of antiquity, too, the area was populated by Paleo-Balkan tribes, including the Thracians and the Dacians, who ruled much of Belgrade's surroundings. Specifically, Belgrade was at one point inhabited by the Thraco-Dacian tribe Singi; following Celtic invasion in 279 BC, the Scordisci wrested the city from their hands, naming it Singid\u016bn (d|\u016bn, fortress). In 34\u201333 BC, the Roman army, led by Silanus, reached Belgrade. It became the romanised Singidunum in the 1st century AD and, by the mid-2nd century, the city was proclaimed a municipium by the Roman authorities, evolving into a full-fledged colonia (the highest city class) by the end of the century. While the first Christian Emperor of Rome \u2014Constantine I, also known as Constantine the Great\u2014was born in the territory of Naissus to the city's south, Roman Christianity's champion, Flavius Iovianus (Jovian), was born in Singidunum. Jovian reestablished Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire, ending the brief revival of traditional Roman religions under his predecessor Julian the Apostate. In 395 AD, the site passed to the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Across the Sava from Singidunum was the Celtic city of Taurunum (Zemun); the two were connected with a bridge throughout Roman and Byzantine times.\n\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n\nIn 442, the area was ravaged by Attila the Hun. In 471, it was taken by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, who continued into Italy. As the Ostrogoths left, another Germanic tribe, the Gepids, invaded the city. In 539 it was retaken by the Byzantines. In 577, some 100,000 Slavs poured into Thrace and Illyricum, pillaging cities and more permanently settling the region. The Avars, under Bayan I, conquered the whole region and its new Slavic population by 582. Following Byzantine reconquest, the Byzantine chronicle De Administrando Imperio mentions the White Serbs, who had stopped in Belgrade on their way back home, asking the strategos for lands; they received provinces in the west, towards the Adriatic, which they would rule as subjects to Heraclius (610\u2013641). In 829, Khan Omurtag was able to add Singidunum and its environs to the First Bulgarian Empire.The first record of the name Belograd appeared on April, 16th, 878, in a Papal missive to Bulgarian ruler Boris I. This name would appear in several variants: Alba Bulgarica in Latin, Griechisch Weissenburg in High German, N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, and Castelbianco in Venetian, among other names, all variations of 'white fortress'. For about four centuries, the city would become a battleground between the Byzantine Empire, the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, and the Bulgarian Empire. Basil II (976\u20131025) installed a garrison in Belgrade. The city hosted the armies of the First and the Second Crusade, but, while passing through during the Third Crusade, Frederick Barbarossa and his 190,000 crusaders saw Belgrade in ruins.\nKing Stefan Dragutin (r. 1276\u20131282) received Belgrade from his father-in-law, Stephen V of Hungary, in 1284, and it served as the capital of the Kingdom of Syrmia, a vassal state to the Kingdom of Hungary. Dragutin (Hungarian: Dragutin Istv\u00e1n) is regarded as the first Serbian king to rule over Belgrade.Following the battles of Maritsa (1371) and Kosovo field (1389), Moravian Serbia, to Belgrade's south, began to fall to the Ottoman Empire.\n\nThe northern sections of what is now Serbia persisted as the Serbian Despotate, with Belgrade as its capital. The city flourished under Stefan Lazarevi\u0107, the son of Serbian prince Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107. Lazarevi\u0107 built a castle with a citadel and towers, of which only the Despot's tower and the west wall remain. He also refortified the city's ancient walls, allowing the Despotate to resist Ottoman conquest for almost 70 years. During this time, Belgrade was a haven for many Balkan peoples fleeing Ottoman rule, and is thought to have had a population ranging between 40,000 and 50,000 people.In 1427, Stefan's successor \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107, returning Belgrade to the Hungarian king, made Smederevo his new capital. Even though the Ottomans had captured most of the Serbian Despotate, Belgrade, known as N\u00e1ndorfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungarian, was unsuccessfully besieged in 1440 and 1456. As the city presented an obstacle to the Ottoman advance into Hungary and further, over 100,000 Ottoman soldiers besieged it in 1456, in which the Christian army led by the Hungarian General John Hunyadi successfully defended it. The noon bell ordered by Pope Callixtus III commemorates the victory throughout the Christian world to this day.\n\n\n=== Ottoman rule and Austrian invasions ===\n\nSeven decades after the initial siege, on 28 August 1521, the fort was finally captured by Suleiman the Magnificent, 250,000 Turkish soldiers, and over 100 ships. Subsequently, most of the city was razed to the ground and its entire Orthodox Christian population was deported to Istanbul to an area that has since become known as the Belgrade forest. Belgrade was made the seat of the Pashalik of Belgrade (also known as the Sanjak of Smederevo), and quickly became the second largest Ottoman town in Europe at over 100,000 people, surpassed only by Constantinople. Ottoman rule introduced Ottoman architecture, including numerous mosques, and the city was resurrected\u2014now by Oriental influences. In 1594, a major Serb rebellion was crushed by the Ottomans. Later, Grand Vizier Sinan Pasha ordered the relics of Saint Sava to be publicly torched on the Vra\u010dar plateau; in the 20th century, the church of Saint Sava was built to commemorate this event.Occupied by the Habsburgs three times (1688\u20131690, 1717\u20131739, 1789\u20131791), headed by the Holy Roman Princes Maximilian of Bavaria and Eugene of Savoy, and field marshal Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon, respectively, Belgrade was quickly recaptured by the Ottomans and substantially razed each time. During this period, the city was affected by the two Great Serbian Migrations, in which hundreds of thousands of Serbs, led by two Serbian Patriarchs, retreated together with the Austrian soldiers into the Habsburg Empire, settling in today's Vojvodina and Slavonia.\n\n\n=== Principality of Serbia ===\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, Belgrade was predominantly inhabited by a Muslim population. Traces of Ottoman rule and architecture\u2014such as mosques and bazaars, were to remain a prominent part of Belgrade's townscape into the 19th century; several decades, even, after Serbia was granted autonomy from the Ottoman Empire.During the First Serbian Uprising, Serbian revolutionaries held the city from 8 January 1807 until 1813, when it was retaken by the Ottomans. After the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, Serbia achieved some sort of sovereignty, which was formally recognised by the Porte in 1830.The development of Belgrade architecture after 1815 can be divided into four periods. In the first phase, which lasted from 1815 to 1835, the dominant architectural style was still of a Balkan character, with substantial Ottoman influence. At the same time, an interest in joining the European mainstream allowed Central and Western European architecture to flourish. Between 1835 and 1850, the amount of neoclassicist and baroque buildings south of the Austrian border rose considerably, exemplified by St Michael's Cathedral (Serbian: Saborna crkva), completed in 1840. Between 1850 and 1875, new architecture was characterised by a turn towards the newly-popular Romanticism, along with older European architectural styles. Typical of Central European cities in the last quarter of the 19th century, the fourth phase was characterised by an eclecticist style based on the Renaissance and Baroque periods.\n\nIn 1841, Prince Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 moved the capital of the Principality of Serbia from Kragujevac to Belgrade. During his first reign (1815\u20131839), Prince Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107 pursued expansion of the city's population through the addition of new settlements, aiming and succeeding to make Belgrade the centre of the Principality's administrative, military and cultural institutions. His project of creating a new market space (the Abad\u017eijska \u010dar\u0161ija), however, was less successful; trade continued to be conducted in the centuries-old Donja \u010dar\u0161ija and Gornja \u010dar\u0161ija. Still, new construction projects were typical for the Christian quarters as the older Muslim quarters declined; from Serbia's autonomy until 1863, the number of Belgrade quarters even decreased, mainly as a consequence of the gradual disappearance of the city's Muslim population. An Ottoman city map from 1863 counts only 9 Muslim quarters (mahalas). The names of only five such neighbourhoods are known today: Ali-pa\u0161ina, Reis-efendijina, Jahja-pa\u0161ina, Bajram-begova and Laz Had\u017ei-Mahmudova. Following the \u010cukur Fountain incident, Belgrade was bombed by the Ottomans.On 18 April 1867, the Ottoman government ordered the Ottoman garrison, which had been since 1826 the last representation of Ottoman suzerainty in Serbia, withdrawn from Kalemegdan. The forlorn Porte's only stipulation was that the Ottoman flag continue to fly over the fortress alongside the Serbian one. Serbia's de facto independence dates from this event. In the following years, urban planner Emilijan Josimovi\u0107 had a significant impact on Belgrade. He conceptualised a regulation plan for the city in 1867, in which he proposed the replacement of the town's crooked streets with a grid plan. Of great importance also was the construction of independent Serbian political and cultural institutions, as well as the city's now-plentiful parks. Pointing to Josimovi\u0107's work, Serbian scholars have noted an important break with Ottoman traditions. However, Istanbul\u2014the capital city of the state to which Belgrade and Serbia de jure still belonged\u2014underwent similar changes.In May 1868, knez Mihailo was assassinated with his cousin Anka Konstantinovi\u0107 while riding in a carriage in his country residence.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Serbia ===\n\nWith the Principality's full independence in 1878 and its transformation into the Kingdom of Serbia in 1882, Belgrade once again became a key city in the Balkans, and developed rapidly. Nevertheless, conditions in Serbia remained those of an overwhelmingly agrarian country, even with the opening of a railway to Ni\u0161, Serbia's second city. In 1900, the capital had only 70,000 inhabitants (at the time Serbia numbered 2.5 million). Still, by 1905, the population had grown to more than 80,000 and, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, it had surpassed the 100,000 citizens, disregarding Zemun, which still belonged to Austria-Hungary.The first-ever projection of motion pictures in the Balkans and Central Europe was held in Belgrade in June 1896 by Andr\u00e9 Carr, a representative of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers. He shot the first motion pictures of Belgrade in the next year; however, they have not been preserved. The first permanent cinema was opened in 1909 in Belgrade.\n\n\n=== World War I ===\nThe First World War began on 28 July 1914 when Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. Most of the subsequent Balkan offensives occurred near Belgrade. Austro-Hungarian monitors shelled Belgrade on 29 July 1914, and it was taken by the Austro-Hungarian Army under General Oskar Potiorek on 30 November. On 15 December, it was re-taken by Serbian troops under Marshal Radomir Putnik. After a prolonged battle which destroyed much of the city, starting on 6 October 1915, Belgrade fell to German and Austro-Hungarian troops commanded by Field Marshal August von Mackensen on 9 October of the same year. The city was liberated by Serbian and French troops on 1 November 1918, under the command of Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey of France and Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Belgrade, decimated as a front-line city, lost the title of largest city in the Kingdom to Subotica for some time.\n\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n\nAfter the war, Belgrade became the capital of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom was split into banovinas and Belgrade, together with Zemun and Pan\u010devo, formed a separate administrative unit.During this period, the city experienced fast growth and significant modernisation. Belgrade's population grew to 239,000 by 1931 (with the inclusion of Zemun), and to 320,000 by 1940. The population growth rate between 1921 and 1948 averaged 4.08% a year.In 1927, Belgrade's first airport opened, and in 1929, its first radio station began broadcasting. The Pan\u010devo Bridge, which crosses the Danube, was opened in 1935, while King Alexander Bridge over the Sava was opened in 1934. On 3 September 1939 the first Belgrade Grand Prix, the last Grand Prix motor racing race before the outbreak of World War II, was held around the Belgrade Fortress and was followed by 80,000 spectators. The winner was Tazio Nuvolari.\n\n\n=== World War II ===\nOn 25 March 1941, the government of regent Crown Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact, joining the Axis powers in an effort to stay out of the Second World War and keep Yugoslavia neutral during the conflict. This was immediately followed by mass protests in Belgrade and a military coup d'\u00e9tat led by Air Force commander General Du\u0161an Simovi\u0107, who proclaimed King Peter II to be of age to rule the realm. As a result, the city was heavily bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941, killing up to 2,274 people. Yugoslavia was then invaded by German, Italian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian forces. Belgrade was captured by subterfuge, with six German soldiers led by their officer Fritz Klingenberg feigning threatening size, forcing the city to capitulate. Belgrade was more directly occupied by the German Army in the same month and became the seat of the puppet Nedi\u0107 regime, headed by its namesake general. Some of today's parts of Belgrade were incorporated in the Independent State of Croatia in occupied Yugoslavia, another puppet state, where Ustashe regime  carried out the Genocide of Serbs.During the summer and fall of 1941, in reprisal for guerrilla attacks, the Germans carried out several massacres of Belgrade citizens; in particular, members of the Jewish community were subject to mass shootings at the order of General Franz B\u00f6hme, the German Military Governor of Serbia. B\u00f6hme rigorously enforced the rule that for every German killed, 100 Serbs or Jews would be shot. Belgrade became the first city in Europe to be declared by the Nazi occupation forces to be Judenfrei. The resistance movement in Belgrade was led by Major \u017darko Todorovi\u0107 from 1941 until his arrest in 1943.Just like Rotterdam, which was devastated twice by both German and Allied bombing, Belgrade was bombed once more during World War II, this time by the Allies on 16 April 1944, killing at least 1,100 people. This bombing fell on the Orthodox Christian Easter. Most of the city remained under German occupation until 20 October 1944, when it was liberated by the Red Army and the Communist Yugoslav Partisans. On 29 November 1945, Marshal Josip Broz Tito proclaimed the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in Belgrade (later to be renamed to Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on 7 April 1963). Higher estimates from the former secret police place the victim count of political persecutions in Belgrade at 10,000.\n\n\n=== Socialist Yugoslavia ===\nWhen the war ended, the city was left with 11,500 demolished housing units. During the post-war period, Belgrade grew rapidly as the capital of the renewed Yugoslavia, developing as a major industrial centre. In 1948, construction of New Belgrade started. In 1958, Belgrade's first television station began broadcasting. In 1961, the conference of Non-Aligned Countries was held in Belgrade under Tito's chairmanship. In 1962, Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport was built. In 1968, major student protests led to several street clashes between students and the police.In 1972, Belgrade faced smallpox outbreak, the last major outbreak of smallpox in Europe since World War II. Between October 1977 and March 1978, the city hosted the first major gathering of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe with the aim of implementing the Helsinki Accords from, while in 1980 Belgrade hosted the UNESCO General Conference. Josip Broz Tito died in May 1980 and his funeral in Belgrade was attended by high officials and state delegations from 128 of the 154 members of the United Nations from both sides of the Iron Curtain, based on which it became one of the largest funerals in history.\n\n\n=== Breakup of Yugoslavia ===\n\nOn 9 March 1991, massive demonstrations led by Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 were held in the city against Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. According to various media outlets, there were between 100,000 and 150,000 people on the streets. Two people were killed, 203 injured and 108 arrested during the protests, and later that day tanks were deployed onto the streets to restore order. Many anti-war protests were held in Belgrade, while the most massive protests was dedicated to solidarity with the victims from the besieged Sarajevo. Further anti-government protests were held in Belgrade from November 1996 to February 1997 against the same government after alleged electoral fraud in local elections. These protests brought Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 to power, the first mayor of Belgrade since World War II who did not belong to the League of Communists of Yugoslavia or its later offshoot, the Socialist Party of Serbia.In 1999, during the Kosovo War, NATO bombings caused damage to the city. Among the sites bombed were various ministry buildings, the RTS building, hospitals, Hotel Jugoslavija, the Central Committee building, Avala Tower, and the Chinese embassy. After the Yugoslav Wars, Serbia became home to highest number of refugees and internally displaced persons in Europe, while more than third settled in Belgrade.After the 2000 presidential elections, Belgrade was the site of major public protests, with over half a million people on the streets. These demonstrations resulted in the ousting of president Milo\u0161evi\u0107 as a part of the Otpor! movement.\n\n\n=== Modern Belgrade ===\n\nIn 2014, Belgrade Waterfront, an urban renewal project, was initiated by the Government of Serbia and its Emirati partner, Eagle Hills Properties. Aimed at improving Belgrade's cityscape and economy, the project hopes to revitalise the Sava amphitheatre, a neglected expanse on the right bank of the Sava river between the Belgrade Fair and the former Belgrade Main railway station. Around \u20ac3.5 billion will be jointly invested by the Serbian government and their Emirati partners. The project includes office and luxury apartment buildings, five-star hotels, a shopping mall and the envisioned 'Belgrade Tower'. The project is, however, quite controversial\u2014there are a number of uncertainties regarding its funding, necessity, and its architecture's arguable lack of harmony with the rest of the city.\nApart from Belgrade Waterfront, the city is under rapid development and reconstruction, especially in the area of Novi Beograd, where many apartment and office buildings are under construction to support the burgeoning IT sector, now one of Serbia's largest economic players.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Topography ===\n\nBelgrade lies 116.75 metres (383.0 ft) above sea level and is located at the confluence of the Danube and Sava rivers. The historical core of Belgrade, Kalemegdan, lies on the right banks of both rivers. Since the 19th century, the city has been expanding to the south and east; after World War II, New Belgrade was built on the left bank of the Sava river, connecting Belgrade with Zemun. Smaller, chiefly residential communities across the Danube, like Krnja\u010da, Kote\u017e and Bor\u010da, also merged with the city, while Pan\u010devo, a heavily industrialised satellite city, remains a separate town. The city has an urban area of 360 square kilometres (140 sq mi), while together with its metropolitan area it covers 3,223 km2 (1,244 sq mi).\nOn the right bank of the Sava, central Belgrade has a hilly terrain, while the highest point of Belgrade proper is Torlak hill at 303 m (994 ft). The mountains of Avala (511 m (1,677 ft)) and Kosmaj (628 m (2,060 ft)) lie south of the city. Across the Sava and Danube, the land is mostly flat, consisting of alluvial plains and loessial plateaus.One of the characteristics of the city terrain is mass wasting. On the territory covered by the General Urban Plan there are 1,155 recorded mass wasting points, out of which 602 are active and 248 are labeled as the 'high risk'. They cover almost 30% of the city territory and include several types of mass wasting. Downhill creeps are located on the slopes above the rivers, mostly on the clay or loam soils, inclined between 7 and 20%. Most critical ones are in Karaburma, Zvezdara, Vi\u0161njica, Vin\u010da and Ritopek, in the Danube valley, and Umka, and especially its neighbourhood of Duboko, in the Sava valley. They have moving and dormant phases, and some of them have been recorded for centuries. Less active downhill creep areas include the entire Terazije slope above the Sava (Kalemegdan, Savamala), which can be seen by the inclination of the Pobednik monument and the tower of the Cathedral Church, and the Vo\u017edovac section, between Banjica and Autokomanda.\n\nLandslides encompass smaller areas, develop on the steep cliffs, sometimes being inclined up to 90%. They are mostly located in the artificial loess hills of Zemun: Gardo\u0161, \u0106ukovac and Kalvarija. \n\nHowever, the majority of the land movement in Belgrade, some 90%, is triggered by the construction works and faulty water supply system (burst pipes, etc.). The neighbourhood of Mirijevo is considered to be the most successful project of fixing the problem. During the construction of the neighbourhood from the 1970s, the terrain was systematically improved and the movement of the land is today completely halted.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nBelgrade has a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), according to K\u00f6ppen climate classification, with four seasons and uniformly spread precipitation. Monthly averages range from 1.4 \u00b0C (34.5 \u00b0F) in January to 23.0 \u00b0C (73.4 \u00b0F) in July, with an annual mean of 12.5 \u00b0C (54.5 \u00b0F). There are, on average, 31 days a year when the temperature is above 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F), and 95 days when the temperature is above 25 \u00b0C (77 \u00b0F). Belgrade receives about 691 millimetres (27 in) of precipitation a year, with late spring being wettest. The average annual number of sunny hours is 2,112.\nThe highest officially recorded temperature in Belgrade was 43.6 \u00b0C (110.5 \u00b0F) on 24 July 2007, while on the other end, the lowest temperature was \u221226.2 \u00b0C (\u221215 \u00b0F) on 10 January 1893.\n\n\n== Administration ==\n\nBelgrade is a separate territorial unit in Serbia, with its own autonomous city authority. The Assembly of the City of Belgrade has 110 members, elected on four-year terms. A 13-member City Council, elected by the Assembly and presided over by the mayor and his deputy, has the control and supervision of the city administration, which manages day-to-day administrative affairs. It is divided into 14 Secretariats, each having a specific portfolio such as traffic or health care, and several professional services, agencies and institutes.The 2014 Belgrade City Assembly election was won by the Serbian Progressive Party, which formed a ruling coalition with the Socialist Party of Serbia. This election ended the long-time rule of the Democratic Party, which was in power from 2004 to 2013.As the capital city, Belgrade is seat of all Serbian state authorities \u2013 executive, legislative, judiciary, and the headquarters of almost all national political parties as well as 75 diplomatic missions. This includes the National Assembly, the Presidency, the Government of Serbia and all the ministries, Supreme Court of Cassation and the Constitutional Court.\n\n\n=== Municipalities ===\n\nThe city is divided into 17 municipalities. Previously, they were classified into 10 urban (lying completely or partially within borders of the city proper) and 7 suburban municipalities, whose centres are smaller towns. With the new 2010 City statute, they were all given equal status, with the proviso that suburban ones (except Sur\u010din) have certain autonomous powers, chiefly related with construction, infrastructure and public utilities.Most of the municipalities are situated on the southern side of the Danube and Sava rivers, in the \u0160umadija region. Three municipalities (Zemun, Novi Beograd, and Sur\u010din), are on the northern bank of the Sava in the Syrmia region and the municipality of Palilula, spanning the Danube, is in both the \u0160umadija and Banat regions.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\n\nAccording to the 2011 census, the city has a population of 1,166,763, while the urban area of Belgrade (with adjacent urban settlements of Bor\u010da, Ov\u010da, and Sur\u010din included) has 1,233,796 inhabitants, and the population of the metropolitan area (the administrative area of the City of Belgrade) stands at 1,659,440 people.\nBelgrade is home to many ethnicities from across the former Yugoslavia and the wider Balkans region. The main ethnic groups are: Serbs (1,505,448), Roma (27,325), Montenegrins (9,902), Yugoslavs (8,061), Croats (7,752), Macedonians (6,970), and Muslims by nationality (3,996). Many people came to the city as economic migrants from smaller towns and the countryside, while tens of thousands arrived as refugees from Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo, as a result of the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s.Between 10,000 and 20,000 Chinese people are estimated to live in Belgrade and, since their arrival in the mid-1990s, Block 70 in New Belgrade has been known colloquially as the Chinese quarter. Many Middle Easterners, mainly from Syria, Iran, Jordan and Iraq, arrived in order to pursue their studies during the 1970s and 1980s, and have remained in the city. Throughout the 19th and early 20th century, small communities of Aromanians, Czechs, Greeks, Germans, Hungarians, Jews, Turks, Armenians and Russian White \u00e9migr\u00e9s also existed in Belgrade. There are two suburban settlements with significant minority population today: Ov\u010da and the village of Boljevci, both with about one quarter of their population being Romanians and Slovaks, respectively.\n\n Although there are several historic religious communities in Belgrade, the religious makeup of the city is relatively homogeneous. The Serbian Orthodox community is by far the largest, with 1,475,168 adherents. There are also 31,914 Muslims, 13,720 Roman Catholics, and 3,128 Protestants.\nThere once was a significant Jewish community in Belgrade but, following the World War II Nazi occupation of the city and subsequent Jewish emigration, their numbers have fallen from over 10,000 to just 295. Belgrade also used to have one of the largest Buddhist colonies in Europe outside Russia when some 400 mostly Buddhist Kalmyks settled on the outskirts of Belgrade following the Russian Civil War. Most of them moved away after the World War II and their temple, Belgrade pagoda, was abandoned and eventually demolished.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n \nBelgrade is the financial centre of Serbia and Southeast Europe, with a total of 17 million square metres (180 million square feet) of office space. It is also home to the country's Central Bank. Over 700,000 people are employed in 120,286 companies, 60,000 enterprises and 50,000 shops. The City of Belgrade itself owns 267,147 square metres (2,875,550 square feet) of rentable office space.\n\nAs of 2019, Belgrade contained 31.4% of Serbia's employed population and generated over 40.4% of its GDP. The city's nominal GDP in 2014 was estimated at 16.97 billion USD, amounting to 859,329 RSD ($10,086) per capita. City GDP in 2019 at purchasing power parity was estimated at $52.1bn USD, which was $32,572 per capita in terms of purchasing power parity.New Belgrade is the country's Central business district and one of Southeastern Europe's financial centres. It offers a range of facilities, such as hotels, congress halls (e.g. Sava Centar), Class A and B office buildings, and business parks (e.g. Airport City Belgrade). Over  1.2 million square metres (13 million square feet) of land is under construction in New Belgrade, with the value of planned construction over the next three years estimated at over 1.5 billion euros. The Belgrade Stock Exchange is also located in New Belgrade, and has a market capitalisation of \u20ac6.5 billion (US$7.1 billion).\nWith 6,924 companies in the IT sector (according to 2013 data), Belgrade is one of the foremost information technology hubs in Southeast Europe. Microsoft's 'Development Center Serbia', located in Belgrade was, at the time of its establishment, the fifth such programme on the globe. Many global IT companies choose Belgrade as their European or regional centre of operations, such as Asus, Intel, Dell, Huawei, Nutanix, NCR etc. The most famous Belgrade IT startups, among others, are Nordeus, ComTrade Group, MicroE, FishingBooker, and Endava. IT facilities in the city include the Mihajlo Pupin Institute and the ILR, as well as the brand-new IT Park Zvezdara. Many prominent IT innovators began their careers in Belgrade, including Voja Antoni\u0107 and Veselin Jevrosimovi\u0107.\nIn September 2013, the average Belgrade monthly salary stood at 53,564 RSD ($635) in net terms, with the gross equivalent at 73,970 RSD ($877). The 2013 Annual Economist Intelligence Unit Survey ranked Belgrade the 86th most expensive out of 131 world cities. According to the 2015 Survey, 73% of the city's households owned a computer, 65.8% had a broadband internet connection and 73.9% had pay television services.According Cushman & Wakefield, Knez Mihajlova street is 36th most expensive retail street in the world in terms of renting commercial space.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nLong cut off from the international movements, Belgrade is a hub for contemporary art in Europe once again. According to BBC, Belgrade is one of five most creative cities in the world.\nBelgrade hosts many annual international cultural events, including the Film Festival, Theatre Festival, Summer Festival, BEMUS, Belgrade Early Music Festival, Book Fair, Eurovision Song Contest 2008, and the Beer Fest. The Nobel Prize winning author Ivo Andri\u0107 wrote his most famous work, The Bridge on the Drina, in Belgrade. Other prominent Belgrade authors include Branislav Nu\u0161i\u0107, Milo\u0161 Crnjanski, Borislav Peki\u0107, Milorad Pavi\u0107 and Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107. The most internationally prominent artists from Belgrade are Charles Simic, Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Milovan Destil Markovi\u0107.\nMost of Serbia's film industry is based in Belgrade. FEST is an annual film festival that held since 1971, and, through 2013, had been attended by four million people and had presented almost 4,000 films.The city was one of the main centres of the Yugoslav new wave in the 1980s: VIS Idoli, Ekatarina Velika, \u0160arlo Akrobata and Elektri\u010dni Orgazam were all from Belgrade. Other notable Belgrade rock acts include Riblja \u010corba, Bajaga i Instruktori and Partibrejkers. Today, it is the centre of the Serbian hip hop scene, with acts such as Beogradski Sindikat, \u0160kabo, Mar\u010delo, and most of the Bassivity Music stable hailing from or living in the city. There are numerous theatres, the most prominent of which are National Theatre, Theatre on Terazije, Yugoslav Drama Theatre, Zvezdara Theatre, and Atelier 212.

The oldest architecture is found in Kalemegdan Park. Outside of Kalemegdan, the oldest buildings date only from the 18th century, due to its geographic position and frequent wars and destructions.\n\nThe oldest public structure in Belgrade is a nondescript Turkish t\u00fcrbe, while the oldest house is a modest clay house on Dor\u0107ol, from late 18th century. Western influence began in the 19th century, when the city completely transformed from an oriental town to the contemporary architecture of the time, with influences from neoclassicism, romanticism, and academic art. Serbian architects took over the development from the foreign builders in the late 19th century, producing the National Theatre, Old Palace, Cathedral Church and later, in the early 20th century, the National Assembly and National Museum, influenced by art nouveau. Elements of Serbo-Byzantine Revival are present in buildings such as House of Vuk's Foundation, old Post Office in Kosovska street, and sacral architecture, such as St. Mark's Church (based on the Gra\u010danica monastery), and the Temple of Saint Sava.In the socialist period, housing was built quickly and cheaply for the huge influx of people fleeing the countryside following World War II, sometimes resulting in the brutalist architecture of the blokovi ('blocks') of New Belgrade; a socrealism trend briefly ruled, resulting in buildings like the Trade Union Hall. However, in the mid-1950s, modernist trends took over, and still dominate the Belgrade architecture.\nBelgrade has the second oldest sewer system in Europe. The Clinical Centre of Serbia spreads over 34 hectares and consists of about 50 buildings, while also has 3,150 beds considered to be the highest number in Europe, and among highest in the world.\n\n\n=== Tourism ===\n\nLying on the main artery connecting Europe and Asia, as well as, eventually, the Orient Express, Belgrade has been a popular place for travellers through the centuries. \nIn 1843, on Dubrova\u010dka Street (today Kralj Petar Street ), Serbia's knez Mihailo Obrenovi\u0107 built a large edifice which became the first hotel in Belgrade: Kod jelena ('at the deer's'), in the neighbourhood of Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac. Many criticised the move at the time due to the cost and the size of the building, and it soon became the gathering point of the Principality's wealthiest citizens. Colloquially, the building was also referred to as the staro zdanje, or the 'old edifice'. It remained a hotel until 1903 before being demolished in 1938. After the staro zdanje, numerous hotels were built in the second half of the 19th century: Nacional and Grand, also in Kosan\u010di\u0107ev Venac, Srpski Kralj, Srpska Kruna, Gr\u010dka Kraljica near Kalemegdan, Balkan and Pariz in Terazije, London, etc.As Belgrade became connected via steamboats and railway (after 1884), the number of visitors grew and new hotels were open with the ever luxurious commodities. In Savamala, the hotels Bosna and Bristol were opened. Other hotels included Solun and Orient, which was built near the Financial Park. Tourists which arrived by the Orient Express mostly stayed at the Petrograd Hotel in Wilson Square. Hotel Srpski Kralj, at the corner of Uzun Mirkova and Pariska Street was considered the best hotel in Belgrade during the Interbellum. It was destroyed during World War II.The historic areas and buildings of Belgrade are among the city's premier attractions. They include Skadarlija, the National Museum and adjacent National Theatre, Zemun, Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 Square, Terazije, Students' Square, the Kalemegdan Fortress, Knez Mihailova Street, the Parliament, the Church of Saint Sava, and the Old Palace. On top of this, there are many parks, monuments, museums, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and shops on both sides of the river. The hilltop Avala Monument and Avala Tower offer views over the city. According The Guuardian, Dorcol is the one of top ten coolest suburbs and in Europe.Elite neighbourhood of Dedinje is situated near the Top\u010dider and Ko\u0161utnjak parks. The Beli dvor (White Palace), house of royal family Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, is open for visitors. The palace has many valuable artworks. Nearby, Josip Broz Tito's mausoleum, called The House of Flowers, documents the life of the former Yugoslav president.\n\nAda Ciganlija is a former island on the Sava River, and Belgrade's biggest sports and recreational complex. Today it is connected with the right bank of the Sava via two causeways, creating an artificial lake. It is the most popular destination for Belgraders during the city's hot summers. There are 7 kilometres (4 miles) of long beaches and sports facilities for various sports including golf, football, basketball, volleyball, rugby union, baseball, and tennis. During summer there are between 200,000 and 300,000 bathers daily.\n\nExtreme sports are available, such as bungee jumping, water skiing, and paintballing. There are numerous tracks on the island, where it is possible to ride a bike, go for a walk, or go jogging. Apart from Ada, Belgrade has total of 16 islands on the rivers, many still unused. Among them, the Great War Island, at the confluence of Sava, stands out as an oasis of unshattered wildlife (especially birds). These areas, along with nearby Small War Island, are protected by the city's government as a nature preserve. There are 37 protected natural resources in the Belgrade urban area, among which eight are geo-heritage sites, i.e. Stra\u017eevica profile, Ma\u0161in Majdan-Top\u010dider, Profile at the Kalemegdan Fortress, Abandoned quarry in Barajevo, Karaga\u010da valley, Artesian well in Ov\u010da, Kapela loess profile, and Lake in Srem\u010dica. Other 29 places are biodiversity sites.Tourist income in 2016 amounted to nearly one billion euros; with a visit of almost a million registered tourists. Of those, in 2019 more than 100,000 tourists arrived by 742 river cruisers. Average annual growth is between 13% and 14%.As of 2018, there are three officially designated camp grounds in Belgrade. The oldest one is located in Batajnica, along the Batajnica Road. Named \"Dunav\", it is one of the most visited campsites in the country. Second one is situated within the complex of the ethno-household \"Zorni\u0107's House\" in the village of Ba\u0107evac, while the third is located in Ripanj, on the slopes of the Avala mountain. In 2017 some 15,000 overnights were recorded in camps.\n\n\n=== Nightlife ===\n\nBelgrade has a reputation for vibrant nightlife; many clubs that are open until dawn can be found throughout the city. The most recognisable nightlife features of Belgrade are the barges (splav) spread along the banks of the Sava and Danube Rivers.Many weekend visitors\u2014particularly from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia\u2014prefer Belgrade nightlife to that of their own capitals due to its perceived friendly atmosphere, plentiful clubs and bars, cheap drinks, lack of significant language barriers, and a lack of night life regulation.\nOne of the most famous sites for alternative cultural happenings in the city is the SKC (Student Cultural Centre), located right across from Belgrade's highrise landmark, the Belgrade Palace tower. Concerts featuring famous local and foreign bands are often held at the centre. SKC is also the site of various art exhibitions, as well as public debates and discussions.A more traditional Serbian nightlife experience, accompanied by traditional music known as Starogradska (roughly translated as Old Town Music), typical of northern Serbia's urban environments, is most prominent in Skadarlija, the city's old bohemian neighbourhood where the poets and artists of Belgrade gathered in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Skadar Street (the centre of Skadarlija) and the surrounding neighbourhood are lined with some of Belgrade's best and oldest traditional restaurants (called kafanas in Serbian), which date back to that period. At one end of the neighbourhood stands Belgrade's oldest beer brewery, founded in the first half of the 19th century. One of the city's oldest kafanas is the Znak pitanja ('?').The Times reported that Europe's best nightlife can be found in Belgrade.

The building is on Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 Square in downtown Belgrade, and is a landmark and tourist attraction. Between its completion in 1936 and 2006, it was the seat of the Parliament of Yugoslavia and the Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nKing Peter I built the House of Representatives of the Kingdom of Serbia near the former location of a large Batal mosque. The first plans for the future House of Representatives were drawn up by architect Konstantin Jovanovi\u0107 in 1891. His plans were slightly revised because of a new state constitution mandating a bicameral (instead of unicameral) legislature. Architect Jovan Ilki\u0107 won a 1901 design competition, adhering to Jovanovi\u0107's basic plan. The cornerstone of the House of Representative was laid in a public 1907 ceremony by King Peter I in the presence of other members of the royal family and senior officials. Construction lasted until 1936, interrupted by the Balkan Wars, World War I, and the Great Depression. The first session in the new house took place on 20 October 1936.The 13,800 square metres (149,000 sq ft) building is designed in neo-baroque style. Its interior, completed in 1938, was designed by Russian architect Nikolai Krasnov. Krasnov designed every detail: chandeliers, lamps, handles, windows, and furniture. His plans were painted in watercolor, rather than a classical technical drawing with pencil and ruler. Lawmakers did not have long to enjoy the newly built House of Representatives. After the 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia and during  World War II, the House of Representatives housed the German high command for southeastern Europe. The building was damaged during the demonstrations on 5 October 2000, and appears on the RSD5,000 banknote. The parliament building was featured in the 2011 film, Coriolanus.\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\n\nThe house was originally designed by architect Konstantin Jovanovi\u0107 in 1891, but financial constraints prevented its construction at the time. A new design was proposed by Jovan Ilki\u0107 in 1901 after a constitutional amendment and the creation of a bicameral parliament.Following the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, the parliament was increased and the original design (under construction) deemed inadequate. A modified design was made by Ilki\u0107's son, Pavle, in 1920 and construction resumed until its completion in 1936. A sculpture by Toma Rosandi\u0107, Igrali se konji vrani (Play by Black Horses), was installed in front of the building in 1939.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nThe building's interior was designed by architect Nikolai Krasnov in academic traditional style. Covering about 13,400 square metres (144,000 sq ft), it has four storeys: a basement, ground floor, first floor, and attic, with mezzanines below the basement, between the basement and the ground floor and between the ground and first floors. The building has 100 offices, large and small halls, and four committee rooms. The 165-square-metre (1,780 sq ft) library, on the first floor, contains over 60,000 books. The building is decorated with 23 frescoes and a number of paintings, sculptures, and other fine artwork.During the 5 October riots in 2000, 91 pieces of art were stolen from the National Assembly. Thirty-five have been found, but 56 remain missing. The building itself was also damaged.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nConstruction began on 27 August 1907, when the building's cornerstone was laid in the presence of Peter I of Serbia, George, Crown Prince of Serbia, members of parliament and the diplomatic corps. Its charter, sealed in the cornerstone during the ceremony, bore the names of the king, the metropolitan, and chief architect Jovan Ilki\u0107. Construction was overseen by Belgrade contractor Vasa Te\u0161i\u0107. It was delayed until the end of World War I, with only the first floor completed. Construction was influenced by the formation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, which required the project to be modified. After Ilki\u0107's death in 1917 his son, Ministry of Construction architect Pavle Ilki\u0107, led the project. His duties included making the required changes and completing the original design. Construction continued from 1920 to 1926, when it was again suspended. A decision about the next phase was made after the death of Alexander I of Yugoslavia in 1934, when the contractor became Ministry of Construction chief architect Nikolaj Krasnov (1864\u20131939). Krasnov's thirty years of experience in public-building design (giving him the titles of Architect of the Russian Imperial Court and \"the academician of architecture\") led to his invitation to work on important buildings in the Serbian capital, and he provided details of the interior. The National Assembly was dedicated on 18 October 1936 in the presence of Peter II of Yugoslavia, after 29 years of construction. The first governmental session was held two days later, and by the end of the year the building was fully completed.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nThe building's central risalit is dominated by a portico with a triangular tympanum, above which is a dome with a lantern at the top. Its external design (with rustic green stone from Ripanj for the basement), and the shape of windows and pilasters extending through the two central levels and ending in a roof cornice with balustrade, indicate neo-Renaissance and neo-Baroque models. The original design's heraldic and sculptural decorations were not executed. The only plastic ornaments are medallions with images of Pericles, Athena, Demosthenes and Cicero, by sculptor \u0110or\u0111e Jovanovi\u0107, on the lateral risalits. A sculpture above the portals of an angel with a torch and an olive branch was designed by sculptor Petar Palavi\u010dini. A 1937 fence with decorative candelabras and two guardrooms with stylized lanterns on top was designed by Krasnov; the fence stood until 1956, when it was removed for Marx and Engels Square (now Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 Square). In 1939 a sculptural group by Toma Rosandi\u0107, Black Horses Playing, was installed near the steps. \nInterior design includes large and small halls and conference rooms, a central vestibule topped by a dome, polychrome walls with columns, pilasters, niches and loggias and a marble floor. The Assembly Hall, designed to hold 200 people, was expanded to accommodate 400.\nKrasnov's furniture designs reflect contemporary Belgrade tastes. The walls of the Assembly are adorned with twenty frescoes, made during 1937 by prominent Yugoslav artists. Because of its architectural, cultural, historical and artistic value, the National Assembly Building was declared a cultural monument in 1984.\n\n\n== Former building ==\nBefore 2006, the National Assembly of Serbia met in another parliament building on Kralja Milana Street while its current building was used by the Federal Assembly of Yugoslavia. The parliament building is still used by the national assembly for offices and administration.\nThe design for this building was completed in 1948, and its construction was completed in late 1953. It was designed by architect E. Azriel and built by the Construction Institute of Serbia. The building was known as the Office Building of the Presidency of the Government of the People's Republic of Serbia at Marshal Tito Street (later renamed Kralja Milana Street). The first National Assembly session in the building was held on 20 March 1954; from 1945 to 1954, National Assembly sessions were held at the House of the National Assembly on Nikola Pa\u0161i\u0107 Square.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nVirtual tour\nThe National Assembly Artwork",

          "Apparently you can't go inside. But it's definitely an interesting building to walk in. Especially if architecture is your thing. Out front there are a ton of anti-Clinton billboards people have put up as well as photos and names of all bombing victims.",

This National Assembly was the seat of the Parliament of Yugoslavia and later the Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro. The",
          "Maybe, could be considered one of the symbol of Belgrade. Beautiful and imponent, situated in the city Center.",
          "Situated conviniently in the middle of the city, it is a building that cannot be missed and nor should be. It is one of the more beautiful buildings and exagerated in style. I would personaly recommend to wait for the dusk and see assembly in the night when it is beautifully",
          "It looks like it was a majestic structure at one time. Even now it is nice to look at and worth a visit.",
          "If I had to choose to remember 1 thing from the buildings of Belgrade, it would certainly be this one! The architecture is magnificent, probably the most gorgeous Assembly I have ever visited! See it both during day and night, it looks totally different! During Christmas",
          "This place echoes some past time when it served a larger country. It is a nice Building int he centre of the City. You can wlak around it and there is even a small park for kids next to it. It is very nice in the evening when it is nicely illuminated",
          "The square in front of the National Assembly is the place to celebrate great Serbian sport successes. It's not nice to visit when the assembly is working as there are plenty of cars parked in front of the assembly and they are spoiling the view.",

          "Located in the center of the city is an impressive building. The building cannot be visited because is the government's building.",
          "Just in the center, the Parliament Building is well kept and a landmark for Belgrade. You can park for 60 minutes just near it, if you find a spot. After seeing from clos, cross the street and admire it from distance. In the vicinity there is also Presidencial pallace and a nice",
          "This Government building is stunning and looks great during the day and very interesting during the night. This building cannot be visited/seen inside as it is still the government seat. But this area has a number of interesting buildings.",
          "This was a really cool building to check out. I thought the whole surrounding area was interesting. I would recommend this.",
          "Same as other mention, from the outside only. But it is a very grandiose building with neat maintenance outside and statues. For some photos there is no problem, you can get some good light by the end of afternoon",
          "Could not get inside as there apparently is no admission for tourists. Outside, it's a gorgeous building on a main street. Across the street is a nice little park with cold water fountains. Also in this park is sort of a pile of rocks and plaques to dead - a mystery to us.",
          "I thought I would go as far as I could and right when I had 2-3 stairs left to the door, an Eastern-Europe-mafia-type guy smiled at me and started walking towards me. His presence was enough for me to climb right down the stairs. I suspect he's with the secret service.",
          "I firmly believe that visit this beautiful building inside is almost impossible, but of course you can admire it from the adjacent street. I saw it in the afternoon and in the evening when it was lit, the lights and improved the appearance of this important building. Reached by",

          "Never been inside this building but from the outside it's just great! There are fountains, gardens, parks and pretty much everything around the parliament's building. It's also very close to the main pedestrian street and also not so far away from the former foreign and defence",
          "It reminds of buildings in the central Europe. We tried to get a look from the inside but they stopped us.",

          "The National Assembly is off limits to passers-by as it is a political hub for Serbia. Saying this if you go in the daytime you can admire the architecture and the strange sculptures outside of a man and a horse wrestling. At night the National Assembly is lit up and cascading",
          "This is a very interesting building, since you get a completely different impression when you look at it in the daylight and in the evening! The light effects give you the impression that you stand in front of a place where history has been made! Also a place with a very",
          "Definitely go here as it is a wonderous building to look at. It is on one of the main roads in to the city centre so can be difficult to get pictures from across the road without getting passing cars in your photo, and again it is worth going back at night as it too is all lit",
          "This building looks very serious, but in fact really nothing happens here. UN really doesnt care for the Serbian national assembly opionion.",
          "I loved to stop by this building at night and think; it's one of the most important palaces in Belgrade (and in ex-Jugoslavia) regarding contemporary history, and it is perfectly illuminated.",
          "it looks wonderful from the outside and that is all you will get to see. it is right across the old palace, that is the house of president. I like the sculptures in front of it. In movie Belgrade from Boris Malagurski we learned it was made during long period of time by two",
          "The National Assembly of Serbia is great architectural building (for me it is one of the most beautiful parliament in Europe) and is placed in the city center of Belgrade next to the central post office building (which is also nice to check when you are there). I am surprised",

        "wiki": "Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo (Serbian: \u0412\u0438\u043d\u0447\u0430-\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e \u0431\u0440\u0434\u043e) is an archaeological site in Vin\u010da, a suburb of Belgrade, Serbia. The tell of Belo Brdo ('White Hill') is almost entirely made up of the remains of human settlement, and was occupied several times from the Early Neolithic (c. 5700 BCE) through to the Medieval period. The most substantial archaeological deposits are from the Neolithic-Eneolithic Vin\u010da culture, of which Vin\u010da-Belo Brdo is the type site.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nVin\u010da is situated on the right bank of the Danube, 14 km downstream from Belgrade, on a high loess terrace. This location was attractive to its Neolithic settlers: the Danube on one side provided water and fishing while on the other the valley of the river Bolecica connected it to a hinterland rich in minerals, ores, hunting grounds and fertile agricultural soils. Belo Brdo is one of the largest tell sites in the Balkans, covering 10 hectares of land with 9 metres of cultural deposits and a total height of 10.5 metres.\n\n\n== Excavations ==\n\nThe first archaeological excavations at Vin\u010da were carried out by prominent Serbian archaeologist Miloje Vasi\u0107 starting in 1908. These were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I and, apart from a brief season in 1924, Vasi\u0107 was unable to obtain the necessary funding to continue working on the site from the impoverished postwar Yugoslav government. However, with the financial backing of British businessman and archaeologist Sir Charles Hyde, Vasi\u0107 was able to resume excavations, on a much larger scale, between 1929 and 1931. These piqued the interest of the British press and the site was subsequently visited by several prominent intellectuals of the time, including Hyde, John Myres, Veselin \u010cajkanovi\u0107, W. A. Hurtley and Bogdan Popovi\u0107. Finds from these excavations are now in several UK museums including the Ashmolean Museum and the British Museum.New excavations were begun in 1978 under the auspices of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. From 1978 to 1982 the project focused on the Bronze Age and later layers, under the direction of Nikola Tasic and Gordana Vujovic. In 1982 excavations began on the more prominent Neolithic occupation, investigation of which continues to the present, led by Milutin Garasanin and Dragoslav Srejovic. Unfortunately in the 47 years between Vasi\u0107's and the present research the site suffered considerable damage from unauthorized excavations and looting.\n\n\n== Occupation ==\n\n\n=== Star\u010devo period, c. 5700\u20135300 BCE ===\nThe earliest deposits at Belo Brdo date to around 5700 BCE and belong to the Early Neolithic Star\u010devo culture. Evidence for this phase of occupation is scant owing to the disruption of the later Vin\u010da settlement, and consists mainly of one large grave containing the remains of eleven males. This collective burial is unusual for Star\u010devo sites, where individual inhumations are the norm. Otherwise the Star\u010devo finds at Belo Brdo are unremarkable, and it is only one of several contemporary Star\u010devo settlements in the vicinity of modern Belgrade.\n\n\n=== Vin\u010da period, c. 5200\u20134900 BCE ===\n\nA century after the abandonment of the Star\u010devo settlement Belo Brdo was occupied by people of the Vin\u010da culture. A total of thirteen building horizons from this period make up the majority of the tell's stratigraphy, as new buildings were constructed on the debris left by periodic fires. Belo Brdo was a major Vin\u010da centre and, at its peak, one of the largest settlements in Neolithic Europe. However, it was abandoned by 4900 BCE, some five centuries before the wider collapse of the Vin\u010da culture.As in the earlier Star\u010devo occupation, the Vin\u010da houses at Belo Brdo were constructed primarily from wood and clay, but they also made use of levelled foundations, insulation and decoration with paint and wall coverings. In later phases large (40 x 60 m2) rectangular buildings with internal divisions and fixed furniture (benches, braziers, waterwheels, tables, etc.) appeared alongside the predominant one-roomed dwellings. The Vin\u010da settlement was arranged on straight streets, fenced and considerably larger than that of the Star\u010devo period. The inhabitants' subsisted based both on the cultivation of grains (einkorn, emmer and barley) and husbandry of domesticated animals (primarily cattle, but also goats, sheep and pigs). These agricultural practices probably continued to be supplemented by hunting and fishing in the surrounding environs.\nIn the Early Vin\u010da phase Belo Brdo seems to have developed into a ritual centre for the entire region. The manufacture of various types of cult objects, including 'mushroom amulet' and 'animal head' jewellery made from semi-precious stones, first appeared there and then spread to other Vin\u010da sites. The raw material for these objects often had to be imported from considerable distance, indicating also that from its earliest phase the site was part of large-scale exchange networks. It is therefore thought that Belo Brdo was a key place in a wider Vin\u010da prestige economy, and an abundance of ritual paraphernalia, especially anthropomorphic figurines, is characteristic of the site. Another ritual innovation of Early Vin\u010da phase Belo Brdo was the bucranium cult, where the painted skulls of cattle were fixed to the interior of houses. It is speculated that this practice may be linked to the wealth of individual households as measured in cattle. Later, however, Belo Brdo was to some degree eclipsed by the nearby site of Vr\u0161ac, which became the centre of the much more widespread exchange of ornaments made from Spondylus shells. Subsequently, in the Late Vin\u010da phase figurines became less widely circulated, and at the same time more standardised in form (in contrast to the many idiosyncratic styles of the Early Vin\u010da phase). They also began to be inscribed with Vin\u010da symbols, which perhaps indicates that competition and conflict was arising between different groups within Belo Brdo trying to assert control over the flow of ritual goods.\n\n\n=== Post-Vin\u010da occupations ===\nBelo Brdo has been occupied several times since the abandonment of the Vin\u010da settlement, but not on the same scale. From the Copper Age there are four graves belonging to the Bodrogkereszt\u00far culture, a very small Baden culture settlement and some evidence of visits by people of the Kostolac culture. There was a large but short-lived Bronze Age settlement belonging to the Vatin culture. In the Iron Age the size of the tell made it an attractive location for a significant Celtic hill fort complete with defensive earthworks. The most recent historical use of the site was a substantial Old Serbian necropolis.\n\n\n== Tourism ==\nVin\u010da-Belo Brdo is classified as an Archaeological Site of Exceptional Importance by the Serbian government, entitling it to the highest level of state protection. Artefacts from the site are on display in exhibitions at the archaeological park, the National Museum of Belgrade, the Belgrade City Museum and the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy.Currently, the entire Vin\u010da archeological site is closed for tourists and protected with a thick layer of sand due to the landslide problems.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLady of Vin\u010da\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nChapman, John (1981).

        "wiki": "Hakone (\u7bb1\u6839\u753a, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of June 2012, the town had an estimated population of 13,492, and a population density of 145 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi). Hakone has been designated as a Japanese National Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Network.\nHakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mt. Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nOdawara\nYugawara\nMinami-ashigaraShizuoka Prefecture\n\nGotemba\nSusono\nMishima\nOyama\nKannami\n\n\n== History ==\nHakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the Hakone Checkpoint (\u7bb1\u6839\u95a2\u6240, Hakone sekisho), which formed the border of the Kant\u014d region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T\u014dkaid\u014d were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons.\nAfter the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake.\nAfter merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active \u014cwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights.\nHakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art.\nMajor events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T\u014dkaid\u014d road.\nOne famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods.\nA noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi.Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town. In 2017, Hakone was included as one of 88 anime pilgrimage sites for 2018 by the Anime Tourism Association. In 2020, new decorations have been introduced to the city in the anticipation of the release of the final film of the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nHakone Tozan Railway\nHakone Tozan Cable Car\nHakone Ropeway\nIzuhakone RailwayOdawara and Mishima, the terminus of the Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, 70 minutes from Shinjuku, Tokyo.

          "The Hakone Open-Air Museum is a great place to get away from the big cities and have a relaxing outdoor walk, surrounded by world-class modern art. The setting is wonderful. Admission includes the indoor Picasso museum. Close to a Shinkansen station and the town of Hakone. It's",

          "We were lucky to be there on a dry day, I wouldn't recommend visiting on a very wet day because almost all of the sculptures are outside. I thought the range was very impressive and include several Henry Moore's & and at least one Hepworth (so the British were well represented).",
          "The Hakone Open-Air Museum is a very nice modern sculpture park/museum. The museum itself is quite small, but the sculpture park is quite large. There is a lot to explore. I arrived shortly after it rained... Blue sky with mixed clouds... It was beautiful. It is not too",

          "Really surprised to see such an extensive open air, modern sculpture collection in the hills of a spa town in Japan. It's absolutely fantastic and easily rivals similar ones that I've seen in the US and in Europe. Absolutely worth a visit, but absolutely be prepared to walk a",

The sculptures are nearly all outdoors, so maybe if it\u2019s scorching hot or wet or cold it might not be as good,",

          "An unique museum, just by its name and concept of having exhibits out in open air. A path has been laid out for visitors, so it was an easy experience. A family-friendly place where strollers can be loaned. Visit the Symphonic Sculpture - it looks normal and dark from the",

          "We visited the open air museum in February 2019. Based on the tripadvisor reviews, we had high expectations and were not disappointed. The museum is easily accessible via train or taxi. We took a taxi to the museum from Tonosawa which only took a few minutes (but was pricey).",
          "One of the main attractions on the Hakone circuit, although annoyingly not included in the Hakone Freepass (Discount only offered). We visited for a couple of hours on a lucky sunny day in November 2018. There are a few indoor halls, including a Picasso exhibit. Besides that,",

          "This is a very nice and good \"museum\". For the accumulated wealth of Japan in past decades, give them credit for acquiring priceless art, and paying tribute to western culture. The Picasso pieces are especially worth seeing. Not at all hard to get to, even if you don't drive,",
          "Visited an afternoon in december 2018. I was amazed with how much there was to see. Sadly I had to rush through some parts in order to get back to the entrance in time. Sculptures are carefully placed, facilities well managed and the overall environment is beautiful. I did not",

          "There are three components to this Open air museum, the statues out doors, the Picasso collection and the collection of small works in the gallery above the cafe. Even one is worth the admission fee, but we got all three. An absolute must do, and what made us choose Hahone as a",
          "This is not the place you want to go on a rainy day. The sculpture is laid out nicely and is excellent but the Picasso exhibit is mainly works you would never really care to see if you are an \"art\" person. It is mostly ceramic work which wasn't his best. THe scultpure garden",

          "I really enjoyed the Hakone Open-Air Museum and the gardens looked especially stunning under snow cover. The weather may affect what you think of the museum, so choose a nice, sunny day to go, especially if it's winter. The great collection of sculptures aside, the Museum also",
          "A lovely thing to do and especially easy to get to as it's only a walk away if staying in Gora. Some thoughtful, clever and interesting art over a very large area, with a cafe and other comforts available. The Picasso section was a little disappointing as nothing truly stands",
          "Get here early and in winter, rug yourself up. It's well worth it as there are some interesting exhibits for kids who can play on the sculptures quite safely. They may also like the foot bath. One sculpture has an area for older and younger kids. I found the souvenir shop",

          "Its a good place to move around. Have ample amount of time to visit this. I arrived late and could not see all.",

          "So we visited this museum because is so close to our hotel, and although is interesting we got bored really fast, everything is really expensive, and very crowded (we went on a Sunday). We did enjoy the gelato they sold and it has some nice views. Is not bad to visit but Hakone",
          "The grounds consist of several buildings and a very nice duck pond with a huge Dale Chihuly in the middle of it. What this has to do with Venetian glass is beyond me. Yes, there is a museum and there are some items of ancient Venetian glass but most of it is a mix of Murano",
          "We saw this place advertised on the drive up and could not imagine what it was.... Actually it is EXTREMELY nice - the exhibits are lovely - mixture of ancient and modern glass - and there was a very cool show playing music on glasses!! And then we ate at the restaurant and",
          "We really enjoyed this museum. We learn a lot about glass in general and Venetian glass in particular. The coffee shop on site is a must! The garden display of Venetian glass was really spectacular.",
          "Beautiful place to visit and see the detail in the Venetian Glass Museum is Amazing it's truly a beautiful place to visit a must see if you go too Hakone a beautiful city ....",
          "I didn't know what to expect, and assumed the worst, but was pleasantly surprised. The museum collection is interesting. I didn't realize the history of glass making was so extensive. The collection and presentation are worth a visit. Best on a good weather day because some fun",
          "We love Japan, but this museum was a great break from the Far East, transporting us to northern Italy. The glass is all beautiful, from the ancient Venetian pieces to the large, modern Chihuly sculptures (we loved the Chihuly museum in Seattle). They even have Italian concerts!",
          "Really good collection of Venetian objects from 17-20th century. Some explanations on the techniques and how things were done. Small video area. Nice garden when sunny, it is literally shining. Easy parking (surcharge).",
          "I went there with my friend without expecting anything and I was pleasantly surprised. It was wonderful; I didn't care much about the display inside but I was enjoying the outdoor display; the glass curtain, glass trees and other small details were amazing.",
          "I didn't quite expect a Venetian glass exhibit in Japan. Both the grounds and museum were spectacular. You especially have to see the trees made with wire trunks and hundreds of sparkling glass beads as leaves. While we were there during the day and they were magnificent with",
          "It's a weird feeling to find yourself in 'Italy' when you're actually in Japan. Can't deny that it is a beautiful place, especially if you like museums. There's the indoor and outdoor, am particularly fond of the outdoor section as the natural backdrop in itself is amazing.",
          "This was a stop on the MWR tour I signed up for. I was a little surprised that my tour of Japan included a museum I would expect to find in Italy, but, hey, whatevs, right? It was very cold the day I was there, but most of the glass is housed in buildings. However, the outdoor",
          "I've been here twice now, two very different trips and even on a return visit I found the displays interesting and different parts of the museum quite restful. It is not overly commercial and the art work and skill on display is worth the bus (or taxi) to visit.",
          "There is carpark fee of 300yen. Entrance fee is 1500yen per adult. Inside, you will find a pretty outdoor display of glass trees and ornaments. Very pleasant. However, there's not very much history in this museum. Feels like a tourist trap. Good if you have nothing much to do.",
          "We loved it! great museum to visit - awesome glass art from different periods. Some absolutely stunning pieces.",
          "Entrance fees for adults is \u00a51,500/- and \u00a5600 for high school children. Fully worth it. Beautiful gardens tastefully decorated with nice glass crystals and trees. There is even a live music performance indoor playing beautiful classical pieces. The cold winter temperature",
          "Very beautiful scenic area. Lots to time and shipping as well. Variety in the cafe was slim and sold out of the popular croissants with the jams inside. Other than that, still a gorgeous place to visit.",
          "The place is simply nice. I wouldn't visit it again. It was very small. Maybe because I love glass, so I've been to several museums that had much more items on display, making me believe this is one of the not as impressive ones...",
          "Wasn't originally planning to stop here, but a couple rainy days pointed me to a handful of museums in the area and I'm glad I stopped here. It ranks on the more unique types of museums with some stunning glass pieces. They have done a very nice job creating the Venetian feel in",
          "What a find A Italian inspired place with glassware from Venice on display in a lovely museum of glass. There is a lovely description of how murano glass is made and also the many types of glassware. Restaurants are plenty and they also include a very elaborate gift shop. Do",
          "The Venetian Garasunomori costs about 1.5x the usual price for Japanese museums, but is pretty and unique enough to be worth a visit. The glass exhibits only take up about 30% of the museum's volume, 40% is an outdoor garden and the rest is taken up by restaurants and gift",
          "It is a wonder to enter this world. Very informative as well as beautiful. The gardens are lovely and full of surprises. The gallery engaging. There are things to do or watch being done. The shop is pricey. There are food options and it is nicely compact.",
          "Thanks to our Hakone free pass we got a discounted entry. The first sight of the gardens takes your breath away. The gardens are spectacular but you are quickly ushered into the indoor museum. It tells the history of Venetian glass and has many stunning displays. The highlight",
          "Beautiful exhibits in the garden with antique pieces inside the museum, great place to spend a leisurely afternoon with art and tea, kids can make glass accessories as well from 1,700 yen. The souvenir shop is huge with glassware and plenty of accessories.",
          "This place is just stunning. The garden is beautifully decorated with sparkling glasses sculpture. It is a bit expensive, but really worth the price. And if you have Hakone free pass, can get discount for the admission fee. We visited on Sunday, and they gave us voucher for free",
          "A museum needs to give you a wow factor. This place certainly does. Was skeptical at first but was very satisfied at the end. Beautiful exhibits. Great education on glass making. Good value for money.",
          "The Venetian glass display was good. Not impressed by the modern glass display. I love the garden, the trees were sparkling with glass leaves.",
          "The museum is small, but very intricate and beautiful. We visited on a rainy day and really enjoyed it. They provided big umbrellas to use so we could still see the gardens. There is also free wifi available.",
          "This place is very beautiful but very small. Entry fee is \u00a51500, if you have free pass it is \u00a51400 . The food inside is also expensive .. Coffee at the cafe is \u00a5800 .",
          "We stayed a stone's throw (don't throw stones here!) from the museum so it would have been rude not to go. ('We' is a mum and daughter from England). On first sight the garden is pretty stunning, with good views of the surrounding mountains. The glass exhibits are quite",
          "Visitors should try wearing their costumes (provided free for the first hour) and walk in the garden. make sure to take lots of pictures in this scenic garden full of glass. Enjoy the free live music and shop souvenirs made of glass.",
          "Let me start with the positives. The owners clearly spent a lot on developing the place. There is a nice water feature, eye-catching bridge, resident ducks and other cool details. Some of the glass and porcelain pieces they have on display - of Venician original and/or influence",
          "Bought my entrance ticket coupled with the Little Prince Museum. Walkable from one museum to another but I'm sure there is an easier way that we didn't discover :) Greeted by crystal cherry blossom trees at the entrance and the crystal arch really sparkled on that sunny day.",
          "It says it is a Venetian Glass Museum. And it is. Some examples of Venetian glass. That's it. Are you very, very interested in Venetian glass? If you are then maybe you should go. They have padded it out as much as they can. An Italian violinist gets people clapping along to",
          "We visited here as we were staying in Hakone, not sure if I would travel from Tokyo just for this but if your staying here or coming for the day to see mount Fuji from the lake it is worth a visit - really nice lots to see, the crystal trees outside were stunning - was very nice",
          "First, the ticket price is scarily high. I almost skip this place after seeing the tag price to enter this place. But please dont let it fool you. Well of course i wont recommend you to come to this place many many times, but for once in your lifetime, you will REGRET for not",
          "If you brought a private vehicle, be sure to leave everything except for your money and your camera. Most places are so delicate and you don\u2019t want any of your bags, or jackets getting caught up in one of the displays, and end up paying and taking home broken pieces of glasses.",
          "Hakone is a day trip from Tokyo and if you are coming out this way make sure to go to the Venetian glass museum. It's easy to get to with its own bus stop on the main lines. It costs \u00a51,500 for an adult but you get a discount if you have th Hakone Free pass. It's so totally",
          "WOW - who would expect to find a small but world class museum here? We didn't. They've got Chihuli inside and out, bowls and sculptures+. And what exquisite objects they have by Livio Seguso! Absolutely WOW! This museum is not to be missed! You can even have a walk in the woods",
          "A MUST-VISIT museum on Hakone. Does not take much to be able to appreciate the beautiful works & views. Very pretty pieces of work that we cannot get enough of. Took many photos. Would have bought a few pieces home if not for the fact that we had another 10 days of",

          "Just by chance my wife and I stopped by this Museum, which is right next door to the Hakone Highland Hotel. Not much of glass guy but found this museum very colorful, and interesting. Ended up spending a few hours there. They also had some international musicians on hand",
          "Interesting and beautiful place to spend a few hours, including lunch. The kids had a fun time walking through the outdoor exhibits and there are pretty ducks in the pond. We had lunch in the Italian restaurant inside. It only serves pasta and pizza... Didn't pay attention to",
          "You can spend at least half a day here visiting the glass collections indoor as well as outdoor. There are also nice gardens to explore and the cafe and restaurants there are really nice and of good value. When we're a the restaurant, they have an Italian band their",

          "The museum has some nice collection of glass art pieces. The garden is lovely and romantic. Besides the glass bridge and sculptures other reviewers mentioned, the \"red leaves trail\" is also beautiful and worth a walk. Hint: you can buy the tickets at Hakone Yumoto bus stop and",
          "This museum are quite interesting. It has a wide collection of perfume bottles which is delicate and really beautiful. Entrance fee of 1,500JPY and souvenirs are a little pricey. But It is a nice place to visit if you are interested in glass materials.",

          "This is a very romantic place to take your significant other to and have a relaxing lunch. The glass sculptures and glass bridge are gorgeous. Be sure to check out the area in the far back end where you walk through a small forest area with glass trees.",
          "Interesting displays of venetian glass. They had a glass concert while we were there and nice views of Hakone volcano. Easy bus ride to get there and to the Little Prince Museum. Take the T line bus from Yamato-Hakone station.",

          "I really enjoyed this place. The glass hydrangeas were my favorite. The grounds were lovely. My only complaint is that we visited on a rainy day (that's Japan for you) so I didn't get to appreciate the full sparkly glass. Also, it's much smaller than I thought it would be.",

          "We walked into a a Venetian fairy land made up of crystal trees , sculptures and arbours. There are 2 museums, both quite small, one devoted to old glass pieces and the other to more modern ones. There were some exquisite pieces in both . The gift shop also hosted quite a fine",
          "We went in May 2015 and we were greeted with garden full of flowers. That combined with the glittering light that comes about when sunlight was reflected and refracted from the hanging glass curtain that adorns the bridge makes the whole place like a fairy land",
          "Sorry, I can not recommend this activity. Yes it is a beautiful garden. But 1500 yen for admissions is too high to visit a garden with glass shops. The museum part is tiny! I prefer gora park or the sculpture museum instead.",
          "This place was like walking into Venice, but so much better as was done by the Japnese - absolutely amazing and stunning. Even our two boys (ages 19, 22) rated this place as a must. Restaurant served pasta meals in keeping with theme of the place and meal was second to none.",
          "If you want to go to a fun and quirky and pretty place, honestly, this is not it. It felt lukewarm at best, though the glass perfume bottle exhibition was interesting. The rest of the grounds feels more like a giant souvenir store peddling their wares. I suppose if you have",

          "Totally not worth paying to see this unless you like looking at glassware.... The fastest time we ever finished a museum. Outside the museum, its quite nice for pictures. Unfortunately on the day we went, it was raining quite hard so couldn't get any nice photos of the glass",
          "you even doubt real plants if they were made of glass. Everything of glass is so realistic and beautiful, Bought a few nice articles made of glass",
          "The entrance ticket of 1500 yen is very unique, it came with a colourful eye mask. The layout of the place is beautiful too with mostly young people wearing the colourful costumes and masks. Anyway, we were not so interested in glasses made items, we left after less than an",

          "This place is very popular and full of families who seem to like the kitschy glass displays throughout the grounds and buildings. If you are looking for art, then give it a miss. The shops are full of junk and the restaurants crowded and average quality at best. There are some",
          "Being called the Venetian Glass Museum, I expected a lot of Murano glass. While there is some Murano glass, the museum has so much more to admire. I really enjoyed the outdoor exhibitions. Everything sparkled and twinkled in the sun. I must have taken dozens of pictures",
          "The museum adopt an European Style of Glass Museum. They even lend some European costume to wear. It has a garden and lot of glass art inside the exhibition area. Don't miss the exhibition area, it's beautifully crafted, the art and the area itself. You can take Hakone Tozan",
          "This is the second time we visited the museum from Tokyo. With driving, it makes it a bit easier to each with the accurate Japanese GPS system. However, it is easily accessible by bus, and bus passes usually cover all the major attractions in the area. Inside, the glass",

          "Really great, strongly recommend. The shops and museum are incredible as well as the natural glass structures. If you're looking for gifts, this is an amazing place to go. Only complaint really is the on site Italian restaurant which is too expensive. But definitely worth the visit!",

          "Sugoi Japan museum\nTons of beautiful glass model",
          "Very expensive for what it is. Most of it is actually shops rather than a museum so I dont understand why the admission fee is so high.\nAlso there was supposed to be a violin concerto but we waited for 30min and it never happened.\nDefinitely not going again.",
          "You pay for parking, pay to enter, but of the six buildings, one is a museum, four are gift shops and one is a restaurant. I get annoyed for having to pay for the right to buy something from someone. The museum is pretty, fine, but if you \u2026",

          "Beautiful art displayed in many unique ways, such as in bushes to simulate roses. Easy to walk through, not to crowded in the middle of the day. Has a nice garden area in the back that is a nice glimpse of nature. The amount of exhibits is the only negative, as it felt short if you are not stopping to deeply examine each piece",
          "It has a good collection of glass artifacts. Some are made in Italy and other European countries.",
          "An weirdly authentic Italian experience in the middle of Japan. The museum have a range of glass collection that is full of photo spots and refreshment for your liking. They have the biggest souvenir shops I have ever seen (bear in mind \u2026",
          "Lovely place. As you enter the place, you would feel as if you are in an wonderland. The coloring and nurturing of plants and crystals on it is fabulous. Must visit place if you are going to Hakone",

          "Surprisingly very nice museum, i recommend to spend few hours there. Note that the shop is very expensive",

          "Not worth it, charged 1500yen, mainly consist of indoor glass sculpture displays, small scale, not as spectacular and varied as the Hakone Open Air Museum. Ifha e only a day or two at Hakone, would recommend to give this a miss and go Hakone Open museum instead.",
          "The glass tree is shiny & beautiful. I.e. Best to visit when it is sunny",
          "Awesome to go and check out, the price to get in is very reasonable. Unlike anything I have ever seen.",
          "Not worth the 1,500 Yen to get in, but a nice quaint area once you're inside. \n\nThere are a few exhibition areas inside of different artists, but mostly the place is for shopping or eating. There could be more included to justify the high price of entry.",
          "A beautiful Glass Art Museum easily accessible by the T bus system in Hakone. A very quaint and unique place worth visiting if you need to blow 2-3 hrs before check in. The place is cute and has lots of potential GRAM pics if you know what \u2026",

          "Nice place to visit.",
          "This museum had some stunning glass pieces and would highly recommend a visit, I didn't capture too many photos of the glass but there are plenty and a lot of nicely finished grounds to explore including a ravine.  It is one of the more pricy places to visit but worth the price!",

          "Very pleasant place to hangout. It has a really nice souvenir shop to buy glass articles.",

          "Very nice place",
          "We felt as we were transported to Italy during rennaisance. The enjoyed the Venetian ambience and the story of glass making. We could attend a live perfomance of an Italian Violinist. \nTotally worth it!",

          "Impressing museum, like it very much, just be careful of the rain, coz 90% outdoor area",
          "Has very creative glass exhibits including entire trees and a bridge made of glass pieces. Seems like a perfect place for Instagram pictures. Other than that items in the museum itself wasn't that great. Most of the area is for shop space \u2026",
          "Nice little shop that sells artistic glass items.",
          "Beautiful and romantic place for taking photos and seeing different glass antiques.",
          "Beautiful museum. Absolutely worth the trip (I even went in the rain and didn\u2019t get to see everything outside). Tons of glass art from world-renowned artisans. I happened to be there on a day they held a concert inside. Phenomenal!",

          "A beautiful place to visit, has good Italian feel to it, I didnt eat here but the food that was served also looked good.",
          "Probably not worth forgoing other activities for. Unless you're into glass art, it's not super exciting. Even Picasso is somewhat unimpressive in this medium.",
          "glass art for display and for sale. it is refreshing experience. better to go in the afternoon until dark.",
          "Nice piece of glasses to see. Nothing very special but if you are around, it worth to visit. If you are lucky you can listen live violin concert from an expert. This part is the most enjoyable part. You can check the schedule of the concert from the museum's website.",

          "If you love to smell of Italian, that is place for u",
          "Interesting to see glasswork from Venice at this location.",
          "Save your money unless you have a burning passion for glass. You can get two meals for the admission fee.",
          "This was a nice museum, but not the best. Outside of the actual meseum was decorated with glass. Against the sun, it was actually quite beautiful. We did not stop by the cafe, but we did go into the meseum. It had many glass peices, and that was very nice. Overall, it had beatiful peices, but did not have much glass at all.",
          "Absolutely beautiful, a great way to relax and enjoy the day.",
          "Takes about 30 minutes to finish everything. The place is mainly focused on the entrance's \"glass tunnel\". Great environment with gorgeous view of autumn leaves. Great attraction for couples and families. Moreover, they also provide free \u2026",
          "Beautiful glass wear from Europe, but be careful walking inside with a backback.",
          "I could only describe it as a shop with an entry fee, there are some interesting objects but nothing that can justify the price, some people might enjoy it as it  has its charm for couples and taking pictures.",
          "This was a great European style exhibit space with very crafted glass blower artists in Hakone. Great value for the spend and the glass creations in the gift shop are also amazing price.\n\nThe cafe is too busy for its own good. They need 2x the seating capacity.",

          "Don't bother paying \u00a51400. Worst experience of my whole 3 month trip to Japan. The Glass is nice but not worth the entrance fee. Underwhelming. Boring. Maybe it's a novelty for the orient but I'd rather save my money and go to Europe. Would \u2026",

          "loved the gardens and shop.",
          "Unexpected museum about Venise art Glass, the garden and the exhibition are worth visiting",
          "Very special place. Open air exhibits are \"must see\", it is already worth the entrance fees. If you show your Hakone Tourist Free pass you do get a discount on entrance ticket. If you want a rest after a long walk, visit a small food and drink store in the garden, best pastry I have ever had.",
          "It was only 500 yen for entry. Sunday special? Not sure. Not particularly a fan of glass art, but it was an interesting place. Wouldn\u2019t recommend going out of your way to get there, though.",
          "Impressive historical pieces, sweet layout with sparkling trees everywhere. Serene surroundings. I very much enjoyed my visit.",
          "Weird to say, but visiting Venice in Japan was not a bad idea. This place is beautiful and the garden is so nice and quiet. \nStore is a bit expensive though, but it has real wares.",
          "It was s rainy morning otherwise we would skip it. Nonetheless it was a pleasant experience but the tickets are overpriced. It might be exotic to Japanese people but after all why not to go to Venice if you are interested in Venetian glass.",

          "Great little museum and a nod to venetian glass artistry.",
          "In my opinion the price is high. The garden is greatly decorated and it looks amazing. If you have freepass it'd bet you a 100 yen discount.",

        "wiki": "Lake Ashi (\u82a6\u30ce\u6e56, Ashi-no-ko), also referred to as Hakone Lake or Ashinoko Lake, is a scenic lake in the Hakone area of Kanagawa Prefecture in Honsh\u016b, Japan. It is a crater lake that lies along the southwest wall of the caldera of Mount Hakone, a complex volcano that last erupted in 1170 CE at \u014cwakudani.  The lake is known for its views of Mt. Fuji, its numerous hot springs, historical sites, and ryokan. The lake is located on the T\u014dkaid\u014d road, the main link between Kyoto and Tokyo. A number of pleasure boats and ferries traverse the lake, providing scenic views for tourists and passengers. Several of the boats are inspired by the design of sailing warships.\nMost visitors to Lake Ashi stay in one of the hotels or ryokan located in the area to visit some of the local attractions. There is also a campsite at the north end of the lake. Hakone Shrine is a shrine that has been visited by sh\u014dgun, samurai, and many travelers over the centuries. Large sections of the Old T\u014dkaid\u014d road are preserved here. Onshi Park was the summer retreat for the imperial family that is now a public park. Taking the aerial tram Hakone Ropeway to The Great Boiling Valley.  From Togendai on Lake Ashi, the Hakone Ropeway aerial tram connects to Sounzan, the upper terminus of the Hakone Tozan Cable Car funicular railway. This in turn connects to the Hakone Tozan Line mountain railway for the descent to Odawara and a connection to Tokyo by the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen.Visitors can also take the Hakone Sightseeing Cruise with its pirate ships from Togendai to Moto-Hakone Port and Hakone-Machi Port on opposite ends of the lake. The cruise line began in 1950.\nThe name means \"lake of reeds\" in Japanese: \u82a6 (ashi) is \"reed\", and \u6e56 (ko) is \"lake\". The abundance of nature makes it popular with hikers. There are many trails with different levels of challenge.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Hakone\". Global Volcanism Program.

          "We took the cruise from hakone lake ashi to get the round trip of lake ashi during our travel mt Fuji is visible and you can take as many pictures as you want the ride are smooth and the journey is great",
          "The ships are comfortable and sail well. They leave every 20 minutes and boarding is possible at 3 location. The Hakone Freepass is recommended, in that case all transport in the area is free.",
          "Situated some 750 metres above sea level, the lake sits within a volcanic crater formed 4000 years ago from the eruption of Owakudani. It never freezes, and therefore hosts an unusual population of cold-water in warm-water fish. The lake shore is largely unspoiled countryside,",
          "Lake Ashi is a dream come true for nature lovers and photographers. Dozens of photography opportunities will spoil you around every corner. It pays to go in good weather for the best view.",
          "The boat trip across lake Ashi is worth it, even if you have to brave the cold. The Hakone pass is very useful and good to travel around in Hakone.",
          "If you take the ropeway over the volcano (pinch your noises) you see the Mt. Fuji over the Lake Aishi, which is stunning! Hakone is also famous for the onsens, try one of you can.",
          "My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, Optional Excursion to Mt. Fuji & Hakone. The boat ride was part of the excursion, and we enjoyed cruising on the lake, We passed by many attractions and there were plenty of photos to take!",
          "Except from being herded like sheep onto the ferry it is easy to remove yourself from the crowds and enjoy the scene.",
          "We took the boat from Moto - Hakone, after visiting the shrine and the temple, to Togendai. The boat is included in the Hakone Free pass. The boat trip was ok, but there were to many tourists and Mount Fuji was not visible.",
          "It is a nice Lake, and the views of Mt. Fuji from the cablecar getting to the lake are worth it. But it was nothing special other than that.",
          "We stayed in Hakone for 2 nights. You need more than that to experience the beauty of this place. From Hakone, we took the coat to lake Ashi then we took the cable cart to Valley of Hell. Train to Gora Park and train back to Hakone. Managed to see a clear glimpse of mount Fuji.",
          "Good to add to your Hakone journey if you have the Hakone Freepass - the pirate cruise ships are free. Upgrade for 400 yen to 1st class cabin and get better seating and less crowd. There is a good view of Mt Fuji on a clear day, and you also pass the Tori gate of the Hakone",
          "This is one of the highlights of this place! The cruse took us to Ashimoto where we boarded a cable car which took us up a small mountain. We alighted at the half way point as there wasn\u2019t much to see, certainly no animals or even birds. So we boarded the boat & returned to",
          "Travelled from one end of the lake on a pirate boat, in the snow, views around the lake were good, but could not see Mount Fuji, next day the view across the lake from our hotel room was sight to behold, there was Mount Fuji in the gleaming sunlight with a snow covered top.",
          "We took the Hakone sightseeing cruise which is part of the Hakone Free Pass. It was about an hour round trip. The views of the lake are lovely. It stops in two other ports if you want to get off and explore those areas. We chose to just stay onboard.",
          "The lake is quite peaceful and nice Unfortunately we could not see mt Fuji but we took the Cruise from one side to the other and was very nice Is a good way to move around the town and have a panoramic view",
          "The lake is 11km long and is really stunning the great views of all surrounding volcanoes except mount Fuji but you can see the tip from the western side of the lake. Cruise ships ferry hoards of tourists each side every day depending on the weather with 3 galleon type ships",
          "We arrived at the lake at the end of the afternoon on a cloudy day .Almost all cafes and restaurants closed at 17.00 aftee the retirn of the last boat trip, so better book an hotel with meal in the area. The place would probably have been magical under the sun, the torii on the",
          "This is a serene lake, which most of us will see from one of the cruise boats that ferry tourists across as part of the Hakone Loop. The boats themselves have enough seating for people and the upper decks offer great views.",
          "A bit of short ride on the pirate ship for just 10mins but you can experience a pretty good view of Mount Fuji and enjoy the cool spring Breeze. Do go to the upper deck for a better picture spot and always on the left side of the boat. We are lucky to have a clear sky and able",
          "It was snowing for us, which was good in itself, but made for poor views. Irrespective, the boats run pretty often and are a good way to link the end of the ropeway (Togendai) with the other end of the lake (Hakonemachi or Motohakone). You can then explore the southern towns and",
          "the lake is set in a beautiful surrounding and it will be spectacular with fall colors and when Mt Fuji is visible, particularly with its snow cap during the winter and spring. You can use the cruise to cross the lake and rent boats to tour the lake yourself. There are many",
          "We did the railway, cable cars then boat ride across the lake. We then walked to the nearby water shrine which was equally stunning. Do watch out for the queues for the buses back though - we stood for over an hour after sunset in the cold!!",
          "We did the \"pirate ship\" sightseeing cruise of this lake. We paid extra to have the VIP seats on one-way of the trip. It was worth it, because you get better choice of seating, more comfortable seating, and better section of deck when outside - you get better views.",
          "Beautiful area near mount Fuji. You can hop on a sightseeing boat (pirate-style) to cross the lake. At the other side it's easy to walk from A to B to do some sightseeing before you go back again. If you are a nature lover: I prefer Lake Ashi over the 5 lakes area, the nature is",
          "Had a lovely journey over the lake, a little cold but great experience in a pirate ship. Great way to get to the cable car.",
          "Will not recommend the trip Was boring and lacked substance No commentary on deck Was crowded Packed like sardines Leave out of trip",
          "Lake Ashi (also known as, Hakone Lake) is a famous crater lake, but is it peaceful below and the surrounding area? Hakone gives off a lot of volcanic steam and likely boiling below. We took a boat ride across the lake, on this, my second visit to the area. Great place for",
          "It's worth boarding the cruise for a lap around Lake Ashi. There are two stops during the journey and you can hop on and off as you like. Pity that it was not a clear day when I visited so cannot see Mt. Fuji.",
          "Catch first boat out of Motohakone to Togendai. 35mins ride offers 2 class cabin.can be upgraded for a fee with front view of the lake. Comes with 3 tier view and seating lay out.Visitor able to enjoy scenic view of surrounding mountain.able to see a glimpse of Fuji San peak.Not",
          "Fascinating view of Mt. Fuji just walk past the convenient store. You may need someone to take your photo as the light is tricky for a selfie.",
          "You have to work out your trip to see which way round you want to see all the sights and some packages do not give you the whole lake but just part of it - we done it ourselves (with the wife\u2019s planning) and had the whole lake trip - a nice lake cruise that is so relaxing Be",
          "There are a couple of boats that cruise around the lake and you can get off at the other side if you wish. The lake and the surrounding area are breathtaking during the various seasons, but we were too early for the cherry blossom. We took the pirate ship and the ride across was",
          "Can take a boat across. Windy and cold so might be much better in warmer seasons. Fun restaurant at dock for lunch.",
          "Gorgeous lake with views of Mount Fuji. Placid boat ride took us along the shore of the lake and we were able to view several towns. Watch for the duck boats. Quite a hoot!",
          "This does look like a very popular and pretty lake \u2013 on a nice day\u2026. When we visited it was raining, cold and dull. No chance of a sighting of mount Fuji \u2013 she is very \u201cshy\u201d in this weather \u2013 of which I am told there is a lot! The towns around the lake are like many across the",
          "On a clear day you can get a very good view of the Mount Fuji and the city of Hakone. We were very fortunate to have a nice sunny day",
          "Great for whole family. Windy during Summer season but worth to see the City of Hakone from the Lake. During Winter season, Mt Fuji are visible most of the time. Unfortunatelly not so during summer.",
          "If you like outdoors this is a must. Walking trails and the Tori gate are a must see. There are several parks all around and temples with gardens and walking pats.",
          "We were fortunate to visit on a perfect day. Everywhere we went we had good views of Fuji, which is special, for some reason. While the pirate boats are a bit odd they are comfortable & good for taking photos. Overall a pleasant experience.",
          "Yes the Pirate boat is worth taking. Yes pay for first class if it is crowded. They include a nice commentary without being intrusive.",
          "Viewing the lake was included with our Hakone FreePass. Operations end at 4:15pm so we missed it on our first day, but made it our a part of our morning agenda on the second. Great views!",
          "I am not sure why we sailed the lake on a pirate ship but what the heck. Depending on the weather determains whether you get a glimpse of Mt Fuji. Clouds blocked the mountain on my visit. The highlight was getting some very good photos of the tori gate that is situated in the",
          "You can approach the lake via a bus or the funicular, but don\u2019t miss the boat ride across. The floating prayer gate is beautiful, though currently under construction/ repair.",
          "Nice a round allot of mountain and its an amazing view and their a coffee and restaurants you can spend a good time",
          "Nice lake with your typical type of lake tour to get a decent view of Mt. Fuji. There are many restaurants, shops and galleries nearby.",
          "Had a lovely cruise on a gorgeous day - the views of Mt Fuji were spectacular. The water was such a deep blue and very calm. Would definitely recommend this excursion. The area is very peaceful.",
          "Visited the lake, have a lunch there and then take the rope way. It is a beautiful place but in winter, there isn't much to see.",
          "This is our second time visiting the lake during our trip to Hakone. Pretty and unique pirate boats , Japanese land mark Mt Fuji at the background. Must visit place if you are around in Hakone. If you have hakone pass - you can use all the transport around Hakone including",
          "we rode the classic looking ship going to another site before taking the cable car. during the boat ride you will see mt. fuji and the famous tori.",
          "The lake is nothing spectacular but unique in the settings of Hakone. Most travelers cross the lake to go into the ropeway.",
          "A tourist trap unfortunately. Not much to see and if you have been on boats and lakes before, this would be quite underwhelming. If you do it from owakudani then mt fuji is behind you at the very end and is far away so it's not really worth the photo. Please be mindful the",
          "Not a very big lake. Went on the pirate ship. Weather was pretty cold though the sun was out. To be honest, nothing much to see except you can see Mount Fuji on one part of the cruise. If you continue with the next leg, you get to see more of the volcano.",
          "We came here in December. Thought photos and the really thing was kinda different. Maybe its Winter. Still a nice lake but definitely not a wow.",
          "I don't think that the lake is worth the visit and the ropeway ride up to the shrine was a waste of time as it was freezing and covered in fog at the top. We did get some good views of Mount Fuji on the ride up to the peak of Hakone and the views were impressive until we were",
          "Taking the pirate ship on this lake is a must. The surrounding of this lake is very scenic with forest and golf courses.",
          "Incredible views and lots of good restaurants around, buy the hakone free pass so you can do the scenic cruise. Worth it for the views on a good day",
          "We went on the boat and walked to the shrine and on the ropeway and there was no sight of mount fujiii! Ultra sad as the announcements mock you throughout the experience by saying \" on the right you can now experience a beautiful view of mount Fuji!!\" All we saw was fog and rain.",
          "It\u2019s beautiful here. We were there very early in the morning and I got an unobstructed view of Mount Fuji and the famous red tori gate. The trek to see the red tori gate and the nearby shrine took about 15 mins. Unfortunately parts of the shrine was under construction so walking",
          "We visited Lake Ashi while on our tour with Shin of ToursbyLocals. It is so peaceful just watching the lake. Unfortunately we didn't see Mount Fuji due to clouds but on the train back from Kyoto we got a lovely view of Mount Fuji.",
          "On a clear day, you will be able to see Mt. Fuji while riding a Japanese Pirate Ship. Enjoy the view and serene Lake Ashi.",
          "We saw Lake Ashi when we took The Rope but did not take the boat ride. It\u2019s a beautiful lake - very serene.",
          "The lake is situated on top of the mountains, which is a historical volcano. One a fine day, you will be able to see mount Fuji from here. There are some shops around the boarding place for the pirate ship and they have some good foods there.",
          "A lovely natural environment! You can visit and old cedar tree forest and a ancient temple in the hills. Afterwards just grab a ferry across the lake.",
          "The lake has a nice view on Mt Fuji.Take the pirate boats and you will be pleasantly surprised by the experience, the views. It makes it more fun.",
          "We had a lovely half hour cruise of Lake Ashi. The views from the boat are beautiful and it made for a lovely relaxing time in an otherwise busy day.",
          "We took the boat cruise on Lake Ashi and it was a beautiful lake surrounded by beautiful scenery (including Mount Fuji). There are also a couple of great small-town stops along the lakefront, with nice restaurants and shops to peruse. Very relaxing experience!",
          "The ride in the ship is quiet and serene as you are mesmerised by the beautiful \"koyo\" (autumn leaves) on either sides of the river. Lake Ashi is also beautiful during sunset. So would recommend one to be present at the Hakone-machi side during sunset. It is a short walk up to",
          "I went with my wife and mother in law on the ship, i thoroughly enjoyed the scenery and the whole adventure of being on the Lake and spent a bit extra going 1st class.great views, didnt Fuji san that day due to the cloud cover but still an enjoyable day all round.",
          "We took the boat from one side to the cable car side. You're treated to a great view with mount fuji in the background.",
          "The boat only sails at specific times and can get quite busy so it\u2019s best to queue up early to be sure you can get on the boat you want Most people just wander around the top deck taking photos and there are some seats at the top. On a clear day you will see Mt Fuji. The cruise",
          "Is a nice place to stroll but too much tourist. Many shops and eatery. The pirate ships ride across the lake.",
          "Buy the Hakone Free Pass - worth every yen. So you can go on unlimited trips on the Pirate Ships, Ropeways and Cable cars.",
          "We took the Nankai Romance Car (reserved seating) from Shinjuku Station to Hakaone-Yumoto and then caught the Tozan bus express to Hakone-machi where we spent the night prior to taking the lake cruise. I would like to return and try fishing for trout in the lake. Boat rentals",
          "Post-Owakudani station, our ropeway cable car took us to Togendai station. At Togendai station, one could catch the ropeway back to Owakudani, catch a bus back to Gora station (and more) or catch a boat to Hakone-Machi. We opt for the boat (admission included in our Hakone Day",
          "This is not an easy trip if you have limited mobility despite assurances. We went to Mount Fuji, the coach parked up a good 200 yards from the centre, so we didn\u2019t get out of the coach. Then we went for \u201clunch\u201d, which was not included in our package, we knew that, but then we",
          "We enjoyed our boat trip on a mock pirate ship as part of the cable/ropeway/rail trip in the Hakone region using the Hakone Free Pass. Nice views. We were there when clouds covered Mt. Fuji, but it was still an enjoyable visit and took us to the lovely art museum at the south",
          "We were very lucky to be on the lake as sunset was approaching. The cloud cleared and we had a wonderful view of Mount Fuji.",
          "Although it was a Misty Moisty Cloudy day ,we did get to take some good photos of the Red Gate and Lake Ashi .....Not much to say. Caught a slight glimpse of Mt Fuji before the clouds got in to cover the whole mountain",
          "Like many places in Japan, the townships around the lake are tired and in need of tidyup. After arriving via the cable-car from Hakone we strolled around the port of Tokendai where the 'pirate' ships depart. By all means take the Cable Car it is a lovely trip.",
          "There was much more space with a 500yen upgrade (400 with the Hakone pass), with indoor seating and a separate open air top deck for viewing. The 'cruise' was short and unfortunately the clouds meant we didnt see anything of Fuju san but the views must be amazing on a clear day.",
          "This is part of the Hakone loop and is really beautiful. Too cloudy for Mount Fuji but still worth doing, as the scenery is lovely. Do the boat trip across then walk round the lake to the shrine.",
          "Although distance from either Shinjuku or Tokyo Station by train is a bit far (Around 2.5 to 3 hours), where you have to change train twice and again change to Hakone Ropeway (Cable Car), the trip is worth going. Our family have reached Togendai Station right at the shore of",
          "The bus service runs very regularly to Lake Ashi where the 'pirate ship' takes you across the lake to the ropeways which take you higher up the hillside. We were fortunate to get a glimpse of Mount Fuji during the crossing but were later rewarded with an even better view at the",
          "Lake Ashi itself is lovely. A caldera lake (elevation 723metres above mean sea level), it is surrounded by steep mountains that are thickly wooded. The air is fresh and cool. The brochures say that Mt Fuji should be visible (in the northwest direction) from the southern shore.",

          "The boat trip, walk through the cedars. Also the check point all very interesting. Everyone is so very friendly. Loved the play. Just walk and enjoy.",
          "We visited Hakone using the Hakone free pass which covered the train ride from Odawara station to Hakone-Yumoto station, the Tozen cable car, ropeway, buses and sailing ship on Lake Ashi. From Tokyo to Odawara, we used the JR pass on JR trains. We took a sightseeing cruize on",
          "Definitely worth trying out the pirate ship. A bit cliche, but overall interesting experience and different view of Lake Ashi.",
          "We took a return boat journey on Lake Ashi. The boats operating the trips are very atmospheric and the views across the lake, the woodland and the magnificent properties along the lake\u2019s shore make for a relaxing trip.",
          "We hiked from Hakone to the lake. Duration there and back: 3h way up and 2h way down. The first hour up is on the road so not very enjoyable with the high way over you. However, once you reach the old paved Tokaido road, it is a nice forest walk, you go through a river, very",

          "We bought the Hakone discount pass for 3 days the equivalent of $65 nz approx. This gave you unlimited trips on bus, ropeway ,cable car the pirate ship on Lake Ashi. Nice walk around the waterfront in old palace grounds and cedar tree walk to shrine. Fun boat trip!",
          "Great views from the Motohakone-Ko part of the lake. There\u2019s not much to see in the ferry to the other end but it does take you to the ropeway where you get more great views.",
          "Gorgeous lake with plenty of attractions surrounding it. Hakone Shrine is the perfect place to snap good photos capturing the area\u2019s beauty. It wasn\u2019t terribly crowded when we were there, but it can get a bit chaotic at Motohakone - where the sightseeing cruise takes off from .",
          "The boat ride across Lake Ashi is a lovely experience. We caught the second ferry of the morning (large pirate like ship) and it wasn't overly crowded. The water was calm and the scenery was beautiful. When you board make your way up to the top level for optimal views and to",

          "The Lake Ashi cruise should not be missed if you have the 72 hour Hakone Free Pass. I definitely got more than what I paid for when I did the whole Hakone Tozan Train-Ropeway-Gondola-Pirate Ship Cruise (to and from Togendai). It was fun. (I love lakes!) I do however want to",

          "We rode on \"Pirates Boat\" to enjoy this beautiful lake. The lake water was clear and clean. The air mountain also very fresh, and of course the scenery was amazing. If you like photography, then you must visit this place to take as much as possible the beautiful scenery.",
          "Such a beautiful spot. We walked round the lake to the shrine, used the opportunity to take many wonderful photos. Almost impossible to take a bad one. The shops are close, plus food available from several outlets. Visit the historic Change Station and walk through the forest.",

          "We rode on one of the \u201cpirate\u201d boats. It wasn\u2019t a long ride but a pleasant trip. There\u2019s a small snack bar and you can sit inside if it\u2019s chilly. The shores are mostly forested but there are a couple Shinto shrines that you pass.",

          "This is a beautiful lake. We bought all inclusive tickets which allowed us to take the bus to the lake, go on the boats, rope car, cable car and local trains back to Yugawara. The tickets cost 4,000 yen each, which I think was extremely cheap for what we were able to",

          "We have visited Lake Ashi on a sunny day in April. There was a strong wind what made it quite cold. The lake is beautiful and from a few spots you can see Mount Fuji. Around the lake there are a few restaurants and shops. The bakery is good and haves a nice view on the lake.",

          "The lake itself is nothing special in my opinion. What is really nice to see is the Mount Fuji, however make sure you visit the lake on a clear day otherwise your visit here is not worth it. We took the cable car to the lake then the boat to Hakone moto where we found an amazing",
          "Wonderful lake. It is something special. It is possible also to make a little cruise on a pirate boat an see many different places in few minutes. Unfortunately wasn't impossible to me to see the Fuji san but I appreciate it anyway",

          "Enjoyed the cruise across the lake. It was a bit over cast, so we weren\u2019t able to see Fuji, but still worth the trip for the beautiful scenery.",
          "Amazing views, Check. Incredible Hotels, check. Museums, definitely must see. Experience 100% recommended. One of the most beautiful landscape towns we got to see in our visit to this amazing country.",
          "Lake Ashi is so beautiful with Mount Fuji located in the background. We stayed at Prince hotel, Hakone and had some of the best views if Lake ashi. Sunrise and sunset are just so perfect looking at mt Fuji and lake ashi.",
          "We came on a not so clear day, but the lake was the most beautiful part of the round trip excursion in Hakone. On a clear day, the views of Fuji must be spectacular and brilliant. On a not so clear day, the lake itself is a treasure. Worth the visit.",
          "We did a quick trip in the morning because stormy weather forecast early afternoon. Were still caught in passing showers and wind strong enough to blow away umbrella. Hakone Shrine, Hakone Checkpoint and park are nice places to walk around. There are walking trails along the",
          "Beautiful here. Don\u2019t forget to buy the Hakone pass well in advance as it is entirely worth it to use cable cars, bus, local trains, ropeway, and cruise.",
          "Great area, the gondola ride over the crater was wonderful, the sulfur smell is quite strong, then the gondola ride to the lake side was beautiful, then boarded the pirate ship to the other side of the lake",
          "Amazing site, you feel so closed from nature. The mix for color of the lake and the vegetation are amazing and the few spots where you can see Mont Fuji make an incredible experience.",
          "Mt Fuji in the distance, dense greenery, quiet peace and a brilliant blue lake.... lovely! It was raining when we visited, and it assumed a poignancy of its own - romantic and reclusive.",
          "The journey was the point, antique train, then cable car, then gondola were all fun with amazing views. We went over a smoking volcanic area on the gondola and were graced by a brief view of \"shy\" Mt Fuji. Thrilling. Didn't take the boat across the lake as we got there too late.",
          "The lake was nice. We rode a boat across the lake (the line was a bit long). The air was cool in the summer, due to the altitude.",
          "Majestical feeling & views, we came from Kyoto but it was worth the trip You can fill a day here possibly 2 or 3",
          "We took a ride around the lake with the pirate ship. The kids are loving it. The ship is big enough that we don't feel too crowded. If you want to get to the front of the ship (and pose like in Titanic) and have a photo spot for yourself, you might want to take the VIP class",
          "We almost skipped going to the lake because we were short on time, only having stopped overnight in Hakone briefly. So glad we didn\u2019t!! It is beautiful!",
          "Great for whole family. Windy during Summer season but worth to see the City of Hakone from the Lake.",
          "Nice views sometimes but if clouds roll in not much to see. Pleasant boat ride but ours was a bit short. The lake is dotted with fake tourist old style Japanese sailing ships. Homie duck paddle boats. Experience is nice and you may get a view of the mountain but mostly",
          "I had read very good reviews about the boat ride across the lake. Unfortunately for us, it was raining. The trip was not pleasant, and there were no views of Mt. Fuji. Not the fault of anyone but just bad luck for us. Maybe next time .....",
          "I always love to cruise, and this was wonderful except for the roaring wind. The sky was clear and the view of Mt. Fuji was spectacular. Lake Ash is a wonderful lake with lots of interesting history. The tour director on the boat told us stories, fables, myths, and history",
          "Our tour took the ropeway down to the lake and then walked to the boat dock. The cruise ship was a catamaran with bleacher seats on the ramp up to the top deck. Unfortunately it was hazy so we could only get hints of Mount Fuji from time to time. In my experience these kind of",
          "We took a boat ride on Lake Ashi! It is very calm and smooth ride. There are beautiful views all around!",
          "As part of the sightseeing route in Hakone, you can take the ferry ride from Hakonemachi-lo or Motohakone-ko to cross Lake Ashi to Togendai-ko. Enjoy the scenery and cooling ride while on the ferry crossing the lake.",
          "Wonderful boat ride across the lake. Check out the Buddha's nearby. Mt. Fuji views and one of the highlights of our trip.",
          "Beautiful lake in the Hakone region, highly recommend taking the boat tour. On a good day you can see Mt Fuji, shops and restaurants around the lake are charming and worth a leisurely stroll",
          "Never felt so close to nature. So beautiful and well kept place, good weekend getaway with kidz. Must visit.",
          "We have found a good idea to plan 2 days in Hakone before moving from Tokyo to Kyoto and it turned out to be a great idea. Biught the hakone pass, for 5k yen and treveled with the ropeway, enjoyed the boat ride, and toured on the side of Lake Ashi. Can only recommend!",
          "Cruise is beautiful and the journey took about 30mins. I took the cruise at Togendai-Ko to HakoneMachi-ko. The cruise is like a pirate ship with lower internal deck and upper open air deck. If you want fresh air, It would be nice to be on the upper deck but seats are limited.",
          "Most scenic place. The snow peaked Mt Fuji looks like a wonder of the world. Worth staying in this area for a couple of days to relax in peace.",
          "Did a cruise across the lake on a pirate ship it was very cold when we did this cruise and too much cloud on the mountain to see it, but ok and fun got dropped off at the other side go the lake would recommend if you have time",
          "This is a magical place, without knowing to much about the Shintoism you can fill the spirit and harmony between mother nature and men. Beautiful landscapes and peacefull environment will let you escape from reality and feel the connection and purpose of the creation, is a must",
          "We enjoyed the quiet location as we stayed overnight beside the lake. By around 5pm all the day trippers had disappeared and we had the area around the lakeside to ourselves. Also a good view of Mt Fuji although we got much closer views during our drive into the Japanese alps",
          "We were rushed onto a boat for a 15 minute tour of the lake with no explanation of what we were seeing. I thought it was more interesting watching the carp beside the dock while waiting to get onto the boat, This boat took us to the ropeway which was the next part of our tour,",
          "The lake is not huge, but it is in a nice setting--very forested (deep greer) and \"civilization\" is only at the two ends of the lake. There is a boat ride available that is on a \"funky\" modern pirate ship that the Japanese refer to as a \"Viking ship\" for no apparent reason!",
          "We had lunch at the bakery overlooking the lake and then used our all day pass (well worth the 4000 yen) to board the pirate boat for a trip to the other end of the lake. The boat is well designed with plenty of space on the upper decks to get photos but also plenty of seating",
          "The lake is beautiful surrounded by green trees. It is really a pleasant place. The buildings at the ferry are just like European style. The journey of taking the pirate ship was very good! You can even see the Mount Fuji during nice weather.",
          "This is a nice, pretty make, with some pleasant walking. However, much of the walk along the east side of the river is along quite unpleasant roads which can get very busy.",
          "Lake is just like you see in the brochure books. Lovely and easy trip across the lake and so beautiful. Love the experience",
          "We went for a cruise on Lake Ashi in one of the pirate ships. It was a sunny day and the lake was calm. There are beautiful views across the lake and the surrounding hills. It was a lovely experience.",
          "It\u2019s a lake with a backdrop of Mount Fiji. There are fishermen dotted around...lots of trees to the waters edge and you can take a 50 minute trip on a fake galleon...it\u2019s okay.",
          "We were very lucky that we saw Mount Fuji on our first day when we walk around the lake on our first day in Hakone. It was simply beautiful. The Hakone sightseeing boat ( or pirate boat as it is in Japanese) takes you cross the lake within 30 minutes, the fare is included in",
          "Taking the sightseeing cruise across Lake Ashi, it's a great way to see Mt. Fuji. Really enjoy the trip.",
          "The Lake Ashi is enormous and it was such an amazing experience to be on a large 'French Ship' and cruising down the lake surrounded by amazing snow covered mountains. Its a MUST DO when you are here.",
          "Relaxing 25 minute traverse of the lake from end to end, with phone ops along the way, including the famous Mount Fuji, if the clouds allow. Part of the Hakone Loop.",
          "The boat ride across the lake was pleasant. Nothing special. The boat was crowded and we waiting quite a while before boarding.",
          "Enjoyed a cruise on Lake Ashi. The surrounding views were so beautiful. Kudos to the Japanese, they preserve their nature and its clean everywhere. The development around the Lake is controlled and everything worked like clockwork. Lake Toba in Indonesia is bigger but is",
          "We expected to get Fuji view from a boat on the Lake Ashi (that what people said), unfortunately we didn't get it. Just imagine how nice it would be if the sky wasn't cloudy. so, make sure you come along to this site to the same purpose when the sky is clear enough. Better to go",
          "Walked alongside the lake and took a boot back.Very good and nice view of mount Fuiji. Wortwhile a visit! Had a good Lunch at bakery and seats with stunning views",
          "We took a water taxi on Lake Ashi to the Hakone Hotel. The boat was a supposed to be a galleon, but was a bit of fun really! The views were less than exciting because a heavy mist descended over the lake and swathed everything to the extent that we could see very little. I am",
          "good day at lake ashi, everything look so serene and beautiful. We went in april, and the fog made it even prettier",
          "We took the Pirate ship (why?) across Lake Ashi and enjoyed the many views of the hills and Mount Fuji.",
          "Visiting Lake Ashi is not about thrills or history, really even; but it is about natural beauty and quiet - both things in fairly short supply on a busy trip. The weather matters a little. It can be quite misty up the mountain, but pleasant on the water. I have only Fuji once,",
          "This small placid lake also gives views of Mt Fuji from a distance. A calm twenty minute boat ride offerd a relaxing break.",
          "If one visits Hakone, Lake Ashi is a must visit place, very scenic and lively to walk around with lot of shopping opportunities.",
          "The scenery is fantastic and relaxing as we were on the Viking styled ship we could see the top of mountain Fuji with the snow covering",
          "It was a glorious sunny day when we came here and Lake Ashi sparkled in the sunlight. You can do a sightseeing cruise across Lake Ashi with the Hakone Free Pass. This is a nice way to see the lake from different angles and also to spot Mount Fuji off in the distance.",
          "Took a day round trip with Fuji Hakone Pass - Kawaguchiko to Gotemba (Bus), to Togendai (bus route W), to Hakone Machi port (pirate cruise), to MotoHakone via Cedar Avenue (on foot), to Kowakidani Station (Bus H), to Gora (via Hakone Tozan Rail), to Souzan, Owakudani (Ropeway)",
          "It is a relaxing and stunning spot to spend some quiet time. The wind was heavy and we could not go on the boat ride though",
          "The view is just amazing. You can sit and relax while admiring the view or you can hike going to the nearby shrine. We went to this place as part of our Hakone Free Pass. You\u2019ll see people fishing or sit having coffee. It\u2019s a good way to take in the wonderful view and just take",
          "Weather did not favor us during our Hakone stay. We took the Hakone circuit on a very rainy day and that meant that the views during the boat ride were non-existent. A pity!",
          "We were on the boat for approx 15 mins. It was a sunny day but quite chilly so standing on the deck was not pleasurable. There were too many people on the boat and it was difficult to see out of the windows. There was a commentary but no-one could hear it.",
          "We went on a 30 mins boat ride, it was really nice to see mt Fuji from a different angle. It was lovely to see some cherry blossoms from the boat as well, the views were amazing.",
          "Unfortunately when we were here it was foggy, damp and a little miserable so no sightings of the elusive Mt Fuji, but I can imagine it\u2019s quite beautiful when the weather is good. Our guide stated that you would be very lucky to get good clear views so have low expectations and",
          "A cruise from Hakone Machi Kou to Togendai in a large vessel. Go for the first class if you want the best views. In Togendai get on the Ropeway for a 28 minute ride to Sounzan for spectacular views of Mount Fuji.",
          "Lovely views along the way. Comfortable and well arranged. Was a little crowded. But still worth it to do the round trip.",
          "Whilst staying in Tokyo, Hakone was a great day trip out of the city. We were fortunate enough to go on a clear day so we had some great views of Mount Fuji. If Not a clear day you may be disappointed as I don\u2019t think our day trip would have been as enjoyable if we couldn\u2019t see",
          "Came to Lake Ashi on a beautiful sunny day. Arrived to board a nice pirate boat ride. On the boat we seen beautiful picturesque views of water and mountains .",
          "On a beautiful day this is a must do. Buy tickets to ride a boat across the lake and enjoy the scenery. On a clear day you can get some great shots of Mt. Fuji. Theirs shops and exhibits along the lake shores so you could make a day of it.",
          "Love the lake. Boat for leisure as well as small paddle boats to enjoy the lake. Very nice pathways next to the lake. Nice for relaxing with family and friends",
          "Lake Ashi is a volcano crater lake and has black sand beaches. Even though it was windy, the lake was calm and smooth sailing. Great wAy to spend 40 minutes. Great for photographers.",
          "As quite a random attraction in a mountain lake in Japan, the pirate ship cruises prove a fun way to cross the lake, on a clear day the views of Fuji are quite spectacular, and the pirate ship is fun, particularly for children. It's a long trip from Tokyo for just this, so make",
          "The view is not particularly stunning unless it is a clear sunny day and you can see mount Fuji. Anyway, it is a comfortable ride. Worth trying.",
          "Really gorgeous trip on the pirate ship like boat. Get the free pass so it\u2019s cheaper. Not a lot to look at on the way but a relaxing time.",
          "We took the cruise around Lake Ashi what a beautiful view of the lake and the mountains surrounds it was cold unfortunately but we still enjoyed the view from inside.",
          "Nice trip, a day well spent. Unfortunately the time of year was unlucky, the vegetation was mainly still dormant from winter. We took a trip on the cruise, which was also nice, but not truely special. Worth for the day, but no WOW.",
          "We really enjoyed this day ... the train ride in the way was a little squishy but worth the cable car ride, views of Mt Fuji and beautiful boat cruise. The Hakone Free pass was excellent value and we were lucky enough to be there on a clear spring day, so the views were",
          "We did the full route from Gora over the ropeway and down to Lake Ashi. Both definitely recommended. Views were amazing (you need it to be a clear day to see Fuji) Can recommend Hakone Tent as a place to stay right by Gora Station and traditional Japanese style!",
          "A must do in Hakone, it takes you from Togendai to the other side where Hakone Shrine and all the other touristy spots including to the longest rope bridge in Japan.. The cruise ship has a guide, it\u2019s mostly crowded though but is a nice experience.. If you are purchasing the",
          "The village on the lake is so pretty and with an amazing view of Mount Fuji in the background. You can sit in the caf\u00e9 and enjoy a cup of tea or coffee while looking at the iconic mountain in the background.",
          "We were there on a tour--day trip to Mt Fuji and Lake Ashi and bullet train. SO owrth the trip as Lake Ashi is absolutely gorgeous! Take the gondola up to the top of the mountain and the views are unbelievable!",
          "We enjoyed it! Took a fun boat and experience the other size with amazing food and a view. I would recommend visiting if you have time.",
          "The boat was a lovely activity. Pay the little extra and get nice seats in first class (or you can buy the ticket on the boat)",
          "We had high expectations of this area - but it turns out that the only great part was the fabulous view of Mt Fuji once you've crossed the Lake to the other side. Maybe it was because we were off-season, but we found the area under-developed in terms of signage (very little in",
          "We took the Romancecar from Shinjuku, Tokyo which took 80 minutes to get to Hakone and then the Mountain Railway and cable car over sulphur springs and down to the lake. All booked at the Odakyu travel desk in Shinjuku station and not expensive (one pass covers all). The lake is",
          "Loved the ambience. The pirate cruise and the view of mt.Fuji was amazing.. the mountain is a little far though but had breathtaking views",
          "It's definitely worth taking one of the cruises across Lake Ashi. The views are lovely, especially if you get to see Mt Fuji. It can very get cold and windy during winter though, but we braved it anyway to stand on the open air deck.",
          "Taking bus opposite Hakone-Yumoto using Hakone Free Pass will bring you to Motohakone. There you will see the beautiful Lake Ashi. You will need to walk a while to see the famous Torii Gate that sits in the lake. I visited the lake in mid Dec, the weather is cooling and scenery",
          "A wonderful place to experience, the landscape surrounding Lake Ashi is naturally gorgeous. Provided you have the Hakone Free Pass, I highly recommend taking the ship across the lake, then taking a stroll along the edge, to the park and shrines. Considering I was there in",
          "We traveled from Tokyo to Hakone hoping to see My. Fuji. Unfortunately, we didn't that day but Lake Ashi at sunset was still absolutely beautiful. I'll never forget that view of the lighted up tori gate on the lake.",
          "This is a gorgeous lake and you can take a cruise on a \"pirate ship\" too. If the weather is kind and the surroundings are clear, you may catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji in the distance.",
          "We took the pirate ship like how tourists are supposed to do it... I must say, the ship does look a bit cheesy. Ride was all, but didn't have a good seat so no good views. I didn't see Fuji San at all.",
          "Obviously a view one has to see, when visiting Japan. The Majestic Fuji San peeking in over surrounding hills on lake Ashi. In a way a pity the experience is so sterile. I do not want any noisy on-lake activities but some nice terraced cafe's , taverne's, would be nice. The",

There\u2019s also a lovely art museum nearby as well that has beautiful modern Japanese art. It feels a bit like the Lake District in England.",
          "We cruised across the lake on the \"pirate\" boat, which was comfortable with free wifi. The lake and surrounding forest with shrine and other structures were pretty, plus we could see Mt. Fuji shrouded in clouds.",
          "Lake Ashinoko is breathtaking! We found the trip from Tokyo a bit difficult and lengthy though and it\u2019s more of a relaxing area so if you\u2019re after a bit more action I would only stay here for one to two days....very nice change though from a busy trip to Japan",
          "We take the pirate ship cruise. Perhaps I have high expectations of the scenery so I am a bit disappointed. We can\u2019t see the Fujiyama from the boat ride.",

          "The scenery was beautiful although limited due to the clouds and rain. As the boat looks like a pirate boat children might enjoy the ride.The ride was smooth and it was easy to get on and off.",
          "We took the ferry and enjoyed the scenic view of the lake. It is worth taking the trip to have a tranquil cruise and enjoy the beautiful view of the lake and Mount Fuji.",
          "A really enjoyable cruise on the pirate ship on Lake Ashinoko. It\u2019s amazing to think this body of water was formed after a volcanic eruption that occurred more than 3000 years ago! The cruise is very relaxing and tranquil and definitely good worth doing. Like most transport",
          "There are 3 different cruise boats in Lake Ashi and we managed to try 2 of them (Victory and Wasa). There is quite a bit of history around this lake and you can hear some of the synopsis while cruising on the boat. Just so pleasant to stop and visit the nearby places and then",
          "Hop on one of the lake\u2019s cruise boats to enjoy the lovely setting and hop off to explore several small villages. A great way to spend an afternoon.",
          "After a disappointing no show Mt Fuji, it was a relieved to see that the cruise along Lake Ashi went ahead with no clouds and mountains along the side were lush green and beautiful (we went late September). It was a short (15 minute) cruise to get to the ropeway. Be sure to go",
          "A good visit to the lake and its surrounding environment. The weather although is always raining but it didn't dampen our interest to visit the lake. There were many visitors when I was visiting there.The air was cool and the scenary of the place is really nice and peaceful",
          "Took a three stop boat ride which was very pleasant with helpful crew. You can choose to stay on the boat or get off and board again in during their next stop. Recommended.",
          "Unfortunately we still didn't see the top of Mt Fuji but The Jolly Roger is an excellent trip in beautiful peaceful surroundings. We had been up to the crater top on Mt Kamiyama and descended by cable car, then went aboard what looked like a fantastic pirate ship out of Pirates",
          "Very peaceful lake with ferries and supposedly great view of Mount Fuji. Unfortunately, the weather wasn't kind to us and the view was just of clouds - and more clouds / fog. Regardless, it is a peaceful tour and well worth the visit for families with kids.",
          "We've spent a few days in hakone and had saved the lake for the really sunny day - to really make the most of it. In all honesty it wasn't quite what we expected. It was entirely pleasant - the pirate ship, a stroll around motohakone, etc. - but it was all very quiet and smaller",
          "I enjoyed the cruise around Lake Ashi, after taking the ropeway over the mountains. It is a pretty lake & a nice way to view Mt Fuji (if the weather is kind to you, as it is often partially or mostly covered by cloud). If I had more time, I'm sure stopping to visit the shrine",
          "We used the unusual Pirate boat to cross the lake to the Hakone Rope-way, which gave great views across the Lake. We also walked along the shore as well as visited several small parks. Very well worth the visit.",
          "Great journey on the lake with super views. On a good day you get a view of Mount Fuji too! We were lucky and clouds dispersed giving a super views.",
          "If you want the iconic photo of Fuji and the tori gate with the lake as a backdrop, you can't miss taking the ferry across the lake. From there take the rope way up to owakudani.",
          "We were staying in Hakone and paid 4000 yen for an all day transportation pass. It included this boat ride and we did it. Just a pleasant 30 mins ride across a mountain Lake. You see the Otorii Gate for the Hakone shrine standing in water as well as another little",
          "Will visit again as is a nice place. Raining make me disappointed for my hakone trip.. Hope to see you soon.",
          "We took a boat ride on the lake. It was rather empty and very tranquil. The lake had many recreational opportunities for large and small.",
          "If you have the Hakone Freepass with you, this cruise is a must to ride! There are 3 different pirate ships & depends on your luck on which ship you get to ride on~ It was a cloudy day with on & off rain in Hakone. We didn't get to see Fuji-san with the clouds in the way on the",

          "Lake Ashi is a scenic lake in Hakone area known for its views of Mount Fuji and its hot springs. We did a cruise of Lake Ashi while returning from Gotemba Peace Park. It was a short cruise of about 20 minutes, unfortunately it was raining and very cloudy not allowed us any view",
          "We took a cruise around lake Ashi. It's a beautiful lake. If you are lucky you can see Mt Fuji from the cruise but we weren't that lucky that day !!!!",
          "Excellent, a short cruise on a beautiful lake. We did it as part of our tour. A really beautiful place.",
          "It's OK and worth going on the cablecar ropeway if not too cloudy but nothing really here. Restaurants are poor and some weren't even open when we got here early. Not very good. Starts to get SO busy too on ropeway around 11am so we were glad we did it early and out the way",
          "We took the short boat ride from the Hakone Kojiri terminal to Hakone-en. There are restrooms on board. Lake Ashinoko is a crater lake. The ride is relaxing and the scenery of lake and mountains is awe-inspiring.",
          "Nice scenic cruise in a large ferry with a comfortable interior lounge with recorded bilingual narration of what you're passing by. You'll see both fishing and pleasure boats on the lake, and a couple of bright orange Tori Gates (traditionally mark the entrance to Shinto",

          "Enjoying the breeze of the mountain and lake wind while riding the pirate cruise is the best, you can enjoy the surrounding ocean of trees in any season, it's highly recommended to come here in autumn, when all the leaves are turning color and will become a hills of colours",

          "this is the lake that the Hakone Shrine has a view of. Its quite chilly if you chose to take the Pirate Ship. Dress appropriately and hope for a great view of Mt. Fiji while on the lake.",
          "Lake Ashi is a peaceful and tranquil lake surrounded by mountains in the background and a postcard perfect body of water. I arrived there just in time for the Hakone sightseeing cruise and luckily I was able to secure a ticket and joined the cruise. Lake Ashi offers a good",
          "We took a brief boat ride on Lake Ashi. It was quite enjoyable and relaxing. You're surrounded by beautiful scenery along the shoreline. Even better was the cable car ride up Kamagatake Mountain; from there you have incredible views of Mount Fuji. It just happened to be a clear",
          "We have done a lovely boat trip across lake Ashi to Hakone ropeway. Beautiful enjoyable ride that we have loved.",
          "Here at the Lake no one would realise the millions of people that live on Japan's islands. This a great scenic spot no matter what the weather. There are many acticities that can occupy the tourist if admiring the view doesn't appeal.A natural wonder to be enjoyed.",
          "The lake itself is a nice small lake. very peaceful. However the boat across the lake was over crowded with not enough sitting spots. Again it felt mostly like we were being herd around from one place to other. Maybe the place and the pace are different in other seasons but I",
          "Our hotel was on the lake, but because of the rain and mist, you couldn't see it. When there were gaps in the weather it looked very picturesque. It is also supposed to have a great view of Mount Fuji - not when we were there. Check the weather before you go.",
          "We boarded the boat after riding the Cablecar (ropeway) and the smooth journey around the lake was very relaxing. The scenery was lovely.",
          "We got the Hakone Day Pass from Tokyo and went here on a day trip. Due to the weather we didn't see Mt Fuji so it was basically just a boat ride. Luckily we saw Mt Fuji on the train journey to Hakone so on the train keep a look out as it might be the best view of Mt Fuji that",
          "We boarded this mock sailing cutter to take a short trip around this lake which is very popular with tourists and locals. There were at least 6/8 ships plying there trade around the Lake whilst we were doing our trip. Interesting",
          "This not the most inspiring boat trip on a pseudo pirate ship. There is not a lot to see apart from some waterside development and one shinto gate on the water's edge. There is limited inside seating so if the weather is inclement you could end up being cold or wet.",
          "The lake is beautiful and on clear day you can see Mount Fuji. You might want to ride the sightseeing cruise (part of Hakone Pass or Fuji Hakone Pass).",

          "the view of the lake was nice frm the ropeway. There wasnt much at the Togendai stop thou. So hop on the pirate ship and head to the other 2 stops. Special mention: Head to the Motohakone-ko and eat the best curry bun i have ever eaten from Bakery & Table. its not cheap at",
          "The famous Landmark here is the Hakone Shrine. it is sitting at the edge of the Lake. very ideal for your instagram picutre. and i am sure a lot of photo was taken at the back of the Shrine. We tool the regular boat cruise which lasted abut 35 mins but we did not get to see",
          "Fun take to ride the pirate boats across the lake. MT Fuji , and the toro gate make for some fun picture taking",
          "Picturesque, but not the best of the big 5. When i went it was too chopping to go on the sightseeing cruise. The nearby Hakone shrine is a must go!",

          "Went on the boat crossing of Lake Ashi using our Hakone pass. The boats are made like old galleons, and make three stops on the round trip but you can get off at any stop. They tend to get very busy especially with tour groups. There is a bar selling cold and hot drinks, and",
          "We were part of a tour group that took a very short ride, one stop, along Lake Ashi. Picture perfect adds make the lake look surreal and tout it to be crystal clear but neither it nor the boat ride were anything to write home about. Also, there were lots of swan paddle boats",

          "Well situated for mountainous views. What a shame that it poured with rain on the day of our visit, we still enjoyed it but we didn't see it at its best. A lone fisherman made a good photo and we all chatted on the ferry which was clean and we'll run. A good day out and worth",
          "We went on the lake cruise after a tour of the area with the hope to see Mount Fuji but unfortunately nothing as it was far too cloudy. The boat is a kind of gimmicky pirate boat including said pirate but it got us where we wanted in about 30 minutes. Would I do it again? I"

        "wiki": "Hakone (\u7bb1\u6839\u753a, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of June 2012, the town had an estimated population of 13,492, and a population density of 145 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi). Hakone has been designated as a Japanese National Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Network.\nHakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mt. Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nOdawara\nYugawara\nMinami-ashigaraShizuoka Prefecture\n\nGotemba\nSusono\nMishima\nOyama\nKannami\n\n\n== History ==\nHakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the Hakone Checkpoint (\u7bb1\u6839\u95a2\u6240, Hakone sekisho), which formed the border of the Kant\u014d region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T\u014dkaid\u014d were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons.\nAfter the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake.\nAfter merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active \u014cwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights.\nHakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art.\nMajor events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T\u014dkaid\u014d road.\nOne famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods.\nA noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi.Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town. In 2017, Hakone was included as one of 88 anime pilgrimage sites for 2018 by the Anime Tourism Association. In 2020, new decorations have been introduced to the city in the anticipation of the release of the final film of the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nHakone Tozan Railway\nHakone Tozan Cable Car\nHakone Ropeway\nIzuhakone RailwayOdawara and Mishima, the terminus of the Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, 70 minutes from Shinjuku, Tokyo.

From G\u014dra, the terminus of Hakone Tozan Line, the Hakone Tozan Cable Car funicular goes to S\u014dunzan. \u014cwakudani can be reached by Hakone Ropeway from Sounzan and the lake, while the lake is crisscrossed by cartoonishly decorated \"pirate\" ships for tourists. There is also Hakone Komagatake Ropeway, which goes to the top of Mount Komagatake.\nA popular \"Hakone Free Pass\", allowing unlimited use of most forms of transport for several days, is available.

          "Some very interesting pottery pieces from Japan, Korea and Pakistan, and although the trees were still green, the garden was also a delight. If you have a moss problem in your lawn back home, then think again, just say to the neighbours you have a Japanese theme going on!",
          "I chose to visit this place instead of the Hakone Open-Air Art Museum, pretty much on a whim. Their collection is nice enough, with artifacts from a wide range of Japanese history and a few other Asian cultures. Most memorable in my mind were the giant, human-sized jars. It",

          "For many people, the attraction here will largely lie in the exceptionally beautiful gardens. Part of them consist of a shady moss-covered area and part of a more formal display of Japanese shrubs and trees. The whole thing amounts to what I think is the best small garden I",

          "This is not a large museum, having 5 rooms of historical pottery from across time and countries. There are some gems here - the Jamon period pots, particularly. It won't take long to tour the building but the garden is worth a visit too. Moss laden and dense with maples, it is",

        "wiki": "Hakone (\u7bb1\u6839\u753a, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of June 2012, the town had an estimated population of 13,492, and a population density of 145 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi). Hakone has been designated as a Japanese National Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Network.\nHakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mt. Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nOdawara\nYugawara\nMinami-ashigaraShizuoka Prefecture\n\nGotemba\nSusono\nMishima\nOyama\nKannami\n\n\n== History ==\nHakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the Hakone Checkpoint (\u7bb1\u6839\u95a2\u6240, Hakone sekisho), which formed the border of the Kant\u014d region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T\u014dkaid\u014d were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons.\nAfter the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake.\nAfter merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active \u014cwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights.\nHakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art.\nMajor events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T\u014dkaid\u014d road.\nOne famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods.\nA noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi.Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town. In 2017, Hakone was included as one of 88 anime pilgrimage sites for 2018 by the Anime Tourism Association. In 2020, new decorations have been introduced to the city in the anticipation of the release of the final film of the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nHakone Tozan Railway\nHakone Tozan Cable Car\nHakone Ropeway\nIzuhakone RailwayOdawara and Mishima, the terminus of the Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, 70 minutes from Shinjuku, Tokyo.

From G\u014dra, the terminus of Hakone Tozan Line, the Hakone Tozan Cable Car funicular goes to S\u014dunzan. \u014cwakudani can be reached by Hakone Ropeway from Sounzan and the lake, while the lake is crisscrossed by cartoonishly decorated \"pirate\" ships for tourists. There is also Hakone Komagatake Ropeway, which goes to the top of Mount Komagatake.\nA popular \"Hakone Free Pass\", allowing unlimited use of most forms of transport for several days, is available. Hakone Free Pass can be bought at Shinjuku Station, Odawara Station, any other chief station along Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, Hakone-Yumoto Station, G\u014dra Station, any other chief station along Hakone Tozan Line, S\u014dunzan Station, T\u014dgendai Station, Sengoku-Annaijo Bus Stop, Moto-Hakone Port, Hakone-Machi Port, and JR Gotemba Station Bus Information.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nHakone Shind\u014d\nJapan National Route 1\nJapan National Route 138\n\n\n== Education ==\nPrivate schools:\n\nKanrei Shirayuri Gakuen Junior/Senior High School\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n - T\u014dyako, Hokkaid\u014d, since July 4, 1964\n - Jasper, Alberta, Canada from July 4, 1972\n - Taupo, New Zealand, from October 7, 1987\n - St. Moritz, Switzerland, from November 2, 2014 (Friendship City)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Hakone travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nOfficial Website (in Japanese)\nHakone Portal Website\n Geographic data related to Hakone at OpenStreetMap",

          "After you leave the tram the park is close at hand next to an interesting museum. Go to both. If your fortunate to have gotten off the tram at the station next to the museum you can tour it first and then walk through the park from top to bottom. Much easier walking downhill.",
          "We happened in this as a result of traveling on the ropeway train. As well as beautiful gardens there are art museums and displays. We spent a while watching the glass blowers at work - very hot and very talented!",

          "The different gardens are beautiful . At the top of the hilled garden is a beautiful fountain. The view of the Hakone mountain is great. We also visited during a possible eruption warning and could see the fumes from the mountain. Nice place to visit.",
          "This is an unique park in Japan. This garden is unique because it is the only existing example of a formal French garden from the Meiji Era (1868-1912) and the Taisho Era (1912-1926). It is a western and a Japanese garden and is harmonious. It has a very nice tropical flora",
          "We got off the cable car one stop before the bottom to visit the park. Some really interesting plants in the greenhouse, a variety of different types of garden, beautiful flowers, a fountain, ancient cedar tree, a view of the surrounding area, a tea house, a cafe, restrooms and",
          "My second visit to Gora Park. May is probably not the best time to visit as plants are not at their best at this time. But I still enjoyed it. Don't miss the hot houses or the lovely tea house - almost hidden from view. Yes, they even serve traditional tea here at certain",
          "If you like gardens then this uphill walk is worth it. Lovely example of Japanese garden and two cafes, glass blowing studio, pottery studio, gift shop",

          "Nice garden to have a stroll around. The craft shops have some really nice stuff for sale. One specialises in bead work, the other is more glass and ceramics. If climbing hills isn\u2019t your thing, from Gora, catch the cable car to the second stop (OH59) then wander downhill",

          "This park was worth a visit even in winter. There are a number of greenhouses containing beautiful flowers and exotic plants. We also enjoyed experiences in the Craft House - glass blowing and pottery wheel, which while a little expensive, were a great memory to create.",
          "For the price, you should go to Shinjuku gyoen. There is absolutely nothing special about this park and I'm still wondering why I paid 500 yens for it. It's just a random park. With trees. And caf\u00e9s.",
          "If you are on a tight schedule for your Hakone day trip, you can skip this unless you really like gardens and is interested in crafts like glass bead blowing or pottery making. It was a steep 10 min walk along pavements from Gora station. Perhaps in summer when there are",
          "Absolutely stunning park. They have a greenhouse also with many other beautiful plants and flowers of the tropics. But the teal beauty lies outside in \"koyo\". Easily spend 2-3 hours given there is a bog cafe also.",

          "Just by chance found this place. Very nice and clean. Beautiful bonsai trees and sitting areas. We made it for a tea demonstration. Worth the walk and peace",
          "For some reason my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to walk to the open air museum from our hotel. It was god damn hot and literally a 40 minute walk. BUT along this walk we passed through Gora park and enjoyed the lovely fountain, as well as a bunch of flowers. Hakone is gorgeous, this",
          "Free entry if you have Hakone Free Pass. We didn't want to spend too much time at the Garden so we took the Hakone Tozan Train, got off at Kami-Hakone Station and entered the Garden from the West Gate. From the West Gate, we simply walked downhill instead of going uphill.",
          "We were on our way to Gora with the bus but decided to get off bus one stop sooner. The Park was a nice surprise and has a couple of small traditional tea house",
          "We got lucky with the timing because everything was in bloom when we visited the park in late May. Beautiful flowers both in the greenhouse and in the outdoor gardens. The craft house is very interesting as well. There is a cafe with reasonably priced food and drinks, with",
          "A very nice park that slopes down a hillside and has various sections. When we visited in late May, there was a glorious array of many different rose species at the top end of the park. Tucked away at the quieter sides of the upper park are some delightful features with rocks,",
          "We had lunch here and it was relaxing and comfortable. The highlight of the park is the fountain and the trees around it but that's about it. The flowers weren't really in bloom when I went and the park is small and a bit steep (both inside and outside in order to get to the",
          "The park is about 5 minutes walk from Gora Station. However, you need to go up a steep slope to reach the park. I have free entry as I bought the hakone free pass. I was expecting nice and beautiful flowers but unfortunately there isn't much flowers around. The season I went was",
          "There are two fantastic things about the park: price and the well kept garden. On top of that, there is a Tropical Plant House and a Bougainvillea House (greenhouses) to visit even during the cold months. Sandwich restaurant Isshikidosaro offered good cakes and ok coffee at a",

          "Near to Gora and just off OH58 on the Hakone Tozan Cable Car this park is a little gem with a couple of cafes and a superb craft workshop. The gardens are small however delightful.",
          "Hakone has some wonderful garden areas - I think the Museum of Art garden is better than this - however Gora Park has lots of colour and light, which can make it a welcome change from the more shaded style of Japanese gardens. It is great to have a small tea house garden set",
          "We stopped here after the Hakone Museum of Art and were very glad we did. We had delicious sandwiches in the cafe by the western style fountains, and enjoyed the flowers in the conservatories. The outdoor gardens were in winter mode so they were a little sparse. There is no",
          "It is a very historic and nice park in Gora. Next door is the Itoh by Nobu restaurant. If you drive it is not difficult to reach at all. If you don't it is about 10 minutes from Gora station. Nice setting, scenery and buildings. The cafe is pretty cozy.",
          "there were in fact not much to offer for this park. the only signature thing was the water fountain, which was in fact a typical one. to enhance attractiveness of the park, there were workshop on pottery and glass-making, which were mostly for kids. please note the park in",

          "Luckily we had read the reviews where you get off at the upper end of the park and walked down through the park otherwise the walk could be very steep. We visited during early Autumn so there wasn't much colour but it was still a great place to spend an hour wondering around.",
          "Our hotel is located near Gora Park. As we arrived late hotel staff suggested a visit. The park is a delight. Easy walk among the trees and shrubs, with the fall colours of the foliage in display. Had coffee in the cafe next to he fountain.",
          "When we visited the park, we had to walk for about 10 mins from the Gora station. Trekking up an inclined road of about 40 degrees before we reach the park. Unfortunately it was raining at the time of the visit. We still bought tickets and walk round the park to visit, It was",
          "It's a very sweet little park - nestled in the middle of Gora. The fountain is all very scenic and good for a couple of photos but things that really stand out for me are the rose garden and the craft house. The rose garden is a stunning array of roses from all over (someone had",

          "A great way to pass an hour or two around Hakone. Best to get off cable car at Koen-Kami and walk to top entrance, then it is all down hill. 550 yen entry fee. Afterwards stroll to Gora station to get back down the mountain. Roses were spectacular.",
          "We visited this place on a rainy day with our Hakone Day pass. Entry is free if you have the day pass with you. With all the clouds around us, the park had looked very mysterious and beautiful, hiding its secrets and intriguing us enough to explore it. As we walked through the",

          "Walked up through the park which was free with the two day travel pass. Very hot day so got some drinks from the convenience store opposite the bottom entrance and sat by the fountain. There are couple of cafes in the park but we didn't try them. Steep climb up the park and out",

          "Was expecting beautiful cherry blossoms as we went in season, but unfortunately there wasnt any. Pretty beautiful park and you could tell the gardeners had spent a lot of time looking after those plants, but to me it just wasnt worth the entry fee.",
          "Gora Park is quite pleasant and worth visiting. You can access it on your Hakone Paa. There is a picnic area with drinks vending machines. Allow about 30 minutes to walk around it. The layout is good. There is also a craft centre in the park.",

          "Very nice and quiet park, very small as well. Nothing much special, I will say only come here when you have extra time. From my opinion, it is actually better to say in the hotel to enjoy the hotspring lol. One thing to mention is there is a craft house inside the park, if you",
          "Entrance is free with the Hakone Freepass but we all regretted visiting. The garden is set on a hillside and we started at the lower side and had to hike going up. It was winter so only a few patches of winter blooms can be seen. There is a small greenhouse but since we were",
          "Stayed near this garden and used the hakone free pass to enter. The garden is pretty small and perhaps it was winter and the leaves have largely fallen, but I personally felt that the garden was not very impressive not well maintained. Do not recommend this unless you have time",

          "Such a pretty park. Inside is the Crafthouse which is worth a visit. You can make crafts or buy them. There are lots of beautiful plants and a fountain. Features a nice coffee shop. The tracks are not all smooth and it is on a steep hill making it unsuitable for some.",
          "Nice scenery but a small park. I like the flowers and the botanic garden there. Although small but worth to visit. You need to go up the slope at Gora station around 5 min walk. I recommend to go as there are some shops and restaurants that you can go for your lunch there.",
          "It turns out that Japan has another great treasure in addition to the cherry blossoms in the spring, the arrival of hydrangeas blooming in June. We never that that there were so many different varieties of hydrangeas. They are outstanding. This park has greenhouses with various",

          "The shrine at the lake is pretty, you can also admire it from the lake. But they were renovating when I was there. But I liked the little temple at the hill also. The nature, with the old cedars is beautiful.",
          "Hakone is often considered as the most picturesque region of Japan and this shrine is one of the main reasons why. From iconic Torii of peace at the shore of Ashi lake to beautiful lush paths leading to the main building. Highly recommended.",
          "This is definitely the number 1 check in place when you are in Hakone. The shrine is a beauty and stands out from far away.",

          "Hakone Shrine is not far from the harbour. A nice place to go after lunch before we catch the ferry back. I was very impressed by the very tall and massive trees in the area. They are absolutely beautiful! I do wish we had more time to visit the place actually.",
          "The Torii gate on the lake itself was under maintenance when we were there. Nothing special about the shrine. Parking space is available and toilet facilities as well. I thought the gate was over rated. Could be that we went in the evening and the sun was behind it. The photos",
          "Despite being a tourist attraction, this shrine is quite peaceful and serene. The heaven\u2019s gate in the lake is a must-see spot but the surroundings of the shrine itself are also incredible. The pine trees are magnificent and gave you awe.",

          "We went there last November 2018. We booked the Hakone Free Pass from Klook which made our trip easier. The Shrine and the Tori gate is easy to locate. We enjoy walking in the cold weather. However, if you're planning to go there by November, please don't forget to bring your",
          "This is the famous shrine with the iconic Tori gate in the water if you look any picture of Lake Ashi on internet. You can walk from the moto hakone - Ko port where the pirate boat stop. It will take around 20 -30 mins walk to the shrine depends on your pace. It is nice walk",

          "Very easy to walk here from Lake Ashi and really beautiful! Often a line to take photos with the gate in the water, but worth it 100%",

          "you'll see a lot of torri gates in Japan, but this was was really cool b/c it sat on the water. we couldn't get good photos b/c of the time of day and where the light hit, but really enjoyed it. We only went to the gates (short walk 10 min) from where the pirate ship takes off)",
          "If you are coming from Hakone-Yumoto Stn, I would advise taking the bus and depart at Hakone-Jinja-Iriguchi instead of MotoHakone. It is a much shorter walk. I visited early in the morning and it was not as crowded. There were still a line of people queuing to take pictures.",
          "This is probably the most popular side on this side of Lake Ashi, however that makes it incredibly crowded. During our visit there were lines for EVERYTHING, admission, stamps, vending machines, washrooms, the shrine itself and the floating torii gate. The site itself",

          "Hakone shrine will always be in my heart. It is a special place where you find a special gate between human and gods world's, between the shrine path and the Lake Ashi. It is the magical place where my future husband asked me to marry him! It is a very romantic place and unique.",

          "This is a nice spot in the forest. The shrine was nice and not too crowded, you could wash your hands (japanese ritual) in a cool dragon fountain. At the lake is the water torii gate. There was a queue to get a photo there, we could not be bothered to wait. In retrospect, maybe",
          "Most people would probably come here to take a photo with the Torii facing the lake. It's a very scenic shot and there's an orderly line to take a photo, so that's good. Once in front, just ask the person behind you to help snap a few photos (do the same for the person in front",
          "Hakone Shrine was great. I went from Tokyo and took a bullet train to a bus. It took about an hour and a half to get there. You walk through the forest and see the big red arches and walk up the stairs and there is the shrine. A must see when in Hakone.",

          "The shrine is quite large, and home of the famous Torii by the lake. It's a stunning area surrounded by wilderness. If you walk past (coming from the South side) the very intimidating staircase (50 or so steps up), you'll come to where you can get your Goshuin (Temple stamp) at",
          "Japan is steeped in history and this is not to be missed! We found Japan easy to navigate, with many subtitles in English on Street Signs, Trains, and Roadways. Love how they have passed their history down from one generation to the next!",

          "Very orderly, queues were formed for photo opportunities. Interesting peek into the architecture and local culture. There were some really old trees around the shrine, close to nature. Could use a little more translation for the write ups around the shrine.",
          "A good 10-15 mins walk from Hakone Machi-ko pier. 1. Interestingly, we need to queue about 15mins (at around 3pm) to take photos at the Torri gate by the lake side. You will hand your camera/phone to the person behind you to take photo for you and it is interesting to observe",
          "Shire is free, but you can purchase items when you are there. The parking lot is somewhat hard to find but with a GPS you will be able to find it easy. It takes about an hour too look at everything. Very nice place to visit, great view of Lake Ashi.",

          "Like everyone else we took the tourist bus here and then walked the forest path to the shrine. There was a queue of people to take a picture with the torii but it was such a beautiful setting it wasn't surprising. The shrine itself was a little further into the woods. There",
          "There were people queuing up for taking a photo at the place. The shrine is beautiful and worth to walk there.",
          "We walked through the Hakone Shrine and it was a very peaceful experience as we were 'tree bathing' in nature. We spent over an hour here and really loved this place. It was our first time to see a typical Japanese Shrine.",
          "May be a little bit of a journey from Tokyo but it's worth the travel. Loads of shopping to do at Hakone Yumoto before you make your way to the shrine to take some beautiful pictures, including the Hakone Shrine Tori Gate. No regrets! :)",
          "The walk to the shrine from the bus stop was quite long but the view that welcomes you is beautiful. The tori gate sitting on the lake is a wonderful site and we had great photos taken all around!",

          "Beautiful, peaceful, serene. A very busy shrine, with lots of steps to climb. But the effort is worth it as it is not only very beautiful, there is just an overall feeling of peace when you get there. In today\u2019s busy lifestyle, places like this are perfect to connect you to",
          "Hakone is not only famous for onsen/hot spring but it also does have other stuff to offer.. It is quite big to explore so I suggest you allocate 2 days, otherwise one day is fine.. One of the best place to visit is the Hakone Shrine, a historical place with an amazing view,",
          "I went with friend, and it was surprisingly in the mist. long stairs to the shrine was unclear to see but lantern guided us to the main location. some Torii gates were standing as the sign of it, and felt the ancient History.",

          "Out of all of the shrines I've visited, this one was my favorite. Why? Because it was surrounded by peaceful nature! I visited a little before sunset and got to see the lights lit up. It was very magical! My only gripe would be the tori gate on the lake. It would have been",
          "Can be seen from hakone pier but really not worth to take too much time there. Nothing much but has those tori gate. LocTed by the sea and you can go really to the edge for a nice scenic photography. Worth to go if u are around there otherwuse dont bother.",
          "At the end of our boat trip on Lake Ashi we disembarked at Motohakone-ko. It was beginning to snow but started walking toward the Hakonejinja (Hakone shrine). It is a short walk and climb (perhaps 100 steps or so) in a beautiful forest which looked lovely as the snowfall picked",

          "Hakone Shrine & Kuzuryu Shrine are two different shrines, FYI. This confused us when we visited. If you want to see the tori gate that is right on Lake Ashi, then the one you want to visit is Hakone Shrine, near Motohakone. The gate is beautiful and a must see if you are in the",

          "I think that people who visit Hakone Shrine needs to be warned of the terrible traffic back and forth (from Hakone-Yumato station). We were stuck in the traffic for over an hour both back and forth due to the single lane roads in the mountains. Naturally, that thwarted our plans",
          "last place of visit in hakone, a lovely shrine, not too busy compared to the more touristy fushimi inari shrine. a place where you can make a pray for your loves ones without being too crowded",
          "There are many things to do in Hakone and time is precious.I would put the Hakone shrine down the list below the Open Air Museum, the Hakone Museum of Art garden in November , Choanji temple and Pola museum of art. We caught the boat from Togendai and got off at",

          "The shrine sits beside a lake with views of Mt Fuji and connects well to a nearby temple. Worthwhile visit and good to pair with seeing other nearby shrines or the onsen (hot springs) about a 30 minute bus journey away.",
          "The area was really beautiful and has lots of paths to walk around and explore. There's an area by the water and then up the hill there is the rest of the shrine.",
          "Beautiful and peaceful. Scenic, lush greenery, combined with beautiful architecture. Temple was undergoing some expansion when I visited, but still a good place to take in the beauty and serenity of ancient Japan.",
          "Made it just in time after the boat ride across the Lake to watch the sunset. Great location to watch the sun set over the lake.",
          "We visited Hakone on a cold rainy day and this place was magical. The shrine up the hill was shrouded in clouds and mist while the torii gate at the bottom overlooked lake Ashi was the perfect spot to sit and take it all in. This shrine was quieter then the rest but was very",
          "You can see this torii gate on the Lake Ashi cruise, beside it there is a smaller torri gate. Its a pretty far walk from the cruise station, took us about 30min from where we alighted after taking the cruise from the Hakone ropeway. However, along the way we walked past",
          "Very pretty and right on Lake Ashi. The views from the shore were amazing and the lake cruse past right by the picture you see in the review.",
          "Very nice and cozy place around this area. Beautiful shrine surrounded by nature and trees. You can walk around the small town in moto-hakone with plenty of small shops for gift and food.",
          "during my first visit, it was misty, i couldnt find the red tori. During my second visit, we got there early in the morning. it was really beautiful and walked in, then i realized, that u can actually drive into the shrine area and park. It should be free parking too. Do",
          "A couple getting married...what a wonderful photo opportunity for a slice of Japanese culture. Great",
          "I lived in Japan for 2 years this is nothing but an ordinary shrine. Maybe good for tourists who visited japan first time.",
          "Too many shrines, temples, monasteries. This was okay, but it was a long way out of the way and, for me at least, not worth the time.",
          "It's a Shinto Shrine by Lake Ashi. I am into photography and it's just the most amazing place for beautiful photos. Even if you are not into photography or spiritual stuff this place is still worth a visit (otherwise why are you visiting Japan?). It's on the must-see list if you",
          "Walking to the shrine alongthe lake is almost mystical. The shrine gate in Lake Ashi is lit, and very beautiful at dusk. it is especially nice viewed from the village with Fuji behind it. Postcard material.",
          "A nice little shrine in Hakone with beautiful pathways and architecture as you would expect in Japan. Not super crowded which means you can actually feel the serenity at the shrine.",
          "It is very scenic around the lake. You can take a bus from Hakone-Yumoto to Moto Hakone then on to Hakone. Outdoor activity still ch as pedal boats and boat rides around the lake. Great summer/warm weather activity. Although, when we went, it was quite chilly. The boats were",
          "After our one night stay in Hakone onsen hotel, we decided to drive up to here and spend a morning strolling around, taking photos and enjoy lunch by the water at the nice cafes. If you have time when visiting Hakone, be sure to spend some time here. Lovely Photos taken.",
          "This is peaceful and in a beautiful setting. There were a dozen or so tourists who were taking photos at the shrine but that was useful as there was someone to take a photo of when my boyfriend proposed to me!",
          "Honestly, I think people come here to visit the torii gate that sites in Lake Ashi, more so than the shrine itself. It's a few minute walk if you get off the Hakone Tozan bus route at Moto-Hakone - walk towards the water and then turn right. Find the red torii gates and walk",
          "We visited the shrine in the late afternoon. It was crowded but worth the 20-min walk from Moto-Hakone Port. I'm partial to forest shrines and this one had lots of big, lovely old trees in addition to the famous torii on the lake. This is a shrine worth visiting, even if",
          "Truly a piece of quintessential Japan: ancient, peaceful, beautiful, balanced, meditative, the list goes on. My family and I weren't on any guided tours so after being dropped off by a Lake Ashi ship we made our way over to the Shrine which took us through a serene wooded",
          "Visited here as the sun was setting. Very quiet and peaceful once you move away from the buses. A light does also come on at night but the walk path can still be quite dark.",
          "Hakone Shrine is culture pure and you have to clean yourself with the water in a special way. Don't miss to go to the lake / pier.",
          "Visited Lake Ashi with Friends on a rainy and foggy day, with ideas of seeing Fuji. Unfortunately, we weren't able to see the mountain, but Ashi and and the Kuzuryu shrine more than made up for it. The surrounding forest is like something out of another world, and the shrine",
          "Nice place to relax and enjoy some peace and quiet. Not really much to see, but if you want a day away from dynamic life of big cities such as Tokyo, then this is place to come and reflect.",
          "Traditional shrine set on a hill overlooking a lake. Very beautiful setting, and very beautiful shrine. Be sure to walk down to the lake!",
          "Very nice spot for an hour or two on the lake side. If you are in Hakone you should visit here. Adequate parking if you're driving, reasonable public transport if you're not.",
          "I stayed there for two days and I recommend the ship which goes down the river for everyone who goes to Hakone.",
          "Hakone is a lovely sight seeing town only a short train ride away from Tokyo and I enjoyed it so much! In January we even managed to catch the snow scenery which we did not expect to see as most photos of Hakone that we saw in brochures and on the Internet were taken in Summer.",
          "This is certain a great offshoot if you are visiting Kuzuryu Shrine. I would suggest doing this during Sunset which is worth the selfie picture. Be warn it could be crowded as many visitors would have the same idea.",
          "It took us about 2 hrs to get here, We took a train, tram, cable car, bus and a boat and then walked for 15 mins to this shrine and it was worth every minute. Great place for a beautiful photo memory of our time in Japan.",
          "worth the trip just to see the beautiful torii gate rising from the lake! 2 minute walk from hakone machi take a photo under the gate",
          "The view of the Torri gate from the lake is breaktaking, we took the paddling boat by the pier at 1,500 yen for 30 mins and paddled our way near the gate to take pics, it was a great experience for the kids, from there we had bakery and coffee at a lovely three-storey",
          "Hakone Shrine is definitely a \"no go item\", must visit place when you're visiting Hakone! Till now, I am still wondering how they actually came out with the idea to build such a big gate in front of the lake, and not to forget to visit their temple as well.",
          "Very quaint temple and you got to visit it when you are at the lake. It can be accessed by foot or by car. Walking up the steps can be slightly tiring for older folks but it should be fine.",
          "The area is so beautiful and serene. The weather is misty and cool. The architecture is just pretty. I would return to visit again.",
          "Hakone Shrine stands at the foot of Mount Hakone along the shores of Lake Ashi. The shrine buildings are hidden in dense forest, its location given away only by the temple's hugh torii gates.",
          "This temple exceeds my expectations from what I read in travel books. When I arrived I had to walk a long flight of stairs up to the temple. The temple is situated inside a forest and is covered by layers of mist. Adds a special sense of tranquility and holiness. At the",
          "A MUST see, if you can then wall down to the shrine while the tide is out, then wait for the tide to come in and admire the beauty. I would recommend walking up to the rope way station the park with its small red Japanese bridges is very nice. The rope way and walk up the",
          "The shrine is very lovely and the walk up to the top of the shrine is pleasant. This shrine was not especially crowded the day I visited, adding to its beauty. The setting is really pretty and it is possible to enjoy both from the top and close to the lake.",
          "Walk from the boat to this beautiful shrine and take a good look around the grounds, walk down to the water and follow the path around the lake , truly wonderful, while I was there I was lucky to witness a young man propose marriage,a lovely experience in a stunning location.",
          "I first read about Hakone Shrine on JapanGuide and saw how beautiful the torii gate looked across from the river. On the day that we had planned for Hakone, it was raining and terribly foggy. The view across from the river was so-so with low visibility. However, the main shrine",
          "This Shrine is located closed Ashinoko lake. If you see from lake side, you can see beautiful viewing. Torii (Gateway to Shinto shrine), Lake, Sightseen boat, Fuji mountain. In side of shrine, there are many trees, calm air. It's solemn atmosphere.",
          "We took the ferry and saw this Shrine from afar, it is large and impressive but then the whole island is lovely. Beware eating near the deer as these deer are not wild and frightened of humans but see them as a meal ticket and will actually jump up to steal your food bought",
          "Loving this place so much. A peaceful place where you can see the beauty of Ashi Lake. Super huge gate making u feel tiny. Perfect.",
          "This place is worth a visit if you are able to find the location. It is nicely hidden at a corner.Once you are able to locate it, you will amazed by its beauty. Prayers are done here with lots of charms available for purchase. Do drop for a short prayer or wish making.",
          "A site worth the visit. Before heading up we ate at the diner near the carpark which had the best noodle soup ever for 850 yen. Dont miss it. Shrine is definitely worth the visit if you're in the area. Dont be daunted by the stairs, elderly ladies were getting up there at their",
          "An easy walk from the Moto Hakone Pirate Ship Pier. You can see the shrine from the shore, so just walk that direction. The path was peaceful and enjoyable despite it being a cool and cloudy day. We did this as one of our first stops from Tokyo, so enjoyed the peaceful scenery.",
          "A nice little temple with an interesting history behind it. It's a 15 min. walk from the pier and there are some nice restaurants on the way to Jinja shrine",
          "If you decide to go to Lake Ashi then visit this Shrine. Not much to do on the lake except for taking pictures of the view and this shrine.",
          "The walking street from the main road to Shrine is nice! A street with trees along at both sides. A good spot for photographing!",
          "It is small Tori, similar to the one in Miyajima but at a smaller scale. I saw it from a boat I took at the ropeway station. It looks nice. I did not have enough time to visit it after disembarking.",
          "We went to Hakone and visited Kuzuryu Shrine Singu. You can spot it easily from the boat (if you decide to take the cruise around Asahi river). After the boat experience, you can have a nice walk around moto hakone and see the others two Torii in the town until you end in Hakone",
          "You can see the Tori of Hakone shrine from the boat. The temple is atop a small hill. The walk is nice and you need to climb a flight of stairs to reach the shrine. Once you are at top it is all peace and calm. When we visited it was already evening so hardly anybody was there.",
          "Like a mini Miyajima if you don't have the time to go there. Be prepared to wait in a short line to take pictures underneath the gate. The walk (about 15 mins) is great to stretch your legs after all the different transport you take on the round trip. The trees provide lots of",
          "After visiting Senso Ji and Zojo Ji in Tokyo city, this temple is so peaceful in comparison. It has beautiful grounds and towering trees. Some of them are sacred trees and you can tell by the ropes tied around them. There are many many many many stairs... So we initially",
          "This is a really beautiful Shinto shrine on the shores of Lake Ashi, in Hakone. You cannot see Mt. Fuji from the shrine itself, but if you walk down to the shore of the lake to see the beautiful peace torii standing there, you can walk along the shore to a point where the",
          "Its a beautiful monument but not worth the hike/car ride since you can see this from the Asi river cruise. There is nothing else to do there.",
          "Nice, but not like Miyajima... Beautiful to look from the boat-ride. It is quite impressive, but would do it, only if you have a spare time.",
          "The shrine was nice but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it again. There's always lots of people around and that kind of kills any charm or feel this shrine had. If you're already in the area you may as well stop to see it, if not I wouldn't bother.",
          "There was something simple majestic and beautiful about the simplicity of this shrine, especially when visited at dusk.",
          "The area is heavy with tourists and students on day trips but well worth a visit. Stay after the day people have gone for an extra special experience. Beware if you stay too late. There is very little food available. Quiet comes with a price!",
          "We saw this shrine (one of many) from a boat. I had read about it and how at certain tides it appears to be floating. A lovely sight as you sail over to the island.",
          "Take the path under the torii and lined with red lanterns. Don't be daunted by all the steps up to the shrine. If you need to there are rest spots on the way up. Male sure you wander off the path to look at smaller shines on the way up. There is such beauty and serenity",
          "Not very well maintained. It is in a scenic setting, follows a path along the river. Easy to walk to from MotoHakone and pirate ship",
          "Its a 20 mins walk from Hakone En. We loved the walk and you will see some or the other standing near the Tori gate taking a picture. It stands very tall and it commands a picture from you. Do not miss if you visit Hakone.",
          "The Torii Gate rising from the lake is the entrance too a beautiful temple complex hidden within a mature Cedar forest. It is an easy walk from the Markone bus stop along the lakefront, then just as end the steep granite steps that are flanked by huge Cedar trees to reach the",
          "Hakone shrine is a 20 min walk from Moto-Hakone pier. The walk to the shrine is an easy and gentle stroll along the banks of Lake Ashi. Arriving at the big red Torri gate that stands between land and water and you have arrived at the foot of Hakone shrine. After seeing many",
          "We went with a taxi driver as there is not much to do in area especially without a car. He was so gracious spent time waiting, then showing us the shrine, telling us the history and little things as well as taking photo's of all of us. Would definitely spend time visiting",
          "This floating red shrine on the Lake Ashi is possibly the most picturesque site on the entire Hakone.",
          "The big orange Gate to this Shrine is actually in Lake Ashi, and is visible from the pirate ship cruising across the lake. It'll crop up in various photos. Otherwise, the Shrine is a relatively sort walk from town. There are many steps - as it's uphill from the lake's edge. If",
          "Although this temple is not so impressive as the temples in the Kamakura or Nara area it is worhwile to visit if you have an hour to spend in the area. The nature around is nice and quiet.",
          "Beautiful temple reached by a path through a cedar forest. A lot of nice Moss covered rocks along the way. Unique red color for the structures. Old samurai location turned shrine. The floating torii gate is very unique.",
          "The Shinto Shrine Gate is as impressive in person as it is in pictures, the shrine itself is some steps up and hidden in the woods. It is a very short distance - about 5-10 minutes' walk by on a clearly marked path from MotoHakone.",
          "A beautiful walk up to the temple among large beautiful trees! Worth the walk from the ferry terminal.",
          "Had a wonderful time in Lake Ashi and Hakone Shrine. Very calm and peaceful, good vibes to carry away. Beautiful and scenic place, amazing for photography. Very recommended.",
          "The huge red gate stood out from the murky lake water. It was pretty impressive to see from up close and afar. We looked so small standing underneath it.",
          "If you love Dori like I do, seeing one just in the water is just breathtaking. This one is near the Hakone Shrine. The shrine itself is quite a few steps up and is not for the faint hearted. But worth the visit.",
          "One of the only two toriis that are built over water. The other's in Hiroshima. Unique sight. When weather's fine, it's said that Fuji Mountain can be seen.",
          "This is a fabulous area - there are sons magnificently tall trees, the shrine is beautiful and there's a lovely calm air to the whole place. I'm really glad we went.",
          "The shrine is very popular with both oversea tourist and locals. If you've never experienced Japanese shrine, you can't really go wrong with Hakone Shrine in the forest. Very peaceful (when the crowd isn't too bad) with a fantastic view of Lake Ashi.",
          "While traveling on one of the three Pirate ships that cross the lake, you can see this small version of the tori at Miyajima. The ship stops at three locations around the lake. Our three day Hakone pass allowed us to ride the ship as much as we wanted.",
          "Nice place to quietly look at the lake. Then Go to the opposite way & give Hakone Jinja shrine a visit.",
          "honestly we are not very impressed with the boat trip. probably because the ropeway is not fully opened.",
          "So serene and beautiful! Time seems to sit still here. Great escape from the western culture, much needed at times.",
          "A red Tori standing in the water...with Chinese tourists in Donald duck waterboats haha. Seriously. Looked more like the Shinto Disney parc to me.",
          "It's a beutiful temple surrounded by huge old trees. It's easy to walk there, although you need to walk by the road for a bit. On a warmer day it's probably great to walk down by the water as well",
          "From the pier, Hakone Shrine is about a 5-10 min walk. Its a great place to visit and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. The Shrine isn't too large, so it should not take more than an hour there including taking photos etc. The highlights will be at the main temple of at the Shrine",
          "Popular spot for photos, a pretty good place for a scenic view. People were queuing up to take photos of the shrine so it will be better if you go there early",
          "This shrine is impressive with all the history and the lakes surrounding it. The are different routes you can take to access it. We took the boat across the lake and then wandered around.",
          "Like taking a step into the past (if you ignore the visitors in modern clothes). It's architecture is beautiful, and its cultural heritage are a good read. It is located at Lake Ashi, which itself is a surreal place... It amazed me at how human structures can co-exist with so",
          "If you are in Hakone-machi, before taking the ferry for the cruise in the lake, I definitely recommend to go to the shrine, is an easy 5 minutes walk from the ferry terminal and the shrine is very suggestive",
          "The scenery is what does it - yet again. The walk up there is an unforgettable experience. You can see Mt Fuji from here at certain times of the year. The downside is that it takes a while to get here via public transport (bus or train- they both take ages). At night the only",
          "If you love dragons definitely visit this shrine. They have many beautiful dragon statues here. The gate is a wonderful spot for a family photo! The scenery and feeling of this shrine is just something you should experience",
          "This is Hakone's \"big day out\"- the pirate ship ferry ride around the lake to the villages. These places were so run down our opinion was - stay on the ferry. Ordinary food, dismal towns and attractions badly in need of repair. Forget it.",
          "Took the gorgeous walk from the cruise boat stop to the Shrine and enjoyed the native rainforest style walk that led us there. Some beautiful views of Lake Ashi and clearly signposted explanations of the cultural significance of the site in English.",
          "Visited Hakone on a coach trip from Tokyo, just spent the day in the area and loved it. The area around the shrine is simply lovely. The air has a refreshing quality - especially after a week in Tokyo! The surrounding forest is fantastic, with some huge and ancient trees. The",
          "Nice little shrine surrounded by wild greenery is in the Hakone area, we got witness to a couple that took their weeding photos they where very nicely dressed etc.",
          "What could be a quiet and calm spiritual place is in fact crammed with noisy day trippers and tourists jostling to take photos. Severe danger of being impaled by a selfie stick. If you want to really enjoy this part of Hakone, hire a pedalo or a row boat and escape the hoards on",
          "The shrine was exactly as you'd expect, well maintained and full of nature. The views from the shrine over the lake were spectacular though! Made for a beautiful walk.",
          "86 steps - in one go. This is a place of worship, a little bit off the beaten track but certainly worth visiting as part of a day tour on a tour bus. It is a place of worship for Japanese people who good to visit the 9 headed dragon sculpture and wash out their mouths with the",
          "From Togendai, around 20-25minutes on foot. You can walk, pass the deck view to see Mt Fuji, walk thru Cedar Avenue then pass many restaurant before seeing the gate. I arrived in the evening so not many people around and it was perfect. So peaceful though it got dark so fast",
          "We were on the Hakone Free Pass circuit. Having just gotten off the bus and on our way to the Lake Ashi Pirate Ship. We saw this Torii Gate on the edge of the lake close to where we got off the bus. Decided to explore. Walked to the right of the pier (counterclockwise).",
          "Follow the steps at red gate by the lake, walk all the way up you will find the Hakone shrine. Heads up, there are many many steps up hill to walk! Think the shrine shuts around 4pm. There are two praying places, one at the beginning of the shrine, the main one is all the way",
          "Even when the weather is not great, it's worth a visit to Hakone and to the shrine. The gate at the water makes for great photos and is peaceful (if not crowded).",
          "Probably 1 of the most famous sights of Hakone, and is rather impressive in person. We first saw it on the Hakone sightseeing cruise and slowly made our way there after stopping off for some lunch. The gate you see from the water is only 1 of 2 approaches to the shrine itself.",
          "This is a very popular photo destination and is a beautiful view of the lake, especially in the Autumn when the leaves are changing color. Definitely one of the more iconic spots in Hakone...",
          "Goes beyond any expectations I had. Amazing view and environment. Please enjoy looking at the wedding ceremonies that take place there and absolutely outstanding.",
          "Come with the Pirate Ship from Togendai station, had a great view after stop by at a nearby bread store (with leg onsen) on the way here. Marvellous view with the Shrine in the water! Never to be missed, i am lucky to have put my food here and taken the photos. :)",
          "The is just as it appears, but definitely worth a stop if you are at Lake Ashi. We did the boat tour of the lake and then walked to the shrine. The area itself is a great spot for lunch and people watching.",
          "I just love temples, and the planning they made some 1200 years ago. An aisle of old humongous trees leads up to this place of worshipping! This is a must see. I think (because I can't read Japanese) that there is a three there which is 3000 years old and 6 meters thick.",
          "This was my most favorite shrine I have seen in Japan. The beautiful lake side sitting with NO crowds make it so special. The area where you cleanse your mouth and hand has the most beautiful dragon ornament. The steps leading up to the shrine are lovely and really set the",
          "From Moto-Hakone-ko, turn left & go straight to the end of the road, turn left again and it's on the left side .It's also right across Hakone-Jinja shrine with the ancient cedar avenue which is also a must visit. You can also rent a small boat to see it from the open water.",
          "When you visit Hakone you normally look for hot springs or contemporary art museums but you'll be discover a spiritual place wonderfully preserved down to the Lake. This shintoist temple founded in 757 is announced to the visitor by an astonishing and wonderful Orange Tori",
          "The shrine itself wasn\u2019t as noteworthy as the location and the beautiful gate. It was the only shrine we visited that was among pines, which gave it a dramatic feel, especially when climbing the steep main stairs. The kids made their donations and we headed back to the bus",
          "Such a beautiful walk to get to this shrine and all the interesting things to see on the way, so peaceful beautifully",
          "Hakone Shrine is surrounded by various nature (for example , forest, lake). It has about 1250 years history. I visited there in summer, so it was very comfortable. Next time I want to visit in winter. Because there has festival in February. There hold very fascinating events.",
          "Good to add to your 1 or 2 day Hakone excursion. It was unfortunately very hot so we didn't stay too long. Some good photo opportunities.",
          "Shrine is ok, but the best thing is the views of Lake Ashi and also the approach to the shrine - line of very tall cedar trees.",
          "Nice trail along the lake leads you to this gate and shrine afterwards. Very chilling relaxing walk. Good photography spot.",
          "Hakone is a nice place to make a day trip from tokyo. The shrine is nice and requires a walk up a few flight of stairs. It was interesting to see the rituals",
          "Set on the shore of Ashi in the town of Hakone, this shrine is an amazing view in all kinds of weather. Now I only experienced it in rainy, cloudy and slightly chilly .... which was spectacular! While we did not get to glimpse Mt. Fuji on this visit, the mist and fog/clouds",
          "A beautiful shrine by the water, a short walk from town. Make sure to visit if you're in Hakone! Close to public transportation.",
          "I only saw this temple from a boat cruising the length of the lake. It looked lovely and I would very much like to visit one day. The boat ride itself was a great way to see Mt Fuji and enjoy the lake, by the way.",
          "We took a day trip from Tokyo to Hakone and it was worth it. We walked around town and took in some amazing site, but nothing came close to the view shrine. I would advise going early before all the tour buses show up.",
          "There are a lot shrines in Tokyo, but one fell special feelings when visiting this little shrine! There are stip stairs to get to the shrine but it is worth it to get there!",
          "Beautiful shrine, really nice to find it off the main road. I would recommend a visit if you are coming off the boat ride from Lake Ashi. You can take the Hakone Bus about 5-10 minutes ( the bust driver can direct you) and walk a few blocks to the shrine.",
          "We ended up in Hakone when the Hakone ropeway was closed due to volcanic activity and we were looking for a nearby destination. The Hakone Shrine is the most obvious destination in town. A large red torii is visible on the edge of the lake, and it's a nice walk over to the",
          "This shrine is important in the Hakone area. It is worth reading a little about it before the visit. There is a torii in the edge of the lake and steps leading up to the shrine. It is very atmospheric when visited on a misty day, with the surrounding tall cedar trees. If you are",
          "Quiet and full of trees. It is quite a walk but it's worth it. the smell of fresh air and seeing a bunch of Japanese tradition all in one place. Don't forget to drink the water from the dragons mouth",
          "The shrine sits atop a nice little walk up some stairs about a 10-15 walk from the Motohakone dock/station. It was not very crowded at all while we were there, which made for a peaceful (and free) experience. The arch that sits along the water makes for some particularly",
          "Stunning and well worth the trip. Loved the history - would have liked some English captions. Pair with a short walk on the historic Cedarm Path.",

        "wiki": "Hakone (\u7bb1\u6839\u753a, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of June 2012, the town had an estimated population of 13,492, and a population density of 145 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi). Hakone has been designated as a Japanese National Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Network.\nHakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mt. Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nOdawara\nYugawara\nMinami-ashigaraShizuoka Prefecture\n\nGotemba\nSusono\nMishima\nOyama\nKannami\n\n\n== History ==\nHakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the Hakone Checkpoint (\u7bb1\u6839\u95a2\u6240, Hakone sekisho), which formed the border of the Kant\u014d region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T\u014dkaid\u014d were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons.\nAfter the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake.\nAfter merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active \u014cwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights.\nHakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art.\nMajor events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T\u014dkaid\u014d road.\nOne famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods.\nA noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi.Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town. In 2017, Hakone was included as one of 88 anime pilgrimage sites for 2018 by the Anime Tourism Association. In 2020, new decorations have been introduced to the city in the anticipation of the release of the final film of the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nHakone Tozan Railway\nHakone Tozan Cable Car\nHakone Ropeway\nIzuhakone RailwayOdawara and Mishima, the terminus of the Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, 70 minutes from Shinjuku, Tokyo.

          "A beautiful reproduction of the checkpoint and village setting.  It has a great little museum before the village with some great history and artifacts.  The village is complete with mannequins displaying normal daily life and there are \u2026",
          "We went here on a rainy day in spring. So it was rather cold. But still worth the visit. \nThe recreated scenes and architecture gave a glimpse of   the past. It also reminded of most things that seem to remain in their culture to this date. \u2026",
          "Fun and interesting way to use up some time while waiting for the pirateship ferry. It's pretty quick and small so some people might not think it worth the cost, but we enjoyed it.",
          "Beautiful exhibition and excellent restoration of old buildings. One feels like back in the old times where Hakone was used as a checkpoint for travelers to and from Edo. The area in general is very enjoyable to walk around as well! Absolutely recommended.",
          "Beautiful view, you can see two islands when looking far away forward",
          "Great view from the watchtower. The tokaido checkpoints also have deep historical significance. Not everything is in English, but it's enough information really.",
          "Awesome place, entrance are free to walk all over the garden , 500 yen to enter museum.",
          "A very well done reconstruction of the Edo period checkpoint.  If you want to understand how the Shogunate controlled the land, this is a great place to see.  They've done a wonderful job of recreating the checkpoint.  One word of warning, is that it isn't large, so it's best to visit as part of an overall trip to the area.",
          "Very interesting museum, with various models, displaying the history of Hakone Takaido Checkpoint. You can also  enjoy beautiful view of the lake and pirate ship here. Nice place to visit as part of your Hakone tour.",
          "This place was a historic check-point on Tokaido route (Between Kyoto and Tokyo). Once Japan have an other transportation this route was closed. But it was revived to be a historic tourist spot at last. Even something will be contrast cause \u2026",
          "Peace village, Come and see how is Japan. Great view, great atmosphire.",
          "An interesting place to see Japanese life and history. These are well restored buildings with replica artifacts of the life for soldiers guarding the Tokyo Kyoto road. The neatest is the stabilized candle lantern that always holds a candle \u2026",
          "Great stop to make - although it doesn't take long to see it. Note that there is a nice overlook of the lake if you are willing to climb the steps.",
          "Very beautiful spot and nice day trip from Tokyo. There's a lot of good shops to eat at but as a warning, they're all closed right after lunch until dinner. We arrived around 3pm and couldn't find even a coffee shop to sit down at.",
          "Nice relaxing place with history all over it plus a surprising play! Loved it very much and it was only 500 yen I believe.",
          "This is a fun place to check out",
          "Interesting place. The only problem is almost everything is in Japanese so we couldn\u2019t understand a lot of things. This is a king of museum about the Japan History",
          "Understanding Japan's history the right way.",
          "1. Come here for a view of the legendary mount fuji\n2. DO NOT PAY THE ENTRANCE FEE\n3. You can just walk right through\n4. The entrance fee is for the exhibits which we all know we are not really interested",
          "Hakone checkpoint museum is one of the best ways to experience the history of this section of Japan. Located close to other tourist attractions, this mostly outdoor museum sits along the eastern shore of Lake Ashi. \n\nAt 500 JPY or $6.00 \u2026",
          "Interesting bit of history in a beautiful location lot's of thing's to see and do",
          "Interesting place.  Need more takeaway food and drinks",

          "Great cultural experience at a great spot to view Fuji. Best visited with a rental car.",
          "Very unclear signs, even if you understand a bit of Japanese: it's free to pass through (and walk/stay in the street, doing whatever you want), while you have to buy a ticket at the gate only when you later want to enter the buildings. Staff on the street will quite rudely remind you this as you pass.",
          "Edo era military check point, entrance tickets \u00a5400. The way surrounding the check point is really refreshing and relaxing",
          "I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviews. The checkpoint museum does have all the displays in Japanese but it's pretty obvious what each display represents. It is worth the 400 yen entrance fee for the view of Lake Ashi and Mount Fuji from the top of the hill.",
          "Walked past so had a look. There appeared to be a ticket desk but a lot of people just walked through due to poor signage. We didn\u2019t bother but worth the two min detour if walking past",
          "Such an amazing place, same place as samurai champloo",
          "3 main rebuilt buildings showing what the checkpoint looked like.  Small entrance fee.  Do if you have time.  Skip if short on time.  There are also stairs to a viewpoint over the lake which is kind of nice.  Spent about an hour there.  The \u2026",
          "Historical landmark. Fullfil all public needs. Next to the landmark. There is also a boat. So u can  see the view from the lake. A very breathtaking view. And romantic also.",
          "Great place to go.. Kids love it specially the cruise mono rail rope way was awesome. Must go place in  near tokyo. Although quite expencive but worth a penny",
          "Nice to place to visit while in Hakone. I wish there was more information in English though. There are many nice wood making shops nearby as well.",

          "The whole checkpoint is rebuilt based on artefacts and technique (wood architecture) back in the era of Edo. Guess this is the most well built site to bring us back in time, very educating piece of history.",
          "Good interpretation in multiple languages.",
          "Reconstructed based on old records. It gives you panoramic view of Lake Ashi",

          "Place where ancient trade happened, must of a old traditional houses, bit of boring actually but for visit would not be a problem",

          "Interesting to see an old Outpost.",
          "Interesting exhibits displaying history of the area and provides an insight to the class divide at the time. The lookout at one of the exhibits offers a great view of the lake and Mt Fuji on a good day. Lovely during autumn. We spent longer than expected there. Staff were nice and friendly.",
          "Great walk with the kids no crowds great views of the lake and Mt Fuji!",
          "Lovely spot to visit an d see some Japanese history of the area. Views are amazing over the lake and u can see my Fuji on clear days.",
          "Historic check point few hundred years ago. Also it's a place for Yosegi-zaiku which is a type of traditional Japanese marquetry. This traditional art was originated during Japan's culturally rich Edo period",
          "very interesting open air museum. Possive is great for the view and content.  A must see in Hakone.",
          "It is a nice place. Reconstruction of an Edo period checkpoint. Feels like those places they do school trips to teach some history lessons. \n\nProbably if the day was clearer I would have been able to see the mount Fugi, but it was not the case.",
          "It was such a cool place to learn about history in Tokyo - the checkpoint was the where everyone who wanted to enter Tokyo (Edo) had to pass through. I definitely recommend visiting!",
          "The views are amazing to relax and enjoy lake Ashinoko with cups of tea and to experience historical places. But, other than that, there is not so much things to do here.",
          "Great view of the lake. Better if the sun is out! Plan your visit on a sunny day to enjoy the view of Fuji-san!",

          "Really nice restoration of the Hakone checkpoint with some really nice views of the lake and Mount Fuji. Takes about 20min to walk through, look at the exhibits and so on. Very visual and good for kids especially; gives a nice idea of life \u2026",

          "Interesting how it used to be a border gate in the Edo era.",
          "Old military checkpoint from Edo era. You can walk around for free or pay to enter the facilities. Great place for views and pics.",
          "Wished there was more. Loved the view and the museum as well. Gotta try the mochi there worth only \u00a5100.",
          "Quite a pretty place but there is absolutely no english signs! They should really improve that if they want tourists to enjoy the experience",
          "It\u2019s one of Japan\u2019s historical places you have to visit when in Hakone",
          "small, but has a perfect view of ashi lake",
          "This is a recreation of the 'Checkpoint' that existed here, which helped control the flow of traffic going in an out of Tokyo.  Buy a ticket, get access to the Checkpoint buildings and a Museum explaining its significance.  A reasonable \u2026",
          "Great little experience of historic Japan. Don't bother getting a ticket for the little exhibit you can just walk through and around the area. Definitely go to the shop where they make the Japanese puzzle boxes and go into their mini interactive museum. It was so cool!",
          "An intriguing reconstruction of Hakone Checkpoint. Great care and attention has been put into bringing this significant part of Japanese history back to life. It is very good at highlighting both the ingenuity of Japanese people and the backwards gender politics of yesteryear.",
          "Historical place with few demonstrations. Not quite interesting.",
          "Not much things to see and you can walk through for free.",
          "Require minimum 2days of visit. Awesome experience",
          "Fascinating piece of history and a very well preserved historical site to visit. We only wandered through the site rather than pay to enter the buildings - it may have been worth it to pay to enter but the lack of english signage in and around the site wasnt quite enough to get me paying to step into the buildings",
          "Cool place, nice views but almost all information was Japanese only.",
          "A nice little place to visit while you are at the lake.",
          "Amazing views, old structures rebuilt to show how the real buildings looked like",

          "It is too small but lovely place for sightseeing. I would recommend to come in Spring and Summer.",
          "Quite a unique cultural and historical landmark and museum covering the procedures of immigration within rural Japan back in the edo period. Lots of clay figures to bring to life the people of the time. Some English explanations too which are scant but interesting. Great rainy day activity though there is an outdoor bit too.",

          "Worth seeing but more touristy than authentic",
          "Amazing. We went on a cruise on the lake and then rode a cable car. Both were really great experiences. The lake has a spiritual air about it that made us feel like higher beings..... cant explain the feeling. Unfortunatrly mt fuji was veiled by clouds so we couldnt see it at all.... a rdgrettable occurence.",
          "Lovely lake with view of Mount Fuji with Conection to the sight seeing boats and buses to other destinations around the lake and to the sky bridge",
          "It was cool. They do nickel and dime you with paying to go into buildings but if you're a history buff you'll like it. It really isn't that much to go into them.",

          "Temporary renovation in progress. Nothing much to see",
          "Tourist love this place even I enjoy the boat trip in the lake and its cheep",

          "Quick walk through. Not worth paying for museum.",
          "As the day was beautifully sunny and clear we saw Mt Fuji from here.   On a cold rainy day not so great.  The Checkpoint buildings  and lookout  have been nicely reproduced  so on a sunny day a good way to pass time here",
          "Remember to climb up the hill to get a very scenic view of Hakone lake and mountain!",

        "wiki": "\u014cwakudani (\u5927\u6d8c\u8c37, lit. \"Great Boiling Valley\") is a volcanic valley with active sulphur vents and hot springs in Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It was created around 3,000 years ago, as a result of the explosion of the Hakone volcano.It is a popular tourist site for its scenic views, volcanic activity, and kuro-tamago (\u9ed2\u5375, lit. \"black egg\") \u2014 a local specialty of eggs hard-boiled in the hot springs. The eggs turn black and smell slightly sulphuric; eating one is said to add seven years to your life.Upon seeing the hellish scenery, when Koubu Daishi visited Owakudani more than a thousand years ago, he offered prayer to Bodhisattva. The Enmei-jizo in Owakudani is said to have its origin in the prayer.\n\n\n== Access ==\nAccess to \u014cwakudani is via a funitel, the Hakone Ropeway (\u014cwakudani Station), or a bus line from Odawara Station, Hakone-Yumoto Station, Kowakidani Station / Kojiri, the Izuhakone Bus (\u014cwakudani Bus Stop). There is a road to a visitor's center just below the Kuro-tamago hot springs site.\nMost visitors used to hike the roughly 1 km (0.62 mi) trail (which has been closed since 2015 due to increased volcanic activity) or take the Hakone Ropeway to close to where the eggs are boiled to participate in the ritual egg eating. The funitel offers a vast view of Mount Fuji (on clear days) and the sulphur vents just below the visitor's center.\nPresent day activities surrounding sulphur vents are the result of massive land slides in the past. Construction of concrete barriers and stabilization of the area have been under way for decades.\n\n\n== Closure ==\nThe tourist site in \u014cwakudani was closed in May 2015 due to volcanic activity. It re-opened on April 27, 2016, but not fully, as it is not possible to walk close to the steaming vents due to the hazards involved. People with asthma, bronchitis, heart disease, heart pacemakers, and pregnant women are advised not enter the valley because of high volcanic activity.\n\n\n== References ==",

I recommend to try it at least once if you are traveling. it's a tourist spot although you can see minijg operations ongoing to mine the sulphur from the vents. Note that sulphur stains the ground yellow",

I would advise using the train and tram transports to get up as the buses can be really delayed. Really good museum for only 100 yen each well worth it for some great insight and history.",

There's also amazing views of Mt. Fuji too. There's definitely a strong smell of sulfur here but don't let that prevent you from visiting!",

          "Beautiful place. We didn't try to black onsen egg. That's a bit of regret of the whole trip",
          "Great spot to see mount Fuji and have a lunch break. Furthermore a nice view of the sulfur crates can be seen.",
          "Can be very crowded and the smell may be a turn off for some. Great views into the crater to see the steam gushing out of the ground.",
          "Beautiful view and nice stopping area!",
          "Truly amazing to see so much volcanic activity with steam clouds billowing up from fumarolic vents coloured yellow from all the sulphur. The mountains and the view are spectacular and add to the impressive atmosphere. I was disappointed to \u2026",
          "Amazing views. Fun high speed winds. Magical sulfur volcanoes. AND you can't miss the BLACK BOILED EGGS and black ice cream. A mist visit.",
          "A great place though smells really bad because of the sulfur. Towards evening, it creates The Lord of the Rings-like atmosphere.",
          "Great place to view mount Fuji. You will find food, souvenirs, mini shrine.\nThey have local specialties, a smoked egg. And some special flakes. The round trip in the cable train is around 8 dollars, for me it's a good price.",

          "Great view of Mount Fuji on a good clear day and Hell valley.",
          "Good to visit.",
          "If you go to Hakone then this place is recommended. You can either reach there by ropeway or via your own vehicle. Very beautiful scenic view and you can enjoy sulphur boiled eggs.  We got chance to go on top where they boil egss in natural \u2026",
          "Great Mt. Fuji view cable car",
          "Significant view... worth the journey.. great place for autumn view along the cable car..",
          "The way people make \"black egg\" is fantastic.",
          "We went to Hakone lake and this place was a true surprise. We really enjoyed the view.",
          "Very scenic spot. Ropeway goes over a volcanic area and you can see the earth smouldering. Prepare yourself because there is a sulfur smell lingering. Very nice way to get to the lake. From there you can take a pirate ship (ferry) to other parts around the lake.",
          "It is easy to get here from the 18seater cable car. Place has stunning view of Mt. Fuji if you\u2019re lucky. The onsen manju costs more than Gora but delicious. The manju is served hot and it is fluffy with yummy red bean paste. The black egg \u2026",
          "Beautiful place good weather  good teast ice cream and boiled black eggs",
          "If u don't mind the location is out of place a bit from within Tokyo ring, this is definitely a great place to visit\u2026 u get to be up close and personal to an area where a major landslide that was triggered by previous earthquake",
          "The highlight of Hakone area! Try to go as early as possible to avoid the massive invasion of tourists. Nice view of mountain Fuji if you are lucky with the weather",
          "Boiling valley of sulphur steam. Eggs treated with the sulphur steam turns black on the outside. A ropeway linking the base of the steaming mountain provides a spectacular view. Very crowded with tourists tasting the black shell eggs.",
          "Must here! Recommended place",
          "Try the black eggs of Owakudani - which according to legend holds eating just one of these black eggs can add seven years to one's life. The place smells sulfur. Ride the Hakone Ropeway tram to see the sulfur deposits.",

          "Interesting place but tons of tourist during our visit",
          "Area from which you can view thermic and volcanic activity with a restaurant, several shops and a geography and history museum. There are also several hiking trails which were unfortunately closed when we were there (late November).",
          "This is a must do when in Hakone. We'll worth the gondola ride to get there.",
          "Really nice day trip if you don't mind the smell of sulfer. Beautiful views of Mt Hakone and Mt Fuji weather permitting. The distinctive black eggs, hard boiled in the springs and blackened by the sulfer, are a fun tourist attraction. They \u2026",
          "While there is an interesting museum here and the black eggs are interesting, most of it is closed off due to volcanic activity that occurred between May 2015 and the summer of 2016, and is still partially ongoing. This can't be helped as \u2026",
          "Famous for Black Eggs and Volcanic Stream.",
          "Nothing special. Waste of money and time to come here. The staffs here weren\u2019t friendly at all",
          "It's a great place to see Mt. Fuji while eating the black eggs that are believed to prolong your life by 7 years. The sulfuric fumes did not have a strong smell when we were there and there were some snow left when we visited.",
          "\u5927\u6d8c\u8c37 (Owakudani) is a famous volcanic landscape in \u7bb1\u6839 (Hakone) area. If people want to enjoy this majestic scenery, they can get there through two ways: \nFirst, drive a car. There is a way to Owakudani and a parking lot for the drivers. \u2026",
          "Great site to visit while in hakone, and some of the best views of mt Fuji from the hakone area. Beware though that the souvenirs can get pricey from up here, and the wind is typically blowing quite strong. Pack a jacket ad even on a warm \u2026",
          "It's really beautiful and unique. I heard it was dog friendly but it really isn't. Expect traffic as even on weekdays there can be long lined to park. If you're bringing a dog, you can skip the ropeway/cable car altogether. I wish I'd simply hung around the main parking area. The lake is lovely but you can just drive there anyway.",
          "Great views of Fuji! There are some nice shops with good souvenirs as well.  Don't forget to try the black eggs; they'll add seven years to your life ;) Don't worry, they taste just like the regular eggs you're used to. They also have black \u2026",
          "Bus ride up to the top was not the most comfortable. The view was great and it was about 10 degrees colder than the base. Smells like sulfur but worth seeing.",
          "I recommend taking the ropeway up. You will get to see a great view of the mountains and Owakundani! Once you reach the top, there's a small tourist center and restaurant, as well as a geological museum. After admiring the crater, we were done since there's not much else to do at the top.",
          "Interesting place with active volcanic zone where sulfurous fumes rise from the ground. Get here using the Hakone Ropeway because hiking is not advisable due to the sulfur gas. Try the sulfur black eggs claimed to extend one's life. There's also a nice vantage point to view Mt Fuji",
          "I'm glad that Owakudani is open to public once again after the typhoon. The smell of sulphur isn't as strong as expected. The place is super windy so it's very cold. It rains during my visit so I can't view the magnificent Mount Fuji from afar. The black egg is overrated but you'll still buy it anyway.",
          "Awesome spot. The pass for this place is worth it. You can see the sulphur gas coming from the mountain. Museum is a good place for spending time and knowing about the mountain and it's origin. The lake is pretty big. The shrine spot for taking pic is pretty crowded. It's very amazing place",
          "Coming here once is good enough for me, not regretting, but just look at something unusual.",
          "Getting there and being there were two completely different yet exciting experiences. If you want to see and active conglomeration of mounts as Hakone is, and you also enjoy the smell os sulfur, then pay this place a visit.",
          "Definitely worth going. There are great views to see. I recommend eating the black ice cream and the black sulfur eggs.",
          "If the weather is good, I would recommend riding the ropeway to Owakudani. We went on a clear weather day and the view of Mt. Fuji was truly beautiful. The activity of the mountain was interesting to see too! It does smell like sulphur, \u2026",
          "Don't miss place if you come you kanto! The stinky sulfur smell will definitely make your trip unforgettable :)",
          "Great views of Mt Fuji and an unusual volcanic landscape. Sulfuric gases vent through the ground so the air smells sulfuric as a result. Interesting place to visit. Walking tracks currently closed off for safety due to a small eruption in 2015.",
          "Love this place. Awesome geothermal hotspot and the food is pretty good. Definitely a fan of the blackened eggs cooked in the sulphur rich waters. \n\nIt's worth checking before you go if the walkway is open and closed. But even if it's closed there's enough things to do locally to justify the visit. ",
          "Chilling winds will suggest gloves and mufflers",
          "Nice view of mt Fuji here",
          "A unique view and a must see place. Completely worth going there. Well the view from the ropeway is way better than the view you get when you go out into that area",
          "Beautiful landscape from the station. Just be careful about the timing for your visit or you might end up with mist ruining the views for you.",
          "Awesome view of Mt Fuji's peak right outside the restaurant where they sell the famous black eggs",
          "Unique geologic area, where soil is neon yellow and huge steam clouds are projected in the air. The whole area could have a way better layout to enjoy the views. Be careful, cloudy day = no view.",
          "Great place with plenty to see and do. The cable cars offer fantastic views of the woodlands and when we got to the top we got a great view of Mount Fuji and tried black eggs",
          "This is amazing spot to see the sulphur gases and enjoy the black eggs ( taste just like normal egg) . Do take note of the timing of last cable car",
          "Amazing! We saw it on a cloudy day so you couldn't see Fuji buy the view of the hot spring water being collected is worth the trip alone. Also take the train there for Hakone Yumoto for one of the steepest train rides on earth. Your clothes and skin will stink of sulphur for a few days after",
          "Awesome experience, I only have good things to say about this place!",
          "Black eggs Really good taste \nJapanese people says that eggs are giving good hope in future. Also place is so good to see .",
          "When I came here, unfortunately the hiking trail was closed. But I still could have some good time here.\nThis place is recommended to go:)",
          "This place was good for a visit, I would of liked to do a walk here but we didn't have time. We ate the black eggs though, which was ok - they taste a bit funny but I expected that.",
          "Magnificent view of Lake Ashi on the way down from the rope way. But obviously the place is the bomb for a view of Mt Fuji.",
          "Nice view of Mount Fuji in the clear days. Easy transportation.\n\nThe route to the hot spring is occasionally closed due to extreme dry weather.",
          "The sulphur mining is not as active as Indonesia Mount Ijen but it is surely more scenic and managed.",
          "Strong stench of sulphur but incredible scenery! Well worth a look. Museum interesting and kid friendly. Unfortunately hiking trail was closed when we went - worth checking ahead of time if possible.",
          "Awesome natural sights! I",
          "Must go especially during March. Not too cold, still snowing, great views.",
          "Awesome place! The museum is pretty cool. Can eat black eggs that are boiled on site turning the shell black on the outside. The inside looks and tastes as a 'typical' egg. Several photo opportunities also",
          "Such a beautiful place! Black egg is worth a try!",
          "Please try black eggs (500\u00a5/5 eggs), it\u2019s special I think.",
          "Best place to visit in Japan.. travelled by train a wonderful experience reaching Hakone and then by electic Bus to Lake Asahi after that unforgettable travel by waterways in a ship which was well crafted.. then the best one to reach here was by ropeways",
          "Natural sulphur mines. Worth a visit. Has a clear and beautiful view of Mount Fuji. Must try the black Egg and black Ice cream.",
          "Volcanoes areas...sulfur smell all over the place. Not a very good view .but sell black eggs which are so famous .",
          "Hokone must visit prime place...\nRope way cable car views are \ud83d\ude0d\nVolcano views and Fuji san view",
          "Although it doesn't smell too good, the view is pretty amazing with all the smoke in the background. The volcano black eggs are certainly an experience but they do not taste any different from boiled eggs",
          "The best way to see Fuji with out going on the mountain. The volcanic rocks are Interesting and smell of sulfur. If you are in the area, it\u2019s worth a stop.",
          "A very nice stop to make if you are taking the cable car ! They have beautiful scene of the methane mountains,  food, charcoal ice cream (black ice cream) and much more",
          "This is my second time here. Last time I couldn't go closer the crater due to sulfuric gases.\n\nDon't buy the black ice cream here. It's vanilla ice cream with black coloring. And it's expensive too. You can find delicious black sesame ice cream at Hakone-machi, where the pirate ship docks.",
          "One of the most famous tourist destination in Hakone. Unfortunately it's closed and access prohibited due to volcanic activity. It may last for years...",
          "Nice place but you can't go very close like before. You can only be right near the parking lot. Used to be you could walk up the hill and get real close to the geysers.",
          "It is a wonderful place .. please check weather ... Before you go.. If it is going to snow.. or rain.. please avoid....pack yourself in winter clothes if travelling in winter's",
          "Such a wonderful place! Located on the top of the Hakone Mountain. Once you reached there, you will sense the sulfer due to the mountain is an active complex volcano. There are several souvenirs shops and restaurants available up there as well.",

          "It was fun but how you get up there was too annoying",
          "sulphur spot with life giving egg",
          "It took so long to get here from Hakone. Plus the queues for the train were huge. The volcanic valley is interesting and it's a great view of Fuji if there's no cloud, which there was. Not worth the journey unless you actually get 7 years extra life for eating the black eggs.",
          "7 times 7 times 7 times... How many eggs how can you eat?",
          "A must visit place \nWith mount Fuji on the background,  this natural wonder of sulfur spring can't be missed on a Japan trip!",

          "Nice views and good souvenir shops.",
          "The crater of the hakone volcano. Constantly spewing sulphurous gases, but not very noxious. A few souvenir and snack shops are around. Tried the volcano eggs and it tastes like how eggs should taste like. There's a museum on the volcano if interested.",

          "Really nice place to try the black eggs. Supposedly adds 7 years to your life. Great views of a once active volcano. Now it remains hot springs and steamy backdrops",
          "An interesting experience which I would recommend for everyone visitig Hakone. The best way to go up is the ropeway from Gora Station. Once up there you have amazing views of Mt. Fuji. Try the local \"black eggs\" boiled in the volcanic \u2026",
          "Nice view also of Fuji and experience",
          "Perfect look at Mt Fuji in clear weather.  Try the kuro tamago, the eggs cooked in vulcanic hot springs. Come hungry as they sell them in 5-packs.",
          "Peaceful boat trip from Hakone followed by a cable car ride to the volcano  crater. The noise of the escaping gas is quite eerie.\nBeware if you have respitory issues.",
          "Amazing place! The entire place reeks of sulphurous fume. You can go to the Geology Museum and learn more about the volcanic eruption at this place. The best option to come to this place would be via ropeway, which is included in the 2/3 day pass to Hakone.",
          "A very strong smell of sulfur and the maddening crowds can be a real pitfall, however, the views are simply spectacular. Make sure to leave for this site as early in the day as possible as it can become so busy that line ups for cable cars \u2026",
          "View of Mt Fuji was fantastic. The pungent smell from the sulphur can be a bit offsetting. Do head up at least half an hour before closing if you want to walk around, eat, and shop at the top.",
          "If you're in hakone, definitely come check this place out. Trying the black egg is not a must but everyone there will be eating it. Before going make sure to research about the location, because if you have respiratory problems it's not \u2026",

          "Feel too close to the volcano. full of a bad smell of sulfur.",
          "It was cool to see the smoke coming out of the vents. and if you are lucky, you might be treated with a view of Mt Fuji!",
          "An impressive sight if you're passing over the mountain by ropeway but I wouldn't make it a stop for the sake of itself. There are so many other scenic spots and things to see around Hakone.",
          "Good experience to see live volcano. And black egg was also new thing for us.",
          "Great place to visit. Amazing restaurants. The ticket area for cable car is very confusing and staff doesn't know english. Make sure to get black eggs on ur visit.",

          "Amazing experience on top of a volcano in activity. Quite impressive !",
          "It's a fun place to visit. The rope way gave a unique and beautiful view of the got springs with sulfur fumes. On the day we visited, we also got a glimpse of Fujiyama! \n\nThere's also a few different stores selling street food. We tried the black ice cream and black egg. \n\nDefinitely visit this if you are in Hakone.",

          "Nice view. If you visit in the volcano museum, you don't have to take the English auto guide as all the exhibition iteas are in English",
          "Quite a view, and an interesting experience to have the black eggs. You must try! Ropeway from lake side is closed so we had to drive. Drive is easy, there was guidance about parking near the top. Definitely would recommend.",
          "Definitely a place to visit if you are in the area! If the skies are clear, you can contemplate Mt. Fuji in the backdrop too.",

          "Very special experience.",

          "I think it's a fun destination and worth a trip. Especially via the ropeway/cablecars. \nThe black eggs weren't as prominent as I thought, you gotta search a little to buy it. meh.\nThe ice creams were nice!\n\nVery nice views of the mountain \u2026",

          "This was so much fun! I think the crazy wind made it exciting. We initially tried to go up the trolley but made it to the first stopped and had to go back down because of the strong winds. We got back down, got in the car and drove up \u2026",

          "Not sure I understand the appeal of this spot! There is some geothermal activity, but only viewable from a distance. Does not compare to other geothermal parks I've visited - no colourful sulfur lakes or geisers, just some plumes of smoke \u2026",
          "Quite average, especially with a bad visibility. If you have a car no need to use a lift. Or at least park for free at the middle station. Black eggs taste just like regular hard boiled eggs, nothing special unless you believe each one add + 7 years to your life)",

          "Because of the open crater, Sulphuric smell is very dominant here. However, the view is good and you can enjoy geological museum for a mere 100\u00a5. The infamous black egg also is sold here but the flavor is same with similar egg.",

Worst experience so far in Japan!",

          "An absolutely brilliant day out...if you want to spend the rest of your life queuing for nothing. There's simply no escape, it's just one giant demonic tourist trap of a queue. You will perish here. Anyone giving this 5 stars is clearly very happy with their new life on the mountain as a skeleton.",

          "Spend 1-2 hours is a gpod idea if you are close",
          "Not much to do here other than enjoy the view (not smell!) of the sulfur holes in the volcanic mountain, as well as a nice view of Mount Fuji if the weather is good. There's quite a large souvenir shop where you can get black eggs for 100 yen a piece. Bring a coat, it's cold and windy even though Hakone was quite warm (mid september).",

        "wiki": "Odawara (\u5c0f\u7530\u539f\u5e02, Odawara-shi) is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.\nAs of February 2015, the city had an estimated population of 194,672, and a population density of 1,710 persons per km2. The total area is 113.79 km2.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area around present-day Odawara has been settled since prehistoric times, and archaeological evidence indicates that the area had a high population density in the J\u014dmon period.\nFrom the Ritsury\u014d system of the Nara period, the area became part of Ashigarashimo District of Sagami Province. It was divided into sh\u014den during the Heian period, mostly controlled by the Hatano clan and its branches. During the Genpei War between the Heike clan and Minamoto no Yoritomo, the Battle of Ishibashiyama was fought near present-day Odawara. During the Sengoku period, Odawara developed as a castle town and capital of the domains of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan, which covered most of the Kant\u014d region. The H\u014dj\u014d were defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Battle of Odawara in 1590, despite the impregnable reputation of Odawara Castle. The territory came under the control of Tokugawa Ieyasu.\nUnder the Tokugawa shogunate, Odawara was the center of Odawara Domain, a feudal han ruled by a succession of daimy\u014d. The castle town prospered as Odawara-juku, a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Odawara Domain briefly became 'Odawara Prefecture', which was merged with the short-lived 'Ashigara Prefecture' before joining Kanagawa Prefecture in 1876. During this period, the center of economic and political life in Kanagawa shifted to Yokohama. Odawara suffered a strong decline in population, which was made more severe when the original route of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line bypassed the city in favor of the more northerly route via Gotemba.\nThe epicenter of the Great Kant\u014d earthquake in 1923 was deep beneath Izu \u014cshima Island in Sagami Bay. It devastated Tokyo, the port city of Yokohama, surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka Prefectures, and caused widespread damage throughout the Kant\u014d region. Ninety percent of the buildings in Odawara collapsed immediately, and fires burned the rubble along with anything else left standing.Odawara regained some measure of prosperity with the opening of the Tanna Tunnel in 1934, which brought the main routing of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line through the city. Odawara was raised from the status of town to city on December 20, 1940. On August 15, 1945, Odawara was the last city in Japan to be bombed by Allied aircraft during World War II.\nOn November 1, 2000, Odawara exceeded 200,000 in population, and was proclaimed a special city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nOdawara lies in the Ashigara Plains, in the far western portion of Kanagawa Prefecture. It is bordered by the Hakone Mountains to the north and west, the Sakawa River to the east, and Sagami Bay of the Pacific Ocean to the south.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\nMinamiashigara\nNinomiya\n\u014ci, Kaisei, Nakai\nHakone, Manazuru, Yugawara\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nOdawara is a major commercial center for western Kanagawa Prefecture.

          "A easy and fun place to tour around. We drove and had a easy and close parking lot to the castle. Inside the castle walls there is plenty of restrooms, a restaurant, vending machines and things to do. Castle was nicely made into a tour with artifacts. The Samurai museum was",
          "I was there in the evening, unfortunately, the castle was closed at that time. Anyway, even from outside castle looks great. It is built on the hill, about 500 meters from the Odawara station, so it is easily accessible from shinkansen. It is enough to left the station using",
          "Odawara Castle is the third tallest of ten castles in Japan. It's about 800 meters from the train station. A nice walk with directions to get to the castle. Best time ti visit, I think is the end of March. There is over 35,000 cherry trees in bloom. The castle is a lot of",
          "Odawara is a short 25 minute Shinkansen ride from Tokyo station and about a 10 minute easy walk from Odawara station. The 3 tier 5 story castle is beautifully surrounded by cherry trees",
          "This is an important castle, close to Hakone and the nearest to Tokyo. It was a well defended castle on the Tokaido when the Hojo clan held off the unifying forces of the Shogun. The castle was rebuilt after damage and destruction more recently and offers good views from the top",
          "Visited Odawara Castle after a few hectic days in Tokyo. It was a pleasant escape from the pace & noise of Shinjuku. It is a lovely older area with some very quaint shops. We used this is as a stop point for a quick bullet train adventure from Tokyo. The Castle is amazing,",
          "The interactive ninja museum was worth the 300 yen entrance fee. We're adults and had just as much fun as the kids running around. There's not a lot of English but the staff tried where they could. The samurai museum was interesting. The views from the top of the tower were",
          "We had a quick visit to odawara from hakone going back to tokyo. We only get to visit the castle and the mall near the station. It is a short walk from the station. And we really enjoyed going up the castle and looking at the historical displays inside.",

          "I did a weekend out of Tokyo, Gora & Hakone-Yumoto, overnight in Odawara, then onto Kamakura and back to Tokyo. Gora wasn't worth it, I'll write about that elsewhere. Hakone-Yumoto & Kamakura were great. But let me get to the point. I kicked off early with Odawara castle, after",

          "It was my first castle and it was beautiful and impressive, the castle also houses a museum explaining it's history, but most of it will be in japanese, still in my opinion it is worth stopping by if you are passing through Odawara and have the time.",
          "This castle had been rebuilt, as the original had been burnt down. Not a very steep walk but nice to see. There is plenty of shaded areas around the castle, and there is a cage of monkeys that can keep the kids occupied.",

          "This castle is beautiful. Pure white. The tour inside is fantastic. The surrounding grounds beautiful. The walk up to it is lovely. Plenty of shopping nearby.",
          "Odawara Castle was a great day trip! It is only a 20 min ride on the Shinkansen from the Yokohama/Toyko area and it is very close to the station. The place is very family friendly, just not for strollers. The grounds are wide open with lots of tables to stop and eat or rest",

          "quite difficult to reinvent a review The place is a landmark of japanese history As such it\u2019s a must see if you are around The museum- castle provides great view of the city and good insight of life at 13-16 centuries Highly recommended",
          "Very convenient to the railway station in Odawara, this old castle set amid splendid grounds typifies a fortified structure, smaller than most in Japan. It was originally a Doi stronghold in the 15th c. later taken over by the Hojo clan of samurai. The keep affords stunning",
          "we stopped by Odawara Castle enroute to Hakone. It was the tail-end of the sakura season but it was still very beautiful and picturesque. Big grounds to explore and have a picnic. Theres an opportunity to dress up as ninja, samurai or Japanese princess for 300yen / child.",
          "Went on a solo visit during the week while kids were at school. Small castle compared to others in Japan, but very enjoyable. I went during the week so there were no crowds at all, barely any people. Quite a lot of exhibits to learn about the history of the castle, history of",
          "Beautiful castle in the Sakura season. Only 10-15min walk from the train station. You can easily spend a good hour or two there.",
          "I strongly recommend to visit this place with a nice castle . I did the visit during sakura period with nice cherry blossoms \ud83c\udf38 . Moreover it is close to the train station, no excuse not visiting it !",
          "It ls small but beautiful-looking castle that has been turned into a museum. It is about fifteen minutes walk from the Odawara Station. It cost 500 yen to enter. This is the cherry blossoms season, so there are lots of cherry blossoms to see on the way to the castle as well as",
          "Odawara is a great very local authentic town. Fun to walk around local streets and see how the people live.",

          "The \"White Castle\" and grounds are beautiful, particularly now that the cherry and plum blossoms are popping so there are some great photo opportunities. Most of the castle has been restored, so not a lot of \"original\" castle left. It is kind of cool if you've never seen a",
          "This a Japanese castle is small compare to other , it has bing rebuild and the main tower has a great view of the city and the sea. The gardens around it are beautiful. This attraction is enough to do for an afternoon if you take the time to walk all of it.",
          "For those who has visited other castles in Japan, this is just ok. I was with foreign friends who had never seen a Japanese castle, so it's kind of interesting to them. For those who have seen the others like Himeji castle, this is probably not interesting especially if one does",
          "This is one of the main castles in Japan which is situated in Odawara of Kanagawa Prefecture. If you travel to Gotemba, Atami or Hakone area from Tokyo, this could be a good stop.",
          "Not crowded which made it all the more enjoyable. Wish more of the exhibits were in English. Really enjoyed our time here. The Samurai Museum while small was worth the money.",
          "This is an excellent place to visit if you like Samurai history and castles,The gates and ramparts are awesome, you get sense what it would be like to attack the place in the Edo period.You can walk up to the highest balcony and see all around including the Pacific ocean, there",
          "Beautiful landmark to visit, the museum is very impressive despite being small. Children's amusement Park is very cute, our daughter loved the small train ride.",
          "We walked around and did not have time to go inside the castle itself, but enjoyed our evening stroll as the sun set. Much more impressive than I was expecting.",
          "This beautiful castle has been rebuilt from scratch several years ago. Obviously it has lost its essence and authenticity but it still worth it! The information inside is mainly in Japanese and the few information available in English is not well written and not enough",
          "The castle is no doubt a magnificent site to behold, but I was very upset by the majestic monkeys who were kept in a tiny dirty cage with very little entertainment. Their conditions were in stark contrast to the beautiful surroundings where there is lush nature and hot water. If",
          "Can be easily reached. A very cool Japanese castle. Not very large and the tower house is located at the highest point of the site. Free-of-charge till you get inside the Castle Tower. With nice sitting areas on the fields inside the castle wall. Very relax and peaceful.",
          "We stopped here on the way back from Hakone to Tokyo, as the castle was only less than 10 mins walk from the Odawara Station. The interior is a recent reconstruction, but unlike many other similar castles, the rooms feel spacious and there is an interesting well-done exhibition",
          "We stopped here coincidentaly on our way back from Hakone national park. Are we glad we did! Even compered to other castles we\u2019ve seen during the trip (and we\u2019ve seen many!), this was our top three favorite. It has an impressive view from the top of the castle and even being",

          "You have to stop in Odawara station to change trains on the way to Hakone if you are using a Japan Rail pass. This castle is only a 15 minute easy walk from the station. Good if you have extra time and the sky is blue. The castle itself is relatively small, but there is a good",
          "A fantastic restoration project and building. It is mostly a museum dedicated to the mediaeval history of Japan, which makes sense given that it\u2019s a castle. The restaurant just outside the castle is also pretty good. Sadly, I missed out as detailed information on signs around",
          "It was raining when we visited and they even had a discount on rainy days! We stayed there for around 1.5hrs, not a big castle, unlike Osaka Castle.",
          "If you are an avid lover of Samurai and the history of the shogunate, then this castle offers a glimpse of their collection. It is quite a small museum on an expansive ground. Nothing much, really.",
          "Odawara Castle is Odawara's iconic symbol and is a \"thing of beauty\" particularly on a sunny day, as it photographs beautifully under the sun. It's an easy day out trip from Tokyo. From the station, you can walk along Ohoribata Street, right from the station exit, then you see",
          "Very interesting and definitely worth the visit if you\u2019re in the area. A lot of care has been taken to preserve the site which is great to see.",
          "Odawara Castle, like so many other castles in Japan, is typical. It's there, a nice place to see, but nothing really stands out as being magnificent. I truly expected to see a more serene place, more peaceful and better kept, but hey, its the way life is in Japan now a",
          "Arriving at the station, we decided to go to the Odowara Castle, only 10 min walk. Ones we arrived, we say the beautiful castle. We were a little bit disappointed as it\u2019s not an original castle. Nice to see, but that\u2019s it. We were the only tourists at 9.30 am, what was nice",
          "The inside of the castle is converted to a museum. It\u2019s nice, but it\u2019s just the same as the other castles in Japan. If you\u2019ve never been to any castle in Japan maybe you should visit this castle but somehow if you\u2019ve been to the other place, probably a bigger castle; this one",
          "Odawara Castle is walking distance from the station. We were there killing time before our shinkansen to Osaka. Walking to Odawara Castle is a treat. Nice restaurants. There are tiles on the floor telling you you're near the castle. The place itself is big. You have various",
          "A highlight of our trip to Odawara. This might sound obvious, but this is a real castle (rebuilt after an earthquake) on real castle grounds, which means it's not just the main building but the surrounding areas that are fascinating to explore, including a temple, moat, kids",
          "It is very beautiful in the sakura season with the white backdrop. It is recently rebuilt. Nothing much to see inside the building. But you can go to the top and see outside.",
          "I visited this Castle due to close proximity to Odawara station with in walking distance. Ideal tour within limited time if u wish to ride the amazing Shinkansen from Tokyo to Odawara & back within a few hours. I was very satisfied",
          "Using train to go to odawara station and walk around 10 minutes here.. must go during spring seasons..",
          "This rebuilt Castle stands on the foundations of an original shogun domain - destroyed by earthquake/fire in early 1900\u2019s. The grounds are truly spectacular, especially during \ud83c\udf52 blossom week which we were very fortunate to see. I would recommend this attraction for any age.",
          "We were having a wonderful time visiting the castle area up until we saw a small cage with lots of monkeys inside it. They looked sad and miserable and such cruelty made me want to cry. I wrote an email to the castle info team hoping they get this feedback and that it wasn\u2019t the",
          "I am so sad to say, I went Odawara castle but there are very few English panel for the display historical items.",
          "The castle and ground themselves are pretty, though nothing spectacular. What really stuck with me and my partner though was the conditions the monkeys were kept in. It was a tiny dirty enclosure and the monkeys were clearly distressed and showing signs of boredom. Not",
          "Well-maintained castle of Edo-type construction. Some good history of the Shoganate period (including a suit of armour you can pretend you are wearing) and good shop. Probably not worth a special trip out unless you were passing anyway.",
          "Odawa castel is an impressive building with an interesting history. I visited the Castel with a Japanese friend, so that I got a better insight meaning translation. Without his help it would have been difficult or expensive. There is an app to be downloaded, which gives for iOS",
          "Beautiful grounds and the reconstructed Castle Tower provides amazing insight and information about the history of the Edo period. The surrounding gardens are picturesque and the Castle with 5 floors fills the landscape. Excellent views from the 5th floor observation deck. Some",
          "Feb 17, 2018 was selected to participate in a Fuma Ninja Event held at the grounds of Odawara Castle. From Shimbashi, local trains cost JPY1490 (one way, around US$14.00) and 1-1/2 hours. Came early before the event and walked around the beautiful, peaceful castle grounds, there",
          "I really liked visiting the white castle...super maintained...nice gardens full of old trees and flowers...you can go in the caste and have a view of the city...a worthy trip to Odawara",
          "this castle is not in my plan,i pass by it when i visit other place,i didn't spend too much time in there and it was evening,still have great time in there",
          "The castle is fine, but he real bonus is you can get the bullet train! 45 minutes from Tokyo station and experience the amazing ride. We landed at 6, dropped our luggage off and headed out. Two tips: get back to Odawara station 15 minutes before your train so can can see the",
          "The castle is very imposing and of great interest but the tour group I travelled with were all stunned by the shockingly pitiful sight of caged monkeys within a small, bare concrete enclosure. So disappointing to see such inhumane treatment anywhere these days but especially in",
          "Go there on your way to an onsen in hakone yumoto if you have time. From the top of the castle you can see the sea. Be sure to sample some satsuma-age (fish cakes).",
          "Very cool both for the history and the amazing view from the top of the tower. I always wish this type of museum would use more of the living history approach. Not that they need interpreters, it would just be better if they had the castle tower renovated to its original state,",
          "We went early so the crowds were less. Though this castle is rebuilt it has a lot of historical value in Japanese history. Many meetings and battles, it\u2019s quite nice view from the top and some nice displays throughout though everything is in Japanese so unless you have a guide",
          "odawara castle is easily done as a sidetrip before hakone. an underrated castle since it has been superseded by the likes of nagoya, osaka, himeji, matsumoto and kumamoto castles. it is merely a 10 minute 1 km walk from odawara station amidst a calm charming town of odawara.",
          "The castle looked majestic from outside and just as beautiful inside. Exhibition were mostly about the Odawara era I guess. Not much info in English was available. There's a lot of stairs climbing needed to be done to arrive at the top floor. View were amazing of the city and",
          "It\u2019s a very pretty castle with lots of history. Even though we already knew it\u2019s a replica, still can\u2019t help to be a little disappointed when we saw the very modern interior. Despite so, we enjoyed all the exhibitions throughout the castle. There\u2019s a lot of information on the",
          "A reconstructed/ restored castle based on the models and related drawings during the Edo period. Beautiful castle with a long history of war and changing of ownership during those times. Great place to walk about and visit. Love the magnificent view at the top surrounded by",
          "Can\u2018t compare to other castles like Himeiji, Osaka, Aizu Wakamatsu, Kanazawa. So if you know the above mentionend you would be deceived by Odawarajo. If you want to see it, go there during Sakura and/or combine it with another sightseeing spot",

          "This was a very beautiful and informational way to spend the morning. Lots of open space and nice walking. It's also free with paid entry to some more specific attractions. \n\nI did think some of the reconstruction seemed dubious based on \u2026",
          "Best place to visit if you are near from odawara city. The castle has build in traditional japanese style architecture.",

They look so skinny&sad & Hot inside, even water doesn\u2019t look so clean, it was so sad!!! \nHopefully they find a good solution for monkeys!",
          "A phenomenal example of a beautiful reconstruction of a historical Japan castle!  The complex on a whole is remarkable and it was easy to spend hours there exploring the museum and all the artifacts throughout. There was so much to see and \u2026",
          "Such a beautiful sight, went with my Japanese friend and absolutely loved it. I recommend going there during the blooming of Sakura (cherry blossom). I would go again.",
          "We went on December 31st, it was closed but the English website wasn't updated \ud83d\ude06 But we still enjoyed the surroundings since it does have a shrine and it has a park for little ones if you have children in your party. They have restrooms outside and there is a parking in front of the castle. Spoiler \u26a0\ufe0f monkeys!",
          "Not as grand as the Osaka castle (in fact it is 7th in terms of size but the history oozing from this castle makes it all worth it.\n\nWish I had a chance to get a photo in full samurai outfit.\n\nCheck out the view from the top.",
          "Cool castle, worth a visit if you are transferring trains in Odawara. There are lockers in the station and at the castle to store your stuff and it's a short walk from the station. There is also and amusement park and samurai costume things \u2026",

          "Beautiful castle set in the foothills of the Japanese mountains. Much of the museum is not in English, but is still worth the 500 yen for the view from the top of the castle. Best if you go on a clear day.",
          "Nice if not particularly authentic reconstruction of a Sengoku period castle.  Akaganemon reconstruction is supposedly authentic however.",
          "Well maintained castle within walking distance from Odawara station. If u are not a fan of museums, go to the top of the castle for a panaromic view of the surroundings.",
          "Very cool castle. Not what I expected but in a good way. Learned a lot of history, just wished there was some type English subtitles in the theater portion. Loved the fact that my family and I were able to make our on coin. Price for the \u2026",

          "Castle has been renovated. Nothing much written in English.",

          "Definitely a beautiful spot to visit. Give yourself enough time to wander around and explore the castle and its surroundings. You can also dress up in traditional clothes and take a nice photo.",
          "The samurai museum nearby is more. Interesting",
          "Absolutely beautiful location. Not hard to find from Odawara station. Inside the castle is a museum detailing the castles (and Japans) history.",
          "Loved the castle and the history... did not love the animals in the tiny cage. Dampened my appreciation for the entire visit.",
          "Excellent place but closing time is 4-5pm. Those who want to understand Japanese battle history this is good place",
          "Smaller Castle compared to more famous ones around Japan.\n\nA nice place to spend some time and get a view of the city from an elevated point.\n\nAlthough the castle itself isn't large, it has a good proportion of artifacts from the time when \u2026",

          "Nice castle on the way to Hakone. Less than 1km from Odawara station. Looks great from the outside. Inside is not original wooden construction, it's been rebuilt and hosts a museum about the castle and the warring states period of Japan. \u2026",

          "Nice place to visit. If you\u2019re history lover then it is a must visit place in Kanagawa prefecture, Japan. However, almost every details in Japanese. So, if you don\u2019t know Japanese, going with Japanese guide will be better.",
          "A really beautiful place to visit. Super interesting history. Also a great selection of souvenirs. Highly recommended.",

          "Interesting information on Warring-States-Era \"Japan\" and a pleasant surrounding park. However, even the extra 100 yen one pays for additional entrance to the samurai museum is not really worth it. It's just one room of displays of armor and swords presented with little context.",
          "A great little \u2018reconstruction\u2019 of a Japanese castle - conveniently on the way to Hakone (if you have a car). Nicely done and very close to Tokyo if you don\u2019t have the chance to go elsewhere. Very nice grounds around there.",

        "wiki": "Hakone (\u7bb1\u6839\u753a, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of June 2012, the town had an estimated population of 13,492, and a population density of 145 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi). Hakone has been designated as a Japanese National Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Network.\nHakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mt. Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nOdawara\nYugawara\nMinami-ashigaraShizuoka Prefecture\n\nGotemba\nSusono\nMishima\nOyama\nKannami\n\n\n== History ==\nHakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the Hakone Checkpoint (\u7bb1\u6839\u95a2\u6240, Hakone sekisho), which formed the border of the Kant\u014d region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T\u014dkaid\u014d were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons.\nAfter the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake.\nAfter merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active \u014cwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights.\nHakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art.\nMajor events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T\u014dkaid\u014d road.\nOne famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods.\nA noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi.Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town. In 2017, Hakone was included as one of 88 anime pilgrimage sites for 2018 by the Anime Tourism Association. In 2020, new decorations have been introduced to the city in the anticipation of the release of the final film of the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nHakone Tozan Railway\nHakone Tozan Cable Car\nHakone Ropeway\nIzuhakone RailwayOdawara and Mishima, the terminus of the Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, 70 minutes from Shinjuku, Tokyo.

          "This was such a fun activity. The kids loved the feel of being on a \"pirate ship\" and we loved the views on Lake Ashi. It was a cloudy day so we did not get to see Fuji, but being on the lake with moutains all around was still a pretty fantastic feeling. If you get the Hakone",
          "It can get crowded on the boat and the lines to get on start a bit early. The 500 yen upgrade area was about empty from what I could see and boarded first so can be worth it. There is a bit of drinks and items to purchase. If you don\u2019t get a seat your on the desk which is fine",
          "Bought a round trip and an officious purser tried to throw us off one jetty today soon. Really spoiled the trip.",
          "A good way to get from point A to point B, and a pretty good view of Mt. Fuji (on cloudless days). Very crowded, but the interior of the ship is well-maintained and clean. Note: The famous gate is actually very small a quite far from the ship.",
          "We get free ride with the hakone pass, worth purchase if you are tourist. The cruise finishes early though around 4pm in winter so don\u2019t miss the last ride. Fast way to travel from south to north.",

          "The pirate boats are new and well kept and the cruise was very calm. We went on a good day and had excellent view of the Lake and Mt Fuji. We could also see the captain piloting the ship and he took his job very seriously. There was a cafe on board and for those with yen to",

          "With the Hakone free pass, this is well worth it. Takes you to the Togendai station, from which you can take the ropeway up to Owakudani, and back. You can use the free pass multiple times on both ropeways and cruise. Was lucky to have been on the ship during a great weather,",
          "I felt a bit silly getting onto a pretend pirate ship, it seemed like something you would do with children, but once on board it was fairly easy to forget the boat you were on. We had hoped for good views of Mount Fuji but it was covered in cloud which was disappointing, however",
          "Went via the pirate ship (which is free with the Hakone pass) to get to the ropeway to go up the mountain and down the other side to Gora. It was such a serene and relaxing trip with amazing wilderness just sliding past quietly.",

          "We had fantastic weather so the views of Mount Fuji from the lake were the highlight. Interesting way to cross Lake Ashi. Pirate ship themed boat. Plenty of views from the lake, shrine and of course Mount Fuji. We did the short gentle crossing from pier to pier, but it does",
          "We paid the extra money to take the pirate ship round-trip cruise around Lake Ashinoko. There is a cheaper boat cruise available from a different dock, but we (well, I) wanted to try the pirate ship. It was fun to be on the top deck and see the sights. There is a bar on board",
          "The trip was organised and a good sized boat decked out like a pirate ship. Unfortunately for us there was thick mist and rain so we were unable to see very much. It was a bit like being at home in Scotland except warmer. We had hoped to get views of Mount Fuji alas the weather",
          "You can't miss this when you are going to hakone. There is two stop using bus, but I suggest you take hakone-machiko bus stop to get into the pirate cruise. You will get down at Motohakone and you can walk to see the torii gate in lake ashi. It kind far 1.2km but it's worth it.",

          "Yes, the cruise was all ok, but it\u2019s just part of the manufactured process of moving tourists through the Hakone area in a bit of a loop. And when you have the pass that includes the cruise and you have some time, then why not? The cruise would have been a lot more special if",
          "The cruise is free if you are holding a Hakone free pass. The ships will make a complete tour of the lake with amazing view on the wonderful nature.",

          "We took the cruise (it was free for pass holders) to get to the other side of Lake Ashi which is known for getting a view of Mt Fuji. You could also get a view from the ship. However, we weren't lucky. It gets crowded with not sufficient seating for everyone. The views in Autumn",
          "We enjoyed our trip on the boat while in the area although the sceywas not as good as we thought as the trees were not in leaf. We did not get off at the end but did around trip and went back to the start as we want to go bake to Hakone",

          "Not sure really about the pirate theme as the crew just sailed the boat but best that they concentrated on the task in hand as there was no safety briefing and no visible signs of any emergency equipment. Pleasant 30 minutes crossing the lake. Pirate ship additions to the boat",
          "Don\u2019t go Nothing to see Just a packed boat on a lake No commentary Avoid at all costs People push and stare at you And talk lound",
          "The hakone free rail pass includes this. It is an awesome experience. You can go to the top deck which is open and around noon time in March you get good tolerable weather.",
          "You can take an Odakyu Bus from Gotemba or Shinjuku to Togendai-ko (port) with many stops in between. At Togendai, check the TV screen for sightseeing cruise timing, it has a 30-40mins frequency! Once on the ship, you can get seats in economy class and it will most likely",

          "Sometimes it stops operating if there is heavy snowfall the day before, due to ice on the deck. We arrive early March, had to wait 3 days before we could go onboard.",
          "This is a great transport to connect between Moto Hakone to Togendai During our travel, Mt Fuji is visible and you can take as many picture as you want. The ride are smooth and the service is great.",
          "This was a fun adventure while in the Hakone area on Lake Ashi. The company operates several of these modern recreation pirate ships that sail daily across the lake. Worth while going on if in the area. The ship was amazing to see and are quite detailed. BOTTOM LINE: Do it!",
          "We went there last November 2018. We booked the Hakone Free Pass from Klook which made our trip easier. The ship was nice and you can take different photos of the beautiful scenery in Lake Ashi.",

          "Pretty views however I did feel it was a little too crowded, and infrequent (40 mins) so if you plan to disembark at a stop or two best to get an early start.",
          "The cruise was comfortable. If not for the rain, wind and cold, we would have sat at the upper deck and enjoyed the awesome view. Do catch the earlier timing cruise during winter as it gets dark after 4pm.",
          "Did this as part of the hakone free pass and it was great, probably would not have done it if it wasn\u2019t included in the free pass but it was great to have a view from the lake, and fantastic views of mt Fuji from here.",
          "If you are looking at scenery, take the deck. In the hold, you will not be able to see much scenery and the boat ride becomes a chore. So if you want to take some cool pictures, go up to the deck.",
          "Suggest start your day early so avoid the crowd. Travel in between from rope rail stn to makamoto, follow the sightseeing path as suggested by local travel guide. Best viewing with normal ticket rather than vip seat for better viewing. You can see the mt fuji in this boat from",
          "We took a round trip ride from Motohakone-ko. The boat was clean and provided a commentary of the sights shpping the route it took to the 2 other stops/towns on Lake Ashi. Unfortunately we were short of time else we would love to got off to explore the two little towns.",
          "Take this cruise from Togendai pier to Motohakone Pier take around 15 - 30 minute. the Scenery was great and you can see the Tori gate (temple gate) in the lakeside. i recommend you to buy the hakone free pass at Odakyu Mall Shinjuku for the best price. you will have a free",
          "This is a lovely way to cross Lake Ashi, included as part of the Hakone travel pass. It was too cloudy for us to see Mount Fuji but we still enjoyed views of the lake, mountains and famous tori. Plenty of seats inside or stand outside.",
          "If u intend to visit Hakone, then to Gotemba Premium outlets and do some sight seeing while u\u2019re here. It is best to buy the Hakone Pass. U can take this sightseeing cruise free if u purchase the Hakone Pass. (Note there are 2 sightseeing cruise, don\u2019t take the one not included",
          "We had the free pass and this was included so it seemed a good way to see a bit more of the area. We caught a fairly late boat (about 3.40 I think) and it was getting dark by the time we reached the end. Not much of a commentary and very hard to hear. Didn't swap ships to see",
          "Lake Ahi is a beautiful lake nestled into a valley--it a skinny little lake that is surrounded with trees that go to the edge of the water. The mode of transportation is described as a \"Viking Ship\" in the brochures, but it is more like a poor reproduction of a pirate ship.",
          "You can see Mount Fuji for a short time from the Motohakone-Ko end but most of the trip is just of the lake itself. Means to an end to get from one end of the lake to the other more than anything.",
          "Covered by the cost of the Hakone Free pass, this is a European-looking ferry that has the function of transporting tourists across the lake. Very functional.",

          "When you see the cruise, you're really impress and hope for a magnificent trip. But it's not really the case. The trip is ok, the views are good, but it's nothing compare with what you'll see from the ropeway. But still, it's the fastest way to go to Hakone after the ropeway.",
          "This trip gets you around Hakone while also showing off the lake\u2019s beautiful scenery. The ship accommodations are just okay, but it\u2019s a relaxing, efficient, and fun trip.",
          "I take the boat to go to the opposite site of the lake. It was great! We saw the lake from another point of view. Unfortunately we were not able to see the mount Fuji but we appreciate it anyway",
          "Their are two types of Hakone sightseeing ferry, the old pirate boat and modern ferry. I surely recommend the pirate boat as it has got amazing views from deck and it's the only ferry which takes you right till the cable trolley station. Modern ferry doesnt go there and hence",
          "Hakone is a beautiful and serene place to visit. The sightseeing cruise was a nice bonus to our visit and very enjoyable.",
          "The cruise is okay, you have to pay extra for First Class, but the lake is beautiful and on a clear day, the views of Fuji must be sublime. Fun for families with small kids, I'm certain.",
          "This boat ride was a fun way to get around to the small villages surrounding the lake and was included in our rail pass. Charming and cute.",
          "The boat was very clean and pretty ! You could see the view of outside everywhere and they explained you little things about the river, and places around.",
          "We took the cruise late in the afternoon on a cloudy day, and so had no chance of seeing Mount Fuji. However, the journey was enjoyable anyway. The lake is so high up in the mountains that we were able to see clouds reaching down to the surface of the water, and the weather is",

          "The pirate ships looked very impressive! The views of Mount Ashi and the Mountains were good. We spent about $50 AUD each for the Tozan Railway, cable car, ropeway and sightseeing cruise which we thought was very reasonable. This was an enjoyable journey!",
          "A cramped ship in the style of a pirate galleon. It is part of the transport network around Hakone but it\u2019s not a highlight in its own right. Reasonable views at best.",
          "If this is a cruise, then it's the biggest rip off in Japan! It's not really a cruise, it's transportation from one side of Lake Ashi to the other. We spent US $80 for a family of five to sail a few minutes from central Hakone to the opposite shore, all so we could partake in",
          "Nice trip to add into the rope way and bus trip. Novelty pirate ship which the children seem to enjoy. The views around the lake are good and the sail gave a good perspective.",
          "Cruise is about 30 minutes long. Water not crowded so you can see sights on shore. Ship is crowded and middle seats are no good for picture taking. To better see and take pictures stand by a door or window.",
          "Its free if u take the hakone pass. Can see the view of mount. Fuji also but it depends on the weather.",
          "Go to the top deck... a Must.. to enjoy the best view of Lake Ashi. Pay extra at the station before boarding approx \u00a5500 for First Class a.k.a. Captain\u2019s Deck... great spot for the \u2018Titanic\u2019 selfie moment. Can also enjoy the ride inside the lower decks especially when it rains",
          "I enjoyed the tour around the lake- even though all the good views of the mountains were covered in fog.",
          "Ultimately, this is just a ferry that gets you from one side of the lake to the next. Little kids will be happy that the ship is dressed up with pirates, but for everybody else it\u2019s all just a bit kitsch. But, hey, it\u2019s included in the Hakone multi-day transportation pass, so",
          "It's so worth it to pay 5 more yen for the first class. There's a special section you can be in that is so much less crowded! There are decks inside and on top for just first class tickets. The trip is not long. There are 2 stops that you can get off at or go round trip.",
          "This is a good option to relax a bit. While enjoying the ride, you may see the Fuji Mountain if you are lucky. It\u2019s also good that you can hop off to 2 other different stops. I enjoyed it a lot!",
          "It\u2019s just a way of getting across Ashinoko. Stayed above the deck, but it was cloudy, windy and cold. Not an enjoyable experience on the day. My kids stayed inside and enjoyed the free Wifi.",
          "Pirate ship in a Japanese lake. Why not? Fun trip to an interesting area. There are 3 ships that offer a ferry service with a difference. The Hakone rail pass covers this experience.",

          "The Hakone Pirate Ship is a pleasant cruise across Lake Ashi and part of the Hakone loop. It can be accessed using the Hakone Free Pass and is connected to the Hakone Ropeway on one side of the lake and the bus at the other end. The boats look great from the outside. The",
          "Coming down by the cable car from the volcano we took a ride aboard the Viking style ship in the beautiful lake and the breathtaking relaxing scenery",
          "It was a glorious sunny day and Lake Ashi sparkled in the sunlight. We got there at about midday and the next scenic boat ride across the lake (included in our Hakone Free Pass) was at 12:30pm. We found a spot overlooking the lake to sit and have a snack before joining the",
          "We didn\u2019t manage to sit on the seats on board. But we did sit on the stairs on the top deck whilst the ship was sailing across Lake Ashi. We rather came late for the Sakura blossoms but I bet the view is amazing and breathtaking when it\u2019s spring or autumn. This is part of the",
          "There was absolutely nothing wrong with this lake crossing, in terms of getting from one side to the other, and also it being part of the Hakone Free Pass so costing nothing extra.

          "Hakone National Park is such a busy place with queues for everything. The Hakone Free Pass allows you to travel on most transport at an inclusive rate. We were lucky in that we went to Togendai but the pirate cruise was a cancelled due to strong winds. We went for a walk and by",
          "Rather depressing hall greets you once you leave the ropeway. The cafeterias were rather grim too, and there didn\u2019t appear to be anywhere outside the building to get a coffee or a snack. Had to wait quite a while for a boat to leave. It was well organised but there were such",
          "Great way to travel the lake and enjoy the scenery and ride. The boat ride is at most 45 minutes but on a clear day you can get a picture of My. Fuji and other points of interest.",
          "We had a Hakone pass (worth buying) which allowed us unlimited trips on this ship. The first trip we took was late in an evening from Motohakone - the last round trip to Motohakone. It was quite cold and misty and hence could not get to see Mt Fuji. The next day we took the",

          "We can see the Mt.Fuji on this ship! A bit windy, but you can view the nice view on board! Must try this ship!",
          "Beautiful scenery along Lake Ashi, but not nearly enough seats. It was very cold went we went, and cloudy. We couldn\u2019t see mt. Fuji, which is just luck. There is a kiosk on board for drinks and some snacks. There are pirate themed areas like a cannon for kids. Cute novel boat",

          "The trip took only about 30 minutes between Motohakone Port to Togendai Port but was fun and provided great views of Mt Fuji. We spent longer lining up to get on board, but as we have come to expect everything was handled in an orderly process. The lake is very beautiful",
          "My kids enjoyed the ride in the lake. It is interesting to find a lake in the mountainous area. It was ok weather but still Fujisan was not visible. There was a first class room you can pay 500 yen to get in and avoid crowd. We took a bus to come back to Odawara. We",

          "Awesome experience even we didn\u2019t have little kids to travel with, even it was chilly outside on the deck, we stayed almost the whole trip out in the front deck! It offers fantastic views of the lake, other ships as well as distant scenery",

          "Basically packed with tourists and no place to sit. Even the priority seats are taken up by everyone else rather than the priorities. The view is jus the lake and the mountains of trees...nothing really exciting.",
          "Still don't get the pirate ship thing, but it was a pleasant short trip across the lake. Unfortunately a very overcast day meaning a bit cool & windy on deck, no sighting of My Fuji & not much else to see. Lots of people on board, so moving around not easy. A logical part of",
          "Strange to find pirate ships in Japan. The kids will love this. Buy tickets at the pier. The ships run regularly and you have 2 stops. One takes you to the cable cars which take you up to the sulphur crater. Always plenty of eateries, souvenir shops and superb toilets.",
          "I would just take a photo of the ship and be done. On the day we went on the ship, it was foggy so we could not see a thing. They also tend to overload the ship so that you could not see much if you sat in the middle as we did. The entire cruise was over in 30 minutes. I would",
          "Surreal experience that would only happen in Japan! I never thought I would be on a pirate ship crossing the lake! I read reviews before going that gave some really good advise! Get there early and pay the extra to go first class as it gets very crowded and you want to see all",
          "This boat takes you to different points on the lake. As it\u2019s name suggests it looks like a pirate ship but is a bit of fun and obviously touristy. However nice way to see the lake and get some lovely views and photograph the Hakone shrine in distance as well. The trip we took to",
          "Oct 4 We did not have to wait long before embarking on one of the \"pirate\" ships that crosses Lak Ashi. The exterior might remind you of a pirate ship, but the interior is like any ferry boat. Prime seats go fast. There is little to do on board besides enjoying the scenery.",
          "There are 3 beautiful porate ships for cruising in Lake Ashi. We managed to try 2 of them: Victory and Wasa. The 3rd one is Royale II. Dyring our cruise on board the Victory, one of the crew members was dressed up in a Captain's outfit for photo-taking opportunities.",
          "We went one way on the pirate ship which I think was enough to enjoy the views of the lake and the torii on the edge. Today was a rubbish day in terms of weather and view, but you\u2019re inside on the boat so at least ta warm and dry. Your Hakone Free Pass gets you as many rides",
          "The whole journey take 90mins but one can also do 15mins trip from departure point to 1st stop at Motohakone-ko as well which is also cheaper. We bought economy tickets & went to the top deck. It got really busy as everyone wanted to see the view from the deck. It got really",
          "If you are visiting Hakone and want to see Lake Ashi, this is probably the most efficient way to do it, you have three stops and if you purchase the round trip you can get off in each stop and ride the next boat. We really enjoyed the views from the boat and it saved us a lot of",

          "We were staying in Hakone and paid 4000 yen for an all day transportation pass. It included this boat ride and we did it. Just a pleasant 30 mins ride across a mountain Lake. You see the Otorii Gate for the Hakone shrine standing in water as well as another little",
          "Really enjoyed our cruise along The Ashi. It's a nice way to travel about. We got an early boat and it was pretty quiet, the ones leaving later looked pretty busy. We missed the last boat back accidentally when we arrived, it's at 16:30....we had assumed 5 would be the last. We",
          "Nice and sedate trip. Could combine with the cable car and ideally that would be the best. We had low cloud and a white out so didn't do this plus we ran out of time. Next time however would do the cable car which is situated at the end of the boat ride. Its 30 minutes",
          "Its covered by Hakone Pass (if you have one), but you can also upgrade it to First Class for 400 yen! But the experience will be totally different from the normal one, since the normal one is so packed and crowded, you will barely see anything on high season! in the first class",

          "Honestly, I have no stinking clue to as to why the tour boat is in a pirate ship form but I don't care because the design is the coolest I have ever seen and will ever get to ride on. The ship itself is very large and very well made. And it's awesome because it's a perfect tour",
          "We saw this majestic ship from our cruise ship and it looked amazing. Hope to go on it next time we are there.",
          "A great way to see lake Ashi. They have 3 boats working to a schedule and the whole operation is well run. Opted for VIP seats and although it was less busy felt like there wasn't that extra money you paid for in value. Free water or complimentary map would have made the",
          "We were talked into buying a first class ticket which gave us more space and an even better view up front when crossing the lake. The views from the lake are amazing. Mt Fuji hid until we were back on the ropeway but if the weather is clear you should be able to see her from the",

          "Three ferrys all done up as pirate ships which is great for kids but is really only a nice way of seeing the lake as part of a round trip with the rope way and Hakone buses and trains.",
          "We took the Hakone Pirate ship. I really appreciate with the cleanliness and the hospitality of the people. We pay more for having the private space until the top of ship. So we can took many pictures and we love it.",
          "The boats that travel over Lake Ashi definitely provide awesome views of the area. It is part of the Hakone Free Pass, so no complaints here!",
          "Loved it, it was my first time to do a short cruise trip, and I really enjoyed it. The view is just so picturesque. The photos I took couldn't even give justice to them. This would definitely be a romantic thing to do with a partner",
          "The pirate Ship was an unusual surprise when we got there. The trip isn't much to write home about, but was unusual. I was told that we could possibly see Mount Fujiyama, but either I was told something that was not true, or the weather did not allow us to see the top of the",
          "The Pirate Ship was an interesting ride. The theme of the ship was quite different from the surrounding area. The views were quite incredible however which made the whole experience worth it.",
          "To finish our Hakone trip we took the Hakone pirate ship. It is a well equipped ship with enough seating places. On bord you can have a photo opportunity with a real pirate and when you are luck you can see Mount Fuji from the water. Unfortunately we had a cloudy day, so we were",
          "You can use a Free Pass to ride free but I recommend you pay the surcharge to have uncrowded seating at the bow and to get some some great shots.",
          "Okay it is a bit corny but still a fantastic way to travel across Lake Ashi. Go up on the top deck for the best views and exhilarating breezes. If it's cold and rainy then you are better off staying inside - although the views aren't as spectacular.",

          "We booked this cruise over lake Ashi in a pirate ship over Viator. I'm glad we did this. The view was amazing. Unable to see mount fuji though as the sky was not clear. I really enjoy the cruise and the view.",
          "It's quite bizarre to see that huge pirate ship on the lake. As it was chilly, we stayed inside the ship fully protected and unharmed by other pirates. If you are up there at the lake, it's a must.",
          "Fun scenic ride. It is about 1/2 hour across, so not enough time to get bored if you are restless. Clean and well maintained ships. Staff very courteous and helpful.",
          "Realky enjoyed the boat trip. Its not that long and you can get on and off at the three stops, one of which has cable car. We went for the first class cabin which is at the front, v luxe and gives access to the very front and top of the boat so no other tourists get in the way",
          "The pirate ship ride was ok, just like a normal ferry ride. We did not have the chance to see Mount Fuji but I can imagine the beautiful view one would have on a clear day. Lots of people on the boat and it is spilt into ordinary and first class but I wonder why they bother",
          "The replica pirate ship is fairly large with both enclosed and open decks. There is an area at front of ship for First Class customers who can pay a supplement to the normal fare. Travelled on many different lake ships/boats in both USA and Europe but never seen one like this",
          "Pleasant cruise on the lake for 30 mins. Not a lot to see, which was a shame. Pretty crowded with tourists",
          "The only reason to go on the pirate ship is to get to land the Village across the lake after you disembark from the wrong way It's a nice voyage but very hokey and contrived",
          "If you are traveling on a cold and wet day pay the extra for first class otherwise you will be stuck outside on the deck in freezing conditions with no shelter. There is very limited closed space unless you pay extra",
          "We took the pirate ship to hakone shrine and had lunch here it was a good way to kill a day and worth it to get first class ticket",
          "I would do this again for the views... but the ship itself is pretty cheesy with photo ops with pirates. Skip the inside seating areas and head right to the top of the ship for the best views... it's only 20 mins and worth it",
          "Standing up top of the pirate ship was freezing but a must do to see the view. We caught a quick glimpse of Mt Fuji before it disappeared behind the clouds again. The pirate ship is part of the Hakone package and helps get you around the loop to the cablecar.",
          "Personally I recommend this. The scenery is good.Condition of the ship is still reasonable.worth trying",
          "Visited during the winter, it is very very cool out there. The cruise are so big and can be cater for more than 200 pax and view from the cruise are so spectacular especially the view of Mountain Fuji!",
          "The Hakone Pirate Ships are a main tourist attraction in Hakone. Indeed there is nothing like taking a scenic cruise around Lake Ashi after a full day of sightseeing! There are three Hakone Pirate Ships - the Royal II (a replica of the 18th century French warship, the Royal",
          "Crossing the lake Ashi by the Pirate ship is a nice experience, I wish the weather had some mercy on us. The clouds made sure that we did not get scenic views of the lake. But its a must do experience in Hakone. Its covered by the Hakone Pass.",
          "A bit cheesy but comfortable cruise on a Pirate ship across lake Ashi from Togendai to Hakonemachi ko, which takes 30 minutes one way. Great view of the environs.",
          "We (my self,brother,sister) went with this ship last November..It was very cool climate there..But it was a nice ride with this ship.this takes around 40 minutes ride to the destination..any way you can see the Mr Fuji as well..",
          "A lovely boat with drinks available to buy. Seating inside or standing outside. Great views of Mount Fuji half way on lake. Have to take a bus at other end but there are plenty. You can also return by same boat. First class available but you don't gain anything for that really.",
          "A fun ride on the Pirate ship. The kids loved it, the views were absolutely gorgeous, and the ride was smooth and comfortable. Free using Hakone Free Pass.",
          "When we go for the ride it was super sunny, so we could see clearly the beautiful view of the lake and mountain. Highly recommended if you have time!",
          "Nice 45 min trip with very pleasant scenery and some views of Fuji. Makes a good day combined with the ropeway",
          "The winter weather was very kind and we enjoyed a calm, beautiful ride in the ship. With plenty of vantage points to see the impressive scenery, including Mt. Fuji, the boat is very popular. Actually there are about four of these and they ply their routes to and fro across Lake",
          "Although cramped on that Sunday, the short ride was refreshing with the breeze taking off the cramped queues earlier. The view of Mt Fuji was spectacular, if you are lucky to spy it.",
          "I like it the boat trip. It takes around 15 minutes, but it is very nice mainly if you are lucky and able to see the Mt. Fuji.",
          "Interesting and fun mode of transport to bring you across the lake. It's about 35mins long for a trip. Good views of Mt Fuji on a clear day. A must-do! If you've a freepass, do a return trip for the fun of it!",
          "Cool way to ride across lake Ashi. Value for money with Hakone pass. Can be rather crowded at times. If u wanna get seats, try to go early and be at the dock to wait for the boat.",
          "After a ride in the ropeway it's a pleasant hour on the water. Nice view and overall enjoyable experience.",
          "The ship sails from one end of Lake Ashi to the other end, with a stop on the way. It is a large ship, and probably because of that, the ship does not cruise close to shore. At a distance, we cannot see clearly the coastline features nor the lovely scenery. With so many tourists",
          "If you are in japan or visit japan in autum(November) you should not skip hakone trip!!! You can take the train from tokio to there about 2hours by train. It is very beautiful, you will be travel by ship about 20km to see the moutain, a red and yello moutain, if you are lucky,",
          "I liked it. It provided a great view of the lake and it was a comfortable way to travel instead of on a bus or train, all squeezy... Although I would make sure to purchase the 4000yen pass, otherwise paying separately, I probably wouldn't have done it. The first level is",
          "My family was visiting for the holidays so we went to Hakone for a few days. The pirate ship is a must. Something cool to do on the lake. Easy to find & can park at the port.",
          "This is a cool way to get around lake Ashi. It is a ferry to get you around the three major towns. The price is included in your Hakone Free Pass.",
          "Enjoyable with great sceneries. We did a round trip and it took around 45mins. The upper deck have statues of pirates and great view of the lake.",
          "The pirate ship is one of the transport modes you will use if you make a round trip using the Hakone one day pass. You also get to use cable cars, funicular railway and local train so it's well worth buying. The ship itself is ok, not authentic in case you thought it might be.",
          "This ship can be found at the final stop of the Hakone ropeway, travelling along Lake Ashi. There is a second class and a first class deck and there is a pirate walking around entertaining the children. It looks spectacular and it is quite fun to travel on and watch the",
          "Great way to wrap up touring around Hakone to see the sites of the lake from water level. The boats are very cool (they run 3 different ones) and I found it a great way to transit from the southern part of the lake to the northern to get back to my hotel.",
          "Initially I was shocked at how fast this ship was going, but realized they were running fast to pick up more people in the second port. After that initial burst of speed, the cruise becomes more chill and scenic. End to end the tour is 40 minutes. Worth it.",
          "This is a very busy attraction and you'll need to deal with some crowds. But the ship is impressive and on a sunny day you'll get an amazing view of Lake Ashi and the surrounding mountains. You can also get off at some stops and explore another part of Hakone, usually with good",
          "While it was a novel way to cross Lake Ashi, it really was like being on a ferry that looked like a pirate ship. It was very busy and difficult to get a seat. We had to stand for the journey. I think this would provide stunning scenery when the weather is good / clear but low",
          "Take a small cruise on the lake in this nicely decorated and grandiose pirate boat is a great way to end your day trip/trip in Hakone. You can take it one way and then from there take a bus back to Hakone JR station or you can take 2 ways and go back to where you got on!",
          "Pirate ship is magnificent. There is a lower level, middle level, and upper deck that is outside with plenty of seating. They also have a VIP seating area if you buy the more expensive ticket. Nice to see the beautiful greens and mountains. There were a lot of kids so this is a",
          "Although it's a bit raining when I arrive there. But it's recommended to go up where you can enjoy the view more than inside the ship.",
          "Not much special about this cruise. I need to take this to bring me to a museum. For kids this may look fun. For adults, really not much interesting. Indeed, we felt like a bit ripped off to pay that much to take the ship.",
          "It's a leg of the Hakone touring route and well worth it. One of several pirate ships sail Lake Ashi. Great views from the top deck and plenty of picture opportunities.",
          "Visited Hakone on an escorted tour of Japan and took a trip on the pirate ship. Not sure of the relevance of a pirate ship on the lake but it was quite atmospheric in the fog. Don't sit downstairs, get up on deck and enjoy the breeze. Great for families with kids I would say.",
          "The Hakone Sightseeing Ship takes you from Togendai station, where the Hakone Ropeway ends, across Lake Ashi and stops at Hakone-machi and Moto-hakone. It's a nice ride, on a large ship,you can sit inside or on deck. we sat on deck there is lots to see. The green energy the blue",
          "After our gondola ride up the mountain we went back to the lake to enjoy about an hour cruising Lake Ashi. The ship had its own pirate captain to entertain us.",
          "Captain Pirate is on board mingling and happy to have his photo taken with tourists. Relaxing cruise The water is pristine but we didn't see any Black Bass or trout\ud83d\ude1e which are inhabitants of Lake Ashi.",
          "Took this cruise from Hakone Machi to Togendai then continued onto rope way to cable car, then back again. The view from lake Ashi is just beautiful. Too bad we couldnt get to see Mt. Fuji because it was quite cloudy outside.",
          "See my review of Ashi Lake. The Pirate Ship is the 'ferry' I refer to and is a fantastic way to see this spectacular lake. The ship is in immaculate condition, very comfortable seating inside and plenty of space for everyone on the upper decks....and the first class lounge area",
          "This is a very well decorated and done up pirate ship. Spare the extra yen and get the first class ticket to enjoy great views and photo takings.",
          "It's a bit odd having a Caribbean-style pirate-themed boat on a Japanese lake. But obviously, someone's decided that it's a good idea as there are in fact three separate vessels ferrying passengers through the day across Lake Ashi between Togendai and Hakone-Machi. And with",
          "Ok. It's funny. Does it need a pirate ship on this lake ? Not sure. It just doesn't fit my taste :-) If you have a freepass, go for it",
          "Very touristic. Modern boats built with some romantic glimpse at European sailing ships. For me it was a way to get from the rope way to the village. It did not cost me anything as the Hakone pass was valid at the boats.",
          "hubby didn't want to do this bc seems so touristy . that it is, but it also a very easy & pretty way to cross the lake (much better than car sickness on the bus or train). the views are lovely & you get to take a picture with a Japanese pirate- how many time sin you relief can",
          "It was a lovely sunny morning, perfect for a cruise around Lake Ashi. Even better it is included in the pride of the Hakone free pass. We just went one way. The cruise was smooth and quiet. Staff were helpful and food and drinks were available for purchase. Perfect position to",
          "With a number of choices by the lake, we opted to take the cruise to the other end of the lake and cable car and train home. Easy easy.",
          "fun for the family, they only start every 40 mins so plan accordingly. The view was beautiful, it gets foggy halfway through the trip but we enjoyed it anyways",
          "Worth the trip across the lake, for the scenery and the fun of the boat. On a hot day, we had a lovely breeze on the water. Make sure you have the Hakone Free Pass to travel on this, and many other things",
          "The pirate cruise was on the tour itinerary and I thought it was going to be hokey. I have to admit, it was very enjoyable. The cruise was free due to our Hakone passes but we decided to upgrade to 1st class, $4, that allowed access to the front of the boat. We got the Black",
          "I bought the first class ticket. As informed, the difference is that I got the chance to view at the front deck compared to the normal ticket. This can be purchased with about 400 yen TOP up with Hakone freepass. Good thing is that you do not need to squeeze with the crowd to",
          "We spent some time sailing on the lake and we enjoyed the couple of hours looking around the area. It's great for kids and people who like fake pirate ships.",
          "Very colourful ship and the distance is just nice about 20 min. We enjoyed the ship ride. You can buy day pass and take the ship ride unlimited to another route.",
          "nice ship one had a cannon very large with a lift to different levels as well as steps. sone commentry in english",
          "We took this cruise on a recent visit to the Hakone area. The fees were included in a two-day transportation pass to the area that we bought and had we not had the pass, we might have skipped this attraction. The boat seemed a bit over the top with a pirate theme. Nonetheless, I",
          "We took one of the pirate ships for a short cruise round Lake Ashi and apart from the views of the surrounding countryside and Fuji, if its a clear day not much else to see. Some good picture opportunities however on board, and sure the kids would love it.",
          "I got a free ticket from my in law, if not I would find toy looking pirate ship a little to childish for my taste. I wish it was more like a Japanese Pirate Junk with entertaining crew members (Maybe a Japanese Johny Depp impersonator?), than the cartoon pirate of the Caribbean",
          "If you have the Hakone free pass this is a good way of getting across lake Ashi. I would regard it as a transportation vessel, rather than something fun and entertaining. But with that said - maybe it is better on a clear day. The day we traveled with the ship it was cloudy,",
          "For me, this is the prettiest way to see Hakone from one end to another. Also the easiest. (The streets are winding and if you get on a full bus it can get hairy. Also views from the bus are obstructed most of the time). The ships are meant to be atmospheric and it does",
          "There are few of these ships (I saw green, red and brown colored ships) taking tourist cruising the lake Ashi. There is someone dressed as pirate for photo together. It is very expensive if you don't have Hakone free pass. \u00a51000 for one way or \u00a51840 return trip from Togendai to",
          "Had a lot of fun with my 10 year old nephew. First class was worth it. You get a nice new from the front of the ship. The have snacks and drinks on there.",
          "The cruise was smooth sailing , partly thanks to the great weather. However, it was a cloudy day and Mt fuji is nowhere to be seen. A big disappointment. There are ample of seats available in the cruise including both indoors and outdoors. It is definitely worth a short sail",
          "We took the vessel with the idea of being able to get a good view of Fujiyama, unfortunately weather and volcanic activity prevented that, but the trip, not long, was safe and enjoyable.",
          "From the outset, it looks like an impressive replica of a pirate ship but once you set foot inside, it is basically just another ferry. There is 1 pirate captain on board for one to take pictures mainly for kids. There is an inside seating area as well as an outdoor deck area",
          "Relaxing cruise on Lake Ashi - beautiful views and just a nice time. 45 min on the boat. Get Hakone Free Pass at Odawara train station You can use it on the following 1. Tozan Line (train from Odawara to Gora) 2. Tozan Bus 3. Tozan Cable Car 4. Ropeway 5. Sightseeing Cruise",
          "I really enjoyed these boats. The navigation is smooth, and we had trips on a rainy day without any problem. It was beautiful anyway\ud83d\ude03",
          "A very pleasant cruise across the lake high up in the mountains. Can be a bit crowded in the cheap seats with everyone wanting to be on deck. Perhaps if your lucky you will see Fuji as it was noit visible on our trip.",
          "We went with our two small boys and they will remember this pirate ship ride for some time. There's two ships docked at Lake Ashi and both look gorgeous. It helped that our boys are into the manga \"One Piece\" so we spent some time discussing if Monkey D Luffy's ship would look",
          "Love the ship from outside and inside. The interior were so pretty and antiques too. Kids loved it and so did we. The lift inside was great for wheelchair and seniors. We had a nice 45mins cruise on it.",
          "The boats are designed like Pirate ships of yore. Kids will enjoy recalling their favourite pirate be it Jack Sparrow or Long John Silver. The boat has a first class section and an ordinary class. The ordinary class has 4 decks, with seating on the second deck. The third deck",
          "30 mins relaxing cruise @ Lake Ashino! From Hakone-machi port to Motohakone port, we could see nice view of lake Ashino & mt Fuji. As cable cars operated only between Togendai which is the another end of cruise, and Owakudani, we took return cruise. I would be better if there",
          "It was fun to go on the boat along the lake ... the boat ride was 30 minutes and very little information. Destined to hakone machi. Only a few coffee shops but one lovely shop selling handmade wooden items which was wonderful. Only stayed 20 minutes as nothing to do! .. trip",
          "One of those things you just have to do and try and explain when you get home. Great views of lake and surrounding area but need to get a window seat. Catch bus from rail station then pirate ship then rope way and then train back to start.",
          "The pirate ship was a nice way to get from one end of the lake to the other. You can use your Hakone free pass to get on it so that's a bonus.",
          "A nice one hour ride . Not an amazing view of the Fuji if that's what you're after but definitely a fun ride over a nice lake The boat is fairly big and not bumpy at all so we didn't feel any sea sickness",
          "Just a foot ferry really but looked like a pirate ship, 'Captain' dresses up & walks around posing for photos, and is accompanied by their own photography.",
          "We had a sail on this ship as part of a tour itinerary. It was absolutely torrential rain and we could barely see the shore never mind the scenery. So worth it only if weather is good. We were all huddled below decks. I am not sure whether you can be ondeck in good weather.",
          "It's included in Hakone free pass so it's worth a try. I recommend going from Togenda-Ko pier and getting off at Hakonemachi-Ko pier. Then you can continue to walk to Onshihakone Park to enjoy the view of Mt Fuji.",
          "The ship is rather crowded, so I would recommend getting to the top early to be able to get a good spot for taking photos if that's your thing. On a good day you get a decent view of Mt Fuji- obviously this is an attraction that works well in good weather. On the day we visited",
          "We used hakone free pass to board the pirate ship. The ship has three stories. There is an elevator for senior and handicap person. It takes 30 minutes from Togendai to Hakonemachi. They have a small shop selling some snack& drinks (a little high price). Ashi lake is very large,",
          "The sight-seeing cruise was nice, but the weather was absolutely terrible. As an avid photographer I did not have many chances for good pictures. I could not see any of the mountains further away. Weather can't be controlled so this is no fault of their own of course. I",
          "The cruise didn't really appeal to me perhaps because it was too crowded with tourists. The weather wasn't very good on the day l took the cruise so the view from the ship wasn't fantastic. Hence l alighted at the first stop. But l guess the cruise will appeal to kids who wish",
          "It is an average ride on nice lake created 3000 years ago. Probably great ride for the kids. All the destinations can be accessed via the tozen bus",
          "We took the bus to the start of the Hakone Ropeway and were disappointed that the ropeway was closed from the first stop so after taking the ropeway (which is actually a cable car) to the first stop and back again, we had lunch and then decided to take this across Lake Ashi to",
          "Caught the ferry while visiting Hakone and was impressed with the pirate ships they had. Caught the ship from one end of the lake to the other. Good day out even though the weather was miserable.",
          "As part of quite a big Hakone round trip I took the ship. It is free for those with the Hakone Free Pass. From Togendai to the other end of the lake it takes 30 minutes, where you can get off, or an additional 10 minutes to Moto Hakone. I paid 400 yen for a first class",
          "We loved that it was a pirate ship on the lake. It was such a relaxing ride. The boat was warm inside too.",
          "Great views of Mount Fuji and a very calm crossing was quick and a big boat. Staff are great, Hakone Free Pass was great to get about with",
          "From my own experience I'd only rate this a transport, not an attraction. It's a ferry boat, admittedly a rather decorative one, but it was a ferry. I'm not sure what other ways there were to cross the lake but that's what we were offered when we were dropped off by the bus.",
          "This tour was so great!! We had breathtaking views of Mt. Fuji and got to explore Hakone and eat black eggs and black ice cream!! It was just the two of us on this trip but it would be great for kids too! The pirate ship is awesome too!!",
          "We took the 'pirate boat' across the lake and back as it suited our journeying - otherwise one trip would have been enough. We had to queue for a long time for one of the journeys. It's a fun vessel and families seemed to be enjoying it. Some good views. Good, rather than very",
          "Travelers : My family of 6. My husband and I with 4 kids. 17, 14, 12 and 9. We boarded the pirate ship when we visited lake Ashi. Cool ship with a clean interior.",
          "took a bus from hakone yumoto station to hakone machi and rode one way to togendai as we were staying at hakone lake hotel. try to choose a sunny day for best view.",
          "First up, the cruise and views were all spectacular and for visitors to Hakone, this cruise is a must-take for the photographs and scenic views. It was freezing since we were on it on Dec 22. You could go up to the deck for photos and enjoy the chilling breezes, or you could",
          "Part of our trip around Hakone and not to be missed. The lake is about 25 m deep and formed by volcanic activity. You are surrounded by seismic activity - Mt Hakone (currently active), the onsen spas and even Mt Fuji. The location is very picturesque and a must do leg of your",
          "Must do! Lovely to get beautiful scenic photos on this ship. Remember, get the one or two day Hakone pass for this trip. U will safe a lot when using the public transportation, this inclusive. Snacks and drinks are sold on board. Do note too that there are two 'arrival' jetties.",
          "We bought Hakone pass which includes this ship trip. Along the lake, we can clearly see the Fuji Mt (it was a perfect sunshine day!).",
          "We went there in November and it's really cold and windy specially if you want to see the view from the top part of the ship. There are no long queue as there are several ship servicing the tourist. You can ride the ropeway right after the sightseeing tour.",
          "A relaxing way to tour Hakone, similar to the boat ride at Lake Como in Italy. Too bad we didn't see Mt Fuji due to cloud.",
          "The ship was modelled after the royal Vasa ship from Sweden, which was fun and strange. The view from the ship was great and it was a convinient way to get across the lake",
          "It was quite an enjoyable ride on the sightseeing ship, and the staffs were efficient and punctual in the operation of the ship.",
          "At first we were excitedly queuing for our turn to board. But perhaps due to the large crowd we fell asleep sometime in the cruise journey. There was nothing special to shout about.",
          "Cold and a bit windy ok the open deck. Beautiful lake, and not too busy this time of the year. Great for us. Cable car arrival and Balt departure time is synchronized which is great but does mean you have to hurry.",
          "The cruise ship takes you along the river with a nice view of Mt Fuji (depends on the time of year/day of course) and of the Hakone shrine gates. It is motorised so doesn't sway in the water, which is vital for me since I'm prone to motion sickness. The boat leaves and arrives",
          "the boat ride is nice way to end the route of the hakone free pass, the cable car finishing is route at the waiting room for the boat ride. the boat is just a gimmick design as pirate ship, but still its nice ride on the amazing lake and another way to see the scenery. day",
          "nothing special about it. You can enjoy the beautiful views without having to go onboard. it is a way to get to the other side of the lake Ashi though (but not cheap). there are other ways to get there (bus..).",
          "Nothing much to add to past reviewers. Found the ship gimmicky, but go for the views of Lake Ashi, not the ship.",
          "We are a family of 4 from Australia with two daughters aged 13 and 11 and thoroughly enjoyed the cruise we took on the pirate ship on Lake Ashi. The tickets for first class were not much more than standard price so we lashed out and cruised first class. We were the only ones in",
          "Nice and quiet boat trip on lake Ashi, stepped of in Hakone-Machi-Ko an took a walk to the neighboring village, a bit overpriced I guess but ok. When we where here the rope-way was unfortunately closed due to increased seismic activity in the area.",
          "Went to take this sightseeing ship and never regret it, the ship was quite well maintained and it has a lift inside the ship too! The view was really very nice and breathtaking and you could see Mt Fuji at a certain part and the lake was really beautiful! Go all the way up to",
          "Try to catch it as the sunsets. It can be breath taking. But it will get a little chilly at that time. But there are 2 floors on the inside for u too sit if it the deck gets too crowded",
          "It's a very unique experience to take the ship to cruise the Lake Ashi. The ship, Royal II, is a first-class warship with beautiful red and white colors. The duration of the route from Togendai port to Hakone-machi port is around 45 minutes. In good weather, you can see Fuji",
          "We surprised ourselves by enjoying our trips across the lake - we boarded as a means of transport but were unsure what to expect from a ship that looks like it came from a Disney-film. No worries, there were no costumed characters to intrude on the scenic mountain beauty, just",
          "Ahoy jim lad! Use the Hakone free pass to save queuing up! It's a pirate ship on lake Ashi......it's just a great fun adventure....everyone on board was happy and smiling! I didn't see johnny depp though :(",
          "Shaped just like a pirate ship, this one isn't hard to miss. Friends and I purchased tickets for this boat to take us around to Togendai before we made our way up to Owakudani. It's a very scenic ride out on Lake Ashi and perfect for families (visited in May 2012)",
          "These ferries modeled on pirate ships are a great way to get around the lake and are a hit with kids. It's included in the Hakone Freepass.",
          "The ship was a great way to cross the lake, although the pirate theme is a bit kitsch, but probably fun for kids.",
          "Free and nice pirates ship ride if you grabbed \"Hakone Pass\" before starting your trip :) You can get great view outside deck but do remember to bring a jacket and hold-on your stuff else staying indoor also not that bad. Ashi lake is so beautiful, pray for a less crowded ship",
          "You can use Hakone free pass for unlimited access. On a (very) clear day you can see mount fuji. Try free food samples at the port.",

          "There is no getting around how touristy this idea is of having pirate boats go back and forth. However, it is a good way to get from one side of the lake to the other. Also if you purchase the \"Free Hakone\" pass for about $40 it is included. I do recommend that, since you can",
          "We went on the Hakone Pirate Ship as part of the Mt Fuji day tour with Sunrise Tours. My daughter loved it. Just like Jake the Neverland Pirate. The scenery on the cruise is good from the outside decks. Bring a jacket as it gets very windy outside. You might get blown overboard.",
          "This boat sucks because we couldn't get on it. Of all the pamphlets given to us, nowhere does it mention in either Japanese or English that the last boat leaves the pier at 5 PM, which means that you have to be physically at the dock at 4:55 PM. I really respect Japanese",
          "The trip to the lake was stunning scenery and then I wasn't exited at the fake Pirate ship but forget that the 30min cruise was a highlight of the trip the lake is so beautiful. And if your in the area or going on this then dont miss it its a sight seeing trip you will love ,",
          "Hakone Sightseeing Ship traverses over Ashinoko, between Hakone-machi and the bottom of Mt. Hakone, and it is a very pleasant ride. You can walk around the whole ship to search for the best viewing spot, and the surroundings around Ashinoko are absolutely beautiful.",
          "A relaxing 30 minutes to enjoy the lake and the hidden views only seen from the ship looking at the shore. Best spot is the top deck but ensure to bring a jacket in case of windy conditions. An old pirate ship look adds to the thrill of it.",
          "The ship is so beautiful!! We don't see outside much as the fog is heavy. If the fog is worse, it ride to Moto-Hakone only (not go to Hakone-Machi) as safety come first. No choice to get bus to Hakone-Machi.",
          "It was clear, but cold and windy. But fortunately, by the time we got through the line and onto the sightseeing ship, there were no more spaces where we could see the sights, such as they were. Instead we were crowded toward the center of the stern where we were partially",

          "I really enjoyed the cruise on board the pirate ship. Just being out in the water on a ship really takes you to another place(figuratively and literally). Besides the ship, I think seeing Mt. Fuji while sailing along lake Ashi just adds to the trip. No rough seas here, just",

          "If you are in the area and have the Hakone pass then you might as well as it forms part of the tourist route along with the cable cars. As for the boat ride, the views are quite nice but nothing breathtaking in my opinion. We went first class so that we could see the views",
          "It was a fun ride, especially for the kids (age 5 and 7). We got the first class tickets (only a few dollars more with the Hakone Free Pass), and I'd say it was well worth it! You got seats right at the very front. Make sure you board early so you can grab those front seats.",
          "Arrived at the harbour after alighting from the ropeway. The ride is most welcome after all the tiring bus and train rides around the areas. Have a moment of peace and enjoy the view as the ship cruised across the lake and arrived at Hakone-machi.",
          "This was a calm cruise within a hectic holiday in Japan. As the weather had been poor the previous day the ship was not crowded - plenty of good seating to enjoy the views; fairly good commentary in english and easy walk via the Cedar Path to next port which has lots of shops",

          "Lake Ashi and the surrounding mountains are beautiful, and from the sightseeing boat you have a lovely view. Don't get your hopes up about seeing Mt. Fuji -- it's really a luck of the draw, even in the winter (when you have the most chance of seeing it). The boat is decorated",
          "If there is any cruise to ask that should be missed for tourists, it will be this Hakone Kankosen / Sightseeing ship!!! Cruising the Lake Ashinoko, and giving a 360 degree all round view of the lake waters, dun miss it!!!",

          "I enjoyed the cruise immensely. But just a word of caution, do take note of the timing of the last ship. You wouldn't want to be trapped, especially during winter. It is best if you take the cruise in the earlier part of the day, then move on to other sights you have in mind.",
          "Although not spectacular, it was a nice, quiet cruise around the lake. Very peaceful.",

        "wiki": "Hakone (\u7bb1\u6839\u753a, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of June 2012, the town had an estimated population of 13,492, and a population density of 145 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi). Hakone has been designated as a Japanese National Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Network.\nHakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mt. Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nOdawara\nYugawara\nMinami-ashigaraShizuoka Prefecture\n\nGotemba\nSusono\nMishima\nOyama\nKannami\n\n\n== History ==\nHakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the Hakone Checkpoint (\u7bb1\u6839\u95a2\u6240, Hakone sekisho), which formed the border of the Kant\u014d region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T\u014dkaid\u014d were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons.\nAfter the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake.\nAfter merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active \u014cwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights.\nHakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art.\nMajor events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T\u014dkaid\u014d road.\nOne famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods.\nA noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi.Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town. In 2017, Hakone was included as one of 88 anime pilgrimage sites for 2018 by the Anime Tourism Association. In 2020, new decorations have been introduced to the city in the anticipation of the release of the final film of the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nHakone Tozan Railway\nHakone Tozan Cable Car\nHakone Ropeway\nIzuhakone RailwayOdawara and Mishima, the terminus of the Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, 70 minutes from Shinjuku, Tokyo. From Odawara, the Hakone Tozan Line continues into various resort towns in Hakone. Odakyu also runs the Romancecar limited express between Shinjuku and Hakone-Yumoto. From G\u014dra, the terminus of Hakone Tozan Line, the Hakone Tozan Cable Car funicular goes to S\u014dunzan. \u014cwakudani can be reached by Hakone Ropeway from Sounzan and the lake, while the lake is crisscrossed by cartoonishly decorated \"pirate\" ships for tourists. There is also Hakone Komagatake Ropeway, which goes to the top of Mount Komagatake.\nA popular \"Hakone Free Pass\", allowing unlimited use of most forms of transport for several days, is available. Hakone Free Pass can be bought at Shinjuku Station, Odawara Station, any other chief station along Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, Hakone-Yumoto Station, G\u014dra Station, any other chief station along Hakone Tozan Line, S\u014dunzan Station, T\u014dgendai Station, Sengoku-Annaijo Bus Stop, Moto-Hakone Port, Hakone-Machi Port, and JR Gotemba Station Bus Information.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nHakone Shind\u014d\nJapan National Route 1\nJapan National Route 138\n\n\n== Education ==\nPrivate schools:\n\nKanrei Shirayuri Gakuen Junior/Senior High School\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n - T\u014dyako, Hokkaid\u014d, since July 4, 1964\n - Jasper, Alberta, Canada from July 4, 1972\n - Taupo, New Zealand, from October 7, 1987\n - St. Moritz, Switzerland, from November 2, 2014 (Friendship City)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Hakone travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nOfficial Website (in Japanese)\nHakone Portal Website\n Geographic data related to Hakone at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "Hakone Ekiden (\u7bb1\u6839\u99c5\u4f1d), which is officially called Tokyo-Hakone Round-Trip College Ekiden Race (\u6771\u4eac\u7bb1\u6839\u9593\u5f80\u5fa9\u5927\u5b66\u99c5\u4f1d\u7af6\u8d70, T\u014dky\u014d Hakone kan \u014cfuku Daigaku Ekiden Ky\u014ds\u014d), is one of the most prominent university ekiden (relay marathon) races of the year held between Tokyo and Hakone in Japan on January 2 and 3. The race is telecast on Nippon Television.\nThis two-day race from \u014ctemachi to Hakone and back is separated into five legs on each day.  Due to slight variations in the courses, the first day distance is 107.5 km while the distance on the second day is 109.6 km.\n\n\n== Rules ==\nFive legs are provided between Tokyo and Hakone each way. Each runner runs one section, and alternates with the next runner at a station. Each team has ten runners, who each run with their team's sash which is handed over to the next runner on the team at each station.\nIf a runner cannot get to a station within a certain time after the leading team reaches it (10 minutes for legs 1-2, 15 minutes for legs 3-4, 20 minutes for all subsequent legs), the next runner starts with a substitute sash. The time difference is added to the goal time.\n\n\n=== Participation ===\nTwenty universities, which belong to The Inter-University Athletic Union of Kanto (\u95a2\u6771\u5b66\u751f\u9678\u4e0a\u7af6\u6280\u9023\u76df, Kant\u014d gakusei rikuj\u014d ky\u014dgi renmei), can participate in this Ekiden. Ten of them are seeded teams that qualify by virtue of finishing in the top ten the previous year. Nine more teams qualify through their team results at the Hakone Ekiden Yosenkai, a 20 km qualifier held in the October preceding the race. A final select team, the Kanto Region University Student United Team (\u95a2\u6771\u5b66\u751f\u9023\u5408\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0, Kant\u014d gakusei reng\u014d chiimu), made up of top-placing individuals at October's Yosenkai 20 km Road Race from universities that do not qualify for Hakone as teams.  The 2014 race did not include a select team, and before 2014, the select team was called the Kanto Region Select Team (\u95a2\u6771\u5b66\u9023\u9078\u629c\u30c1\u30fc\u30e0, Kant\u014d gakuren senbatsu chiimu), and were also constituted by a selection of top runners from universities that did not qualify as one of the 19 participating teams.\n\n\n=== Seed rights ===\nTeams who finished 10th place or better will be seeded and guarantees participation in the Hakone Ekiden for the next year.\n\n\n=== Forfeiture ===\nIf a runner retires en route to a station because of an accident, his team is treated as retired. Although runners for following sections may run, their times are not officially recorded.\n\n\n== Course ==\n\n\n=== Day 1, January 2 ===\n\n\n==== Leg 1 (21.3 km) From \u014ctemachi, Tokyo to Tsurumi, Yokohama ====\nThe race begins at 8:00 a.m. in front of the Yomiuri Shimbun Building in \u014ctemachi, Tokyo, and follows a relatively flat course past various Tokyo landmarks such as Tokyo Imperial Palace, Tokyo Station, Hibiya Park, Z\u014dj\u014d-ji, and the shadows of Tokyo Tower. Past Shinagawa Station, the runners will encounter some slopes at Shin-Yatsuyamabashi (\u65b0\u516b\u30c4\u5c71\u6a4b) as well as Rokug\u014dbashi (\u516d\u90f7\u6a4b) at the 17 km mark, before arriving at the Tsurumi relay station.\nThis is one of the most important sections because the first runner\u2019s rank affects the flow of the entire ekiden for his team. As a result, teams usually enter a strong runner run in this section.\n\n\n==== Leg 2 (23.1 km) From Tsurumi to Totsuka ====\nAfter departing the Tsurumi relay station, the runners follow National Route 1 on their way to Totsuka relay station. As part of the traditional 53 Stations of the T\u014dkaid\u014d, the runners will face a significant uphill climb at Gontazaka at the 13 km mark. The last 3 km section is also made up of a combination of uphill climbs and downhill descents.\nAs this is the longest leg of the race, the fastest runner in each team traditionally runs on this course as it has influence on the overall pace of the race. The leg is often referred to as Leg 2 of Flowers (\u82b1\u306e2\u533a) in reference to its often star-studded runners and status.\n\n\n==== Leg 3 (21.4 km) From Totsuka to Hiratsuka ====\nThe first 9 km of leg is marked with a gentle descent as the course gradually departs the urban areas towards the Sh\u014dnan coastline. The runners join National Route 134 at Chigasaki, and travel along the coastline with Mt. Fuji in front of them and Sagami Bay to their left. Leg 3 finishes after the runners cross the Shonan Bridge, and reaches the Hiratsuka relay station on the coast.\nThough considered to be the most scenic leg of the entire race, strong and sometimes unpredictable sea winds force runners to adapt as they exit the urban sections of the race. Like leg 2, leg 3 also often sees placements of the strongest runners of each team in order to keep pace.\n\n\n==== Leg 4 (20.9 km) From Hiratsuka to Odawara ====\nThe shortest flat section of the race, leg 4 leads runners parallel to the Tokaido Main Line past towns of \u014ciso and Ninomiya, before crossing the Sakawa River into the heart of Odawara. Passing by Odawara Castle, the last 3 km stretch of this leg sees a gradual uphill climb, a prelude to leg 5.\nFrom 2006 to 2016, runners ran a shortened leg 4 at 18.5 km, the shortest of all legs, as organizers attempted to create a leg that would better highlight mid-distance runners of each team. However, the 20.9 km length was reinstated for the 2017 edition and has remained in place since.\n\n\n==== Leg 5 (20.8 km) From Odawara to Lake Ashi, Hakone ====\nAfter passing by Hakone-Yumoto Station, the runners run past (or in earlier editions, run through) the Kanreidoumon Gallery to begin their climbs, and pass by various Hakone sights such as the Fujiya Hotel, Hakone Kowakien, a railroad crossing for the Hakone Tozan Line, and Hakone Keimei Gakuen before reaching the highest point of National Route 1 at 16.2 km. Finally, the runners run through the town of Moto-Hakone under the Torii of Hakone Shrine at 19 km, and reach the finish line at Lake Ashi.\nColloquially called The Mountain Climb (\u5c71\u4e0a\u308a) , leg 5 is considered to be one of the most grueling sections of the race that sees runners climb up to 874 m at the highest point of leg. While almost all competitors forego tank tops and opt to dress in long sleeved apparel to combat the low temperatures, leg 5 sometimes sees runners fall to conditions such as hypothermia and hypoglycemia due to its trying nature. This legs often sees uphill specialists from each team being deployed, with many often only running this section for their universities throughout their collegiate career. Those who have consistent high finishes in this section are traditionally referred to as God of the Mountain (\u5c71\u306e\u795e).\n\n\n=== Day 2, January 3 ===\n\n\n==== Leg 6 (20.8 km) From Lake Ashi, Hakone to Odawara ====\nDay 2 of the race begins at 8:00 a.m. with leg 6 being a reverse course of leg 5 from day 1, and its first 4 km section is an uphill section before rapidly descending the mountains, past the same sights as those of leg 5. The teams' coaches are not allowed to join the teams until they have reached Hakone-Yumoto Station at the base of the mountain.\nAs a reverse of leg 5 and colloquially called The Mountain Descent (\u5c71\u4e0b\u308a) , the downhill leg 6 is a speedy and challenging affair with average runner speeds of 25 km per hour. Runners also need to combat the morning chills of starting early in the morning atop of the mountains, and icy and slippery course conditions are not uncommon dependent on weather conditions. As a combination of these challenging conditions, leg 6 also sees a high number of specialist runners much like leg 6, and those who participate often take tolls on the their legs and feet as they reach the bottom of the mountain.\n\n\n==== Leg 7 (21.3 km) From Odawara to Hiratsuka ====\nA near-reverse course of leg 4, leg 7 is slightly longer than its parallel during day 1 and sees its runners leave the mountains and head to the coast near Hiratsuka on a mostly flat course with minor inclines after 9 km.\nAs the sun rises throughout the course of leg 7, the difference of temperature between the start in Odawara and the finish at Hiratsuka is the largest out of all other sections. Runners have to combat and adapt to the changing weather conditions as they move towards Hiratsuka.\n\n\n==== Leg 8 (21.4 km) From Hiratsuka to Totsuka ====\nA reverse course of leg 3, the first half of leg 8 is mostly flat, however near Fujisawa there is a significant uphill section near Yugy\u014dji-no-saka (\u904a\u884c\u5bfa\u306e\u5742) which may causes some runners difficulties.\nAs the temperatures continue to rise, some runners fall into states of dehydration near Yugy\u014dji-no-saka, and proper management of runners' physical conditions is critical in leading the way to a successful final 2 legs of the race.\n\n\n==== Leg 9 (23.1 km) From Totsuka to Tsurumi ====\nA reverse course of leg 2, leg 9 is the longest leg of day 2. After revisiting Gontazaka, now as a downhill section, the rest of the course past Hodogaya Station is a mostly flat affair leading to the Tsurumi relay station.\nLike leg 2, Most teams place their second-best runners for this leg, and it is likewise called Leg 9 of Pines (\u677e\u306e9\u533a) to indicate its importance. The leg is critical for leading teams to cement their lead or for trailing teams to close their distance, either in a fight for the championship or a top-10 seeding position to guarantee their return to the next year's race. Owing to the strength of runners in this sections, overtakes are not uncommon during leg 9.\nAdditionally, the Tsurumi relay station at the end of leg 9 is the most common place for early starts (Kuriage-sut\u0101to (\u7e70\u308a\u4e0a\u3052\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c8)) to occur, as teams need to reach Tsurumi within 20 minutes of the race leaders to prevent a forced early start. Because of the symbolic importance of physically relaying the Tasuki to each teammate throughout the race, emotions often run high when teams fail to do so. The 160 m clear straight section at Tsurumi exacerbates this: teams close to the 20 minute cut-off physically see their teammates near the relay station, but not all teams make the successful exchange at this final relay station.\n\n\n==== Leg 10 (23.0 km) From Tsurumi to Otemachi, Tokyo ====\nA near-reverse course of leg 1, and similar to the opening leg, leg 10 is largely flat as runners head towards central Tokyo. The leg follows the same course as leg 1 until the final section, where it deviates east at Babasakimon (\u99ac\u5834\u5148\u9580) in front of the Nijubashi of the Tokyo Imperial Palace before turning north on Chuo-Dori through Ky\u014dbashi. After crossing Nihonbashi, the race returns and concludes in front of the Yomiuri Shimbun Building, where the finish line awaits.\nThe spectating crowds grow gradually as the race progresses through leg 10, and runners have to face strong winds between tall buildings as they enter more built-up areas of Tokyo. As the final runners of each team closes out the race, their teammates awaits them at the finish line in celebration and reflection.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nHakone Ekiden was started in 1920.  Shizo Kanaguri, who is known as the father of the Japanese marathon, conceived the idea.  His enthusiastic idea of bringing up a runner who could compete in the world became the driving force of establishing Hakone Ekiden. When Kanaguri was a Tokyo Koto Shihan school (Koshi) student, he participated in Olympic Games in Stockholm in 1912 as one of the representative Japanese marathon runners.  He had to give up his race on the way, however.In the meantime, the first ekiden, Tokaido ekidentohokyoso (\u6771\u6d77\u9053\u99c5\u4f1d\u5f92\u6b69\u7af6\u8d70) was held in 1917 between Sanj\u014d \u014chashi, Kyoto and Ueno Shinobazunoike (\u4e0a\u91ce\u4e0d\u5fcd\u6c60) Tokyo, celebrating 50 years after Tokyo became the capital. This race was a big relay race between Kyoto and Tokyo (516 km) held by Yomiuri Shimbun for three days. It succeeded and became the original form of Hakone Ekiden. Kanaguri was influenced by the success of the race and persuaded many universities that they should race in the Hakone Ekiden.  As a result, Waseda Univ., Keio Univ., Meiji Univ. and Tokyo K\u014dshi replied to his offer and Hakone Ekiden started. Hakone Ekiden was started with great energy of the pioneers in Japanese sports society. It started during World War I, so industrial areas gradually expanded to the west and the Tokaido road was widened.  Reflecting this active atmosphere, the Japanese sports society, including ekiden one, were developing great challenging spirits at that time.\n\n\n== Level of competition in 2010 ==\nIn the 2010 (86th) race, of the 380 athletes (190 runners and 190 alternates) that represent the 19 universities, 328 have run under 14:40 for 5,000 meters; 150 at 14:20 and 33 under 14:00.\u3000This figure compares very strongly with US collegiate men from all schools: athletic.net's list of collegiate men 5000 meters in 2009, which lists approximately 400 athletes at 14:40, 200 at 14:20 and 60 under 14:00 in 2009. Stepping up to the 10,000 meter distance, the same sources show that these 19 Tokyo universities list over 190 runners with personal bests under 30:00 (14 more sub 30 minute runners make up an all-star team of runners from other Tokyo universities); about 90 US collegians ran under 30:00 in 2009.\n\n\n== Winners ==\n\n\n=== Shizo Kanakuri Trophy ===\nThis prize is awarded to the most valuable runner. This was founded in 2004(80th) to admire Shizo Kanakuri's accomplishment. \n\n\n=== Records ===\n\n\n==== Section Time Records ====\nFollowing are the time record for each of the section from the current course in effect.\n\n\n==== Overtook Records ====\nThey overtook the highest number of runners in one section.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nRun with the Wind is a Japanese novel by Shion Miura that narrates the build-up and training of a team to run the Hakone Ekiden. It has been adapted to manga, live action film and anime.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIzumo Ekiden\nAll Japan University Ekiden\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website",

        "wiki": "Hakone (\u7bb1\u6839\u753a, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of June 2012, the town had an estimated population of 13,492, and a population density of 145 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi). Hakone has been designated as a Japanese National Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Network.\nHakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mt. Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nOdawara\nYugawara\nMinami-ashigaraShizuoka Prefecture\n\nGotemba\nSusono\nMishima\nOyama\nKannami\n\n\n== History ==\nHakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the Hakone Checkpoint (\u7bb1\u6839\u95a2\u6240, Hakone sekisho), which formed the border of the Kant\u014d region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T\u014dkaid\u014d were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons.\nAfter the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake.\nAfter merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active \u014cwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights.\nHakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art.\nMajor events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T\u014dkaid\u014d road.\nOne famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods.\nA noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi.Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town. In 2017, Hakone was included as one of 88 anime pilgrimage sites for 2018 by the Anime Tourism Association. In 2020, new decorations have been introduced to the city in the anticipation of the release of the final film of the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nHakone Tozan Railway\nHakone Tozan Cable Car\nHakone Ropeway\nIzuhakone RailwayOdawara and Mishima, the terminus of the Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, 70 minutes from Shinjuku, Tokyo.

From G\u014dra, the terminus of Hakone Tozan Line, the Hakone Tozan Cable Car funicular goes to S\u014dunzan. \u014cwakudani can be reached by Hakone Ropeway from Sounzan and the lake, while the lake is crisscrossed by cartoonishly decorated \"pirate\" ships for tourists. There is also Hakone Komagatake Ropeway, which goes to the top of Mount Komagatake.\nA popular \"Hakone Free Pass\", allowing unlimited use of most forms of transport for several days, is available.

          "We enjoyed this museum a lot more than the museums on Naoshima island which basically feature 4 or 5 works the most!",
          "Was a revelation to see Gall\u00e9\u2019s early glass art work whereas many museums show his Art Deco works this has both and many of the impressive earlier works. Great addition to your appreciation of the evolution of his work. Not publicized as much as the museum\u2019s wonderful paintings",
          "This place has had serious love spent on it. The building alone is worth a look. Modern Japanese architecture at its finest. I spent almost as much time admiring the building as the art. The art in 3 galleries was amazing - impressionists from POLA and other galleries, some that",
          "Superbly designed gallery built in 2012, housing one man's collection of 9500 art works. Early works from Picasso, Monet, Renoir, Matisse and others. Rarely seen early works by 20th century masters. Japanese collector Suzuki Tsuneshi (born 1930) has amassed an amazing treasure",
          "Another small museum with plenty of art works from Picasso, Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh - the masters of impressionism",
          "Nice museum for a rainy day. Many incredible pieces which I didn\u2019t expect in Hakone!! Very pleasantly surprised!",
          "If it wasn\u2019t for the rain we\u2019d have gone to the sculpture park. Then we\u2019d have missed a real treat. This museum is beautifully designed, with a great collection imaginatively curated and displayed.",
          "So nice to be able to appreciate such a beautiful Art collection of Paintings with English description and comments !!! You will enjoy all the 5 exhibitions Halls filled with Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet and Marc Chagall!!! Had a chance to enjoy all and a great surprise...Azuma",
          "Quite an eclectic experience looking through this impressive glass topped gallery with an absorbing collection of art ranging from Chagal,Matisse and Renoir to an odd Gogh or two. A thourough look at the art on display would take a least a day. Well worth a visit.",
          "Missing those Western artists, culture lovers? Along with some Japanese works, you can get your \u201cfix\u201d here. Perfect for a rainy day, too. Great selection of postcards in gift shop. We saw everything in 1.5 hours, but we were moving at a quicker pace than usual. Adored the",
          "This garden was soo pretty ! The colors of the park are gorgeous and it is very clean. Trees, rocks, little rivers and grass everywhere. Recommended for pictures !",
          "Just a perfect way to spend both in nature and viewing exquisite art work. Impressionists, and other fabulous art work.",
          "We got here using our Hakone Free Passes with some help from a friendly bus driver. It\u2019s an interesting collection and we thought it worth the detour. We also had an excellent lunch ordering some set menus.",
          "This is the second time Ive visited the museum. the architecture is great and the exhibitions are good too (especially the one we saw). However, it does present Western art and not a lot of Japanese or Asian art. Its certainly a great option for a rainy day in Hakone, which is",
          "We had our own car, so not a problem for us, but the Pola is a bit out of the way and I'm not sure how you get here without your own transport unless you are on a guided tour. The actual art display area itself is not that large, though there were some very fine pieces in the",
          "Perhaps I had too high of expectations after all the good reviews, but maybe I just didn\u2019t appreciate the current special exhibit of glassware. For me, it was not worth the trip out, even though the building itself was quite nice.",
          "Although we didn't plan a visit to this museum, we ended up here on a rainy day. The museum is easy to reach by bus and is located in a beautiful environment. The architecture of the museum is beautiful and perfectly blends in the environment. The museum has an interesting",
          "There cannot be many art museums that you can see Monet, Renoir, Cezanne etc paintings next to each other and get so close you can see the paint strokes. Truly amazing. A little pricey however worth the visit.",
          "Don\u2019t miss if you are interested in art and have a spare couple of hours - wonderful exhibition on Emile Galle when we visited but also Monet, Renoir etc, plus Chinese ceramics and well worth the entrance fee. Modern glass building in the trees, good facilities and cafe.",
          "I can't believe we essentially just happened to be visiting a city with this extensive and impressive an art collection. The Pola Museum has some of the finest works by known artists such as Monet and Matisse I have ever seen. It far outshines the Peggy Guggenheim museum in",
          "The setting for this museum is beautiful, surrounded by forests and the floor to ceiling windows allowing all the natural light through. Struck us as unusual to have such high quality art in such an isolated location, but we thoroughly enjoyed the visit.",
          "They had Van Goghs/Monets/Picasso's and a great selection of Japanese artists I have never seen before. Good learning experience!",
          "A small museum with a surprisingly large number of Monets and Manets, etc. Chinese and Korean ceramics were also on display. A bright and cheerful atmosphere. Worth the time spent.",
          "The works of art in this museum's collection is truly excellent. It's something you wouldn't expect in middle of a forest, but then this area is patronized by some very well-off people from Tokyo, and having such a great collection is not really a surprise. Expect Monet,",
          "After all the wonderful things that Hakone National Park has to offer, it was incredible to discover a world-class art collection too. It's a fantastic space with European and Japanese art thoughtfully laid out. We loved being able to linger here for a few hours. It was a",
          "We went here on arrival in Gora as we were too early for check in. I had read about this in Australia and had intended to go. I was really happy to see so many paintings by the masters such as Cezanne, Monet, Manet, Degas, Van Gogh and more. As I don't often get to art",
          "Enjoyed the rich collection of artworks. 100 paintings to demonstrate the 100+ years. Not just the history, it shows beauty of the paintings also. Got impressed by many of them. Thank you very much. Around the museum, there is a walking path in the forest. Walked about 10",
          "The collection in this museum is mediocre. They have one or more mediocre examples of every major artist. I think the exhibit included 5 Renior's from their collection, three of which proved that even Renior had \"bad days\". One was fair and one was up to expectations. We",
          "By car, it's the easiest way to get to this. Parking lots are next to it. Also available to use a public transportation. From Hakone-yumoto or Odawara Stations, one can get on a through bus, and get off at Pola Bijutsukan-mae just before the museum. Its permanent painting",
          "This is museum is definitely worth visiting, has an amazing collection of art including Monet. The building itself is an architectural wonder.",
          "Have now been twice- different exhibitions. The latest is just terrific as gives you a journey through Masterpieces. Love the building and the setting. Our Art loving friends just amazed at what was on offer- all pieces they hadn't seen in their many European holidays.",
          "It is in an outdoor setting. And it is beautiful, add the outdoor art work and sculptures. I would go again on my next trip to Hakone. It is great for kids.",
          "Very nice museum in Hakone with a lot of impressionist art, by French as well as Japanese artists. Also a very good restaurant.",
          "This is such a surprising site - a perfectly designed gallery housing huge volumes of world class paintings, hidden away in the woods. Like so many things in japan, this is done to perfection. The gallery may look modern but somehow it houses the exhibitions with class and in a",
          "I went there when they had 'Picasso & Chagall' special exhibition. With ordinary exhibition, it was worth a visit at \uffe51700(with discount). At Hakone, there are few way to get discounts for museums, cafes, so on. 2/3 conbined museums discount is my favourite. Reserch Hakone",
          "....but my husband would have given it is bit lower rating because it is expensive and not a good value for the money. Very elegant.",
          "Easy to get to (via Bus), scenic setting, interesting building architecture, along with a surprising collection! The Picasso & Chagall Exhibition currently being shown is Outstanding! That's in addition to the normal collection of Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh, and many Japanese works",
          "At the time of my visit there was an impressionist show going on. The presentation was beautiful and very manageable. Sometimes I find museums overwhelming and this was just the right amount to truly appreciate what I was seeing. The building is beautiful, contemporary and if",
          "Excellent ultramodern museum built thanks to the generosity of a large Japanese organisation. A mix of raw concrete and glasses overlooking the surroundings. Interesting collections changing on a regular basis. Take an audio tour in English. Good coffee shop located on the lower",
          "The place are very peaceful and interesting. There is an exhibition of Picasso when i was there and more interesting exhibition of my favorite Artist. The building is very beautiful. Love it.",
          "Very good access by bus. The park/open-air gallery around the museum is also worth walking around, and it is free. The building is so light-filled, and architecturally unique. The admission is reduced, if you show your Hakone Free Pass, by 200Yen . Very nice cafe , tried their",
          "What a lovely building and collection of fantastic art. Hats off to POLA! The exhibit space is well laid out and the amenities are excellent. Lovely place to spend a few hours. Very memorable.",
          "As people have said, a serene and peaceful place. Might be worth saving for a rainy day. Or just go for it.",
          "Great museum, good collection of art Especially until September 2017, a special exhibition of Marc-Chagall and Picaso",
          "A good activity to consider for wet weather, although getting to the place by foot might be challenging, as such using the public bus or driving might be advisable. With lush trees surrounding it gives off a peaceful feel compared to a bustling city, the museum at the top also",
          "We went on a rainy day. The forest outside is magical. We saw the Picasso and Chagall exhibit, an amazing collection of both artists' work. Lots of other classics, as well. The building itself is also truly gorgeous.",
          "This museum is beautiful. We saw a special and very good exhibition of Picasso and Chagall side by side Beautiful I don't know how long this exhibition will last so check in advance Worth the visit",
          "This museum showcases European art mainly. We were very fortunate to see some Picasso and Chagall works. The impressionist exhibition was also excellent. Entry is not cheap at 1800 yen. The building is in beautiful surroundings with every window having a garden view.",
          "We recently viewed this very interesting retrospective exhibition of the artworks of Pablo Picasso and Marc Chagall. The exhibition traced historically the friendship of these two masters of modern art, their similarities and differences and subsequent falling out after the",
          "Wow, there was so much to see from Monet to Picasso! Definitely worth a visit for those who love Art. The cafe was nice, had a toasted sandwich which was delicious.",
          "The building itself is a modern piece of Art on its own. Good collection. Very helpfull staff who helped us to get a taxis to leave. Being there in Autumn with the beautiful red leaves was a great plus.",
          "The architecture is simply stunning. Clean lines with major elements such as glass, wood and concrete. Whole place is in the midst of a forest so after you complete the tour inside the building, do take a walk outside on the grounds. It's so peaceful and quiet, one of my fav",
          "oustanding architecture and mid size exhibitions. located in the middle of the forrest. I love to come here again and again.",
          "This museum is fantastic. Only the building is worth seeing. Very good collection, not busy so you can take your time strolling and admiring the art pieces. Great for a rainy day",
          "The museum building is beautiful with plenty of natural light and views of the garden. We did not have time to explore the outside areas but they will make for a nice stroll if you have a lot of time in Hakone.",
          "This is a small private collection, but a lovely sampling of European impressionist and early twentieth-century Japanese painting. There are nice educational activities for children, as well as carts with children's books strategically placed. The restaurant was surprisingly",
          "Fantastic gallery in a beautiful area of Japan! Level of art is world class; building that pieces are housed in, is a work of art it's self. Well worth the visit will not disappoint.",
          "What a surprise in every way! Set in the midst of green mountain jungle this modern white concrete box offers so much. An incredible art collection, glass to create desire in any heart, sculpture and fun. Beautifully curated to offer knowledge with heart this should be on",
          "This is a beautiful gallery tucked away in the forest and should be on your list if you enjoy art. Quite small but has great selection of top European painters and a lovely building in which they are all housed.",
          "My family thought this was one of the most beautiful museums they had ever visited. The architecture, the setting, the art work all was as good as it could be. This is a museum you won't want to miss!",
          "An easy bus ride from our ryokan in Kowkidani brought us to this gem of modern architecture. A display on modern beauty (mostly a French Belle \u00c9poque) was the central theme. A surprisingly good collection and great curatorship had us spending a morning there. Only fault was due",
          "Beautiful, modern, clean lines, great collection, that's how I look at the place. A peaceful place to visit, to be surrounded by arts and nature. I love the architecture, I was impressed of how they surround the glass building with the green. A touch of beauty, a touch of nature",
          "I was very surprised to see such a lovely museum in natural surroundings away from a major city. We enjoyed seeing the original art and had a lunch in the restaurant. Each dish was presented in a very artistic way and was quite pricey.",
          "An wonderful collection of the world's masterpieces in an interestingly designed gallery nestled in the beautiful Hakone. Plan to spend 1-2 hours admiring works of art without jostling crowds - though there are many visitors. For an extra couple of dollars you can purchase the",
          "We were surprised avout the quality of the museum. It is located in the middle of a gorgeous and lush forest. You can enjoy Monet, Rousseau, Manet, Toulouse-Lautrec, Picasso, Modigliani, and other great painters. Also a very good colection of perfume bottles from Lalique. All",
          "Good place to go on a rainy day in Hakone, we bought the combination pass (Pola + Lalique museum) for 2700 yen per adult. Apart from the impressionist works, the museum also had a Glass Gallery featuring beautiful pieces by Galle and Lalique. The museum itself is gorgeous and",
          "It was a very rainy day, typhoon and planns were changed. So we got to the Pola Museum of art. beautiful exposition of the history of French fashion and beauty",

          "We were completely spoilt ... when visiting this museum as they were displaying famous French impressionalists. Monet, renoir and manet and many more. Lovely souvenir shop. Definitely worth visiting",
          "We only had an hour before closing time but managed to see the full museum. A little disappointed but in saying that the artwork is magnificent. This is the collection of one man so that has to be taken into consideration. You have a selection of paintings, sculptures,",

          "This was an unexpected gem, during a day in Hakone when the rain was torrential. The museum is a very cool building, built (I believe) in 2002 and funded by the Pola family, who have a collection of 9,500 works of art. I don't know where they keep the rest of them, but that's",

          "Cezanne, Monet, Rodin & Renoir all have their art works exhibited in this tiny museum. Surprise! Specialized in European (Impressionism) and Japanese arts, Pola Museum has an excellent niche collection. It also has some Tiffany glass pieces. The museum did not allow photography",

          "We were in Hakone during a rainy spell and this is your best bet in the incessant rain. The Cezanne exhibition going on at the time was excellent, with decent pieces and interesting discussion points even for English speaking visitors. As for the permanent section, we especially",
          "It was raining non stop during our trip to the area, so the art museum seemed like a good alternative to outdoor sightseeing. The museum is a beautiful piece of architecture. There was supposed to be a traveling Cezanne exhibit, but it had been canceled due to volcano threats",

          "The museum is located in a highland area of Hakone. I recommend taking a bus to reach from Gora station (Hakone Tozan Railway). It is built between woods and I felt very relaxed at birds singing. The building is designed to let the sunlight in and make a modern and open",

        "wiki": "Lake Ashi (\u82a6\u30ce\u6e56, Ashi-no-ko), also referred to as Hakone Lake or Ashinoko Lake, is a scenic lake in the Hakone area of Kanagawa Prefecture in Honsh\u016b, Japan. It is a crater lake that lies along the southwest wall of the caldera of Mount Hakone, a complex volcano that last erupted in 1170 CE at \u014cwakudani.  The lake is known for its views of Mt. Fuji, its numerous hot springs, historical sites, and ryokan. The lake is located on the T\u014dkaid\u014d road, the main link between Kyoto and Tokyo. A number of pleasure boats and ferries traverse the lake, providing scenic views for tourists and passengers. Several of the boats are inspired by the design of sailing warships.\nMost visitors to Lake Ashi stay in one of the hotels or ryokan located in the area to visit some of the local attractions. There is also a campsite at the north end of the lake. Hakone Shrine is a shrine that has been visited by sh\u014dgun, samurai, and many travelers over the centuries. Large sections of the Old T\u014dkaid\u014d road are preserved here. Onshi Park was the summer retreat for the imperial family that is now a public park. Taking the aerial tram Hakone Ropeway to The Great Boiling Valley.  From Togendai on Lake Ashi, the Hakone Ropeway aerial tram connects to Sounzan, the upper terminus of the Hakone Tozan Cable Car funicular railway. This in turn connects to the Hakone Tozan Line mountain railway for the descent to Odawara and a connection to Tokyo by the T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen.Visitors can also take the Hakone Sightseeing Cruise with its pirate ships from Togendai to Moto-Hakone Port and Hakone-Machi Port on opposite ends of the lake. The cruise line began in 1950.\nThe name means \"lake of reeds\" in Japanese: \u82a6 (ashi) is \"reed\", and \u6e56 (ko) is \"lake\". The abundance of nature makes it popular with hikers. There are many trails with different levels of challenge.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\"Hakone\". Global Volcanism Program.

          "I used the Hakone Free Pass to ride the Pirate Ship on Lake Ashi. We did not get to see Mount Fiji that day as the mountain was erupting which blocks the view. However the pirate ship is just beautiful and the ride on Lake Ashi was peaceful and very scenic as well.",
          "Took the cruise to the Cable Car to view Mount Fuji. Very nice serene cruise which took about 20 minutes. Unfortunately it was slightly misty on the day so we couldn't see Mount Fuji from the top of the cable car. However well worth the trip. A number of shops at the bottom of",

          "This lake is beautiful, on a clear sunny day at the south eastern end of the lake, you might be lucky enough to get a photo of Mt Fuji with its reflection on the still waters of the lake. The lake cruise ships are designed as pirate ships and they look great, I counted 5 ships",
          "Sadly Mount Fuji hidden in clouds for our visit, but a lovely cruise on a 'Pirate Ship' making up for much of the disappointment. A lovely area with Traditional houses nestling among the forest. The cruise lasting about an hour. lovely respite drinking a coffee while gliding",
          "Enjoyed a trip along the lake in the pirate ships, great views, gentle ride, very relaxing after the Ropeway",
          "While Lake Ashi is probably best enjoyed via the sightseeing cruise, I would also highly recommend walking along its banks as you can get some pretty amazing views. For example after disembarking from the cruise ship at Mokohakone-ka, take a stroll along its shores to Hakone",
          "Lake Ashi is beautiful - I enjoyed riding the boat across the see Hakone Shrine and walk around for a few hours in the small town. The day I toured the area it was perfectly clear (and hot!) and we were able to see Mount Fuji clearly from the boat and from the pier when we",

          "Really enjoyed our journey on Lake Ashi. Paid to go first class on the pirate ship which isnt really that much more expensive but well worth it as you get to sit up the front of the boat and it is not crowded. Economy seemed to be rather packed. We paid for the return and jumped",
          "Great views of mount Fuji from Lake Ashi from a overly crowded \"Pirate Ship\" that is bling gone crazy - Your 4 year old may think its wonderful - otherwise, if you can afford it get a private cruise.",
          "We travelled in the morning from Tokyo to Hakone, then we did the tour across the lake, then up to Owakudani via the ropeway and back to Hakone to spend the night at a ryokan. The tour is nice for the views of mount Fuji from the ship. I'd suggest to get down from the bus from",
          "We took the cruise ride about 20 minus from Hakone and got off at the first stop to see Mt. Komagatake via the ropeway. The ride was a great chance to see the surrounding landscape and beautiful lake view since the environment seems to be in pristine condition!",

          "I think about spending two nights/ 2-3 whole days in hakone is PERFECT for nature lovers. You can\u2019t see Fuji- san all the time so you have to be lucky. I loved seeing the nature and the walks are fantastic. Lake Ashi is great and walking to observation point 3 was relaxing. I",
          "We returned on the Pirate boat from the Owaku-dani Valley. Consider this trip as another mode of transportation to your bus. The weather was foggy, so we could see very little. Besides, there are so many tourists on the boat that you have to be very proactive and grab ANY",
          "Lake Ashi is a delightful area that affords much in the way of recreation. The lake never freezes due to the volcanic activity of the area and it is a popular fishing and boating area. You'll find small boats available for rent. It is also possible to cruise the lake as we",
          "Included in my Fuji tour, but again due to fog we saw nothing - but fog.......... wasn't an issue as really only used as transfer point - but shame to have missed that aspect of the iconic view............ our tour guide on the bus said it may be cancelled - think the company",
          "We took the trip across the lake with our Hakone pass, and to complete the \u2018circuit\u2019 of our day\u2019s activities. Aside from the beautiful weather, and some amazing views of Mount Fuji, the trip itself was pretty mundane and rather lack-lustre: the coastal scenes have little to",

          "Situated some 750 metres above sea level, the lake sits within a volcanic crater formed 4000 years ago from the eruption of Owakudani. It never freezes, and therefore hosts an unusual population of cold-water in warm-water fish. The lake shore is largely unspoiled countryside,",
          "Lake Ashi is a dream come true for nature lovers and photographers. Dozens of photography opportunities will spoil you around every corner. It pays to go in good weather for the best view.",
          "The boat trip across lake Ashi is worth it, even if you have to brave the cold. The Hakone pass is very useful and good to travel around in Hakone.",

          "We took the boat from Moto - Hakone, after visiting the shrine and the temple, to Togendai. The boat is included in the Hakone Free pass. The boat trip was ok, but there were to many tourists and Mount Fuji was not visible.",
          "It is a nice Lake, and the views of Mt. Fuji from the cablecar getting to the lake are worth it. But it was nothing special other than that.",
          "We stayed in Hakone for 2 nights. You need more than that to experience the beauty of this place. From Hakone, we took the coat to lake Ashi then we took the cable cart to Valley of Hell. Train to Gora Park and train back to Hakone. Managed to see a clear glimpse of mount Fuji.",
          "Good to add to your Hakone journey if you have the Hakone Freepass - the pirate cruise ships are free. Upgrade for 400 yen to 1st class cabin and get better seating and less crowd. There is a good view of Mt Fuji on a clear day, and you also pass the Tori gate of the Hakone",
          "This is one of the highlights of this place! The cruse took us to Ashimoto where we boarded a cable car which took us up a small mountain. We alighted at the half way point as there wasn\u2019t much to see, certainly no animals or even birds. So we boarded the boat & returned to",
          "Travelled from one end of the lake on a pirate boat, in the snow, views around the lake were good, but could not see Mount Fuji, next day the view across the lake from our hotel room was sight to behold, there was Mount Fuji in the gleaming sunlight with a snow covered top.",
          "We took the Hakone sightseeing cruise which is part of the Hakone Free Pass. It was about an hour round trip. The views of the lake are lovely. It stops in two other ports if you want to get off and explore those areas. We chose to just stay onboard.",
          "The lake is quite peaceful and nice Unfortunately we could not see mt Fuji but we took the Cruise from one side to the other and was very nice Is a good way to move around the town and have a panoramic view",
          "The lake is 11km long and is really stunning the great views of all surrounding volcanoes except mount Fuji but you can see the tip from the western side of the lake. Cruise ships ferry hoards of tourists each side every day depending on the weather with 3 galleon type ships",
          "We arrived at the lake at the end of the afternoon on a cloudy day .Almost all cafes and restaurants closed at 17.00 aftee the retirn of the last boat trip, so better book an hotel with meal in the area. The place would probably have been magical under the sun, the torii on the",
          "This is a serene lake, which most of us will see from one of the cruise boats that ferry tourists across as part of the Hakone Loop. The boats themselves have enough seating for people and the upper decks offer great views.",
          "A bit of short ride on the pirate ship for just 10mins but you can experience a pretty good view of Mount Fuji and enjoy the cool spring Breeze. Do go to the upper deck for a better picture spot and always on the left side of the boat. We are lucky to have a clear sky and able",
          "It was snowing for us, which was good in itself, but made for poor views. Irrespective, the boats run pretty often and are a good way to link the end of the ropeway (Togendai) with the other end of the lake (Hakonemachi or Motohakone). You can then explore the southern towns and",
          "the lake is set in a beautiful surrounding and it will be spectacular with fall colors and when Mt Fuji is visible, particularly with its snow cap during the winter and spring. You can use the cruise to cross the lake and rent boats to tour the lake yourself. There are many",
          "We did the railway, cable cars then boat ride across the lake. We then walked to the nearby water shrine which was equally stunning. Do watch out for the queues for the buses back though - we stood for over an hour after sunset in the cold!!",
          "We did the \"pirate ship\" sightseeing cruise of this lake. We paid extra to have the VIP seats on one-way of the trip. It was worth it, because you get better choice of seating, more comfortable seating, and better section of deck when outside - you get better views.",
          "Beautiful area near mount Fuji. You can hop on a sightseeing boat (pirate-style) to cross the lake. At the other side it's easy to walk from A to B to do some sightseeing before you go back again. If you are a nature lover: I prefer Lake Ashi over the 5 lakes area, the nature is",
          "Had a lovely journey over the lake, a little cold but great experience in a pirate ship. Great way to get to the cable car.",
          "Will not recommend the trip Was boring and lacked substance No commentary on deck Was crowded Packed like sardines Leave out of trip",
          "Lake Ashi (also known as, Hakone Lake) is a famous crater lake, but is it peaceful below and the surrounding area? Hakone gives off a lot of volcanic steam and likely boiling below. We took a boat ride across the lake, on this, my second visit to the area. Great place for",
          "It's worth boarding the cruise for a lap around Lake Ashi. There are two stops during the journey and you can hop on and off as you like. Pity that it was not a clear day when I visited so cannot see Mt. Fuji.",
          "Catch first boat out of Motohakone to Togendai. 35mins ride offers 2 class cabin.can be upgraded for a fee with front view of the lake. Comes with 3 tier view and seating lay out.Visitor able to enjoy scenic view of surrounding mountain.able to see a glimpse of Fuji San peak.Not",
          "Fascinating view of Mt. Fuji just walk past the convenient store. You may need someone to take your photo as the light is tricky for a selfie.",
          "You have to work out your trip to see which way round you want to see all the sights and some packages do not give you the whole lake but just part of it - we done it ourselves (with the wife\u2019s planning) and had the whole lake trip - a nice lake cruise that is so relaxing Be",
          "There are a couple of boats that cruise around the lake and you can get off at the other side if you wish. The lake and the surrounding area are breathtaking during the various seasons, but we were too early for the cherry blossom. We took the pirate ship and the ride across was",
          "Can take a boat across. Windy and cold so might be much better in warmer seasons. Fun restaurant at dock for lunch.",
          "Gorgeous lake with views of Mount Fuji. Placid boat ride took us along the shore of the lake and we were able to view several towns. Watch for the duck boats. Quite a hoot!",
          "This does look like a very popular and pretty lake \u2013 on a nice day\u2026. When we visited it was raining, cold and dull. No chance of a sighting of mount Fuji \u2013 she is very \u201cshy\u201d in this weather \u2013 of which I am told there is a lot! The towns around the lake are like many across the",
          "On a clear day you can get a very good view of the Mount Fuji and the city of Hakone. We were very fortunate to have a nice sunny day",
          "Great for whole family. Windy during Summer season but worth to see the City of Hakone from the Lake. During Winter season, Mt Fuji are visible most of the time. Unfortunatelly not so during summer.",
          "If you like outdoors this is a must. Walking trails and the Tori gate are a must see. There are several parks all around and temples with gardens and walking pats.",
          "We were fortunate to visit on a perfect day. Everywhere we went we had good views of Fuji, which is special, for some reason. While the pirate boats are a bit odd they are comfortable & good for taking photos. Overall a pleasant experience.",
          "Yes the Pirate boat is worth taking. Yes pay for first class if it is crowded. They include a nice commentary without being intrusive.",
          "Viewing the lake was included with our Hakone FreePass. Operations end at 4:15pm so we missed it on our first day, but made it our a part of our morning agenda on the second. Great views!",
          "I am not sure why we sailed the lake on a pirate ship but what the heck. Depending on the weather determains whether you get a glimpse of Mt Fuji. Clouds blocked the mountain on my visit. The highlight was getting some very good photos of the tori gate that is situated in the",
          "You can approach the lake via a bus or the funicular, but don\u2019t miss the boat ride across. The floating prayer gate is beautiful, though currently under construction/ repair.",
          "Nice a round allot of mountain and its an amazing view and their a coffee and restaurants you can spend a good time",
          "Nice lake with your typical type of lake tour to get a decent view of Mt. Fuji. There are many restaurants, shops and galleries nearby.",
          "Had a lovely cruise on a gorgeous day - the views of Mt Fuji were spectacular. The water was such a deep blue and very calm. Would definitely recommend this excursion. The area is very peaceful.",
          "Visited the lake, have a lunch there and then take the rope way. It is a beautiful place but in winter, there isn't much to see.",
          "This is our second time visiting the lake during our trip to Hakone. Pretty and unique pirate boats , Japanese land mark Mt Fuji at the background. Must visit place if you are around in Hakone. If you have hakone pass - you can use all the transport around Hakone including",
          "we rode the classic looking ship going to another site before taking the cable car. during the boat ride you will see mt. fuji and the famous tori.",
          "The lake is nothing spectacular but unique in the settings of Hakone. Most travelers cross the lake to go into the ropeway.",
          "A tourist trap unfortunately. Not much to see and if you have been on boats and lakes before, this would be quite underwhelming. If you do it from owakudani then mt fuji is behind you at the very end and is far away so it's not really worth the photo. Please be mindful the",
          "Not a very big lake. Went on the pirate ship. Weather was pretty cold though the sun was out. To be honest, nothing much to see except you can see Mount Fuji on one part of the cruise. If you continue with the next leg, you get to see more of the volcano.",
          "We came here in December. Thought photos and the really thing was kinda different. Maybe its Winter. Still a nice lake but definitely not a wow.",
          "I don't think that the lake is worth the visit and the ropeway ride up to the shrine was a waste of time as it was freezing and covered in fog at the top. We did get some good views of Mount Fuji on the ride up to the peak of Hakone and the views were impressive until we were",
          "Taking the pirate ship on this lake is a must. The surrounding of this lake is very scenic with forest and golf courses.",
          "Incredible views and lots of good restaurants around, buy the hakone free pass so you can do the scenic cruise. Worth it for the views on a good day",
          "We went on the boat and walked to the shrine and on the ropeway and there was no sight of mount fujiii! Ultra sad as the announcements mock you throughout the experience by saying \" on the right you can now experience a beautiful view of mount Fuji!!\" All we saw was fog and rain.",
          "It\u2019s beautiful here. We were there very early in the morning and I got an unobstructed view of Mount Fuji and the famous red tori gate. The trek to see the red tori gate and the nearby shrine took about 15 mins. Unfortunately parts of the shrine was under construction so walking",
          "We visited Lake Ashi while on our tour with Shin of ToursbyLocals. It is so peaceful just watching the lake. Unfortunately we didn't see Mount Fuji due to clouds but on the train back from Kyoto we got a lovely view of Mount Fuji.",
          "On a clear day, you will be able to see Mt. Fuji while riding a Japanese Pirate Ship. Enjoy the view and serene Lake Ashi.",
          "We saw Lake Ashi when we took The Rope but did not take the boat ride. It\u2019s a beautiful lake - very serene.",
          "The lake is situated on top of the mountains, which is a historical volcano. One a fine day, you will be able to see mount Fuji from here. There are some shops around the boarding place for the pirate ship and they have some good foods there.",
          "A lovely natural environment! You can visit and old cedar tree forest and a ancient temple in the hills. Afterwards just grab a ferry across the lake.",
          "The lake has a nice view on Mt Fuji.Take the pirate boats and you will be pleasantly surprised by the experience, the views. It makes it more fun.",
          "We had a lovely half hour cruise of Lake Ashi. The views from the boat are beautiful and it made for a lovely relaxing time in an otherwise busy day.",
          "We took the boat cruise on Lake Ashi and it was a beautiful lake surrounded by beautiful scenery (including Mount Fuji). There are also a couple of great small-town stops along the lakefront, with nice restaurants and shops to peruse. Very relaxing experience!",
          "The ride in the ship is quiet and serene as you are mesmerised by the beautiful \"koyo\" (autumn leaves) on either sides of the river. Lake Ashi is also beautiful during sunset. So would recommend one to be present at the Hakone-machi side during sunset. It is a short walk up to",
          "I went with my wife and mother in law on the ship, i thoroughly enjoyed the scenery and the whole adventure of being on the Lake and spent a bit extra going 1st class.great views, didnt Fuji san that day due to the cloud cover but still an enjoyable day all round.",
          "We took the boat from one side to the cable car side. You're treated to a great view with mount fuji in the background.",
          "The boat only sails at specific times and can get quite busy so it\u2019s best to queue up early to be sure you can get on the boat you want Most people just wander around the top deck taking photos and there are some seats at the top. On a clear day you will see Mt Fuji. The cruise",
          "Is a nice place to stroll but too much tourist. Many shops and eatery. The pirate ships ride across the lake.",
          "Buy the Hakone Free Pass - worth every yen. So you can go on unlimited trips on the Pirate Ships, Ropeways and Cable cars.",
          "We took the Nankai Romance Car (reserved seating) from Shinjuku Station to Hakaone-Yumoto and then caught the Tozan bus express to Hakone-machi where we spent the night prior to taking the lake cruise. I would like to return and try fishing for trout in the lake. Boat rentals",
          "Post-Owakudani station, our ropeway cable car took us to Togendai station. At Togendai station, one could catch the ropeway back to Owakudani, catch a bus back to Gora station (and more) or catch a boat to Hakone-Machi. We opt for the boat (admission included in our Hakone Day",
          "This is not an easy trip if you have limited mobility despite assurances. We went to Mount Fuji, the coach parked up a good 200 yards from the centre, so we didn\u2019t get out of the coach. Then we went for \u201clunch\u201d, which was not included in our package, we knew that, but then we",
          "We enjoyed our boat trip on a mock pirate ship as part of the cable/ropeway/rail trip in the Hakone region using the Hakone Free Pass. Nice views. We were there when clouds covered Mt. Fuji, but it was still an enjoyable visit and took us to the lovely art museum at the south",
          "We were very lucky to be on the lake as sunset was approaching. The cloud cleared and we had a wonderful view of Mount Fuji.",
          "Although it was a Misty Moisty Cloudy day ,we did get to take some good photos of the Red Gate and Lake Ashi .....Not much to say. Caught a slight glimpse of Mt Fuji before the clouds got in to cover the whole mountain",
          "Like many places in Japan, the townships around the lake are tired and in need of tidyup. After arriving via the cable-car from Hakone we strolled around the port of Tokendai where the 'pirate' ships depart. By all means take the Cable Car it is a lovely trip.",
          "There was much more space with a 500yen upgrade (400 with the Hakone pass), with indoor seating and a separate open air top deck for viewing. The 'cruise' was short and unfortunately the clouds meant we didnt see anything of Fuju san but the views must be amazing on a clear day.",
          "This is part of the Hakone loop and is really beautiful. Too cloudy for Mount Fuji but still worth doing, as the scenery is lovely. Do the boat trip across then walk round the lake to the shrine.",
          "Although distance from either Shinjuku or Tokyo Station by train is a bit far (Around 2.5 to 3 hours), where you have to change train twice and again change to Hakone Ropeway (Cable Car), the trip is worth going. Our family have reached Togendai Station right at the shore of",
          "The bus service runs very regularly to Lake Ashi where the 'pirate ship' takes you across the lake to the ropeways which take you higher up the hillside. We were fortunate to get a glimpse of Mount Fuji during the crossing but were later rewarded with an even better view at the",
          "Lake Ashi itself is lovely. A caldera lake (elevation 723metres above mean sea level), it is surrounded by steep mountains that are thickly wooded. The air is fresh and cool. The brochures say that Mt Fuji should be visible (in the northwest direction) from the southern shore.",

          "The boat trip, walk through the cedars. Also the check point all very interesting. Everyone is so very friendly. Loved the play. Just walk and enjoy.",
          "We visited Hakone using the Hakone free pass which covered the train ride from Odawara station to Hakone-Yumoto station, the Tozen cable car, ropeway, buses and sailing ship on Lake Ashi. From Tokyo to Odawara, we used the JR pass on JR trains. We took a sightseeing cruize on",
          "Definitely worth trying out the pirate ship. A bit cliche, but overall interesting experience and different view of Lake Ashi.",
          "We took a return boat journey on Lake Ashi. The boats operating the trips are very atmospheric and the views across the lake, the woodland and the magnificent properties along the lake\u2019s shore make for a relaxing trip.",
          "We hiked from Hakone to the lake. Duration there and back: 3h way up and 2h way down. The first hour up is on the road so not very enjoyable with the high way over you. However, once you reach the old paved Tokaido road, it is a nice forest walk, you go through a river, very",

          "We bought the Hakone discount pass for 3 days the equivalent of $65 nz approx. This gave you unlimited trips on bus, ropeway ,cable car the pirate ship on Lake Ashi. Nice walk around the waterfront in old palace grounds and cedar tree walk to shrine. Fun boat trip!",
          "Great views from the Motohakone-Ko part of the lake. There\u2019s not much to see in the ferry to the other end but it does take you to the ropeway where you get more great views.",
          "Gorgeous lake with plenty of attractions surrounding it. Hakone Shrine is the perfect place to snap good photos capturing the area\u2019s beauty. It wasn\u2019t terribly crowded when we were there, but it can get a bit chaotic at Motohakone - where the sightseeing cruise takes off from .",
          "The boat ride across Lake Ashi is a lovely experience. We caught the second ferry of the morning (large pirate like ship) and it wasn't overly crowded. The water was calm and the scenery was beautiful. When you board make your way up to the top level for optimal views and to",

          "The Lake Ashi cruise should not be missed if you have the 72 hour Hakone Free Pass. I definitely got more than what I paid for when I did the whole Hakone Tozan Train-Ropeway-Gondola-Pirate Ship Cruise (to and from Togendai). It was fun. (I love lakes!) I do however want to",

          "We rode on \"Pirates Boat\" to enjoy this beautiful lake. The lake water was clear and clean. The air mountain also very fresh, and of course the scenery was amazing. If you like photography, then you must visit this place to take as much as possible the beautiful scenery.",
          "Such a beautiful spot. We walked round the lake to the shrine, used the opportunity to take many wonderful photos. Almost impossible to take a bad one. The shops are close, plus food available from several outlets. Visit the historic Change Station and walk through the forest.",

          "We rode on one of the \u201cpirate\u201d boats. It wasn\u2019t a long ride but a pleasant trip. There\u2019s a small snack bar and you can sit inside if it\u2019s chilly. The shores are mostly forested but there are a couple Shinto shrines that you pass.",

          "This is a beautiful lake. We bought all inclusive tickets which allowed us to take the bus to the lake, go on the boats, rope car, cable car and local trains back to Yugawara. The tickets cost 4,000 yen each, which I think was extremely cheap for what we were able to",

          "The lake itself is nothing special in my opinion. What is really nice to see is the Mount Fuji, however make sure you visit the lake on a clear day otherwise your visit here is not worth it. We took the cable car to the lake then the boat to Hakone moto where we found an amazing",
          "Wonderful lake. It is something special. It is possible also to make a little cruise on a pirate boat an see many different places in few minutes. Unfortunately wasn't impossible to me to see the Fuji san but I appreciate it anyway",

          "Majestical feeling & views, we came from Kyoto but it was worth the trip You can fill a day here possibly 2 or 3",
          "We took a ride around the lake with the pirate ship. The kids are loving it. The ship is big enough that we don't feel too crowded. If you want to get to the front of the ship (and pose like in Titanic) and have a photo spot for yourself, you might want to take the VIP class",
          "We almost skipped going to the lake because we were short on time, only having stopped overnight in Hakone briefly. So glad we didn\u2019t!! It is beautiful!",
          "Great for whole family. Windy during Summer season but worth to see the City of Hakone from the Lake.",
          "Nice views sometimes but if clouds roll in not much to see. Pleasant boat ride but ours was a bit short. The lake is dotted with fake tourist old style Japanese sailing ships. Homie duck paddle boats. Experience is nice and you may get a view of the mountain but mostly",
          "I had read very good reviews about the boat ride across the lake. Unfortunately for us, it was raining. The trip was not pleasant, and there were no views of Mt. Fuji. Not the fault of anyone but just bad luck for us. Maybe next time .....",
          "I always love to cruise, and this was wonderful except for the roaring wind. The sky was clear and the view of Mt. Fuji was spectacular. Lake Ash is a wonderful lake with lots of interesting history. The tour director on the boat told us stories, fables, myths, and history",
          "Our tour took the ropeway down to the lake and then walked to the boat dock. The cruise ship was a catamaran with bleacher seats on the ramp up to the top deck. Unfortunately it was hazy so we could only get hints of Mount Fuji from time to time. In my experience these kind of",
          "We took a boat ride on Lake Ashi! It is very calm and smooth ride. There are beautiful views all around!",
          "As part of the sightseeing route in Hakone, you can take the ferry ride from Hakonemachi-lo or Motohakone-ko to cross Lake Ashi to Togendai-ko. Enjoy the scenery and cooling ride while on the ferry crossing the lake.",
          "Wonderful boat ride across the lake. Check out the Buddha's nearby. Mt. Fuji views and one of the highlights of our trip.",
          "Beautiful lake in the Hakone region, highly recommend taking the boat tour. On a good day you can see Mt Fuji, shops and restaurants around the lake are charming and worth a leisurely stroll",
          "Never felt so close to nature. So beautiful and well kept place, good weekend getaway with kidz. Must visit.",
          "We have found a good idea to plan 2 days in Hakone before moving from Tokyo to Kyoto and it turned out to be a great idea. Biught the hakone pass, for 5k yen and treveled with the ropeway, enjoyed the boat ride, and toured on the side of Lake Ashi. Can only recommend!",
          "Cruise is beautiful and the journey took about 30mins. I took the cruise at Togendai-Ko to HakoneMachi-ko. The cruise is like a pirate ship with lower internal deck and upper open air deck. If you want fresh air, It would be nice to be on the upper deck but seats are limited.",
          "Most scenic place. The snow peaked Mt Fuji looks like a wonder of the world. Worth staying in this area for a couple of days to relax in peace.",
          "Did a cruise across the lake on a pirate ship it was very cold when we did this cruise and too much cloud on the mountain to see it, but ok and fun got dropped off at the other side go the lake would recommend if you have time",
          "This is a magical place, without knowing to much about the Shintoism you can fill the spirit and harmony between mother nature and men. Beautiful landscapes and peacefull environment will let you escape from reality and feel the connection and purpose of the creation, is a must",
          "We enjoyed the quiet location as we stayed overnight beside the lake. By around 5pm all the day trippers had disappeared and we had the area around the lakeside to ourselves. Also a good view of Mt Fuji although we got much closer views during our drive into the Japanese alps",
          "We were rushed onto a boat for a 15 minute tour of the lake with no explanation of what we were seeing. I thought it was more interesting watching the carp beside the dock while waiting to get onto the boat, This boat took us to the ropeway which was the next part of our tour,",
          "The lake is not huge, but it is in a nice setting--very forested (deep greer) and \"civilization\" is only at the two ends of the lake. There is a boat ride available that is on a \"funky\" modern pirate ship that the Japanese refer to as a \"Viking ship\" for no apparent reason!",
          "We had lunch at the bakery overlooking the lake and then used our all day pass (well worth the 4000 yen) to board the pirate boat for a trip to the other end of the lake. The boat is well designed with plenty of space on the upper decks to get photos but also plenty of seating",
          "The lake is beautiful surrounded by green trees. It is really a pleasant place. The buildings at the ferry are just like European style. The journey of taking the pirate ship was very good! You can even see the Mount Fuji during nice weather.",
          "This is a nice, pretty make, with some pleasant walking. However, much of the walk along the east side of the river is along quite unpleasant roads which can get very busy.",
          "Lake is just like you see in the brochure books. Lovely and easy trip across the lake and so beautiful. Love the experience",
          "We went for a cruise on Lake Ashi in one of the pirate ships. It was a sunny day and the lake was calm. There are beautiful views across the lake and the surrounding hills. It was a lovely experience.",
          "It\u2019s a lake with a backdrop of Mount Fiji. There are fishermen dotted around...lots of trees to the waters edge and you can take a 50 minute trip on a fake galleon...it\u2019s okay.",
          "We were very lucky that we saw Mount Fuji on our first day when we walk around the lake on our first day in Hakone. It was simply beautiful. The Hakone sightseeing boat ( or pirate boat as it is in Japanese) takes you cross the lake within 30 minutes, the fare is included in",
          "Taking the sightseeing cruise across Lake Ashi, it's a great way to see Mt. Fuji. Really enjoy the trip.",
          "The Lake Ashi is enormous and it was such an amazing experience to be on a large 'French Ship' and cruising down the lake surrounded by amazing snow covered mountains. Its a MUST DO when you are here.",
          "Relaxing 25 minute traverse of the lake from end to end, with phone ops along the way, including the famous Mount Fuji, if the clouds allow. Part of the Hakone Loop.",
          "The boat ride across the lake was pleasant. Nothing special. The boat was crowded and we waiting quite a while before boarding.",
          "Enjoyed a cruise on Lake Ashi. The surrounding views were so beautiful. Kudos to the Japanese, they preserve their nature and its clean everywhere. The development around the Lake is controlled and everything worked like clockwork. Lake Toba in Indonesia is bigger but is",
          "We expected to get Fuji view from a boat on the Lake Ashi (that what people said), unfortunately we didn't get it. Just imagine how nice it would be if the sky wasn't cloudy. so, make sure you come along to this site to the same purpose when the sky is clear enough. Better to go",
          "Walked alongside the lake and took a boot back.Very good and nice view of mount Fuiji. Wortwhile a visit! Had a good Lunch at bakery and seats with stunning views",
          "We took a water taxi on Lake Ashi to the Hakone Hotel. The boat was a supposed to be a galleon, but was a bit of fun really! The views were less than exciting because a heavy mist descended over the lake and swathed everything to the extent that we could see very little. I am",
          "good day at lake ashi, everything look so serene and beautiful. We went in april, and the fog made it even prettier",
          "We took the Pirate ship (why?) across Lake Ashi and enjoyed the many views of the hills and Mount Fuji.",
          "Visiting Lake Ashi is not about thrills or history, really even; but it is about natural beauty and quiet - both things in fairly short supply on a busy trip. The weather matters a little. It can be quite misty up the mountain, but pleasant on the water. I have only Fuji once,",
          "This small placid lake also gives views of Mt Fuji from a distance. A calm twenty minute boat ride offerd a relaxing break.",
          "If one visits Hakone, Lake Ashi is a must visit place, very scenic and lively to walk around with lot of shopping opportunities.",
          "The scenery is fantastic and relaxing as we were on the Viking styled ship we could see the top of mountain Fuji with the snow covering",
          "It was a glorious sunny day when we came here and Lake Ashi sparkled in the sunlight. You can do a sightseeing cruise across Lake Ashi with the Hakone Free Pass. This is a nice way to see the lake from different angles and also to spot Mount Fuji off in the distance.",
          "Took a day round trip with Fuji Hakone Pass - Kawaguchiko to Gotemba (Bus), to Togendai (bus route W), to Hakone Machi port (pirate cruise), to MotoHakone via Cedar Avenue (on foot), to Kowakidani Station (Bus H), to Gora (via Hakone Tozan Rail), to Souzan, Owakudani (Ropeway)",
          "It is a relaxing and stunning spot to spend some quiet time. The wind was heavy and we could not go on the boat ride though",
          "The view is just amazing. You can sit and relax while admiring the view or you can hike going to the nearby shrine. We went to this place as part of our Hakone Free Pass. You\u2019ll see people fishing or sit having coffee. It\u2019s a good way to take in the wonderful view and just take",
          "Weather did not favor us during our Hakone stay. We took the Hakone circuit on a very rainy day and that meant that the views during the boat ride were non-existent. A pity!",
          "We were on the boat for approx 15 mins. It was a sunny day but quite chilly so standing on the deck was not pleasurable. There were too many people on the boat and it was difficult to see out of the windows. There was a commentary but no-one could hear it.",
          "We went on a 30 mins boat ride, it was really nice to see mt Fuji from a different angle. It was lovely to see some cherry blossoms from the boat as well, the views were amazing.",
          "Unfortunately when we were here it was foggy, damp and a little miserable so no sightings of the elusive Mt Fuji, but I can imagine it\u2019s quite beautiful when the weather is good. Our guide stated that you would be very lucky to get good clear views so have low expectations and",
          "A cruise from Hakone Machi Kou to Togendai in a large vessel. Go for the first class if you want the best views. In Togendai get on the Ropeway for a 28 minute ride to Sounzan for spectacular views of Mount Fuji.",
          "Lovely views along the way. Comfortable and well arranged. Was a little crowded. But still worth it to do the round trip.",
          "Whilst staying in Tokyo, Hakone was a great day trip out of the city. We were fortunate enough to go on a clear day so we had some great views of Mount Fuji. If Not a clear day you may be disappointed as I don\u2019t think our day trip would have been as enjoyable if we couldn\u2019t see",
          "Came to Lake Ashi on a beautiful sunny day. Arrived to board a nice pirate boat ride. On the boat we seen beautiful picturesque views of water and mountains .",
          "On a beautiful day this is a must do. Buy tickets to ride a boat across the lake and enjoy the scenery. On a clear day you can get some great shots of Mt. Fuji. Theirs shops and exhibits along the lake shores so you could make a day of it.",
          "Love the lake. Boat for leisure as well as small paddle boats to enjoy the lake. Very nice pathways next to the lake. Nice for relaxing with family and friends",
          "Lake Ashi is a volcano crater lake and has black sand beaches. Even though it was windy, the lake was calm and smooth sailing. Great wAy to spend 40 minutes. Great for photographers.",
          "As quite a random attraction in a mountain lake in Japan, the pirate ship cruises prove a fun way to cross the lake, on a clear day the views of Fuji are quite spectacular, and the pirate ship is fun, particularly for children. It's a long trip from Tokyo for just this, so make",
          "The view is not particularly stunning unless it is a clear sunny day and you can see mount Fuji. Anyway, it is a comfortable ride. Worth trying.",
          "Really gorgeous trip on the pirate ship like boat. Get the free pass so it\u2019s cheaper. Not a lot to look at on the way but a relaxing time.",
          "We took the cruise around Lake Ashi what a beautiful view of the lake and the mountains surrounds it was cold unfortunately but we still enjoyed the view from inside.",
          "Nice trip, a day well spent. Unfortunately the time of year was unlucky, the vegetation was mainly still dormant from winter. We took a trip on the cruise, which was also nice, but not truely special. Worth for the day, but no WOW.",
          "We really enjoyed this day ... the train ride in the way was a little squishy but worth the cable car ride, views of Mt Fuji and beautiful boat cruise. The Hakone Free pass was excellent value and we were lucky enough to be there on a clear spring day, so the views were",
          "We did the full route from Gora over the ropeway and down to Lake Ashi. Both definitely recommended. Views were amazing (you need it to be a clear day to see Fuji) Can recommend Hakone Tent as a place to stay right by Gora Station and traditional Japanese style!",
          "A must do in Hakone, it takes you from Togendai to the other side where Hakone Shrine and all the other touristy spots including to the longest rope bridge in Japan.. The cruise ship has a guide, it\u2019s mostly crowded though but is a nice experience.. If you are purchasing the",
          "The village on the lake is so pretty and with an amazing view of Mount Fuji in the background. You can sit in the caf\u00e9 and enjoy a cup of tea or coffee while looking at the iconic mountain in the background.",
          "We were there on a tour--day trip to Mt Fuji and Lake Ashi and bullet train. SO owrth the trip as Lake Ashi is absolutely gorgeous! Take the gondola up to the top of the mountain and the views are unbelievable!",
          "We enjoyed it! Took a fun boat and experience the other size with amazing food and a view. I would recommend visiting if you have time.",
          "The boat was a lovely activity. Pay the little extra and get nice seats in first class (or you can buy the ticket on the boat)",
          "We had high expectations of this area - but it turns out that the only great part was the fabulous view of Mt Fuji once you've crossed the Lake to the other side. Maybe it was because we were off-season, but we found the area under-developed in terms of signage (very little in",
          "We took the Romancecar from Shinjuku, Tokyo which took 80 minutes to get to Hakone and then the Mountain Railway and cable car over sulphur springs and down to the lake. All booked at the Odakyu travel desk in Shinjuku station and not expensive (one pass covers all). The lake is",
          "Loved the ambience. The pirate cruise and the view of mt.Fuji was amazing.. the mountain is a little far though but had breathtaking views",
          "It's definitely worth taking one of the cruises across Lake Ashi. The views are lovely, especially if you get to see Mt Fuji. It can very get cold and windy during winter though, but we braved it anyway to stand on the open air deck.",
          "Taking bus opposite Hakone-Yumoto using Hakone Free Pass will bring you to Motohakone. There you will see the beautiful Lake Ashi. You will need to walk a while to see the famous Torii Gate that sits in the lake. I visited the lake in mid Dec, the weather is cooling and scenery",
          "A wonderful place to experience, the landscape surrounding Lake Ashi is naturally gorgeous. Provided you have the Hakone Free Pass, I highly recommend taking the ship across the lake, then taking a stroll along the edge, to the park and shrines. Considering I was there in",
          "We traveled from Tokyo to Hakone hoping to see My. Fuji. Unfortunately, we didn't that day but Lake Ashi at sunset was still absolutely beautiful. I'll never forget that view of the lighted up tori gate on the lake.",
          "This is a gorgeous lake and you can take a cruise on a \"pirate ship\" too. If the weather is kind and the surroundings are clear, you may catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji in the distance.",
          "We took the pirate ship like how tourists are supposed to do it... I must say, the ship does look a bit cheesy. Ride was all, but didn't have a good seat so no good views. I didn't see Fuji San at all.",
          "Obviously a view one has to see, when visiting Japan. The Majestic Fuji San peeking in over surrounding hills on lake Ashi. In a way a pity the experience is so sterile. I do not want any noisy on-lake activities but some nice terraced cafe's , taverne's, would be nice. The",

          "There are 3 different cruise boats in Lake Ashi and we managed to try 2 of them (Victory and Wasa). There is quite a bit of history around this lake and you can hear some of the synopsis while cruising on the boat. Just so pleasant to stop and visit the nearby places and then",
          "Hop on one of the lake\u2019s cruise boats to enjoy the lovely setting and hop off to explore several small villages. A great way to spend an afternoon.",
          "After a disappointing no show Mt Fuji, it was a relieved to see that the cruise along Lake Ashi went ahead with no clouds and mountains along the side were lush green and beautiful (we went late September). It was a short (15 minute) cruise to get to the ropeway. Be sure to go",
          "A good visit to the lake and its surrounding environment. The weather although is always raining but it didn't dampen our interest to visit the lake. There were many visitors when I was visiting there.The air was cool and the scenary of the place is really nice and peaceful",
          "Took a three stop boat ride which was very pleasant with helpful crew. You can choose to stay on the boat or get off and board again in during their next stop. Recommended.",
          "Unfortunately we still didn't see the top of Mt Fuji but The Jolly Roger is an excellent trip in beautiful peaceful surroundings. We had been up to the crater top on Mt Kamiyama and descended by cable car, then went aboard what looked like a fantastic pirate ship out of Pirates",
          "Very peaceful lake with ferries and supposedly great view of Mount Fuji. Unfortunately, the weather wasn't kind to us and the view was just of clouds - and more clouds / fog. Regardless, it is a peaceful tour and well worth the visit for families with kids.",
          "We've spent a few days in hakone and had saved the lake for the really sunny day - to really make the most of it. In all honesty it wasn't quite what we expected. It was entirely pleasant - the pirate ship, a stroll around motohakone, etc. - but it was all very quiet and smaller",
          "I enjoyed the cruise around Lake Ashi, after taking the ropeway over the mountains. It is a pretty lake & a nice way to view Mt Fuji (if the weather is kind to you, as it is often partially or mostly covered by cloud). If I had more time, I'm sure stopping to visit the shrine",
          "We used the unusual Pirate boat to cross the lake to the Hakone Rope-way, which gave great views across the Lake. We also walked along the shore as well as visited several small parks. Very well worth the visit.",
          "Great journey on the lake with super views. On a good day you get a view of Mount Fuji too! We were lucky and clouds dispersed giving a super views.",
          "If you want the iconic photo of Fuji and the tori gate with the lake as a backdrop, you can't miss taking the ferry across the lake. From there take the rope way up to owakudani.",
          "We were staying in Hakone and paid 4000 yen for an all day transportation pass. It included this boat ride and we did it. Just a pleasant 30 mins ride across a mountain Lake. You see the Otorii Gate for the Hakone shrine standing in water as well as another little",
          "Will visit again as is a nice place. Raining make me disappointed for my hakone trip.. Hope to see you soon.",
          "We took a boat ride on the lake. It was rather empty and very tranquil. The lake had many recreational opportunities for large and small.",
          "If you have the Hakone Freepass with you, this cruise is a must to ride! There are 3 different pirate ships & depends on your luck on which ship you get to ride on~ It was a cloudy day with on & off rain in Hakone. We didn't get to see Fuji-san with the clouds in the way on the",
          "Take a cruise around the lake or enjoy many of the water based or walking, cycling activities there. A must for a warm day but a no no for cold and wet days.",
          "Lake Ashi is a scenic lake in Hakone area known for its views of Mount Fuji and its hot springs. We did a cruise of Lake Ashi while returning from Gotemba Peace Park. It was a short cruise of about 20 minutes, unfortunately it was raining and very cloudy not allowed us any view",
          "We took a cruise around lake Ashi. It's a beautiful lake. If you are lucky you can see Mt Fuji from the cruise but we weren't that lucky that day !!!!",
          "Excellent, a short cruise on a beautiful lake. We did it as part of our tour. A really beautiful place.",
          "It's OK and worth going on the cablecar ropeway if not too cloudy but nothing really here. Restaurants are poor and some weren't even open when we got here early. Not very good. Starts to get SO busy too on ropeway around 11am so we were glad we did it early and out the way",
          "We took the short boat ride from the Hakone Kojiri terminal to Hakone-en. There are restrooms on board. Lake Ashinoko is a crater lake. The ride is relaxing and the scenery of lake and mountains is awe-inspiring.",
          "Nice scenic cruise in a large ferry with a comfortable interior lounge with recorded bilingual narration of what you're passing by. You'll see both fishing and pleasure boats on the lake, and a couple of bright orange Tori Gates (traditionally mark the entrance to Shinto",
          "Beautiful lake with a great experience on one of these cool looking pirate ships. Great view of the famous landmark shrine. A good walk around the lake as well.",
          "Enjoying the breeze of the mountain and lake wind while riding the pirate cruise is the best, you can enjoy the surrounding ocean of trees in any season, it's highly recommended to come here in autumn, when all the leaves are turning color and will become a hills of colours",
          "Lots to do and lots to see at this beautiful lake. Cable cars, boat trips, lovely villages and fantastic restaurants. Be sure to visit Lake Ashi",

          "Lake Ashi is such a beautiful sight. Just to see it from afar is gorgeous enough but make sure you take the pirate ship tour! It's so much fun because you get to have a closer look of the lake but also a better view of Mt. Fuji as well! You don't want to miss it! It's wonderful!",
          "Lovely view of the forest and wonderful journey on the lake. We could not see Mt Fuji though as it was too cloudy. Nonetheless a lovely way to end the day after Mt Fuji.",

          "Were taken here as part of a day tour. Getting there early is a good idea as it gets very busy. The Skywalk is impressive but I only went a short way along as I'm not great with heights and swaying bridges! You can still see Mount Fuji on a clear day without actually",
          "We took the bus from the station and it was hourly. The cost is ok and yes it does have great views across to Mount Fuji but of course only if there is no cloud cover. We had done and it did add a little drama to our pictures. There are free places to take pictures but don't",
          "We were ecstatic to see Mishima Skywalk until it rained really hard and could not see Mt. Fuji or even the city. \ud83d\ude29 so check the weather prior to your visit. Otherwise, the experience was okay. I still enjoyed myself for a little bit walking through the bridge. Bring your camera",

          "Firstly , weather! You come here on a cloudy , its just a suspension bridge. But you come here on a bright sunny day where clouds do not cover Mt.Fuji , you are in for a very awesome view and photo spots with Mt.Fuji in the background. Not only that! you get to view such lush",
          "Pointless, and that's being generous. Don't waste your time. Someone thought that building a bridge from nowhere to nowhere was a good idea. Yeah, you have some nice views of Mount Fuji (with several powerlines and chopped trees ruining the moment), but that's BEFORE crossing",
          "Mishima Skywalk is apparently the longest pedestrian-only suspension bridge in Japan. I went there on April 29 and the view was incredible! On real sunny days, you can even see Mount Fuji. The bridge sways and shakes a lot when there's wind in addition to a lot of people",
          "You can enjoy Mt. Fuji from here on the 400m bridge named Mishima Skywalk. After visiting here, I recomend you to go to the Mishima Shrine and the Nirayama Reverberatory Furnaces. You can also enjoy the strawberry picking near here in season."

          "The longest suspension bridge in Japan, not easy to reach there, but it was well worth a visa it if you are in Hakone. We took the bus from Hakonemachi port (after completing our Pirate ship cruise) and it takes about 20 mins from there. \u2026",
          "WOW amazing sky walking n long zipped Slider ...",

Many activities to do in your time there whether you want to Zipline, do an obstacle course, see some dinosaurs, visit some little forest eggs, or shop vendors and buy flowers.",

They have places to eat food, romantic heart-shaped flower pieces from an overarching outlook area, you can get a Segway tour, or a dirt bike tour, or even go zip lining. They have done a good job of using the space effectively.",

          "A good place to see Mt. Fuji",
          "Fun walking over the bridge. It's quite impressive. You can watch a detailed video about its construction in 2015. And there are zip lines to use to do something unusual. Also an athletic course at tree level. Built as a tourist destination and in my opinion worth a trip when the weather is nice: you can see Fuji-San and the sea!",
          "On a crowded day, you can't really stop and enjoy the view as everybody is eager to cross. There are activities to do on both sides. For people who like the outdoors, zip lines, segway rides and obstacle course (c/o Forest Adventure) are available on the other end.",

          "It's fun to go with friends and family! Great view of Fuji! I recommend going in the early part of the day as Fuji tends to blur towards the later half due to rise in temperature and clouds. You can enjoy small adventures like zip lining, wall climbing and jungle adventure. They also have Segway.",

          "Overall very good day at Mishima skywalk. We were coming from ShinFuji. View was very clear to Mount Fuji. Lots of activities and cafes. You can do a Segway or Quad trip in the forest; climb canopies; slide between the valley; enjoy local food; and of course take great photos of Fujisan.",

          "Dependent on the weather, but great place for Mt Fuji photos.",

          "You can enjoy the great view and intense winds there lol\nThere are ziplines too. Nice place : )",
          "Got blessed with an awesome view of Mt. Fuji and the surrounding area. Very cool mountain breeze; make sure to wear something thick during the Winter months. You can ride Japan's longest zipline for around $15, had to pass since we're short of time (staff says needs 45 mins), and it's too cold.",
          "I enjoyed the experience",
          "This place is okay to stop by and spend an hour or two. It really depends on the weather for the good views. There is also cable-gliding to try for. Otherwise there is not a lot to see and do.",
          "Suspension bridge with an amazing view!! \n\nA plus is that there are outdoor \"adventure\" activities eg: flying fox, rock climbing and an adventure course that you can take sign up after crossing the bridge. Really fun and highly recommend the flying fox!! (About an hour extra though)",

          "Its just a bridge... I enjoyed it on super windy day, so it was scary and exciting! But go here if you have free time or extra money. I don't recommend it as a stop.\n\nThe only reason I couldn't enjoy it was because there is no real history \u2026",

          "I really liked this attraction. There was so much to do and see. The admission price is well worth it. I will go back.",
          "Great view there with panoramic cities, sea and mount Fuji. It is worth to pay 1000 Yen but take enough time to spend on the bridge, both ends and souvenir spot. At least one hour may needed.",
          "We visited Hakone for about 2 days. More than enough. \nTo go there you must take the bus to Mishima, about 40 minutes from Lake Ashi.\n1.100 \u00a5 per adult. Discount if You visit with disabled people 50%.\nGot tyrolines, ice creams, bar, garden \u2026",

          "Thinking of overcoming fear of heights? Well this place offers more than just overcoming that fear. Apart from the beautiful landscape view, there\u2019s a zip line too.They probably have the fanciest bathrooms in the region.",
          "It is a tourist place that is worth the stop. The views are spectacular but be ready for the bridge to sway. They have pamphlets in 8 languages so hopefully they have yours. The zip line is fun but wish that they aloud little kids to do it, you have to be 120 cm tall.",
          "We were lucky as it was a clear day and one could clearly see mount Fuji . Admission was 1000 yen . For those who visit I would highly recommend going up to the souvenir shop (accessible by escalator). They have a nice floral decoration, great for photos . Try their ice cream made from real milk , you won't regret it",

          "We had a lot of fun esp. The adventure activities and ziplining. It was 3600 JPY per person with 1000 JPY for skywalk entry. It was a lot of fun. Better to go as early as possible so that you can have more fun. Adventure activities requires \u2026",
          "Not for those with fear of heights \ud83d\ude05",
          "The view is great even if it's a bit expensive for the experience. The bad review is mostly for the Owl cafe. The owls can't move on their own and have barely 10cm of cords that link them to the branches.",
          "Come on a sunny day. Decent view of Mt. Fuji. The \u00a51000/adult is worth it. Some ticketing staff can speak English. There are now zip lines and \"Forest Adventure\" like attractions.",
          "Nice view of Fuji mountain. Zip line is fun to try",
          "Find a nice place to view the lakes and Mt Fuji and avoid this place. There are some amazing views from the roadside looking over Lake Ashi onto Mt Fuji. The Sky Walk is useful if you need a rest or toilet break. I would not suggest going out of your way to visit it.",
          "If the weather is good you have a nice view of mt Fuji, but I wouldn't plan a trip around this attraction. It's far from the shinkansen station and a little bit pricey.",

          "Amazing views of Mishima and Mount Fuji",
          "Nice place out of the city. We can see and hear the water flowing below the bridge. Can see different hills around, but we could not see mount Fuji due to clouds. It's not as thrilling as the name suggests 'skywalk'.",
          "We can see a nice view of Mishima city and mouth Fuji. The bridge also nicely builded.",
          "Great place to visit as a tourist. Three bridge is quite high though, and you can see through the grating in the floor. So if you have a problem with heights this may not be for you.",

          "Absolutely breath taking... Food vendors and shopping was good too! Many English speakers.",
          "Beautiful view of mount Fuji! There's a fun adventure Park there with ATV's, ziplining, and more. It's 20 minutes from the JR train and only cost around $10 to get there. The unagi in this town is amazing! Great place to stop when traveling between Kyoto and Tokyo. This town has very few English speakers have a map and pictures ready.\ud83d\ude05",
          "Nice place. In entire hakone trip Mishima skywalk and ropeway are excellent. But, in winter we can't cover all places. We missed autumn leaves there. I recommend to plan before Nov 3rd week for hakone and mishima.",

          "Nice view.. better visit in the morning when the weather clearer.. u can view fuji mountain..",
          "There are a lot of activities that you can do in this place but the major activity is crossing the bridge. For people who are afraid of heights then this is the best place to overcome your fears. All i can see are beautiful views and also \u2026",
          "Make sure the sky is clear, pretty underwhelming if you can't see in the distance",

          "Great place, great views of Mt Fuji",
          "One of the best places to see the view of mount fuji. If the weather is fine and no clouds you could see the best of mount fuji.\nLarge car park, very clean and nice wash rooms, restaurants make this place too good.",
          "Cool tourist attraction but that's all it is. I thought this might be a bridge to somewhere but it appears that it was built simply for tourists. Good views but that's about it. Worth a stop if you are already driving by but don't make a side trip to see it.",
          "Amazing view, and though I didn't partake in the activities such as the zip line, they looked like great fun.",
          "The views of Fuji-san would be spectacular from here if you are lucky. I wasn't... \nThere is entrance fee of 1000yen which gets discounted to 900yen is you have Hakone pass...",

          "We could view the highest mountain- Fuji San from this longest (400m) sky bridge. U can spend the complete day if you have children who can participate in  adventurous activities",
          "Really interesting place. We went there on a whim and it was totally worth it.",
          "This wonderful walk over the valley gives you quite the view, but don't expect to always see Mt. Fuji; winter will likely give you the best view. Better to make a reservation for the zip-line if you want to take the full course; \u2026",

          "A great place to take the family. I enjoyed the bridge and the huge turkey legs that they sell. They are currently building a Zip Line and obstacle course which I will definitely come back to use. I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family.",
          "It's a bit expensive, but there are many delicious things to eat and drink. The view of Mishima to around Suruga is very good and a lot of trendy people come. Large car parking with staff to help you exit onto the road when you leave.",

        "wiki": "The COVID-19 pandemic originated with a cluster of mysterious, suspected pneumonia cases in the city of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, China. A Wuhan hospital notified the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019. On 31 December, the Wuhan CDC disclosed to the media that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to Huanan Seafood Market after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the National Health Commission (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. Chinese authorities formally notified the World Health Organization on this same day. On 8 January 2020, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia. The sequence of the virus was soon published on an open-access database.Public and media criticism has labeled responses by the Wuhan and Hubei authorities as delayed and as failing to contain the outbreak in its early stage. By 29 January, the virus spread to all provinces of mainland China. All provinces of mainland China initiated the highest response level to public health emergency. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" on 31 January, citing reasons of spread in other countries, particularly those without robust healthcare systems. By 8 February, over 724 died from the coronavirus infection-associated pneumonia and 34,878 were confirmed to have been infected. In Hubei alone, there were 24,953 cases of infections and 699 related deaths.The Chinese government may have censored discussions about the outbreak since the beginning of its spread. On 25 January, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping warned about a \"grave situation\" facing China. The Party Politburo formed a special leading group for epidemic control, led by Premier Li Keqiang. The 25 January Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled. Passengers across the country have been checked for their temperatures. Commands for epidemic control (CEC) have been formed in different regions including Wuhan and Hubei. Many inter-province bus services and railway services have been suspended. By 29 January, all Hubei cities were quarantined. Curfew laws were implemented in Huanggang, Wenzhou, and other mainland cities. In February 2020, the region also saw a huge shortage of face masks and other protective gear despite itself being the world's manufacturing hub for these products. Other countries donated medical supplies to help China deal with the epidemic.On 25 February, the number of newly confirmed cases outside mainland China exceeded those from within for the first time; the WHO praised the effectiveness of measures taken in the country. By 6 March the reported number of new cases had dropped to well fewer than 100 nationally per day, down from thousands per day at the height of the crisis. On 13 March, the number of newly imported cases passed the number of domestically transmitted new cases for the first time.Fear, regional discrimination in China, and racial discrimination within and beyond China increased with the growing number of reported cases of infections despite calls for stopping the discrimination by many governments. Some rumors circulated across Chinese social media, along with endorsements and counter-rumor efforts by media and governments. The Chinese government has worked to censor and counter reporting and criticism about the crisis and portray the official response to the outbreak in a positive light. They have also provided humanitarian assistance to other countries dealing with the virus. News outlets have reported concerns that the Chinese government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths.On 26 July, China saw its highest number of daily cases since March.\n\n\n== Graphics ==\n\n\n== Context ==\n\nNew infectious diseases impose a serious threat to the health of the general public. Their origins are often mysterious despite intensive research efforts. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002\u201303 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans.Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in China have been worried about the potential return of the deadly virus which motivated the Chinese government to reform its public health system to handle the next public health crisis. As part of the reform, China expanded the laboratory networks to handle the pathogens of the infectious diseases which included a newly built BSL-4 laboratory in Wuhan and a national key laboratory to investigate into pneumonia with unclear causes. Zeng Guang, the Chief Scientist at China CDC believed that a quicker publication of the epidemic information was a lesson that China learned from the SARS outbreak as the lack of information release worsened the outbreak.With the improved public health system, China managed to handle several public health emergencies. In coping with the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak starting from Mexico, China developed and distributed vaccines to 100 million people within months as an active prevention. During the 2013 H7N9 outbreak in East China, the country's health system identified the pathogen 5 days after the outbreak. Test kits for diagnosis were designed and distributed to all mainland provinces 3 days after the identification. Within months, effective vaccines were developed. Besides, Chinese academic Li Lanjuan and her group was the first to reveal the virus's transmission methods, molecular mechanisms and effective treatment.However, Southern Metropolis Daily stated that although people paid more attention to public health, the government's funding to the health system was far from enough as CDCs in smaller municipalities had to reduce their staff. 10 years after the SARS outbreak, few people wore a face mask when they had respiratory symptoms and the hospitals were cutting the fever clinics off. Despite confidence in winning the next battle against SARS, Zhong Nanshan who earned fame in fighting the SARS outbreak in 2003 still held a conservative attitude to whether the Chinese officials would lie to the people about a disease outbreak.Early cases surrounding the animal market suggested potential animal-to-human transmission while later the virus was found to be able to transmit from ill people to others. There have been cases where asymptomatic patients transmitted the virus to others. According to China NHC, the virus transmits by droplets or close contact while some proposed that feces could also be where the virus hides and transmits from. The typical symptoms of the viral infection included fever, dry cough, dyspnea, headache and pneumonia which are usually developed after an incubation time lasting as long as 2 weeks. The existence of mild but infectious cases complicated the epidemic control efforts. It is also noticed that patients might be able to transmit the virus even during the incubation period.\n\n\n== Early response by Wuhan ==\n\n\n=== Discovery ===\n\nThe first confirmed patient started experiencing symptoms on 1 December 2019, though the South China Morning Post later reported that the first case may have been a 55-year-old patient from Hubei province as early as 17 November. More recently, on 27 March 2020, news outlets citing a government document reported that a 57-year-old woman, who started having symptoms on 10 December 2019 and subsequently tested positive for the coronavirus disease, was described in The Wall Street Journal on 6 March 2020, may have been patient zero in the coronavirus pandemic. Although the first confirmed patient did not have any exposure to Huanan Seafood Market, an outbreak of the virus began among the people who had been exposed to the market nine days later. It is possible the infection may have passed from bat to human; if so, it may be related to bat guano used in traditional Chinese medicine. On 26 December, Shanghai PHC received a sample of a patient with unknown pneumonia from Wuhan CDC and Wuhan Central Hospital and started an investigation to the sample which was later confirmed to contain a new coronavirus.The outbreak went unnoticed until a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases was observed by Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory Medicine at Hubei Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, whose experience fighting SARS in 2003 kept her alerted about a public health emergency. On 26 December 2019, a couple of seniors who lived near Zhang's hospital came to her for their fever and cough. The CT scan results of the couple's thorax showed unusual changes in the lungs which were different from those in any known viral pneumonia. Zhang saw the couple's son and found similar conditions. On the same day, a patient from Huanan Seafood Market that Dr. Zhang saw also had the unusual conditions.On 27 December, the doctor reported her discovery to her hospital and the hospital soon informed Jianghan CDC, thinking that this might be an infectious disease as it was indicated by the familial cluster. As a precaution, she told her colleagues to wear protective gear and prepare a specialized area in the hospital to receive patients with similar conditions.On 28 and 29 December, three more patients who had visited the Huanan Seafood Market visited the clinic of the hospital. The hospital notified the provincial and municipal health commissions. The health commissions appointed Wuhan and Jianghan CDC and Jinyintan Hospital to undertake epidemiological research for the seven patients on 29 December. Six of them were transferred to Jinyintan, a specialized facility for infectious diseases. Only one patient refused the transfer. Zhang's discovery was widely praised; the Hubei government honored her and Zhang Dingyu, the president of Jinyintan, for their contribution to controlling the viral outbreak.\n\n\n=== Disclosure ===\n\nOn the evening of 30 December, the two emergent notice letters from the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan began to circulate on the Internet which was soon confirmed by Wuhan CDC who admitted that there were 27 cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December. The letters required all hospitals in Wuhan to report any pneumonia patient with unknown causes and related to Huanan Seafood Market. They also asked the hospitals to give proper treatment to these patients. Wuhan CDC told The Beijing News that the investigation was still underway and the experts from NHC were on the way to help the investigation after a rumor about it circulated on the Internet.On 1 January 2020, the seafood market was closed down by Jianghan District's Health Agency and Administration for Market Regulation due to an \"environment improvement.\" According to China Business, the workers in hazmat suits were inspecting all around the market and collecting samples. The storekeepers at the market said that they were not told what the people were collecting and detecting. The urban management officers and police officers were on the spot to ask the storekeepers to finish up and leave the market.Several doctors were warned by Wuhan's police for \"spreading misinformation\" and eight \"rumormongers\" who were all doctors at Wuhan hospitals according to Wang Gaofei, Weibo's CEO were summoned by the police on 3 January. Li Wenliang, one of the whistleblowers died from the virus on 7 February which was the same day when the discoverers of the outbreak, Zhang Jixian and Zhang Dingyu, were honored by Hubei's government. The death of Dr. Li led to widespread grief and criticism toward the government.\n\n\n== Measures and impact in Hubei ==\n\nSemi-log graph of 3-day rolling average of new cases and deaths in China during COVID-19 epidemic showing the lockdown on 23 January and partial lifting on 19 March.\n\n\n== Impact beyond Hubei ==\n\nChinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping warned that China was facing a 'grave situation'. He held a Party Politburo meeting which promised resources and experts for treatment and supplies to Hubei as more and more cases of the viral infection, mostly exported from Wuhan were confirmed in other cities in Hubei and multiple parts in mainland China. On 29 January, Tibet announced its first confirmed case, a male who traveled from Wuhan to Lhasa by rail on 22\u201324 January which marked that the virus spread to all parts of mainland China.The 25 January Chinese New Year celebrations were canceled in many cities. The passengers were checked for their temperatures to see whether they had a fever. Henan, Wuxi, Hefei, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia suspended trade of living poultry on 21 January.Financial Times described the outbreak as China's Chernobyl moment, increasing the pressure on its leader, Xi Jinping. A trade war with the US, Hong Kong protests, and an African swine fever outbreak that led to a pork shortage already placed pressure on the current government.\n\n\n=== Early responses by Henan ===\nAt the end of December 2019, Henan announced the suspension of passenger trains to and from Wuhan. In early January 2020, the local government of Henan Province with its complete disinfection measures, effective and intensive publicity, a strong awareness of epidemic prevention and quarantine among the people, the setting up of return spots at the village entrance and even the use of garbage trucks, the digging of trenches to block roads connecting Hubei and the hanging of slogans such as \"return home with sickness is to dishonor your parents.\" #\u6284\u6cb3\u5357\u7684\u4f5c\u4e1a (lit.: 'copy Henan's homework') became a trending Weibo topic hashtag.\nHowever, cutting the roads off without authorization is illegal in mainland China as Xinhua and the Public Security Ministry pointed out. The Ministry of Transport asked the local governments to take the principle of \"block one, not three (Chinese: \u4e00\u65ad\u4e09\u4e0d\u65ad)\", that is, to block the virus from spreading, but not to block roads, traffic and Internet access, the transportation of emergency supplies and the transportation of essential goods. \n\n\n=== Public Health Emergency declarations ===\n\nBy 21 January, government officials warned against hiding the disease.On 22 January, Hubei launched a Class 2 Response to Public Health Emergency. Ahead of the Hubei authorities, a Class 1 Response to Public Health Emergency, the highest response level was announced by the mainland province of Zhejiang on 23. Guangdong and Hunan followed suit later on the day. On the following day, Hubei and other 13 mainland provinces also launched a Class 1 Response. By 29, all parts of mainland initiated a Class 1 Response after Tibet upgraded its response level on that day.The highest response level authorizes a provincial government to requisition resources under the administration to control the epidemic. The government was allowed to organize and coordinate treatment for the patients, make investigations into the epidemic area, declare certain areas in the province as an epidemic control area, issue compulsory orders, manage human movement, publish information and reports, sustain social stability and to do other work related to epidemic control.On 11 June, officials confirmed another outbreak of the infection in Fengtai, a south-western district in Beijing.\n\n\n=== Cancellations, delays and shutdowns ===\n\n\n==== Holiday extension ====\nOn 26 January, the State Council extended the 2020 Spring Festival holiday to 2 February (Sunday, the ninth day of the first lunar month) with 3 February (Monday) marking the start of normal work.

All qualified citizens will be able to continue the qualification in the Bureau's next activity. On 23 January, the Bureau announced the temporary closing of museums, memorials, public libraries and cultural centers in Wuhan from 23 January to 8 February. All tour groups to and from Wuhan will be canceled.On 23 January, the City Administration of Dongcheng, Beijing cancelled temple fairs in Longtan and Temple of Earth, originally scheduled for 25 January. The Beijing Culture and Tourism Bureau later announced cancellations of all major events including temple fairs. The tourist attractions in Beijing and Tianjin, including the Forbidden City and the National Maritime Museum closed their doors to the public from 24 January. On the evening of 23 January, the Palace Museum decided to shut down from 25 January and the West Lake in Hangzhou announced shutting all paid attractions and the Music Fountain down and suspended the services of all large-scale cruise ships starting the next day. Since 24 January, many major attractions are shut down nationwide including the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing, Shanghai Disneyland, Pingyao Ancient City in Shanxi, Canton Tower in Guangdong, the Old Town of Lijiang, Yunnan and Mount Emei in Sichuan.\n\n\n==== Education ====\n\nOn 21 January 2020, the Ministry of Education (MoE) requested the education system to do a good job in the prevention and control of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection. After that, private education providers including New Oriental, NewChannel and TAL Education, education departments in Hubei, Zhejiang, Shenzhen, and Shanghai University cancelled all ongoing courses and postponed the new semester. On 27 January, MoE advised all higher education institutions to postpone the new spring semester with all local education departments to determine the starting time of the new semester for K-12 education and local colleges according to the decision of the local governments. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security also decided to put the new semester off for all vocational education facilities.The National Education Examinations Authority canceled all IELTS, TOEFL and GRE exams scheduled for February.

Later, on 30 January, the Ministry of Civil Affairs ordered to cancel marriage registrations on 2 February.\n\n\n=== Parliament sessions ===\n\nThe outbreak made an impact on the National People's Congress (NPC), China's national parliament and many local parliaments. On 27 January, the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee (PPCSC) of Yunnan announced to postpone local Lianghui sessions scheduled for early February which was followed by the PPCSC of Sichuan on 28 January. The local parliament sessions of cities including Hohhot, Chengdu, Jinan, Qingdao, Binzhou, Zhengzhou, Pingdingshan, Anyang, Hefei, Changzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Zhoushan, Ganzhou, Shangluo, and Jiangjin were also put off.The NPC's Standing Committee will discuss on 24 February to decide whether to delay its March session or not. The 10-day session in March is an annual gathering of about 3,000 delegates from all parts of China where the major laws are passed and key economic targets are unveiled. The potential delay will be the first time since 1995 when the NPC first adopted the schedule for the March session. Willy Lam, a political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong believed that the sessions may not only increase the risk of infections but also \"post hostile and embarrassing questions to the top officials about the outbreak.\" He also believed that canceling the meetings would be possible although this never happened after the Cultural Revolution.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\n\nThe government of China, which upholds a policy of state atheism, used the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic to continue its antireligious campaigns, demolishing Xiangbaishu Church in Yixing and removing a Christian Cross from the steeple of a church in Guiyang County. In the Shandong, \"officials issued guidance forbidding online preaching, a vital way for churches to reach congregants amid both persecution and the spread of the virus\".\n\n\n=== Economic impact ===\n\nIn late January, economists predicted a V-shaped recovery. By March, it was much more uncertain. Millions of workers were stranded far from their jobs while the workplaces were short-handed. The data for February 2020\u2014the first full month after the virus became a major factor in January\u2014saw official indicators of economic activity fell to record lows. The Caixin manufacturing index (PMI) fell to 35.7 in February from 50 in January, showing a deep contraction. The nation's non-manufacturing index sank even further to a record low of 29.6 in February from 54.1 in January 2020. According to The Wall Street Journal, \"The factory index indicated contraction for most of 2019, hit by a trade war between the United States and China. It didn't cross back into expansion until late last year when trade tensions between the two sides eased.\"China's economic growth is expected to slow by up to 1.1 percentage in the first half of 2020 as economic activity is negatively affected by the new coronavirus outbreak, according to a Morgan Stanley study cited by Reuters. But, on 1 February 2020, the People's Bank of China said that the impact of the epidemic on China's economy was temporary and the fundamentals of China's long-term positive and high-quality growth remained unchanged.Due to the outbreak, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced that with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the Spring Festival holiday was extended to 2 February and trading will resume on 3 February. Before that, on 23 January, the last trading day of shares before the Spring Festival, all three major stock indexes opened lower, creating a drop of about 3% and the Shanghai index fell below 3000. On 2 February, the first trading day after the holiday, the three major indexes even set a record low opening of about 8%.

There was a 92% reduction on the volume of cars sold during the first two weeks of February 2020. According to the sources of Automative News, Chinese policymakers had discussed the extension of subsidies for electric-vehicle purchases beyond this year to revive sales, while also discussing reducing requirements for zero-emission vehicle shares of production.By 13 March, most business outside of Hubei was active again. The Caixin PMI increased to 50 at the end of March.In Q1 2020, China GDP dropped by 6.8 percent, the first contraction since 1992.In May 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang announced that, for the first time in history, the central government wouldn't set an economic growth target for 2020, with the economy having contracted by 6.8% compared to 2019 and China facing an \"unpredictable\" time. However, the government also stated an intention to create 9 million new urban jobs until the end of 2020.\n\n\n=== Unemployment ===\n\nIn January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs. Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province.By the end of March, as many as 80 million workers may have been unemployed, according to an estimate by economist Zhang Bin of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; this estimate included migrant workers and people in rural areas, whom the official statistics from Beijing do not take into account.\n\n\n=== Face mask shortage and production ===\n\nIn China, face masks have been used widely by the general public during the pandemic, and have been required in many locations. As the epidemic accelerated, the mainland market saw a shortage of face masks due to the increased need from the public. It was reported that Shanghai customers had to queue for nearly an hour to buy a pack of face masks which was sold out in another half an hour. Some stores are hoarding, driving the prices up and other acts so the market regulator said that it will crack down on such acts. The shortage will not be relieved until late February when most workers return from the New Year vacation according to Lei Limin, an expert in the industry.On 22 January 2020, Taobao, China's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group said that all face masks on Taobao and Tmall would not be allowed to increase in price. The special subsidies would be provided to the retailers. Also, Alibaba Health's \"urgent drug delivery\" service would not be closed during the Spring Festival. JD, another leading Chinese e-commerce platform said, \"We are actively working to ensure supply and price stability from sources, storage and distribution, platform control and so on\" and \"while fully ensuring price stability for JD's own commodities, JD.com also exercised strict control over the commodities on JD's platform. Third-party vendors selling face masks are prohibited from raising prices. Once it is confirmed that the prices of third-party vendors have increased abnormally, JD will immediately remove the offending commodities from shelves and deal with the offending vendors accordingly.\" The other major e-commerce platforms including Sunning.com and Pinduoduo also promised to keep the prices of health products stable.Figures from China Customs show that some 2.46 billion pieces of epidemic prevention and control materials had been imported between 24 January and 29 February, including 2.02 billion masks and 25.38 million items of protective clothing valued at 8.2 billion yuan ($1 billion). Press reported that the China Poly Group, together with other Chinese companies and state-owned enterprises, had an important role in scouring markets abroad to procure essential medical supplies and equipment for China. Risland (formerly Country Garden) sourced 82 tonnes of supplies, which were subsequently airlifted to Wuhan.By March, China has been producing 100 million masks per day to meet the demand of medical staff and general public.\n\n\n=== Lockdown and curfew ===\n\nEver since Hubei's lockdown, areas bordering Hubei including Yueyang in Hunan and Xinyang in Henan set up checkpoints on roads connecting to Hubei to monitor cars and people coming from Hubei. Between 24\u201325 January, the local governments of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Hainan and other areas announced to quarantine passengers from \"key areas\" of Hubei for 14 days. Chongqing also announced mandatory screening of every person who arrived from Wuhan since 1 January, and set up 3 treatment centers.Since 1 February, a curfew law that resembles that of Huanggang, Hubei, was put in place by the city of Wenzhou in Zhejiang, which is the second largest center after Hubei. Each local family can appoint one family member who may leave their house to purchase essential goods every two days. Since 4 February Zhejiang's capital, Hangzhou, announced the closure of all of its villages, residential communities and work units to guests. Those who enter and exit these places must show valid identification papers. Non-residents and cars will be checked strictly. On the same day, Yueqing, Ningbo, Zhengzhou, Linyi, Harbin, Nanjing, Xuzhou and Fuzhou began to take the same approach. Zhumadian, Henan, announced that each family were only allowed to have one member leave the house to purchase essential goods every 5 days.\n\nFactories were closed or reduced production for a few weeks. When they opened again, measures were implemented to reduce risk. During the pandemic, Uyghur workers were sent to resume work.Many local governments implemented restrictions to control the outbreak, including keeping schools closed, cutting off villages, and restricting travel. A smartphone-based health-tracking system was introduced in much of the country.On 2 April 2020, the government ordered a Hubei-like lockdown in Jia County, Henan, after a woman tested positive for the coronavirus. It is suspected that she may have been infected when she visited a hospital where three doctors tested positive for the virus, despite showing no symptoms. In early May, restrictions were tightened in Harbin.\n\n\n=== Impact on greenhouse gas emissions ===\nThe slowdown in manufacturing, construction, transportation and overall economic activity created a temporary reduction by \"about a quarter\" in China's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n=== Recovery and further outbreaks ===\nOn 10 April, Tianshannet reported that there had been no newly confirmed cases of coronavirus in Xinjiang for the preceding 53 days and that there were no coronavirus patients in Xinjiang. In mid July, some air traffic and public transportation in \u00dcr\u00fcmqi was canceled in the wake of the discovery of new cases in the city.As factories and other businesses reopened, extensive measures were put in place to avoid infection, including temperature checks, handwashing, disinfection, mask wearing, a mobile phone health app, avoiding public transportation, staggered lunches, physical distancing, contact tracing, and opening windows for ventilation. Rules vary by location, with different local governments enforcing different measures.In June 2020, an outbreak with 45 people testing positive at Xinfadi Market in Beijing caused some alarm, and Zhang Qiang said that the authorities in Beijing, population 20 million, are able to conduct on a daily basis nucleic tests for 400,000 people.  Authorities closed the market and nearby schools; eleven neighborhoods in the Fengtai District started requiring temperature checks and were closed to visitors. By this time, public health technology included special leaf blower backpacks designed to vent hot air onto outdoor surfaces. By the evening of 23 June, Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan declared that the situation \"has been basically brought under control\" even as \"China's traffic authorities vowed to strictly guard traffic out of Beijing: those with abnormal health QR codes or without recently-taken negative nucleic acid test proof will not be allowed to take public transportation or drive out of the capital\" and started a new regulation to that effect, while 13 new cases were detected on that morning.On 26 July, China saw its highest number of daily cases since March. with 61 new cases, up from 46 cases a day earlier, This increased to 127 daily COVID cases on July 30. The daily reported cases subsequently went down, to 16 on August 23.\n\n\n== Response by the Central Government ==\n\n\n=== Safeguarding 2020 Chunyun ===\n\nChunyun, known to host the world's largest human migration, is a 40-day period when people return home to spend the Chinese New Year with their families. In 2020, it started on 10 January and was to end on 18 February. Before the coronavirus outbreak, the government estimated 3 billion trips to be made during the period.On 9 January, Wan Xiangdong, the Chief Pilot of the Civil Aviation Administration, said that the agency would keep a close watch on the outbreak and strengthen ties with the health authorities. Li Wenxin, the Deputy general manager of China Railway said that the railway authorities were paying attention to the situation and making sure to prevent the spread of the epidemic through the railway stations and trains and safeguard the health and safety of passengers. Wang Yang, the Chief Engineer of the Ministry of Transport said that the ministry would carry disinfection monitoring and protection measures out in areas with heavy passenger traffic including transport hubs, passenger stations, and cargo terminal factory stations.On 22 January, as the coronavirus outbreak escalated, Li Bin, the deputy president of NHC warned that Chunyun might speed the transmission of the new virus up. Li repeated the government's previous advice to the people, that is, stay away from Wuhan. George F. Gao, the Director of China CDC also admitted to the conference that the virus can transmit between humans and there were also cases of community-acquired infections. The Chinese health officials also promised to take strict measures to stop the virus from spreading and release information as soon as possible.\n\n\n=== Epidemic control efforts ===\n\nThe NHC with the approval of the State Council announced 2019-nCoV-associated pneumonia as Category B Infectious Diseases with control measures of Class A infectious diseases as stipulated in The Law on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases. From 20 January, the NHC will publish daily data on confirmed and suspected cases in all provinces of the country (Including during the Spring Festival) until no longer necessary. On 20 January, NHC set up a working group up to deal with pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection. On 28 January, NHC sent seven supervision teams to seven provinces and cities in Beijing, Hebei, Shanghai, Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, and Sichuan to supervise the epidemic control measures in the areas. China normally makes 10 million face masks per day, about half of the world production. During the crisis, 2,500 factories were converted  to produce 116 million daily. Delivery drones, artificial intelligence, and facial recognition systems has also been used to help fight the epidemic.In February 2020, Major General Chen Wei, virologist and medical doctor of the Chinese army, and her team were sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology in order to develop a vaccine against COVID-19.In late March, the government severely restricted international travel, limiting the number of flights to the country and denying entry to foreigners with previously issued visas and residence permits. The government also took steps to discourage Chinese people from returning from overseas. The end of March saw a new Hubei-style lockdown implemented in Jia County, Henan. The lockdown was in response to a confirmed case of coronavirus by a woman who received treatment at a hospital where three doctors have now tested positive for the coronavirus, despite showing no symptoms.In June 2020, following an outbreak in Beijing tied to Xinfadi Wholesale Market, the Chinese government suspended meat imports from specific facilities in Germany and the United States that had also seen outbreaks.\n\n\n=== Financial supports and tax reduction ===\nOn 1 February, the People's Bank of China and other five departments jointly issued the notice on further strengthening financial support for the prevention and control of the epidemic of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus infection, stating that relevant financial services will be further strengthened during the period affected by the epidemic. For those who are temporarily affected by the epidemic and facing difficulties, the document requires financial institutions to tilt their credit policies appropriately, flexibly adjust their loan repayment arrangements and reasonably postpone the repayment period. Those overdue due to inconvenient repayment during the epidemic period shall not be included in the record of credit investigation and breach of trust.On 30 January, the Ministry of Finance and NHC issued a notice on the financial guarantee policy for the prevention and control of the new type of pneumonia. The Central Government shall grant a subsidy of 300 yuan per person per day to those who are in direct contact with the cases to be investigated or confirmed who are involved in the diagnosis, treatment, nursing, hospital infection control, case specimen collection, and pathogen detection. For other medical personnel and epidemic prevention workers who take part in epidemic prevention and control, the Central Financial Department shall subsidize them at a rate of 200 yuan per person per day.The Ministry of Finance, the General Administration of Customs and the General Administration of Taxation issued a joint announcement that from 1 January to 31 March 2020, more preferential import tax policies will be implemented for imported materials used for epidemic prevention and control.\n\n\n=== Communist Party Politburo's leadership ===\n\n\n==== Meetings on coronavirus outbreak ====\nOn 20 January, the Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping ordered that great attention should be paid to prevention and control of the epidemic. The Party also vowed to \"guide\" people's opinions with intensive publicity strategies and interpretations of current policies to ensure social stability. Premier Li Keqiang urged relevant ministries and localities to take a highly responsible attitude towards the People's health and resolutely prevent the spread of the epidemic. Premier Li Keqiang also called a meeting of the State Council's Executive Meeting and deployed the work of epidemic prevention and control.On 21 January, Premier Li urged protection and encouraged the health care workers. The National Healthcare Security Administration decided to adopt a special reimbursement policy for confirmed patients and temporarily bring relevant drugs and medical services into the reimbursement scope of medical insurance. On 22 January, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan went to Wuhan to inspect the prevention and control of the epidemic.On 26 January, the first meeting of the Central Leading Group for the Response to the Epidemic of Pneumonia Caused by 2019-nCoV infection prioritized the provision of urgently needed medical and health forces, protective clothing and face masks for prevention and control in Hubei Province and Wuhan and attached importance to the transport of daily necessities for residents and relief supplies to Hubei. It urged the local governments to enhance epidemic control including cancelling meetings and events, strictly quarantining confirmed and suspected infection cases, extending the Chinese New Year holiday and supporting online office and teaching. The Central Government promised to crack down on hoarding and profiteering in materials for disease prevention and control. Public Finance at all levels should fully guarantee such funds as prevention and control of epidemic situations and treatment of the patients.\n\n\n==== Xi Jinping's absence ====\nOn 27 January, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, entrusted by Party general secretary Xi Jinping according to Xinhua arrived in Wuhan to inspect and guide the epidemic prevention and control work. According to The Wall Street Journal, the appointment of Li who is considered a technocrat surprised some observers, given that he had been sidelined in recent years as Xi concentrated power and cultivated a populist ideological image. Some suggest that Xi was \"more at risk to the political fallout of the coronavirus\" while Li could be a convenient \"political scapegoat\". Li's visit to Wuhan earned high popularity on Chinese social media. Xi Jinping claimed that he \"personally commanded\" the fight against the coronavirus outbreak when meeting with WHO director general in Beijing on 28 January, but according to a report by The Guardian, he has not made any public presence since then as the social media posts mocking Xi's absence were promptly deleted by the censors.Xi's first public appearance during the outbreak was at a residential community in Chaoyang, Beijing on 10 February. Xinhua posted photos of Xi wearing a mask and said that the aim of Xi's visit was \"to learn about the situation of epidemic prevision and control at the grassroots level.\" It was his first time to interact with the people since the outbreak after he paid a short visit to Yunnan during 19\u201321 January as a tradition that China's leaders observed to visit the smaller towns and villages before the Spring Festival. He was said to chair a meeting on 3 February by the state media, but no pictures or videos were released. Xi also met Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, the first foreign leader to visit China since the coronavirus outbreak on 5 February.On 10 March, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, over one month after Premier Li Keqiang's visit.\n\n\n=== Administrative supervision ===\nSince the outbreak of the epidemic, a number of government officials have been publicly held accountable for their dereliction of duty in the epidemic prevention in 6 provinces.On 29 January, Director of Huanggang MHC Tang Zhihong failed to tell the capacity of the local hospitals including how many patients that they could handle, how many could be hospitalized and how many patients could be tested each day when asked about these questions despite being an administrator of the local hospitals. A day later, the Party Committee of Huanggang proposed a removal of Tang from the post. On 1 February, according to the Mayor of Huanggang named Qui Lixin, the city authority disciplined 337 of its officials and removed 6 cadres who \"caused disadvantages to the epidemic prevention\".On 2 February, Zhang Cong, Party Secretary of Xuanhua, Hebei was admonished. Zhang Guoqing, Deputy Party Secretary of Xuanhua and Guo Xiaoyi, the political commissar of the local police were given disciplinary actions by the Party. On the same day, February, Xiangshui, Jiangsu reported three cases of misconduct. The cases were associated with illegal disclosure of personal data and dereliction of duty. Party secretary, Zhang Changyue and deputy director Gu Bing of the Zhangji Health Center and the director of the Xiangshui CDC were removed or disciplined.Tang Hu, the director of the Health Bureau of the Nanhu New District in Yueyang, Hunan Province was suspended. Cai Junfeng, the deputy director of the Lengshuijiang Municipal Committee and Yang Wen, the deputy director of the municipal government office are suspended. He Yong, the deputy secretary of the Gutang Party Committee and township chief was suspended.On 4 February, Zhang Qin, the vice president of the Hubei Red Cross, was removed from his post while Gao Qin and Chen Bo of the Hubei Red Cross were given a warning. The deputy director of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Statistics, Xia Guohua was also removed from his post. The Secretary and Director of the Leading Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Development and Reform Commission, the Secretary and Director of the Leading Party Group of the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Statistics, Meng Wukang and the deputy director of the General Office of the Wuhan Municipal Government, Huang Zhitong are admonished.\n\nOn 15 February, Qiushi magazine documented a 7 January order by Xi Jinping, regarding the COVID-19 outbreak at a Politburo Standing Committee meeting. However, a record of that same meeting released beforehand shows that there was zero mention of the epidemic throughout.\n\n\n=== National mourning ===\nOn 3 April, the Chinese government declared 4 April, the Qingming Festival of 2020, a national day of mourning for those who lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic. At 10 a.m., people were asked to observe three minutes of silence while sirens and vehicle horns blasted out. Chinese flags were flown at half-mast across the country and at embassies overseas. All public entertainment were halted for the day.\n\n\n=== Planning of other government activities ===\nChina still plans to undertake its census in November 2020, but preparations have been affected due to COVID-19 and are being reviewed.\n\n\n== International and regional relations ==\n\n\n=== Information sharing ===\nChina's scientists have been praised for rapidly sharing information on the virus to the international community, and leading some of the world's research on the disease.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on 21 January that the Chinese authorities would share information of the epidemic \"with the WHO, relevant nations and China's Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions in a timely manner including the genome sequence of the new coronavirus.\" During the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn praised China for its improved transparency since 2003. US officials and WHO also praised China for sharing data about the epidemic and keeping transparent. The US experts had been invited by China's NHC.  On 23 January, WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom and WHO regional director for the Western Pacific, Takeshi Kasai arrived in Beijing to discuss the new coronavirus outbreak with the Chinese authorities and health experts. China agreed on 28 January that WHO would send international experts to China.John Mackenzie, a member of the World Health Organization's emergency committee criticized China for being too slow to share all of the infected cases, especially during major political meetings in Wuhan after Tedros Adhanom praised China for helping \"prevent the spread of coronavirus to the other countries.\" US President Donald Trump said that China was \"was very secretive and that's unfortunate\" regarding the information on the pandemic. Yanzhong Huang, a health expert at Seton Hall University, said that China could have been more forceful and \"when there was a cover-up and there was inaction\".A number of other countries' governments have called for an international examination of the virus's origin and spread.\n\n\n=== Evacuations ===\n\nMultiple countries evacuated or are trying to evacuate their citizens from Wuhan including South Korea, Japan, the US, the UK, Kazakhstan, Germany, Spain, Canada, Russia, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, France, Switzerland and Thailand. Korean media Channel A said that China asked the evacuation flights to arrive in the evening and leave Wuhan in the next morning so the evacuation would not be seen by the public. According to BBC, any Chinese national, even with a UK citizenship is not allowed to be evacuated by the UK.\n\n\n==== Taiwan ====\n\nAfter initially refusing to allow Taiwanese citizens to evacuate due to the One-China policy, the Chinese government eventually allowed Taiwan to evacuate its nationals from Wuhan with the assistance of the local Taiwan Affairs Office. There were around 500 Taiwanese trapped in Wuhan. The first flight to help them leave left Wuhan on 3 February. All of them would be quarantined for two weeks after they enter Taiwan.The evacuation halted after the first flight was found to carry an infected case. The Taiwanese government said that the person was not in the evacuation list and the most vulnerable were not included in the first flight. It also said that it was not prepared to take these people with a high risk of viral infections home. Tsai Ing-wen criticized China's attempt to rule Taiwan out in WHO and said, \"The information obtained by the WHO was obviously inaccurate ... and could cause the WHO to make mistakes in dealing with the global epidemic.\" Premier Su Tseng-chang called for a government-to-government negotiation for the following arrangement of chapter flights despite the fact that the cross-strait communication mechanism between governments had been suspended since 2016 when Tsai was elected president.The State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office urged the Taiwanese government to stop impeding the evacuation. The office said that before the flight, all of the passengers signed a personal declaration claiming that they have no contact with any confirmed or suspected cases and promising to comply with quarantine measures after returning to the island. All of the passengers are checked for their temperature three times before the flight and showed no abnormality. The office said critically that the Taiwanese government first expressed appreciation before the flight, but changed its attitude after the flight. Wuhan's Taiwan Affairs Office asked Taiwan for more details about the infected case as the basic descriptions of the patient including age and gender were not given as previously 17 cases in Taiwan. The office also said that the patient's close relatives were not at all informed of the viral infection.\n\n\n=== Immigration control ===\n\nThe State Administration of Immigration promised that the border inspection agencies at all ports of entry and exit in China would continue to provide necessary facilities and services for Chinese citizens returning home. On 25 January, the General Administration of Customs reactivated the health declaration system where people entering or exiting mainland China are asked to write a health declaration. Border control staff shall also cooperate in health and quarantine work such as body temperature monitoring, medical inspection, and medical check-up. On 31 January, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it was arranging charter flights to take the Chinese citizens from Hubei and Wuhan back to Wuhan 124, given the practical difficulties that they faced overseas.Hubei suspended the processing of applications from mainland Chinese residents for entry and exit of mainland China. For those with a valid visa to enter Hong Kong and Macao, but fail to enter the areas due to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese Immigration Administration will issue a new visa for free on request of the visa holder after the outbreak is lifted. Some of automated border clearance systems will be shut down according to the needs of the epidemic prevention. After Wuhan declared lockdown on 23 January, the Tianhe Airport and Hankou River ports have been without passengers for several days.Since 25 January, Taiwan's government banned anyone from mainland China entering the country with the ban extended to mainland Chinese overseas. Although the global health officials advised not to apply travel restrictions on China, the US and Australia restricted all Chinese citizens from China from entering their borders. Travel restrictions were announced by Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Italy and other countries despite China's criticism of border control.Since 28 January, the Hong Kong government began to cut traffic down connecting mainland China. On the same day, China's National Immigration Administration announced that with immediate effect, the application of mainland residents' visa to Hong Kong and Macau would be suspended. On 3 February, Hong Kong closed most of its border to mainland China. However, Hong Kong nurses still held a strike, demanding a complete closure.\n\n\n=== International aid ===\nChina received funds and equipment in donations from a number of other countries to help fight the pandemic. The United Front Work Department (UFWD) also coordinated diplomatic channels, state-owned businesses and Chinese diaspora community associations in urging overseas Chinese to buy masks and send them to China. Jorge Guajardo, Mexico's former ambassador to China, suggested that \"China was evidently hiding the extent of a pandemic...while covertly securing PPE at low prices\", according to Global News. Guajardo called it a \"surreptitious\" operation that left \"the world naked with no supply of PPE.\"China has also sent tests, equipment, and experts to other countries to help fight the pandemic. European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenar\u010di\u010d expressed gratitude and praised collaboration between the EU and China. Chinese aid has also been well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. Chinese-Americans also marshalled networks in China to obtain medical supplies.On 13 March, China sent medical supplies, including masks and respirators to Italy, together with a team of Chinese medical staff. While the head of the Italian Red Cross, Francesco Rocca said these medical supplies were donated by the Chinese Red Cross, there were other sources that said that these were paid products and services. Chinese billionaire and Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma also donated 500,000 masks and other medical supplies, which landed at Liege Airport in Belgium on 13 March and then sent to Italy. Italian Prime Minister Conte thanked China for its support and assistance.  A former Mexican ambassador Jorge Guajardo said that masks sent to China in January and February were being sold back to Mexico at 20 to 30 times the price.A U.S. congressional report released in April concluded that \"the Chinese government may selectively release some medical supplies for overseas delivery, with designated countries selected, according to political calculations.\"On 18 May 2020, the Chinese government pledged US$2 billion to help other countries with fighting COVID-19 and other development.\n\n\n=== Problems with equipment ===\nOfficials in Spain, Turkey, and the Netherlands have rejected Chinese-made equipment for being defective. The Dutch Ministry of Health announced it had recalled 600,000 face masks which were made in China. The Spanish government said they bought thousands of test kits to combat the virus, but later revealed that almost 60,000 did not produce accurate results. The Chinese embassy in Spain said that the company that made the kits was unlicensed, and that these kits were separate from the ones donated by the Chinese government. The government of the United Kingdom paid two companies in China at least $20 million for test kits later found to be faulty.\n\n\n== Discrimination ==\n\n\n=== Hubei residents ===\nAlthough there has been support from Chinese online towards those in virus-stricken areas, instances of regional discrimination have also arisen. According to World Journal, there have been instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned away from hotels, having their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying \"people from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not welcomed here.\" Numerous hotels, and guest houses refused entry to residents of Wuhan or kicked out residents of Hubei. Multiple hotels purportedly refused a Wuhan tour guide to check in after she returned to Hangzhou from Singapore with one of them calling the police to give her a health check and asking the police to quarantine her. Amidst these incidents, various cities and prefectures outside of Hubei adopted resettlement measures for Hubei people in their region such as designated hotel accommodation for visitors from the province. In Zhengding, Jingxing and Luquan of Shijiazhuang City, the local governments rewarded anyone who reported those who had been to Wuhan, but not recorded in official documents at least 1,000 yuan RMB. In Meizhou, residents reporting people entering from Hunan were awarded with 30 face masks.It was reported that on a scheduled 27 January China Southern Airlines flight from Nagoya to Shanghai, some Shanghainese travellers refused to board with 16 others from Wuhan. Two of the Wuhan travellers were unable to board due to a fever while the Shanghainese on the spot alleged that the others had taken medicine to bypass the temperature check. One of the Wuhan tourists protested on Weibo, \"are they really my countrymen?\", to which a Shanghai tourist who was purportedly at the scene replied that they did it to protect Shanghai from the virus. Many netizens criticized the Wuhan tourists for travelling with a fever, although some also called for understanding and for Shanghainese not to regionally discriminate.\n\n\n=== Outside mainland China ===\nMainland Chinese overseas have experienced discrimination and anti-Chinese sentiment during the coronavirus outbreak. In Hong Kong, a Japanese noodle restaurant claimed to refuse mainland Chinese customers and said on Facebook, \"We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us.\" In Japan, a sweet shop in Hakone and a ramen restaurant in Sapporo posted \"no Chinese\" signs outside. Similar events were reported in South Korea. The French newspaper Courrier Picard published two articles titled \"Yellow Alert\" and \"New Yellow Peril?\" which may allude to historical racist tropes about the Chinese.Beyond only Chinese, Asians in general are affected by anti-Chinese sentiment. Disinformation about Asian food and Asian communities have circulated, and videos showing Asian people eating bats have gone viral along with dehumanizing comments and implications of the cause of the virus outbreak.\n\n\n=== Targeting of Africans ===\n\nGuangzhou has a sizeable community of black Africans including migrants, who were allegedly singled out by local authories during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Chinese state media, five Nigerian men who had tested positive for COVID-19 broke quarantine and infected others, which triggered suspicion and anti-foreigner sentiment. Africans were forced to undergo coronavirus testing and quarantine, regardless of their travel history, symptoms, or contact with known patients. Some restaurants \u2013 including a branch of McDonald's \u2013 reportedly refused to service Africans, while landlords and hotels targeted Africans for eviction resulting in some becoming homeless. Xinhua reported 111 Africans tested positive for the coronavirus in Guangzhou out of a total of 4,553 tested, also claiming that 19 of the cases were \"imported\" from unspecified countries.It has been noted that public sensitivity in China to racism, particularly to Africans, has been low with little education against racism or use of political correctness, while government censors appear to tolerate racism online. In the preceding few years, many Chinese believed that foreigners have been given extra benefits, leading to concerns about unfairness and inequality. Many Chinese internet users soon posted racist comments, including calls for all Africans to be deported, while a cartoon depicting foreigners as different types of trash to be sorted through went viral on social media.Local media in African countries were the first to report on the issue, while Beijing initially attempted to deny such reports as \"rumors\" and \"misunderstandings\" spread by Western media. As further incidents of Africans being targeted were shared on social media, the United States Consulate General in Guangzhou warned African Americans to avoid travel to Guangzhou. The governments of Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, Uganda and the African Union placed diplomatic pressure on Beijing over the incidents, and group of African ambassadors in Beijing wrote a letter of complaint to the Chinese government about the \"stigmatisation and discrimination\" being faced by Africans. The Nigerian Speaker of the House Femi Gbajabiamila showed one of the social media videos to the Chinese ambassador while the Ghanaian Minister for Foreign Affairs Shirley Ayorkor Botchway described the incidents as \"inhumane treatment\".In response to the diplomatic pressure and media coverage, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an official statement on 12 April 2020 that the Chinese government attached \"great importance to the life and health of foreign nationals in China\", has \"zero tolerance for discrimination\", and treats all foreigners equally. In a regular press conference on the following day, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Zhao Lijian added that a series of new measures were adopted in Guangzhou to address \"the concerns of some African citizens\" and avoid racist and discrimination problems, while blaming the United States for \"making unwarranted allegations in an attempt to sow discords and stoke troubles\". China's state media later described the incidents as \"small rifts\", while officials made PR visits to quarantined Africans with flowers and food accompanied by television cameras, and Chinese envoys have continued to reassure their African counterparts that they would correct the \"misunderstandings\" and establish \"an effective communication mechanism with African Consulates-General in Guangzhou\".\n\n\n== Controversies and criticism ==\n\n\n=== Censorship and police responses ===\n\nA pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December. The early response by city authorities was accused of prioritising a control of information on the outbreak. A group of eight medical personnel, including Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist from Wuhan Central Hospital, who in late December posted warnings on a new coronavirus strain akin to SARS, were warned by Wuhan police for \"spreading rumours\" for likening it to SARS.By the time China had informed the World Health Organization of the new coronavirus on 31 December 2019,  Nicholas Kristof commented that the government was still keeping \"its own citizens in the dark\" in an opinion published on The New York Times. While by a number of measures, China's initial handling of the crisis was an improvement in relation to the SARS response in 2003, local officials in Wuhan covered up and downplayed the initial discovery and severity of this outbreak. This has been attributed to the censorship institutional structure of the country's press and Internet, with Jude Blanchette of the Center for Strategic and International Studies quoted stating \"under Xi Jinping, the inclination to suppress has become endemic and, in this case, contributed to a prolonged period of inaction that allowed the virus to spread\". William Summers, a Yale University professor of medicine, told Undark Magazine though that such silencing and downplaying tactics are \"not unique to China\", and \"seems to be standard operating procedure\" worldwide.On 20 January, Xi Jinping made his first public remark on the outbreak and spoke of \"the need for the timely release of information\". Chinese premier Li Keqiang also urged efforts to prevent and control the epidemic. One day later, the CPC Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the most powerful political organ in China overseeing legal enforcement and the police, wrote \"self-deception will only make the epidemic worse and turn a natural disaster that was controllable into a man-made disaster at great cost,\" and \"only openness can minimise panic to the greatest extent.\" The commission then added, \"anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of cases out of self-interest will be nailed on a pillar of shame for eternity.\" Also on the same day, Xi Jinping instructed authorities \"to strengthen the guidance of public opinions\", language which some view as a call for censorship after commentators on social media became increasingly pointedly critical and angry at the government due to the epidemic. Some view this as contradictory to the calls for \"openness\" that the central government had already declared.As part of the central government's \"bifurcated approach to diffuse discontent\", while the propaganda machinery was going into \"overdrive...to protect [Xi Jinping's] reputation\", citizens were permitted to criticise local officials so long as they did not \"question the basic legitimacy of the party\". The Cyberspace Administration (CAC) declared its intent to foster a \"good online atmosphere,\" with CAC notices sent to video platforms encouraging them to \"not to push any negative story, and not to conduct non-official livestreaming on the virus.\" Censorship has been observed being applied on news articles and social media posts deemed to hold negative tones about the coronavirus and the governmental response, including posts mocking Xi Jinping for not visiting areas of the epidemic, an article that predicted negative effects of the epidemic on the economy, and calls to remove local government officials. Chinese citizens have reportedly used innovative methods to avoid censorship to express anger about how government officials have handled the initial outbreak response, such as using the word 'Trump' to refer to Xi Jinping, or 'Chernobyl' to refer to the outbreak as a whole. Younger individuals have also been creating digital archives of media concerning the epidemic \u2013 which is prone to deletion by censors \u2013 and posting them on the exterior web. While censorship had been briefly relaxed giving a \"window of about two weeks in which Chinese journalists were able to publish hard-hitting stories exposing the mishandling of the novel coronavirus by officials\", since then private news outlets were reportedly required to use \"planned and controlled publicity\" with the authorities' consent.On 30 January, China's Supreme Court, delivered a rare rebuke against the country's police forces, calling the \"unreasonably harsh crackdown on online rumours\" as undermining public trust. In what has been called a \"highly unusual criticism\" by observers, supreme court judge Tang Xinghua said that if police had been lenient against rumours and allowed the public to have taken heed of them, an earlier adoption of \"measures like wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding wildlife markets\" might have been useful in countering the spread of the epidemic. The Human Rights Watch reported that \"there is considerable misinformation on Chinese social media and authorities have legitimate reasons to counter false information that can cause public panic,\" but also noted censorship by the authorities on social media posted by families of infected people who were potentially seeking help as well as by people living in cordoned cities who were documenting their daily lives amidst the lockdown.Journalists in China have worked to publish information about the outbreak. The government initially allowed greater leeway than usual to reporters investigating the crisis, but then cracked down with greater censorship than usual. On 12 March, ten Tibetans were arrested for breaching control measures meant to prevent the spread of the virus. Dolma Kyab, a Tibetan writer and teacher, told Radio Free Asia that \"the Chinese government is only using coronavirus as a convenient excuse to infringe on the human rights of Tibetans\".\n\n\n==== Response to whistleblowers ====\n\nOn 18 December 2019, Ai Fen, director of the emergency department of Central Hospital of Wuhan came into contact with an unusual pulmonary infection from a delivery person of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. On 27 December, she received a second patient with similar symptoms, but who had no link to the wet market. In the afternoon of 30 December, upon  seeing the words \"SARS coronavirus, pseudomonas aeruginosa\", Ai immediately reported to the hospital's public health department and infection department. She circled the word \"SARS\", and took an image of it and forwarded it to another doctor in Wuhan. From there it spread throughout medical circles in Wuhan, and reached Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist at the hospital. On the afternoon of the same day, Li sent a warning to former classmates over WeChat which was reposted widely. In an interview with Renwu magazine, Ai said she was reprimanded after alerting her superiors and colleagues of the SARS-like virus in December. Li Wenliang would later be canonised on the internet as a heroic whistleblower, and Ai would be lauded as the one who provided the whistle.On 1 January, it's reported by Global Times that eight people were arrested by Wuhan police for their claim that there were SARS cases in Wuhan. Li Wenliang said he didn't know whether he was one of them or not. According to Wang Gaofei, Weibo's CEO, the eight people are all doctors at Wuhan hospitals who \"are still fighting at the frontline\". The Supreme Court defended these doctors and pointed out in a WeChat article on 28 January, delay and opacity in public information are the root of fake news and the information that is mostly factual and not subjectively malicious and causes no objectively severe consequences should be tolerated. On 29 January, the eight doctors were also praised by Zeng Guang, Chief Scientist at China CDC. Hu Xijin, the editor of the Global Times, complained about the local governments' low tolerance of differing online opinions and believed this weakened checks-and-balances of government powers through news media.\n\n\n==== Death of Li Wenliang ====\nAfter Li Wenliang was warned by Wuhan police, the doctor was diagnosed with the coronavirus infection and died from it on 7 February 2020. He was said to be dead on the evening of 6 February, although the hospital said that he was still under emergency treatment. People speculated that Dr. Li was actually kept alive while the authorities were trying to censor the news. After his death, people mourned his death and criticized the government. some of the trending hashtags on Weibo such as \"Wuhan government owes Dr. Li Wenliang an apology\" and \"We want freedom of speech\" became trending topics on Weibo until the posts were deleted by censors. While media outlets were allowed to report his death, the nature of the doctor's censorship which produced widespread public anger in the aftermath, in what has been described as \"one of the biggest outpourings of online criticism of the government in years,\" was not a topic that was permitted for coverage.A group of Chinese academics including Xu Zhangrun of Tsinghua University signed an open letter calling for the central government to issue an apology to Dr. Li and to protect freedom of speech. Professor Zhou Lian of Renmin University has observed that the epidemic has \"allowed more people to see the institutional factors behind the outbreak and the importance of freedom of speech\". After attempts to discourage the discussion on Dr. Li's death further escalated online anger, the central government has been accused of reportedly attempting to co-opt the incident by \"cast[ing] Dr. Li's death as the nation's sacrifice \u2013 meaning, the Chinese Communist Party's own\". The Financial Times believed Li's story fitted the historical archetypes in China where incorruptible Confucian scholar who speaks truth to the emperor but is persecuted and ultimately dies for his honesty.Later in March, Wuhan police apologised to Li Wenliang's family after National Supervisory Commission admitted the conduct of local officials is inadequate and praised the whistleblower's effort on raising public awareness.\n\n\n==== Zhang Ouya's criticism ====\nIn January, Zhang Ouya, the Chief Journalist of Hubei Daily called for the removal of the current leaders of Hubei and Wuhan on Weibo. But, he was asked to remove his post and the newspaper that he worked for apologized to the Wuhan authorities, promising that they will publish only positive content from now on. Mayor Zhou of Wuhan said to the state media \"As a local government, I could not disclose information until I get information and authorization which was not understood at the time.\" His argument which hinted at the Central Government's responsibility, was refuted by China CDC. Chief Scientist Zeng Guang said to Chinese tabloid The Global Times that what the scientists said was \"often only part of their decision-making\" and praised the eight whistleblowers who were warned by the Wuhan authorities before the epidemic.\n\n\n==== Undercounting of cases and deaths ====\nOn 1 April, two United States officials claimed that China had deliberately concealed its cases and deaths according to a report by United States Intelligence Community, leading other countries to underestimate the seriousness of the outbreak. The officials asked not to be identified because the report is secret, and declined to detail its contents. The sources stated that the Chinese central government does not know the extent of the outbreak because lower-level officials reported falsified statistics to avoid losing their positions. The CIA is currently investigating in China to assess the coronavirus totals.During the pandemic, no reports of cases of the coronavirus in Xinjiang prisons or of conditions in the Xinjiang re-education camps emerged. A former Xinjiang resident raised concerns about the potential spread of coronavirus in the re-education camps.As of late March, users of the social-media site Sina Weibo widely shared an undated photograph showing long lines at the Hankou funeral home in Wuhan.\nAccording to Caixin Global, the Hankou funeral home was operating 19 hours a day. Caixin also reported that there were a number of people who died with COVID-19 symptoms but were not tested and were thus excluded from the official case-tally. Some patients died of other diseases due to a lack of proper treatment when hospitals were overwhelmed dealing with those who had the coronavirus. Some social-media users have used the numbers of urns returned to families and the number of cremations conducted in Wuhan to estimate a death toll in Wuhan of about 42,000 or 46,800, compared to an official toll of 2,548 people attributed to the virus in Wuhan as of 27 March. There were 13,856 cremations in Wuhan in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data from the city's civil-affairs agency. That was 2,419 lower than in the fourth quarter of 2018.Sources including a number of health experts, United States intelligence officials, British scientists, and British government officials have expressed doubts about the accuracy of the figures provided by the Chinese government relating to the epidemic, raising concerns that the Beijing government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths. Although Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported on 24 March 2020 that the spread of domestically transmitted epidemic has essentially stopped and the outbreak has been controlled in China, news publications reported that experts have doubted these claims, and described them as premature.Asymptomatic cases (people who tested positive but did not develop symptoms) were not counted as confirmed cases before 1 March.On 17 April 2020 the Wuhan government revised the number of COVID-19 deaths, accounting for deaths that occurred at home that went previously unreported, as well as for the subtraction of deaths that were previously double-counted\nby different hospitals, resulting in a net increase of 1,290 reported deaths in the city.\n\n\n==== Investigations of origins of the virus ====\nThe central government has imposed restrictions on the publication of academic research regarding the origins of the coronavirus. The directive issued by the Ministry of Education's science and technology department stated that \"academic papers about tracing the origin of the virus must be strictly and tightly managed\", requiring that such papers be vetted by a State Council task force. A Chinese researcher who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation said \"I think it is a coordinated effort from (the) Chinese government to control (the) narrative, and paint it as if the outbreak did not originate in China. And I don't think they will really tolerate any objective study to investigate the origination of this disease.\" The researcher said that such a move would obstruct important scientific research. Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Washington-based Council on Foreign Relations, said \"it is no surprise that the government seeks to control related scientific research so that the findings do not challenge its own narrative on the origin of the virus and the government response to the crisis\".After interviewing virologist Shi Zhengli who had investigated bat coronaviruses including the latest one, journalist Gao Yu said \"We learned later her institute finished gene-sequencing and related tests as early as January 2 but was muzzled.\" Shi said that Yanyi Wang, Director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, had ordered staff not to disclose information on the disease arguing that \"inappropriate and inaccurate information was causing 'general panic'\". Furthermore, Wang directed that \"The National Health Commission 'unequivocally requires that any tests, clinical data, test results, conclusions related to the epidemic shall not be posted on social media platforms, nor shall [it] be disclosed to any media outlets including government official media, nor shall [it] be disclosed to partner institutions'\".The broad scientific consensus holds that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. A member of Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBRA) in the UK, tasked with dealing with crisis, has said that while British government intelligence does not dispute that the virus has a zoonotic origin, it also does not discount the idea of a leak from a Wuhan laboratory, saying that \"Perhaps it is no coincidence that there is that laboratory in Wuhan\" (the Wuhan Institute of Virology). On 15 April 2020, US President Donald Trump announced that the US government was investigating whether the virus spread from the laboratory.\n\n\n=== Propaganda ===\n\nStatements issued by Xi Jinping on 3 February declared the need for an emphasis by state media on \"telling the moving stories of how [people] on the front line are preventing and fighting the virus\" as a priority of coverage, while top official Zhang Xiaoguo said that his department would \"treat propaganda regarding the control and prevention measures of the virus as its top priority\". For instance, state media organisations People's Daily and Global Times, along with deputy director of information Zhao Lijian from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have been observed to be publishing effusive praise on Beijing's response to the epidemic, such as extensive coverage of the accelerated construction of the new hospitals in Wuhan (which Zhao claimed was completed in 16 hours), the lock down of Wuhan with its population of 11 million, and the \"unprecedented\" quarantine of Hubei province. Though such efforts had a questionable effect on the epidemic, as the new hospitals were operating at under half-capacity due to shortages of beds and medical resources while the lock down of Wuhan came too late to be effective as millions had left, the Financial Times and others noted that such widely publicised actions were a \"PR coup\" showing that the \"overbearing, centralized government\" of China was particularly suited to dealing with the outbreak, creating the impression as if Beijing had directly intervened at Xi Jinping's request.Observers have warned that while \"admiration of the front-line medical workers is widespread and sincere,\" the state media should also be highlighting the reality that many of those workers \"lack protective gear\" and that over 3000 have been infected since the outbreak so that media attention may bring them public support to obtain some much needed equipment. The New York Times has noted that such government propaganda attempts to control the narrative has been viewed with distrust among the younger individuals, who unlike older people depend less on state media and instead have sought \"firsthand info and in-depth media studies concerning the epidemic on the web\", suggesting that the central government was out of touch with the younger population.Outlets such as Politico and Foreign Policy have reported that China's efforts to send aid to virus-stricken countries are part of a propaganda push for global influence. The European Union's diplomatic service, the European External Action Service (EEAS) has fought back against propaganda highlighting China's role in providing medical supplies to Italy, pointing out that France and Germany combined had provided more masks to Italy than China. The EEAS also noted that China's \"state media and government officials promote not proven theories about the origin of Covid-19\" while China state media coverage highlighted \"displays of gratitude by some European leaders in response to Chinese aid\". China has been accused of \"opportunitism\" during the pandemic, alongside their donations and exports of faulty medical equipment to EU nations hardest hit by the virus, as their disinformation campaign \"reputedly bid to denigrate Europe\u2019s responses to cast its own in a more favorable light\", such as on 12 April 2020 when the Chinese embassy in Paris published an article titled \"Restoring distorted facts - Observations of a Chinese diplomat posted to Paris\" claiming that careworkers in Western nursing homes had abandoned their jobs leaving residents to die. The EEAS had toned down their report by omitting details of China's state sponsored disinformation campaign, which in turn led to allegations that the EEAS had bowed to pressure from China, as China reportedly threatened to withhold the shipment of medical supplies if the original report was released.\n\n\n=== Hubei and Wuhan governments ===\nThe exodus from Wuhan before the lockdown resulted in angry responses on Sina Weibo from the residents in the other cities who are concerned that it could result in the spreading of the novel coronavirus to their cities. Some in Wuhan are concerned with the availability of provisions and especially medical supplies during the lockdown.The World Health Organization called the Wuhan lockdown \"unprecedented\" and said that it showed \"how committed that the authorities are to contain a viral breakout\". However, WHO clarified that the move is not a recommendation that WHO made and the authorities have to wait and see how effective that it is. The WHO separately stated that the possibility of locking an entire city down like this is \"new to science\".The CSI 300 Index, an aggregate measure of the top 300 stocks in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, dropped almost 3% on 23 January 2020, the biggest single-day loss in almost 9 months after the Wuhan lockdown was announced as the investors that are spooked by the drastic measure sought a safe haven for their investments.The unprecedented scale of this lockdown generated controversy and at least one expert criticized this measure as \"risky business\" that \"could very easily backfire\" by forcing otherwise healthy people in Wuhan to stay in close conditions with infected people. Drawing a cordon sanitaire around a city of 11 million people raises inevitable ethical concerns. It also drew comparisons to the lockdown of the poor West Point neighborhood in Liberia during the 2014 ebola outbreak which was lifted after ten days.The lockdown caused panic in the city of Wuhan and many have expressed concern about the city's ability to cope with the outbreak. It remains unknown whether the large costs of this measure, both financially and in terms of personal liberty will translate to effective infection control. A medical historian named Howard Markel argued that the Chinese government \"may now be overreacting, imposing an unjustifiable burden on the population\" and claimed that \"incremental restrictions, enforced steadily and transparently tended to work far better than draconian measures.\" Others such as Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases defended the intent behind the lockdowns, citing that the lockdowns bought the world a \"delay to essentially prepare better.\" A mathematical epidemiologist named Gerardo Chowell of Georgia State University stated that based on mathematical modelling, \"containment strategies implemented in China are successfully reducing transmission.\"Nonetheless, after northern Italy became a new hotspot of the outbreak in late February, the Italian government enacted what has been called a \"Wuhan-style lockdown\" by quarantining nearly a dozen towns of 50,000 people in the provinces of Lombardy and Veneto. Iran, another developing hotspot for the coronavirus as of 25 February came under calls to assume similar lockdown procedures as China and Italy. The security experts such as Gal Luft of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security in Washington said that \"The best way for Iran to deal with the disease is to do precisely what China did \u2013 quarantine.\" and \"If Wuhan with its 11 million population can be under quarantine so can Tehran with its 8 million\"\n\n\n==== Frozen case number ====\nThe early cases surrounding an animal market may suggest animal-to-human transmission, more evidence surfaced to support the human-to-human transmission of the virus. However, despite the expert-led investigation and early signs of human-to-human transmission including a hospital-acquired infection (nosocomial) case confirmed on 10 January according to Caixin, the local government of Wuhan denied any case of nosocomial infection and kept claiming that \"there was no clear sign of human-to-human transmission\" until 15 January when Wuhan's Municipal Health Commission (MHC) said on its website that \"the result of present investigation shows no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission, but this does not rule out the possibility of such a transmission. The risk of continuous human-to-human transmission is low.\"The reported case number froze at 41 during the Hubei Lianghui and Wuhan Lianghui, the local parliament sessions between 6\u201317 January, which the local authorities of Hubei and Wuhan claimed to be due to the lack of PCR test kits for the new virus. But, Caixin said that the other sequencing techniques can be used for diagnosis which usually takes two days without any need of PCR kits. Meanwhile, an Imperial College group and a Hong Kong University group both estimated over 1,000 cases in Wuhan as cases were being exported and confirmed overseas. Perceived discrepancies in the official Chinese data for the number of cases left many netizens doubtful, with some mockingly labeling the virus \"patriotic\" for its appearance of mainly infecting the Chinese after they left the country.\n\n\n==== \"Manageable and preventable\" ====\nOn 20 January, the Chinese National Health Commission announced that human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus had already occurred.Also 20 January, the number of reported new cases soared to 136 as major mainland cities including Beijing and Shenzhen reported their first cases. Only the Wuhan authorities stopped claiming that the virus had a limited ability to transmit between humans. On the same day, the city formed a specialized command for epidemic control (CEC) to upgrade measures to cope with the epidemic including enhanced protection over the medical workers and free treatment for all patients at the fever clinics. On the evening of that day, Zhong Nanshan, one of the NHC experts sent to Wuhan who was well known for fighting against SARS in 2003, exemplified human-to-human transmission of the new virus with a cluster of 14 hospital-acquired infections in Wuhan and two familial clusters in Guangdong.However, the National Health Commission still insisted that the epidemic should be \"manageable and preventable.\" At that time, the BBC said that not much public attention was drawn to the virus outbreak. On 19 January, despite the virus outbreak, over 40,000 Wuhan families joined an annual potluck banquet which was a community tradition observed for over two decades to celebrate the Kitchen God Festival. A community leader told The Beijing News that \"everything is normal now\" when asked about the virus outbreak. According to the community committee of Baibuting where the banquet was held as of 4 February, a block of the community had at least 10 confirmed cases of the coronavirus infection, plus over 30 highly suspicious cases, but the community hospital also said that the incidents of the coronavirus was lower than that in the other communities.Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of Wuhan who was widely criticized by the public and media due to slow responses said to the state media CCTV that the banquet was organized by the local community which had a long history of self-governance. He said that the government was not precautious enough to stop it because it was believed that the virus only had a limited ability to transmit between the people.\n\n\n==== Controversial commentary ====\nOn 20 January, Guan Yi, a Hong Kong-based expert in SARS epidemiology told Caixin that the local government should not play on words about transmissibility and he hoped that we could learn from the 2003 SARS outbreak. He continued, \"transmissibility, adaptability, incidence and virulence of the virus highly resemble those of SARS at the early stage [of the 2003 outbreak]\". Guan's team travelled to Wuhan on 21 January and returned to Hong Kong the next day. He observed that the \"epidemiology experts and scientists do not seem to be welcomed in the city.\" On 22 January, Wuhan was still \"an open city\" to the virus outbreak where most people did not wear a mask although NHC announced the coronavirus-associated pneumonia as a notifiable disease. He believed that a pandemic was unavoidable as the virus spread with the annual mass migration of the Spring Festival.The statements of Guan which were apparently different from that in most Chinese media became highly controversial as the journalists of state media reposted his statement of 15 January in which he opined that the disease was manageable,  whilst also peddling old news that his lab had been fined by the Chinese authorities in 2005. Wang Duan, the Caixin journalist who conducted the interview described such behavior as \"personal attacks\" and complained that no expert came forward to refute what Guan said so far.\n\n\n==== 26 January press meeting ====\nHubei Government's press meeting on 26 January was described as a \"scene of a massive car crash\" by BBC which led to widespread dissatisfaction. Despite the compulsory face mask law, Governor Wang Xiaodong did not wear a mask while the other two official hosts including Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang and Provincial Party Secretary Bie Bixiong wore masks incorrectly. The Governor said Xiantao, a Hubei city was capable to produce 10.8 billion masks annually after he made two corrections for the number hinted by someone else's notes. The Governor admitted a severe shortage of medical supplies in Hubei while Mayor Zhou of Wuhan claimed that the shortage had been fully alleviated.\n\n\n=== Science community ===\nOn 29 January, the Ministry of Science and Technology issued a notice, urging the scientists \"to write their papers on the land of the motherland, to use the results to fight the epidemic\" and the scientists should not focus on publishing their papers until the epidemic prevention and control task is completed. Duowei News believed this was aimed to respond to the academic conflict between Zhang Yongzhen's group from Fudan University which published the first genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV and the Gao Shan group from Nankai University which published an analysis on the sequence without authorization from Zhang. Before the notice, Nankai and Fudan, two of China's top universities had a fight over the alleged academic misconduct related to the analysis published by the Gao Shan group.On 30 January, Wang Liming, a neuroscientist from Zhejiang University expressed anger on a Weibo post about George F. Gao's latest NEJM article. Wang believed that the article indicated that the Chinese CDC had clear evidence of human-to-human transmission in early January and kept it secret until three weeks later. Although the post was soon deleted, China CDC came under the spotlight. China CDC had to respond on the next day that the research was a retrospective analysis of the 425 cases reported to CDC on 23 January. Jennifer Zeis of NEJM's media Relations Department told The Paper, a Chinese newspaper that it took only two days to publish the article, but she refused to give further details.The journal Nature reported at least 54 English-language papers about the new coronavirus in China were published by 30 January. Zuofeng Zhang, a public health expert from UCLA interviewed by the mainland China-based magazine Intellectual, asked why the published data were not used in epidemic control even before their publication.\n\n\n=== Misinformation and conspiracy theories ===\n\nThere were conspiracy theories about COVID-19 being the CIA's creation to keep China down on China's Internet, according to London-based The Economist. Although biological warfare against Chinese troops in the Korean war is only considered an allegation in the US, it is considered official history in China, thus greatly helping these new theories gain credibility.Multiple conspiracy articles in Chinese from the SARS era resurfaced during the outbreak with altered details, claiming that SARS is biological warfare conducted by the US against China. Some of these articles claim that BGI Group from China sold genetic information of the Chinese people to the US, with the US then being able to deploy the virus specifically targeting the genome of Chinese individuals.On 26 January, Chinese military news site Xilu published an article detailing how the virus was artificially combined by the US to \"precisely target Chinese people\".Some articles on popular sites in China have also cast suspicion on US military athletes participating in the Wuhan 2019 Military World Games, which lasted until the end of October 2019, and have suggested that they deployed the virus. They claim the inattentive attitude and disproportionately below-average results of American athletes in the games indicate they might have been there for other purposes and they might actually be bio-warfare operatives. Such posts stated that their place of residence during their stay in Wuhan was also close to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the first known cluster of cases occurred.On 5 March 2020, in response to the American Fox News host's recent announcement that the Chinese should \"formally apologize\" for the novel coronavirus pandemic, Zhao lijian, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China.said: The announcement is absurd and ridiculous, which fully exposes his arrogance, prejudice and ignorance of China. The statement that \"China should apologize\"is groundless and unreasonable. He said that the H1N1 flu that broke out in the United States in 2009 spread to 214 countries and regions and caused at least 18,449 deaths that year. Has anyone asked the United States to apologize? In March 2020, this conspiracy theory was endorsed by Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China. On 13 March, the US government summoned Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai to Washington DC over this conspiracy theory, when he had called this theory \"crazy\" on Face the Nation on 9 February, and re-affirmed this belief after Zhao's tweets.The United States Presidential administration, including President Donald Trump, Mike Pompeo and others also pushed a conspiracy theory repeatedly asserting that the virus had originated from a laboratory leak in Wuhan, despite widespread rejection from the scientific community and by allied intelligence.\n\n\n== Statistics ==\nThe case count in mainland China only includes symptomatic cases. It excludes patients who test positive but do not have symptoms, of which there were 889 as of 11 February 2020. It's also reported that there were more than 43,000 by the end of February 2020. On 17 April, following the Wuhan government's issuance of a report on accounting for COVID-19 deaths that occurred at home that went previously unreported, as well as the subtraction of deaths that were previously double-counted by different hospitals, the NHC retrospectively revised their cumulative totals dating to 16 April, adding 325 cumulative cases and 1,290 deaths.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCoronavirus COVID-19 Global Cases and historical data by Johns Hopkins University\nReports on the COVID-19 pandemic in China, by the PRC National Health Commission\nCoronavirus China updates and news.

          "I could be the wrong person to ask, but this isn't a very interesting attraction. Perhaps if you are into ancient Asian history, a visit here is worthwhile, but I'm not quite sure it's worth the entry fee. Luckily, it's free to stroll the grounds and there are some pretty views",
          "I can't say Hakone checkpoint is a must do but it's fun little activity to do in this quaint town. If you're not interested in the history the view up the hill is worth it to pay the entrance",

          "The checkpoint worth a quick tour and you can get a feel of what happened back in the old days. However exhibits are quite small and you can probably finish it in 15 minutes. The exhibition hall further down is good for another 15 minutes. There is room for improvement.",
          "Great sightseeing even for a rainy day during \"tsuyu\" or rainy season. Many of the exhibits have English language explanations.",
          "It's a quick stop, but I recommend it to get a feeling for what it was like in this time. The climb to the top of the lookout gives great views.",

          "Just a short walk up from lake Ashi boat point,it's set in the edo period,staff are in period costume,,it's a historical area with lovely garden,shrine and the hundreds of years old cedar avenue,,,well worth a visit,with the hakone pass you get a discount for entry,,easily",

The farthest point south, the isle of Hachij\u014d-jima, is several hundred kilometers from Mount Fuji. The park includes a variety of geographic features including natural hot springs, coastlines, mountainous areas, lakes, and more than 1000 volcanic islands. Vegetation in the park ranges from species of mountainous trees to the subtropical vegetation of the Izu Islands.Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park was established on February 2, 1936 as Fuji-Hakone National Park, and is one of the first four national parks established in Japan. In 1950, the Izu islands were added to the park, and its name changed to its present designation. Due to its proximity to the Tokyo metropolis and ease of transportation, it is the most visited national park in all Japan.Nearby cities include Odawara, Fuji, Minami Ashigara, and Numazu.\n\n\n== Points of interest ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nFuji-Hakone-Izu National Park is divided into four general areas:\n1.

          "You need to be fairly fit for this. We did the 30 minutes from Motohakone to the tea house. In June it was pretty slippery so wear good shoes. A bit muddy in places as well but well worth the effort. The start is 400m up the side road from the Motohakone bus stop. Lonely Planet",

It was surrounded by lines of cedar trees and it was peaceful and quiet. One of the nicest things I've done in Hakone.",

          "The old stone paved road to Tokyo. \"Stone' paved\" but actually has become rocky and uneven now. Large trees all around, very peaceful and nice and quiet. There are signs and explanations of the road in different languages in different points, giving you a historical background",
          "After we visited the Hakone Shrine, I wanted to take a walk on the stone paved road, since I read other reviews and sounded great. To find the trail as you are coming from the Shrine towards Moto-Hakone, turn left at the Tourist Office, walk to the petrol station and turn right.",
          "This road is uneven cobbles laid in the 16th and 17th century as part of the Tokkaido Highway linking Kyoto and Yokyo. I recommend walking down it to the Ashi-no-ko lake from the Amazake Chaya - another atmospheric remnant of the past (albeit rebuilt). Get there by bus from",

          "From Amazake Chaya and down to Moto-Hakone you can trek along the old Tokaido road which is full of history. It is stone paved almost all the way and not so difficult (we passed 4-5 pairs of elderly Japanese trekking). You walk through old woods with old stones in the ground and",
          "Nice for a quick stroll and views of the lake. The trees are beautiful and ever so old. You wonder what they have witnessed over all the years they have been there.... Not something to go out of your way for but you can easily get to it from Moto Hakone or any of the bus",
          "Lined with Cedar trees this is all that remains of the once great Tokaido Highway built in 1618. The cedar trees provided travellers with welcome shade from the hot summer sun. About 2km of the route exists. It is between Hakone Machi and Moto Hakone at the south of Lake Ashi."

        "wiki": "Yamanaka Castle (\u5c71\u4e2d\u57ce, Yamanaka-j\u014d) was a Sengoku period yamajiro-style Japanese castle, built by the Odawara H\u014dj\u014d clan in Tagata District, Izu Province, in what is now eastern Mishima, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. The site has been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1988.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nYamanaka Castle overlooks the strategic T\u014dkaid\u014d highway halfway of western slope of Hakone Pass. The T\u014dkaid\u014d highway was the main route between Kyoto and the Kanto region of Japan. The castle has a long and narrow structure, consisting of two lines of connected enclosures extending west and south of the second bailey, which is located just below the inner bailey. These enclosures are protected by deep, wet and dry moats.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe late H\u014dj\u014d clan was based at Odawara Castle in far western Sagami Province and only a few kilometers from the border with Suruga Province ruled by the Imagawa clan. The H\u014dj\u014d and Imagawa maintained an alliance; however, after the fall of the Imagawa clan, Suruga was occupied by the Takeda clan of Kai Province and the H\u014dj\u014d territories were threatened. This threat did not diminish after the Takeda clan was destroyed by an alliance between Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, both of whom were at odds against the H\u014dj\u014d.  Yamanaka Castle was built by H\u014dj\u014d Ujiyasu in the Eiroku era (1558\u20131577) to guard against this threat.\nDespite the growing tension between the H\u014dj\u014d and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, only a modest attempt was made to strength the defenses of the castle. When the Toyotomi armies attacked Odawara in 1590, Hideyoshi ordered Toyotomi Hidetsugu and Tokugawa Ieyasu to reduce Yamanaka Castle as quickly as possible, as it lie directly in his line of communications between the front lines and Osaka. In March, the two commanders attacked Yamanaka castle with 50,000 soldiers. In response, H\u014dj\u014d Ujikatsu resisted with only 4,000 troops. Despite the disparity in numbers, the Toyotomi forces took heavy losses, including one general, Hitotsuyanagi Naosue; however, the castle fell in only a half day of combat and most of its defenders were killed.\nYamanaka Castle was not rebuilt during the Edo period, and the site reverted to forest. All that remains are fragmentary portions of its moats and earthworks.\nIn 2006, the site of Yamanaka Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation, primarily due to its historical significance.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of Historic Sites of Japan (Shizuoka)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nSchmorleitz, Morton S.

        "wiki": "Odawara (\u5c0f\u7530\u539f\u5e02, Odawara-shi) is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.\nAs of February 2015, the city had an estimated population of 194,672, and a population density of 1,710 persons per km2. The total area is 113.79 km2.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area around present-day Odawara has been settled since prehistoric times, and archaeological evidence indicates that the area had a high population density in the J\u014dmon period.\nFrom the Ritsury\u014d system of the Nara period, the area became part of Ashigarashimo District of Sagami Province. It was divided into sh\u014den during the Heian period, mostly controlled by the Hatano clan and its branches. During the Genpei War between the Heike clan and Minamoto no Yoritomo, the Battle of Ishibashiyama was fought near present-day Odawara. During the Sengoku period, Odawara developed as a castle town and capital of the domains of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan, which covered most of the Kant\u014d region. The H\u014dj\u014d were defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Battle of Odawara in 1590, despite the impregnable reputation of Odawara Castle. The territory came under the control of Tokugawa Ieyasu.\nUnder the Tokugawa shogunate, Odawara was the center of Odawara Domain, a feudal han ruled by a succession of daimy\u014d. The castle town prospered as Odawara-juku, a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Odawara Domain briefly became 'Odawara Prefecture', which was merged with the short-lived 'Ashigara Prefecture' before joining Kanagawa Prefecture in 1876. During this period, the center of economic and political life in Kanagawa shifted to Yokohama. Odawara suffered a strong decline in population, which was made more severe when the original route of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line bypassed the city in favor of the more northerly route via Gotemba.\nThe epicenter of the Great Kant\u014d earthquake in 1923 was deep beneath Izu \u014cshima Island in Sagami Bay. It devastated Tokyo, the port city of Yokohama, surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka Prefectures, and caused widespread damage throughout the Kant\u014d region. Ninety percent of the buildings in Odawara collapsed immediately, and fires burned the rubble along with anything else left standing.Odawara regained some measure of prosperity with the opening of the Tanna Tunnel in 1934, which brought the main routing of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line through the city. Odawara was raised from the status of town to city on December 20, 1940. On August 15, 1945, Odawara was the last city in Japan to be bombed by Allied aircraft during World War II.\nOn November 1, 2000, Odawara exceeded 200,000 in population, and was proclaimed a special city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nOdawara lies in the Ashigara Plains, in the far western portion of Kanagawa Prefecture. It is bordered by the Hakone Mountains to the north and west, the Sakawa River to the east, and Sagami Bay of the Pacific Ocean to the south.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\nMinamiashigara\nNinomiya\n\u014ci, Kaisei, Nakai\nHakone, Manazuru, Yugawara\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nOdawara is a major commercial center for western Kanagawa Prefecture.

Within the city itself, the Yugawara area is a well-known hot spring resort.\nEnoura, a coastal area of Odawara known for its pristine sea, has an abundance of kumamomi, a type of fish that prefers clear and clean water. Sea turtles are sometimes present there. Because of the clear water and plentiful undersea life, many people come to Enoura for scuba diving.\nTraditionally, Odawara is known for its production of kamaboko processed fish, stockfish, umeboshi salted plums, and traditional herbal medicines. The Suzuhiro Kamaboko Village is a place to experience making and learning more about Odawara Kamaboko.\n\n\n== Sister city relations ==\n - Nikk\u014d, Tochigi, since December 19, 1980\n - Kishiwada, Osaka, since June 26, 1968\n - Chula Vista, California, United States, since November 8, 1981\n - Manly, New South Wales, Australia (friendship city), since 1991\n - Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, since February 4, 1993\n\n\n== Notable people from Odawara ==\nKai At\u014d - actor\nY\u014dhei K\u014dno - politician\nNinomiya Sontoku - Edo period economist and philosopher\nRumina Sato - mixed martial arts fighter\nKitamura Tokoku - author\nYoshiyuki Tomino - anime movie director\nBaku Yumemakura - science fiction author\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHammer, Joshua.

          "Odawara Castle was a great day trip! It is only a 20 min ride on the Shinkansen from the Yokohama/Toyko area and it is very close to the station. The place is very family friendly, just not for strollers. The grounds are wide open with lots of tables to stop and eat or rest",
          "A wonderful side-trip. The walk is worth the time. The \u2018castle\u2019 is quite impressive and the history is significant and very interesting. Do take the time.",
          "quite difficult to reinvent a review The place is a landmark of japanese history As such it\u2019s a must see if you are around The museum- castle provides great view of the city and good insight of life at 13-16 centuries Highly recommended",
          "Very convenient to the railway station in Odawara, this old castle set amid splendid grounds typifies a fortified structure, smaller than most in Japan. It was originally a Doi stronghold in the 15th c. later taken over by the Hojo clan of samurai. The keep affords stunning",
          "we stopped by Odawara Castle enroute to Hakone. It was the tail-end of the sakura season but it was still very beautiful and picturesque. Big grounds to explore and have a picnic. Theres an opportunity to dress up as ninja, samurai or Japanese princess for 300yen / child.",
          "Went on a solo visit during the week while kids were at school. Small castle compared to others in Japan, but very enjoyable. I went during the week so there were no crowds at all, barely any people. Quite a lot of exhibits to learn about the history of the castle, history of",

          "I strongly recommend to visit this place with a nice castle . I did the visit during sakura period with nice cherry blossoms \ud83c\udf38 . Moreover it is close to the train station, no excuse not visiting it !",
          "It ls small but beautiful-looking castle that has been turned into a museum. It is about fifteen minutes walk from the Odawara Station. It cost 500 yen to enter. This is the cherry blossoms season, so there are lots of cherry blossoms to see on the way to the castle as well as",
          "Odawara is a great very local authentic town. Fun to walk around local streets and see how the people live.",
          "Beautiful castle which has been rebuilt and is now like new which allows you to understand exactly what a castle with the surrounding moat and walls was like. Great visit, about 80 minutes from Tokyo and 10 minutes walk from the station.",
          "The \"White Castle\" and grounds are beautiful, particularly now that the cherry and plum blossoms are popping so there are some great photo opportunities. Most of the castle has been restored, so not a lot of \"original\" castle left. It is kind of cool if you've never seen a",
          "This a Japanese castle is small compare to other , it has bing rebuild and the main tower has a great view of the city and the sea. The gardens around it are beautiful. This attraction is enough to do for an afternoon if you take the time to walk all of it.",
          "For those who has visited other castles in Japan, this is just ok. I was with foreign friends who had never seen a Japanese castle, so it's kind of interesting to them. For those who have seen the others like Himeji castle, this is probably not interesting especially if one does",
          "This is one of the main castles in Japan which is situated in Odawara of Kanagawa Prefecture. If you travel to Gotemba, Atami or Hakone area from Tokyo, this could be a good stop.",
          "Not crowded which made it all the more enjoyable. Wish more of the exhibits were in English. Really enjoyed our time here. The Samurai Museum while small was worth the money.",
          "This is an excellent place to visit if you like Samurai history and castles,The gates and ramparts are awesome, you get sense what it would be like to attack the place in the Edo period.You can walk up to the highest balcony and see all around including the Pacific ocean, there",
          "Beautiful landmark to visit, the museum is very impressive despite being small. Children's amusement Park is very cute, our daughter loved the small train ride.",
          "We walked around and did not have time to go inside the castle itself, but enjoyed our evening stroll as the sun set. Much more impressive than I was expecting.",
          "This beautiful castle has been rebuilt from scratch several years ago. Obviously it has lost its essence and authenticity but it still worth it! The information inside is mainly in Japanese and the few information available in English is not well written and not enough",
          "The castle is no doubt a magnificent site to behold, but I was very upset by the majestic monkeys who were kept in a tiny dirty cage with very little entertainment. Their conditions were in stark contrast to the beautiful surroundings where there is lush nature and hot water. If",
          "Can be easily reached. A very cool Japanese castle. Not very large and the tower house is located at the highest point of the site. Free-of-charge till you get inside the Castle Tower. With nice sitting areas on the fields inside the castle wall. Very relax and peaceful.",
          "We stopped here on the way back from Hakone to Tokyo, as the castle was only less than 10 mins walk from the Odawara Station. The interior is a recent reconstruction, but unlike many other similar castles, the rooms feel spacious and there is an interesting well-done exhibition",
          "We stopped here coincidentaly on our way back from Hakone national park. Are we glad we did! Even compered to other castles we\u2019ve seen during the trip (and we\u2019ve seen many!), this was our top three favorite. It has an impressive view from the top of the castle and even being",

          "You have to stop in Odawara station to change trains on the way to Hakone if you are using a Japan Rail pass. This castle is only a 15 minute easy walk from the station. Good if you have extra time and the sky is blue. The castle itself is relatively small, but there is a good",
          "A fantastic restoration project and building. It is mostly a museum dedicated to the mediaeval history of Japan, which makes sense given that it\u2019s a castle. The restaurant just outside the castle is also pretty good. Sadly, I missed out as detailed information on signs around",
          "It was raining when we visited and they even had a discount on rainy days! We stayed there for around 1.5hrs, not a big castle, unlike Osaka Castle.",
          "If you are an avid lover of Samurai and the history of the shogunate, then this castle offers a glimpse of their collection. It is quite a small museum on an expansive ground. Nothing much, really.",
          "Odawara Castle is Odawara's iconic symbol and is a \"thing of beauty\" particularly on a sunny day, as it photographs beautifully under the sun. It's an easy day out trip from Tokyo. From the station, you can walk along Ohoribata Street, right from the station exit, then you see",
          "Very interesting and definitely worth the visit if you\u2019re in the area. A lot of care has been taken to preserve the site which is great to see.",
          "Odawara Castle, like so many other castles in Japan, is typical. It's there, a nice place to see, but nothing really stands out as being magnificent. I truly expected to see a more serene place, more peaceful and better kept, but hey, its the way life is in Japan now a",
          "Arriving at the station, we decided to go to the Odowara Castle, only 10 min walk. Ones we arrived, we say the beautiful castle. We were a little bit disappointed as it\u2019s not an original castle. Nice to see, but that\u2019s it. We were the only tourists at 9.30 am, what was nice",
          "The inside of the castle is converted to a museum. It\u2019s nice, but it\u2019s just the same as the other castles in Japan. If you\u2019ve never been to any castle in Japan maybe you should visit this castle but somehow if you\u2019ve been to the other place, probably a bigger castle; this one",
          "Odawara Castle is walking distance from the station. We were there killing time before our shinkansen to Osaka. Walking to Odawara Castle is a treat. Nice restaurants. There are tiles on the floor telling you you're near the castle. The place itself is big. You have various",
          "A highlight of our trip to Odawara. This might sound obvious, but this is a real castle (rebuilt after an earthquake) on real castle grounds, which means it's not just the main building but the surrounding areas that are fascinating to explore, including a temple, moat, kids",
          "It is very beautiful in the sakura season with the white backdrop. It is recently rebuilt. Nothing much to see inside the building. But you can go to the top and see outside.",
          "I visited this Castle due to close proximity to Odawara station with in walking distance. Ideal tour within limited time if u wish to ride the amazing Shinkansen from Tokyo to Odawara & back within a few hours. I was very satisfied",

          "This rebuilt Castle stands on the foundations of an original shogun domain - destroyed by earthquake/fire in early 1900\u2019s. The grounds are truly spectacular, especially during \ud83c\udf52 blossom week which we were very fortunate to see. I would recommend this attraction for any age.",
          "We were having a wonderful time visiting the castle area up until we saw a small cage with lots of monkeys inside it. They looked sad and miserable and such cruelty made me want to cry. I wrote an email to the castle info team hoping they get this feedback and that it wasn\u2019t the",
          "I am so sad to say, I went Odawara castle but there are very few English panel for the display historical items.",
          "The castle and ground themselves are pretty, though nothing spectacular. What really stuck with me and my partner though was the conditions the monkeys were kept in. It was a tiny dirty enclosure and the monkeys were clearly distressed and showing signs of boredom. Not",
          "Well-maintained castle of Edo-type construction. Some good history of the Shoganate period (including a suit of armour you can pretend you are wearing) and good shop. Probably not worth a special trip out unless you were passing anyway.",
          "Odawa castel is an impressive building with an interesting history. I visited the Castel with a Japanese friend, so that I got a better insight meaning translation. Without his help it would have been difficult or expensive. There is an app to be downloaded, which gives for iOS",
          "Beautiful grounds and the reconstructed Castle Tower provides amazing insight and information about the history of the Edo period. The surrounding gardens are picturesque and the Castle with 5 floors fills the landscape. Excellent views from the 5th floor observation deck. Some",
          "Feb 17, 2018 was selected to participate in a Fuma Ninja Event held at the grounds of Odawara Castle. From Shimbashi, local trains cost JPY1490 (one way, around US$14.00) and 1-1/2 hours. Came early before the event and walked around the beautiful, peaceful castle grounds, there",
          "I really liked visiting the white castle...super maintained...nice gardens full of old trees and flowers...you can go in the caste and have a view of the city...a worthy trip to Odawara",

          "The castle is fine, but he real bonus is you can get the bullet train! 45 minutes from Tokyo station and experience the amazing ride. We landed at 6, dropped our luggage off and headed out. Two tips: get back to Odawara station 15 minutes before your train so can can see the",
          "The castle is very imposing and of great interest but the tour group I travelled with were all stunned by the shockingly pitiful sight of caged monkeys within a small, bare concrete enclosure. So disappointing to see such inhumane treatment anywhere these days but especially in",
          "Go there on your way to an onsen in hakone yumoto if you have time. From the top of the castle you can see the sea. Be sure to sample some satsuma-age (fish cakes).",
          "Very cool both for the history and the amazing view from the top of the tower. I always wish this type of museum would use more of the living history approach. Not that they need interpreters, it would just be better if they had the castle tower renovated to its original state,",
          "We went early so the crowds were less. Though this castle is rebuilt it has a lot of historical value in Japanese history. Many meetings and battles, it\u2019s quite nice view from the top and some nice displays throughout though everything is in Japanese so unless you have a guide",
          "odawara castle is easily done as a sidetrip before hakone. an underrated castle since it has been superseded by the likes of nagoya, osaka, himeji, matsumoto and kumamoto castles. it is merely a 10 minute 1 km walk from odawara station amidst a calm charming town of odawara.",
          "The castle looked majestic from outside and just as beautiful inside. Exhibition were mostly about the Odawara era I guess. Not much info in English was available. There's a lot of stairs climbing needed to be done to arrive at the top floor. View were amazing of the city and",
          "It\u2019s a very pretty castle with lots of history. Even though we already knew it\u2019s a replica, still can\u2019t help to be a little disappointed when we saw the very modern interior. Despite so, we enjoyed all the exhibitions throughout the castle. There\u2019s a lot of information on the",
          "A reconstructed/ restored castle based on the models and related drawings during the Edo period. Beautiful castle with a long history of war and changing of ownership during those times. Great place to walk about and visit. Love the magnificent view at the top surrounded by",
          "Can\u2018t compare to other castles like Himeiji, Osaka, Aizu Wakamatsu, Kanazawa. So if you know the above mentionend you would be deceived by Odawarajo. If you want to see it, go there during Sakura and/or combine it with another sightseeing spot",
          "Beautiful castle, good walk, there is a kids park however it was shut the day we went due to I think it was upgrading the park. We didn\u2019t go up in the castle as it was beautiful to see from the outside but if you did want to go I believe it was 400 yen per person. There is a",

          "It was rainy, but it turned out to be good because we were keeping away from the crowded sightseeing. It is worth 500 yen for admission fee.",
          "The castle is really nice, and so are the gardens. It was pretty busy though, and sadly most of the info was not translated into any other languages besides Japanese. You could dress up in a kimono, or as a samurai or ninja, which was pretty fun, and the giftshop and entry",
          "So the castle is beautiful, but we only saw the outside of it. In the souvenirs store though they offer Samurai costumes for the kids to dress up and take pictures. With the castle in the background, those pictures come out great! Kiddos loved it!",
          "Visited the castle on a recent trip with my family to Japan. The grounds are fun to explore and really beautiful. The Walk through the castle is a great cultural and history lesson. Most everything is in English and if it isn't Google translate can help! My small children",
          "A very good spot in a wonderful and quiet park. The museum inside the castle is worth a visit as it describes the prosperous history of the region and the House of Shoguns who controlled the castle. The park is free and is located nearby the train station at short walking",
          "As I know that it is not the original castle, so I plan just a short visit. It is not too far from the train station. You can walk by 15-20min. Nice environmental, no entry fee. (I didn't go inside the castle) If you go inside the entry fee is required.",
          "the castle itself was interesting enough, but part of the attraction is a tiny, crowded, disgusting monkey cage. It was dirty and the monkeys looked miserable. Honestly seeing it was depressing and made me want a refund for my ticket. Imprisoning animals in terrible conditions",
          "Nice architecture. Please wear comfortable shoes. Its a long walk from the parking area to the castle. The display was nice and informative. The view from top of the tower is picture perfect",
          "The street next to castle is probably the best place in japan to see cherry blossom. While you can skip the castle but street next to castle is amazing. Calm and small town away from busy city; a stay overnight is definitely recommended",
          "The Odawara Castle Park is a great spot to stroll around. The main entrance leads through different Gates until reaching the Main building after a few hundred meters. There are as well many old shops near the castle and other places to see.",
          "Situated in the city of Odawara in Kanagawa prefecture. It is a major landmark and is listed on the 100 fine castles of Japan. The surroundings of the castle include a large park area along with some museum's and small shrines. It is a historical monument. During the Sakura",
          "Display was really impressive. The walking up was strenuous...the lifts pretty inaccessible because of the long tourist line...but the view at the top was infinitely worth the climb.",
          "Nice rebuilt castle. Worth a visit if you're in the area on the way to Hakone since you have to change trains anyways. Nice photo op from outside. Panoramic from the 5th floor. Would have been really good if we caught cherry blossoms.",
          "Lovely, white castle set high on a hill, so lots of steps to climb, but they're quite manageable. Besides, there's an ice-cream vendor, several vendors actually, one who sell delicious green-tea cones. There were lots of ninja warriors running around the day we visited and",
          "We visited Odawara Castle on a day with heavy rain. The tourist flow was fairly light, thanks to the rain. Fortunately the cherry blossom in the surrounding park was in its prime, offering a picturesque view. The castle is very well maintained and equipped with quite good",
          "This was our first Japanese castle so we loved it. It's one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan, although it is a reconstruction, not the original. It is also one of the ten highest castles with good views from the top on a sunny day. Interesting history and monkeys in the huge",
          "Odawara Castle has a wonderful history of ninja and samurai. The castle itself is very beautiful especially during Hanami season. It is located not so far from the station. You can take you time to wonder aimlessly around the castle. You can also wear the samurai and ninja",
          "We visited on a very rainy day, the cherry blossoms were beautiful. There weren't very many tourists due to the weather. There is a small discount off the entrance fee if you show them the online coupon. Several different areas of interest, the castle tower with observation",
          "Odawara castle is unique in that it is so close to the ocean and for the modern traveler, it is only minutes from the JR station so it is very accessible. The main attraction in this area is not only this castle but Hakone area which is close to Odawara via a local train system.",
          "The original castle was destroyed over many years in history but rebuilt in 1960 and refurbished in 2016. With this make over, it is now attracting many local tourists. This castle played a significant role in the Japanese Sumurai war era and this would be a must go place if you",

          "We needed to kill sometime so we decided to check this castle out. It was a great experience. The grounds are beautiful; even without most of the flowers as it is winter. The castle itself and the view from the top is gorgeous. And there's a museum inside the castle that takes",
          "I was only here for about two hours. I could have spent longer, but I was on a guided MWR tour. The castle itself is basically a reproduction, which was disappointing, but the history behind why it is a reproduction is interesting. Most of the placards in the museum are in",
          "After having visited quite a number of Japanese castles this one didn't impress us much. It's bailey is a reconstruction (after it suffered badly in the Great Kanto earthquake) and inside there is not much to see. Outside they were some dressed up \"samurai\" walking posing for",

          "If you visit odawara which is likely if you go to Hakone as most people change train here or change for the bus. Luckily it's in close proximity to the Station and signage is most clear. It's pretty and outside has nice areas for seating. The castle offers amazing views also and",

          "On the way to Hakone, you might want to drop by at Odawara Castle at Odawara Station. If you want to get out from the train to get move your legs this will be a great place to visit. There is an observation deck which at the top of the castle. Don't expect to see the old castle",
          "Very beautiful castle. In the base they have monkeys and you can dress as a samurai and walk around for 10 minutes for 300 yen. Super fun experience. You can go all the way to the top and sometimes you can even see mt fuji from the top on a clear day.",
          "We had planned to stop briefly at Odawara Castle before proceeding on to the Hakone area but when the cold rain settled in we thought better of it. We turned it into a castle visit and a walking tour of Odawara - and we were thoroughly glad we did. At the outset it should be",

          "The outside was great, unfortunately the inside was closed due to renovations. The surrounding area is fantastic, with many koi in the canal around it.",
          "The 7th highest castle in Japan and near to Tokyo. The castle is a rebuild castle from edo period. The museum is very small and not worth paying extra for it. Recommend to just pay to visit the castle keep and to go to edo-tokyo museum for better museum tour.",
          "Love at first sight! Our trip was so worth it. Even though some parts of the interior was sort of modern, I fell inlove on the exterior. I could look at this beautiful building all day! I look forward to seeing more castles here in Japan!",
          "We went around 2.30pm and manage to leave after it close which for us with young kids meant a great deal. From the entrance right to the tower, the place was absolutely beautiful. The grounds were kept brautifully and view of the bridge over the moats were exactly as what you",

          "We visited Odawara castle with our two young children. The museum near the gate was fun and quite interactive. Our 3 year old was petrified of the samurai model with flames behind it! The best bit was dressing up outside the castle - choice of kimono, samurai or ninja outfits",

          "We visited the castle during cherry blossom season on a split trip to Hakone. The Cherry trees were in full bloom. The castle itself was closed for renovation, but I'd seen it before. It is worthy of a stop as an outer-Tokyo area attraction. They have some zoo-animal cages",

          "The castle is an easy 10 minute walk from the train station and even though the interior of the castle is still closed for renovation we really enjoyed walking the surrounding grounds. The Sakura were just amazing and the views of the castles' exterior are impressive. Small row",
          "We visited this castle by Nov 2015. We followed a day trip to come here. I am not quite familiar with the history of this castle. I just enjoyed the scenic view and strolling about 30 min. Not many tourist here.Really a peaceful place.",

          "We only visited the outdoor ground of the castle since it was being renovated with scaffoldings everywhere. But it was a lovely discovery for us. Castle in Japan are so different than castle in the West. To me they more or less look like temples and they certainly are not so",

          "Around 10 min walk from the station, some lovely cherry blossom lined paths to the castle. The castle itself has plenty to take in, on several floors you get a history of the importance of this site/location between the different clans. You get a good view of how close you are",

          "We visited the castle when we had a few hours to spare before catching our train to Kyoto. It is the perfect way to spend 2-2.5 hours. We asked for directions in the train station information center and they gave us a discount coupon. It is a nice walk to the castle. The",
          "We went here to kill two hours between hour trains, but soon we learned that it may have not been enough to look at everything that was in display. There are 4 stories to this castle and it was full of goods from 1600s. I loved the beautiful sets of Japanese lacquers. English",
          "The castle was set up like a museum and full of Japanese history. The armor and swords were the coolest to see. There are a lot of stairs to explore the whole castle with a gift shop and viewing deck at the top. Be aware that photography is not allowed a lot of places in",
          "I liked that the castle grounds is surrounded by residential areas and life. Schools and children also use the grounds. It nice that it's alive. Many castles are tourist spots but I especially liked that real people are still using & enjoying this area. I didn't go in as",

          "A lovely place to visit. And also, this is an replica of the original. Noted with that, the Spring season of Sakura is lovely and the Autumn season of red leaves is just as nice.",

          "A popular tourist location, it simply lacks the drama of what Westerners might expect from a castle. Plus, it's a replica; the original is down the road a mile or so. Don't plan more than an hour, even if you read every artifact explanation.",

          "Such a relaxing day! Having spent a super busy week sightseeing in Tokyo this was exactly what we needed to relax. The place itself is very easy to access, we grabbed a taxi from Hakone Yumoto which was quite affordable and easier than trying to find a bus. The Onsen was",
          "Close to Hakone-Yumoto Station and I had very good experience. Only thing is if you live here in Japan and use to visit lots of onsens you may find it very different. First, they accept people with tattoo, I found at least 10% people wearing tattoo may be because this is the",
          "Great experience, beautiful place. I visited with my friends and it was so calm and beautiful. However we read previous comments about bathing suits allowed and that's not true... Only naked. However it's an amazing experience and you shouldn't miss it Tattoo friendly",
          "The restaurant and resting area are by the river, with a couple of cherry blossom trees. The outdoor sitting area was raining pale pink sakura petals when I went in spring. Hot springs are not in a huge area but really nice - 1 wooden half-open indoor tub, a sauna, plus 5",

          "They have beautiful rock made onsen with various pools. It is a pity that they do not allow photos, as we arrive early and there was no one. It was very relaxing during a December visit. It is a clean and well maintained onsen. And convenient shuttle that take you there and",
          "We had dinner before the onsen. The restaurant is divided into 2 areas. One for ala carte and the other set meals. We tried the set meals. Without fail, the food is delicious. The black pork set is amazing! The Onsen is separated by gender. Within each area, they have one indoor",
          "It a must do in Hakone since it\u2019s famous with hot spring. Been doing research around for Onsen which allowed for peoples with tattoos. This is the one most peoples have recommended. Took the romancecar from Shinjuku to Hakone-Yumoto station in an early morning, 7am (85min",

          "This traditional onsen is absolutely stunning and a must-visit. Tenzan is about a 20 minute walk from town, or a short bus ride away. We walked there from Hakone and it was beautiful but a little bit tight. There are not walkways or often designated shoulders for pedestrians",
          "nice onsen, clean&very relaxing with the natural stone, trees, .. i went on a weekday(!!) after visiting hakone area as a day trip from tokio- it was lovely as it wasnt crowded at all and also there were very few foreigners -great experience!",
          "On a solo work trip and decided to try out my first onsen in Hakone! Easy to get to using the shuttles just outside and across the road from the Hakone-Yumoto station. Driver dropped us off at the base of the building and then you had to purchase your ticket at the vending",
          "This is my second onsen and I liked the experience very much again. Very kind personal. Few foreigners. Easy to reach with bus B for 100 Yen from the tourist office at the train station. Relaxing massages can be booked directly in the facility. No need for reservation.",
          "This was an amazing onsen. The baths were enveloped in trees, waterfalls and natural stone. We spent several hours there enjoying the setting and various temperature pools. Highly recommend- a great refuge outside of Tokyo.",
          "This place is pretty nice and relaxing. If you are first timer and feel embarrassed of totally naked, go on weekdays at around 630pm. It is not crowded and pretty dim in evening. Plus you get a small towel to cover your front which many foreigners do. You need to buy a ticket",
          "Great Japanse onsen. Situated beautifully in nature. Very feng sue build. Tattoo friendly and overall very friendly. Not an tourist trap. You relax with the Japanese people. If you don't have towells yourzelf, you can buy them there ranging from 200 yen to 800 yen. Friendly",
          "Unquestionably, my evening here proved to be one of the highlights of my holiday in Japan, and certainly the highlight of my day in Hakone. I've only have two other onsen experiences but this was on another level in terms of scale, and lavish attention to detail. Suddenly, a",
          "Onsen Tenzan is a perfect place to experience a Japanese onsen. It is easily reachable with public transport and the staff is very friendly. Facilities are clean and well maintained. The price is 1300 yen, which is good value for money. Lockers are provided, as well as snacks",
          "The Onsen was quite a walk from the Odakyu Hakone Yumoto station but on the way back we found out that there is also a bus stop close by. But I would recommend the little hike along the river and waterfalls, it was very scenic. I would also recommend this onsen for all of you",
          "I can't say have I have been ever more relaxed than taking in the waters of Tenzan. After a long day of touring Hakone on the Free Pass, I was bit tired and ready to retire at our hotel in Tokyo, an hour and half away. However, my wife and kids suggested we take an",
          "This is the last onsen we visited during our short stay in Hakone, and one of the best. The surrounding cherry blossom was in its prime when we arrived, making the place picturesque. While the male bath is on par with other very nice onsen we already experienced in previous",
          "This was an amazing onsen. The view and the nature is unbelievably beautiful, it's like you are in the middle of Utopia. The onsen itself is superb, very very clean and stylish, very big and comfortable. The prices are very low, we payed 1200 yen for one person! You have lots of",
          "I'm a little biased because I'm used to Korean style spas and springs where there are a lot of things to do to keep you entertained. This is a very natural experience. Natural hot spring water in pools and not much else. So it's great for just relaxing and unwinding. Still,",

        "wiki": "Hakone (\u7bb1\u6839\u753a, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of June 2012, the town had an estimated population of 13,492, and a population density of 145 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi). Hakone has been designated as a Japanese National Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Network.\nHakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mt. Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nOdawara\nYugawara\nMinami-ashigaraShizuoka Prefecture\n\nGotemba\nSusono\nMishima\nOyama\nKannami\n\n\n== History ==\nHakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the Hakone Checkpoint (\u7bb1\u6839\u95a2\u6240, Hakone sekisho), which formed the border of the Kant\u014d region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T\u014dkaid\u014d were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons.\nAfter the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake.\nAfter merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active \u014cwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights.\nHakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art.\nMajor events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T\u014dkaid\u014d road.\nOne famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods.\nA noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi.Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town.

          "We recently visited with our 9 and 11 year old children. So much of the museum is interactive. The grounds are just beautiful. This visit was enjoyed by our kids just as much as DisneySea and probably a lot more enjoyable for us parents. We spent about 2-3 hours there. Not a lot",
          "I\u00b4m not very interested in sculptures and art but this museum was great, with a lot of sculptures in the park and also a building dedicated to Picasso art only.",
          "We visited on a sunny day and spent around 3 hours at the park. The sculptures are modern and vary in style, including Moore, Miro and Picasso. It is quite breathtaking seeing the modern art surrounded by autumn leaves on the mountains. There is also lots of spots for kids",
          "We spent two hours here with friends. It is spectacular. We were very lucky with the weather. The sculptures are arranged very thoughtfully in the gardens. The Henry Moore collection must be one of the best anywhere and certainly the most elegantly set into the landscape.",
          "This was a stop on my tour and I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I was blown away by the huge and beautiful grounds containing so many world class art installations. A few were targeted for kids. The Picasso exhibit was also extraordinary. Our tour group stayed only one and a half",
          "I loved it here, it\u2019s definitely worth stopping off if you\u2019re doing the loop! Really amazing outdoor space, plenty for kids and adults alike ... I went first thing and found it super chilled and a great start to the day!",

          "We were lucky to be there on a dry day, I wouldn't recommend visiting on a very wet day because almost all of the sculptures are outside. I thought the range was very impressive and include several Henry Moore's & and at least one Hepworth (so the British were well represented).",
          "The Hakone Open-Air Museum is a very nice modern sculpture park/museum. The museum itself is quite small, but the sculpture park is quite large. There is a lot to explore. I arrived shortly after it rained... Blue sky with mixed clouds... It was beautiful. It is not too",

          "This was part of a trip to Hakone, the gardens are beautiful and we saw them at there best on a sunny day. As the title says it is an Open-air museum so most exibits are outside. The picasso exibit is indoors but the venue is so much more than pissaco. well worth a visit",
          "We lucked out and had a beautiful day to enjoy the museum, which definitely added to our experience. It is very well done with the outdoor sculptures, the lawns, the trees, etc. all set against the beautiful green mountain scenery. We had a nice leisurely stroll, taking in the",

          "Full array of wonderful sculptures from all the famous names around the world all set in delightful tranquil gardens. Beautifully thought through. We loved it",
          "We had a really lovely afternoon at this unique outdoors museum. The setting is wonderful, really special to be able to regard these works of art against the Hakone mountain backdrop. Although we have no kids with us we were really impressed at how kid friendly this museum is.",
          "Really surprised to see such an extensive open air, modern sculpture collection in the hills of a spa town in Japan. It's absolutely fantastic and easily rivals similar ones that I've seen in the US and in Europe. Absolutely worth a visit, but absolutely be prepared to walk a",

          "Walking by we spot the museum and we were compelled to go inside. Plenty of large art figures scattered throughout the property. Highlight is the Picasso works within the museum complex. Take your time, as the collection covers a long period of his life and is well",
          "Beautiful open air museum, lots of sculptures and many kids are able to play on which is great. Also some building with collections of artworks, including a Renoir and many Picassos. The foot onsen is great for a rest after so much walking. Highly recommend.",
          "The most unexpected array of thought-provoking, emotion-provoking sculptures are in a small mountain area of Japan! Crazy but true. I took so many pictures just to be able to keep looking at them well after our visit. There is a Picasso exhibit here that is interesting (no",
          "It is a beautiful museum with a large collection of statues. Modern artists from all over the world. Beautiful indoor collection of Picasso. Mainly ceramics but also some paintings. Climb up the tower for a beautiful view. They have a foot bath so don\u2019t forget a small towel.",
          "A highlight from my experience in hakone . I love the design and layout of this museum and some of the Picasso pieces were amazing. Would like to see the nature part a little more groomed but other then that good memories.",
          "We just loved our time at the The Hakone Open-Air Museum something that I certainly wasn't expecting, the exhibits are weird but interesting and the gardens just beautiful. The sculptures exquisite some you may understand others not so, but again so interesting. There is a small",

          "A breath of fresh air! Beautifully exposed art, surrounded by trees and flowers. You can enjoy Picasso paintings and it\u2019s excellent for families, as it has some art creations for children up to 12 to play. Plan at least 3 hours for this museum as you can have a nice pause at the",
          "A very interesting collection of sculptures by international artists, in a nice park. It was well worth the couple of hours we spent there. There is also a small collection of Picasso's works, but the pavilion was closed, so we only got to see a part of the collection.",
          "Beautiful 2 hours spent here. We were glad we went early because it was getting busy by the time we left at 11:30am. Beautiful surroundings and interesting sculptures. The Picasso display was really well done.",
          "The whole family loved this museum. Such a significant collection of amazing sculptures and the Picasso pavilion is also fab. Loved this place and possibly missed seeing Fuji because we stayed so long. Haven\u2019t seen so many Henry Moore\u2019s in one place and lots of other highly",

          "Fairly easy walking park to view the different sculptures.The amazing greenery and tranquil ambience add to the joy of visit. Climb the circular tower near the cafe (< 100 narrow steps) which offesr different views of the park and displays. Treat your feet to warm foot spa",
          "A delightful way to spend a couple of hours. We cut the teenager loose right after we got in - she told us later \"it was good\". This meant the wife and I got to stroll around at a leisurely pace. I'm not a huge art aficionado, but there was plenty for me to enjoy. Aside from the",
          "I never expected this! The Open Air museum has perhaps the best outdoor sculpture garden in the world. Yes the world. The variety of art works on display are wonderful, from the traditional freestanding figures by Henri Moore or Rodin to the more modern pieces that defy",
          "I was so impressed with this museum however, I would call it The Hakone Open-air Art Gallery. To access the art you walk around beautiful park like gardens. We had allowed 2 hours to view what we thought was a museum and found that we had to rush in order to get around. I",
          "We spent about 3 and 1/2 hours walking around and taking fun photos of the sculptures. Stopped for coffee at the cafe near the Picasso exhibit. Parking discount to \u00a5500 was very nice too.",
          "We went to this \u2018museum\u2019 just as it opened (9am) on a Wednesday morning. It was pretty warm but cloudy. We couldn\u2019t believe what a high quality gallery/museum this is. The sculptures are nearly all outdoors, so maybe if it\u2019s scorching hot or wet or cold it might not be as good,",
          "But most of it was outside. They server really good soft serve ice cream for like 400 yen, defo get some of that. The ticket was cheap I think and they spoke English. Lots of art everywhere and you can look at it. Pretty good tbh.",

          "Although we never saw Mt. Fuji... he was feeling shy that day... we got to visit the fabulous Hakone Open-Air Museum. This is one that the kids would enjoy as there are many outdoor sculptures and they can be as noisy as they want. The highlight is the Picasso Museum. Although I",

          "I was expecting to be in and out of here in 10 minutes. It is quite pricey to get in (1600 yen each?) and you have to leave bags in a locker. The outdoor setting helps massively - with scenery like this the installations get a huge interest boost. I found the Picasso museum",
          "What a beautiful place to spend a few hours on a sunny day! We got the train from Hawkins to this park and we were not disappointed. At every turn there was something striking to look at and after a couple of hours we even got to soak our feet in the foot bath.",

          "Now, if you do not like museums because it means staying inside on a nice day, this is the museum you need to get to. Everything, or almost (ref. Picasso) is outside and if the weather is nice you will ''kill two birds with one stone''. We have been to open-air museum before,",

          "Even if you aren't into museums this place is not to be missed. Fantastic space, art which is easily understood and well presented, even a warm onsen foot bath. The grounds are both large and beautifully landscaped and worth the cost of admission just to walk around and",
          "The Hakone Open-Air Museum is a magnificent place to visit but not for the reasons that it might look like from the outside. As a collection of modern sculpture it is ok. However, as a place for young children to experience creative physical play it is wonderful. The museum",

          "This is a fine collection of monumental sculptures (including a good selection of Henry Moore's) set in a delightful (if steep) park - the sculptures benefit from their setting, and complement it. We saw it in bright spring sunshine - delightful and well worth a visit if",
          "We reached this amazing setting using the train from Hakone-Yumoto station and could easily have spent a good half day there instead of the couple of hours we had available. There are permanent exhibits featuring painters and sculptors from around the world with some fun",
          "Gorgeous garden with amazing collection of modern art. An amazing collection of paintings and ceramics by Picasso. A great place for fam8lies, as some of the creative exhibits are interactive and meant to be climbed on by children. Loved it!",

          "Sculpture is often an addition at an art gallery or museum, occupying centre stage or in a corner, sometimes a room of heads on plinths, but to see such a variety of works and mediums, placed outside, where their size is relative to the garden, is wonderful. This is not my first",
          "This is a must go place in Hakone, it is a good experience to walk in the open while enjoying the scenery and the scriptures at the same time. Especially during the Cherry blossom time, it\u2019s so beautiful.",

          "My family and I had such a great afternoon at the Open Air Museum today. We were a bit early to check in to our accommodation in Hakone, so we decided to go and visit the Open Air Museum, thinking that at least it would be outside and our kids would be able to run around.",
          "I guess we were expecting more from the museum but overall it was great. Picasso gallery was our highlight as we\u2019ve learned a lot from his life and his work of art.

          "This was a fantastic day out... we loved it. It has so much to see and do and also has some fantastic pieces of art that just took you breath away. If you can get their you won\u2019t be disappointed we have nothing that compares to anything in the UK.",

          "I spent a wonderful afternoon strolling around this open air sculpture museum finding new delights at every turn in the path. Loads to see - artists I just did not expect to see and hidden gems if you take the time to check out every nook and cranny. Took the Hakone Tozen",
          "There are three components to this Open air museum, the statues out doors, the Picasso collection and the collection of small works in the gallery above the cafe. Even one is worth the admission fee, but we got all three. An absolute must do, and what made us choose Hahone as a",
          "This is not the place you want to go on a rainy day. The sculpture is laid out nicely and is excellent but the Picasso exhibit is mainly works you would never really care to see if you are an \"art\" person. It is mostly ceramic work which wasn't his best. THe scultpure garden",

          "I really enjoyed the Hakone Open-Air Museum and the gardens looked especially stunning under snow cover. The weather may affect what you think of the museum, so choose a nice, sunny day to go, especially if it's winter. The great collection of sculptures aside, the Museum also",
          "A lovely thing to do and especially easy to get to as it's only a walk away if staying in Gora. Some thoughtful, clever and interesting art over a very large area, with a cafe and other comforts available. The Picasso section was a little disappointing as nothing truly stands",
          "Get here early and in winter, rug yourself up. It's well worth it as there are some interesting exhibits for kids who can play on the sculptures quite safely. They may also like the foot bath. One sculpture has an area for older and younger kids. I found the souvenir shop",

          "Mammy was very helpful & accommodating. We had booked a large room for 7 of us, but as the hotel was quiet that night, she arranged for us to have 3 separate rooms. Excellent meal & service, staff were all very friendly. A wonderful experience of a traditional unspoilt Ryokan",
          "Fantastic service, friendly staff, comfortable bed, beautiful scenery and great traditional experience. Needed to know a bit of Japanese to understand the staff at times and got hit with a few unexpected costs like karaoke and an onsen \u2026",
          "It's a very beautiful place to stay. The sound of the water flowing all night is the most tranquil thing to go to sleep to. The service was of the highest quality as they were very accommodating. It's very traditional and in a gorgeous part of Hakone",
          "We had such a wonderful one-night stay at Fukuzumiro. This was our first time experiencing a ryokan and Fukuzumiro definitely exceeded our expectations. The ryokan has a beautiful traditional charm to it. Our room (Sakura 5) overlooked the \u2026",

          "Stellar hospitality in this ryokan. First time for me but it certainly went way beyond my expectations. The person taking care of me spoke excellent English and confessed she started to learn it only a few months ago. I had an amazing time and the river view is definitely worth it.

          "We stayed in another ryokan on our trip and loved it, but the price here was significantly higher and yet the quality of the food and facility was much lower. I was expecting a more polished and refined experience and simply didn\u2019t get it. \u2026",

          "For $700 a night I expected better service. We got an abrupt young girl who was clearly unhappy that she had to work on a Saturday night. I speak  fluent Japanese so I know she was using very informal language with us and she was impatient \u2026",
          "I will preface this review by saying my girlfriend and I were coming back from hiking Fuji. We just wanted to shower and relax in the hot springs. Instead we get ambushed with questions about when we want food and, exactly what time we \u2026",

          "The best experience I've had in Japan when it comes to accommodations. The staff are wonderful and thoughtful. The rooms are what you expect for a building this old - worn and creaky. It just adds to the charm! The meals were prepared well, \u2026",

          "So very beautiful. The service was wonderful. Our helper, Mama, had good English. The food was well displayed and delish. They give the option of Western or Japanese style. Also we got there about 5:20 which is late and they were fine with it. Totally worth it. Oh, one thing to note - the baths are EXTREMELY hot.",
          "Myself and my family came to stay for a traditional Japanese experience. We were initially daunted by the exotic food (which we were kept in the dark about) but the host took great care in asking us about our food requirementswhich was thoughtful. Our hostess encouraged questions and answered in good nature. ",
          "This was the highlight of our trip to Japan. Such a great, traditional Japanese experience. The staff could not be more helpful and service-minded. Our room had a river view, which was beautiful. The private onsen was relaxing and comfortable. Highly recommend staying here as part of your vacation to Japan.",
          "Amazing! First experience at a ryokan, and we were blown away! Traditional Japanese dinner and breakfast was interesting, and our room attendant was able to work with our almost non existent knowledge of Japanese. The private family bath was a nice Change of pace from the public ones.",
          "Great place to relax and eat good food, just be aware there's a lot of bugs.",

          "We stayed at a small japanese room with a view of the river. The well prepared and beautifully presented meals are served in your room by the house mother and futons are spread out in the evening for sleeping. Having said all that, we feel that the price was a bit high. ",
          "The staff was an utter delight and every other stay at other places will be nothing compared to my experience here",
          "Old fashioned ryokan with amazingly attentive staff. Located about a 10 minute walk from the nearest train station, this ryokan was perfect for getting away from the big city of Tokyo. I would stay here again without hesitation.",
          "Very nice traditional Ryokan and the lady host was very hospitality and friendly. The bus seems like it suffers from frequent delays due to traffic and high volume of tourists with luggage getting on and off. There was a small queue when we \u2026",

          "Very traditional Ryokan with pampering service.",
          "Excellent staff. Charming setting along the river. Not a very convenient location - better to be closer to a train stop. Onsen areas were clean, but small.",
          "\u63a5\u5ba2\u304c\u6700\u60aa\uff01\nHorrendous service! I couldnt take it anymore so I asked for the manager. But not a single word of apology out of his mouth, or any of the staff.\n\ni have been to more than 20 Ryokan all over Japan, luxury to a rather cheap one. This one has the worst service by far. How this place got such high rating is beyond my understanding.",
          "Great experience, felt pampered. The food, atmosphere and the accomodation were top notch. The onsen were really cozy.",
          "Traditional ryokyan with beautiful rooms overlooking a river and very attentive service. Onsen has both men and women only rooms, as well as a private bath should you want to bathe with your partner or in a family. The rooms were one of the most beautiful rooms we've stayed in in Japan.",
          "Expensive but so worth it. We could find it easily and there's a bus stop close by. Our room had a view of the river which was very nice. There were multiple onsen so we tteid them all out and they were all beautiful. The staff was also \u2026",
          "It was a nice and quiet stay. The futon bed and clothing were very comfortable. The food was interesting, mostly good. Some of it was just a little too foreign for me, but we did ask for the Japanese breakfast for that kind of experience. \u2026",
          "Beautiful traditional stylish stay in Japan. Strongly recommend for those who enjoy Onsen and traditional living accommodation. The service here is totally worthy of the medium high price.",
          "It's been a really lovely experience staying in a traditional Japanese else ryokan. The food is delicious and the staff are very helpful. Also the local area is definitely worth exploring.",
          "A ryokan that has more than a 100 years of history. And because of that, please do not expect modern facilities (eg attached bathroom, bidet etc). \n\nThe food they here is delectable, very well presented and served in your room. They rotate \u2026",
          "Amazing experience. The kaiseki dinner was delicious. Very good Japanese food. The traditional Japanese breakfast was great. The rooms are rather big and the night on futon is a must-try. They have 2 shared onsen and a private one, which we enjoyed a lot. The only downside is the the expensive price.",
          "This was a really awsome place for that traditional Japanese guesthouse feel.",
          "It was an amazing experience. Fukuzumiro is comfortable and relaxing. The hotel atmosphere gives you the feeling of traditional Japanese hospitality. Soaking in the hot springs will melt away all your stress.",
          "Great experience.. we stayed at Sakura 5",
          "A great place to stay for a very traditional, Japanese vibe. It is a very fun experience. The room is clean with a great view. The meals are basically feasts, with many courses of unique foods that I would not have known to try elsewhere. \u2026",
          "If you want typical ryokan experience in this is the place. The service and the food is excellent!",
          "I was very deeply disturbed. The place could benefit from a bit of a tidy up in some areas as it is looking a little worn. We were met at the entrance by a *** we think is the owner who is the most miserable person we met in japan. ",
          "In fact, by the time I got out of the ryokan, I felt extremely dirty and couldn't wait to get to the next hotel to have a good wash. It's great for people who like to experience the old Japanese time. You HAVE to do this and it is worth every penny. ",
          "Good if you want to have a real Japanese experience for a couple of nights. Be prepared to have an high level Japanese dinner ",
          "It was a great first ryokan experience. Our room overlooked the river and the sounds from it was very tranquil. The dinner and breakfast provided was unbelievably divine and beautifully represented. Top notch service. We felt like royalty. \u2026",
          "Small place, super hot onsen though, service was good and small areas around, very touristic but a nice authentic Japanese experience. A bit steep though",
          "We stayed at Fukuzumiro for 1 night and enjoyed the dinner and breakfast there. This is definitely a great place to experience a traditional Japanese style roukan. They were very friendly with foreigners and had instructions and information \u2026",
          "Great experience, authentic Japanese ryokan. Only complaints are that the dinner was not included in the stay (extra 5000 yen) and they charged 100 yen for a spare towel. The staff were very nice and very helpful. Would definitely recommend.",
          "The ryokan is a lovely old building and the staff is lovely, however for the price I was not expecting to find it in such need of even the most basic repairs - there are tears in the paper blinds, stains on the carpeted areas, big black \u2026",
          "Wonderful ryokan with multiple baths.",
          "Cause it was awesome. What kind of monster gives it anything less",
          "Great experience! Excellent japanese dinner and breakfast! Great hot springs.",
          "Excellent traditional establishment. Very large rooms. Good breakfast.",
          "The building was well blended with nature, with halls that open on one side to gardened courtyards, rooms 3 feet from the rushing river and birds waking you at a very reasonable hour of the morning.  Staff was helpful and friendly and the \u2026",
          "Amazing Ryokan! Had a fantastic multi-course dinner and a great breakfast. The baths were very clean and the surrounding areas were beautiful to view!",

        "wiki": "Odawara (\u5c0f\u7530\u539f\u5e02, Odawara-shi) is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.\nAs of February 2015, the city had an estimated population of 194,672, and a population density of 1,710 persons per km2. The total area is 113.79 km2.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe area around present-day Odawara has been settled since prehistoric times, and archaeological evidence indicates that the area had a high population density in the J\u014dmon period.\nFrom the Ritsury\u014d system of the Nara period, the area became part of Ashigarashimo District of Sagami Province. It was divided into sh\u014den during the Heian period, mostly controlled by the Hatano clan and its branches. During the Genpei War between the Heike clan and Minamoto no Yoritomo, the Battle of Ishibashiyama was fought near present-day Odawara. During the Sengoku period, Odawara developed as a castle town and capital of the domains of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan, which covered most of the Kant\u014d region. The H\u014dj\u014d were defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in the Battle of Odawara in 1590, despite the impregnable reputation of Odawara Castle. The territory came under the control of Tokugawa Ieyasu.\nUnder the Tokugawa shogunate, Odawara was the center of Odawara Domain, a feudal han ruled by a succession of daimy\u014d. The castle town prospered as Odawara-juku, a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto.\nAfter the Meiji Restoration, Odawara Domain briefly became 'Odawara Prefecture', which was merged with the short-lived 'Ashigara Prefecture' before joining Kanagawa Prefecture in 1876. During this period, the center of economic and political life in Kanagawa shifted to Yokohama. Odawara suffered a strong decline in population, which was made more severe when the original route of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line bypassed the city in favor of the more northerly route via Gotemba.\nThe epicenter of the Great Kant\u014d earthquake in 1923 was deep beneath Izu \u014cshima Island in Sagami Bay. It devastated Tokyo, the port city of Yokohama, surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka Prefectures, and caused widespread damage throughout the Kant\u014d region. Ninety percent of the buildings in Odawara collapsed immediately, and fires burned the rubble along with anything else left standing.Odawara regained some measure of prosperity with the opening of the Tanna Tunnel in 1934, which brought the main routing of the T\u014dkaid\u014d Main Line through the city. Odawara was raised from the status of town to city on December 20, 1940. On August 15, 1945, Odawara was the last city in Japan to be bombed by Allied aircraft during World War II.\nOn November 1, 2000, Odawara exceeded 200,000 in population, and was proclaimed a special city.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nOdawara lies in the Ashigara Plains, in the far western portion of Kanagawa Prefecture. It is bordered by the Hakone Mountains to the north and west, the Sakawa River to the east, and Sagami Bay of the Pacific Ocean to the south.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\nMinamiashigara\nNinomiya\n\u014ci, Kaisei, Nakai\nHakone, Manazuru, Yugawara\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nOdawara is a major commercial center for western Kanagawa Prefecture.

Within the city itself, the Yugawara area is a well-known hot spring resort.\nEnoura, a coastal area of Odawara known for its pristine sea, has an abundance of kumamomi, a type of fish that prefers clear and clean water. Sea turtles are sometimes present there. Because of the clear water and plentiful undersea life, many people come to Enoura for scuba diving.\nTraditionally, Odawara is known for its production of kamaboko processed fish, stockfish, umeboshi salted plums, and traditional herbal medicines. The Suzuhiro Kamaboko Village is a place to experience making and learning more about Odawara Kamaboko.\n\n\n== Sister city relations ==\n - Nikk\u014d, Tochigi, since December 19, 1980\n - Kishiwada, Osaka, since June 26, 1968\n - Chula Vista, California, United States, since November 8, 1981\n - Manly, New South Wales, Australia (friendship city), since 1991\n - Shenzhen, Guangdong, China, since February 4, 1993\n\n\n== Notable people from Odawara ==\nKai At\u014d - actor\nY\u014dhei K\u014dno - politician\nNinomiya Sontoku - Edo period economist and philosopher\nRumina Sato - mixed martial arts fighter\nKitamura Tokoku - author\nYoshiyuki Tomino - anime movie director\nBaku Yumemakura - science fiction author\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHammer, Joshua.

        "wiki": "Hakone (\u7bb1\u6839\u753a, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of June 2012, the town had an estimated population of 13,492, and a population density of 145 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi). Hakone has been designated as a Japanese National Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Network.\nHakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mt. Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nOdawara\nYugawara\nMinami-ashigaraShizuoka Prefecture\n\nGotemba\nSusono\nMishima\nOyama\nKannami\n\n\n== History ==\nHakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the Hakone Checkpoint (\u7bb1\u6839\u95a2\u6240, Hakone sekisho), which formed the border of the Kant\u014d region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T\u014dkaid\u014d were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons.\nAfter the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake.\nAfter merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active \u014cwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights.\nHakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art.\nMajor events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T\u014dkaid\u014d road.\nOne famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods.\nA noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi.Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town. In 2017, Hakone was included as one of 88 anime pilgrimage sites for 2018 by the Anime Tourism Association. In 2020, new decorations have been introduced to the city in the anticipation of the release of the final film of the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nHakone Tozan Railway\nHakone Tozan Cable Car\nHakone Ropeway\nIzuhakone RailwayOdawara and Mishima, the terminus of the Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, 70 minutes from Shinjuku, Tokyo. From Odawara, the Hakone Tozan Line continues into various resort towns in Hakone. Odakyu also runs the Romancecar limited express between Shinjuku and Hakone-Yumoto. From G\u014dra, the terminus of Hakone Tozan Line, the Hakone Tozan Cable Car funicular goes to S\u014dunzan. \u014cwakudani can be reached by Hakone Ropeway from Sounzan and the lake, while the lake is crisscrossed by cartoonishly decorated \"pirate\" ships for tourists. There is also Hakone Komagatake Ropeway, which goes to the top of Mount Komagatake.\nA popular \"Hakone Free Pass\", allowing unlimited use of most forms of transport for several days, is available. Hakone Free Pass can be bought at Shinjuku Station, Odawara Station, any other chief station along Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, Hakone-Yumoto Station, G\u014dra Station, any other chief station along Hakone Tozan Line, S\u014dunzan Station, T\u014dgendai Station, Sengoku-Annaijo Bus Stop, Moto-Hakone Port, Hakone-Machi Port, and JR Gotemba Station Bus Information.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nHakone Shind\u014d\nJapan National Route 1\nJapan National Route 138\n\n\n== Education ==\nPrivate schools:\n\nKanrei Shirayuri Gakuen Junior/Senior High School\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n - T\u014dyako, Hokkaid\u014d, since July 4, 1964\n - Jasper, Alberta, Canada from July 4, 1972\n - Taupo, New Zealand, from October 7, 1987\n - St. Moritz, Switzerland, from November 2, 2014 (Friendship City)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Hakone travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nOfficial Website (in Japanese)\nHakone Portal Website\n Geographic data related to Hakone at OpenStreetMap",

        "wiki": "Hakone (\u7bb1\u6839\u753a, Hakone-machi) is a town in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. As of June 2012, the town had an estimated population of 13,492, and a population density of 145 persons per km\u00b2. The total area is 92.82 km2 (35.84 sq mi). Hakone has been designated as a Japanese National Geopark by the Japanese Geoparks Network.\nHakone is to a great degree regarded as a traveler destination; Mt. Fuji can be seen when taking a day trip from Tokyo. In addition to hot springs, museums and other recreation activities, Hakone is known for its scenery during all four seasons.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nHakone is located in the mountains in the far west of the prefecture, on the eastern side of Hakone Pass. Most of the town is within the borders of the volcanically active Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park, centered on Lake Ashi.\n\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\nKanagawa Prefecture\n\nOdawara\nYugawara\nMinami-ashigaraShizuoka Prefecture\n\nGotemba\nSusono\nMishima\nOyama\nKannami\n\n\n== History ==\nHakone is the location of a noted Shinto shrine, the Hakone Gongen, which is mentioned in Heian period literature. During the Genpei War, Minamoto no Yoritomo prayed at this shrine for victory over his enemies, after his defeat at the Battle of Ishibashiyama, which was fought in neighboring Manazuru. As with the rest of Sagami Province, the area came under the control of the later H\u014dj\u014d clan of Odawara during the Sengoku period. After the start of the Edo period, Hakone-juku was a post station on the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. It was also the site of a major barrier and official checkpoint on the route known as the Hakone Checkpoint (\u7bb1\u6839\u95a2\u6240, Hakone sekisho), which formed the border of the Kant\u014d region. Under the Tokugawa shogunate, all travellers entering and leaving Edo along the T\u014dkaid\u014d were stopped here by officials. Their travel permits and baggage were examined to enforce Tokugawa laws that restricted the travel of women and weapons.\nAfter the start of the Meiji Restoration, Hakone became a part of the short-lived Ashigara Prefecture before becoming part of Ashigarashimo District in Kanagawa prefecture in August 1876. Hakone attained town status in 1889. The imperial household established the summer Hakone Imperial Villa close to the lake.\nAfter merger with five neighboring towns and villages in September 1956, it reached its present boundaries.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nThe economy of Hakone is strongly dominated by the tourist industry. Hakone is noted for its onsen hot spring resorts, which attract both Japanese and international visitors, due to its proximity to the greater Tokyo metropolis and to Mount Fuji. Sights include the volcanically active \u014cwakudani geysers and Hakone Shrine on the shore of the lake, as well as the Hakone Botanical Garden of Wetlands. In April the cherry blossoms (sakura) and in autumn the Miscanthus sinensis (susuki) are noted sights.\nHakone has a number of art museums, including the Hakone Open-Air Museum and Pola Museum of Art.\nMajor events include the annual JLPGA CAT Ladies Golf tournament and the Hakone Ekiden, a long distance collegiate foot race, held at the New Year, which runs from Tokyo to Hakone and back over two days, partly in commemoration of the couriers who ran the T\u014dkaid\u014d road.\nOne famous hotel in Hakone is the historic Fujiya Hotel in Miyanoshita, which was patronized by noted literary figures, politicians and foreign dignitaries in the Meiji and Taish\u014d and early Sh\u014dwa periods.\nA noted local handicraft is a kind of marquetry called Yosegi.Hakone is also well-known among anime fans for being the main location in the manga and anime series Neon Genesis Evangelion, in which it has been renamed Tokyo-3, and there are numerous attractions related to the franchise offered in the town. In 2017, Hakone was included as one of 88 anime pilgrimage sites for 2018 by the Anime Tourism Association. In 2020, new decorations have been introduced to the city in the anticipation of the release of the final film of the Rebuild of Evangelion tetralogy.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Railway ===\nHakone Tozan Railway\nHakone Tozan Cable Car\nHakone Ropeway\nIzuhakone RailwayOdawara and Mishima, the terminus of the Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, 70 minutes from Shinjuku, Tokyo. From Odawara, the Hakone Tozan Line continues into various resort towns in Hakone. Odakyu also runs the Romancecar limited express between Shinjuku and Hakone-Yumoto. From G\u014dra, the terminus of Hakone Tozan Line, the Hakone Tozan Cable Car funicular goes to S\u014dunzan. \u014cwakudani can be reached by Hakone Ropeway from Sounzan and the lake, while the lake is crisscrossed by cartoonishly decorated \"pirate\" ships for tourists. There is also Hakone Komagatake Ropeway, which goes to the top of Mount Komagatake.\nA popular \"Hakone Free Pass\", allowing unlimited use of most forms of transport for several days, is available. Hakone Free Pass can be bought at Shinjuku Station, Odawara Station, any other chief station along Odaky\u016b Odawara Line, Hakone-Yumoto Station, G\u014dra Station, any other chief station along Hakone Tozan Line, S\u014dunzan Station, T\u014dgendai Station, Sengoku-Annaijo Bus Stop, Moto-Hakone Port, Hakone-Machi Port, and JR Gotemba Station Bus Information.\n\n\n=== Highways ===\nHakone Shind\u014d\nJapan National Route 1\nJapan National Route 138\n\n\n== Education ==\nPrivate schools:\n\nKanrei Shirayuri Gakuen Junior/Senior High School\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\n - T\u014dyako, Hokkaid\u014d, since July 4, 1964\n - Jasper, Alberta, Canada from July 4, 1972\n - Taupo, New Zealand, from October 7, 1987\n - St. Moritz, Switzerland, from November 2, 2014 (Friendship City)\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Hakone travel guide from Wikivoyage\n\nOfficial Website (in Japanese)\nHakone Portal Website\n Geographic data related to Hakone at OpenStreetMap",

They have this special sauna and every hour, a girl comes in and poor some aromatic water on those hot stone. And then she blast you with giant fan! Then you will be sweating like end of the world. So detoxifying! Good stuff.",
          "It's a beautiful onsen. But if you have a tattoo even tiny one, they are super strict! My friend had a tiny tattoo and she put a bandaid to hide no-one able to see it but they  asked my friend to leave the Onsen... How sad...  so, if you \u2026",

          "Considering the distance a lot of people travel to this rotenburo, it\u2019s disappointing in its rather typical features. The baths are quite limited: a massaging jet bath, two warm ones, a cold one, and a sauna. The temperatures are the same \u2026",
          "Private onsen rooms are an unbeatable experience and decently priced too",

          "The free shuttle bus from Hakone Yumoto station is a nice touch, as the place is quite inaccessible. Staff were friendly and very accommodating, the food was good and reasonably priced. However, the onsen itself was only ok, nothing to write home about...\n\nVisited Feb 2019",
          "A stunning onsen set in a private and intimate location.\n\nWe hired the 'type 3' private onsen. The water is hot but very inviting and the setting is very charming.\n\nI would recommend coming here in the late afternoon/evening after a long day trekking around Hakone.",
          "Great ambience. Free pick up from the station.",
          "Fantastic main bath, outdoor bath with a view and it's worth waiting for the sauna special events in a Finland style! A little pricey, but spend some time and it's worth it. A short walk from the nearest station, but it's a little of a hill climb.",
          "Nicest onsen I have been to. Several baths and outdoor setup is really good and well maintained",
          "I hate myself for using the word tranquil to describe our experience here but there\u2019s really no other option. We splurged for the most expensive private room for 90 minutes which felt a lot longer than we expected. The free shuttle bus was a bonus. Highly recommended.",

          "Highly recommend if you're visiting the Hakone area and are looking for a nice out-of-the-city Onsen experience. Not too expensive.\n\nWas very quiet at time of visit at night (around 8 p.m.) and very enchanting with its traditional-looking \u2026",

          "I came here for the $50 private onsen with my wife. You get a small private room, showering area, and small semi-outdoor onsen.\n\nI like the rustic atmosphere of the room & onsen. The 1-hour time limit was more than enough for us to enjoy \u2026",
          "Like all of Japan, very reverent and clean. The hot mineral water felt rejuvenating long after I left the spa.",
          "The Onsen area was much smaller than I expected. The facility was disappointingly modern (was hoping for a old feel).\n\nDispite this place being different than my expectations, it's one of the best onsens I've been to. The free shuttle was convenient.",

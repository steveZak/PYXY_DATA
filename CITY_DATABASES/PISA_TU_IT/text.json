        "wiki": "The Piazza dei Miracoli (Italian: [\u02c8pjattsa dei mi\u02c8ra\u02d0koli]; English: Square of Miracles), formally known as Piazza del Duomo (English: Cathedral Square), is a walled 8.87-hectare area located in Pisa, Tuscany, Italy, recognized as an important centre of European medieval art and one of the finest architectural complexes in the world. Considered sacred by the Catholic Church, its owner, the square is dominated by four great religious edifices: the Pisa Cathedral, the Pisa Baptistry, the Campanile, and the Camposanto Monumentale (Monumental Cemetery). Partly paved and partly grassed, the Piazza dei Miracoli is also the site of the Ospedale Nuovo di Santo Spirito (New Hospital of the Holy Spirit), which houses the Sinopias Museum (Italian: Museo delle Sinopie) and the Cathedral Museum (Italian: Museo dell'Opera del Duomo).\nThe name Piazza dei Miracoli was coined by the Italian writer and poet Gabriele d'Annunzio who, in his novel Forse che s\u00ec forse che no (1910), described the square as the \"prato dei Miracoli\", or \"meadow of miracles\". The square is sometimes called the Campo dei Miracoli (\"Field of Miracles\"). In 1987, the whole square was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\n\n== Cathedral ==\n\nThe heart of the Piazza del Duomo is the Duomo, the medieval cathedral of the Archdiocese of Pisa, dedicated to Santa Maria Assunta (St. Mary of the Assumption). The cathedral has two aisles on either side of the nave.  The transept consists of three aisles. The church is known also as the Primatial, the archbishop of Pisa being a Primate since 1092.\nIts construction began in 1064 by the architect Buscheto. It set the model for the distinctive Pisan Romanesque style of architecture. The mosaics of the interior, as well as the pointed arches, show a strong Byzantine influence.\nThe fa\u00e7ade, of grey marble and white stone set with discs of coloured marble, was built by a master named Rainaldo, as indicated by an inscription above the middle door: Rainaldus prudens operator.\nThe massive bronze main doors were made in the workshops of Giambologna, replacing the original doors destroyed in a fire in 1595. The original central door was of bronze, made around 1180 by Bonanno Pisano, while the other two were probably of wood.\nHowever, worshippers have never used the fa\u00e7ade doors to enter, instead entering by way of the Porta di San Ranieri (St. Ranieri's Door), in front of the Leaning Tower, built around 1180 by Bonanno Pisano.\n\nAbove the doors are four rows of open galleries with, on top, statues of Madonna with Child and, on the corners, the Four evangelists.\nAlso in the fa\u00e7ade is found the tomb of Buscheto (on the left side) and an inscription about the foundation of the Cathedral and the victorious battle against the Saracens.\nAt the east end of the exterior, high on a column rising from the gable, is a modern replica of the Pisa Griffin, the largest Islamic metal sculpture known, the original of which was placed there probably in the 11th or 12th century, and is now in the Cathedral Museum.\nThe interior is faced with black and white marble and has a gilded ceiling and a frescoed dome. It was largely redecorated after a fire in 1595, which destroyed most of the Renaissance art works.\nThe impressive mosaic of Christ in Majesty, in the apse, flanked by the Blessed Virgin and St. John the Evangelist, survived the fire. It evokes the mosaics in the church of Monreale, Sicily. Although it is said that the mosaic was done by  Cimabue, only the head of St. John was done by the artist in 1302, his last work, since he died in Pisa the same year. The cupola, at the intersection of the nave and transept, was decorated by Riminaldi showing the assumption of the Blessed Virgin.\n\nGalileo is believed to have formulated his theory about the movement of a pendulum by watching the swinging of the incense lamp (not the present one) hanging from the ceiling of the nave. That lamp, smaller and simpler than the present one, is now kept in the Camposanto, in the Aulla chapel.\nThe granite Corinthian columns between the nave and the aisle came originally from the mosque of Palermo, captured by the Pisans in 1063.\nThe coffer ceiling of the nave was replaced after the fire of 1595. The present gold-decorated ceiling carries the coat of arms of the Medici.\nThe elaborately carved pulpit (1302\u20131310), which also survived the fire, was made by Giovanni Pisano, a masterwork of medieval sculpture. Having been packed away during the redecoration, it was not rediscovered and restored until 1926. The pulpit is supported by plain columns (two of which are mounted on lion's sculptures) on one side and by caryatids and a telamon on the other: the latter represent St. Michael, the Evangelists, the four cardinal virtues flanking the Church, and a bold, naturalistic depiction of a naked Hercules. A central plinth with the liberal arts supports the four theological virtues.\n\nThe present-day pulpit is a reconstruction of the original. It does not lie in its original position, which was nearer the main altar, and the columns and panels are not original. The original stairs (perhaps of marble) were lost.\nThe upper part has nine narrative panels showing scenes from the New Testament, carved in white marble with a chiaroscuro effect and separated by figures of prophets: the Annunciation, the Massacre of the Innocents, the Nativity, Adoration of the Magi, the Flight into Egypt, the Crucifixion, and two panels of the Last Judgement.\nThe church also contains the bones of St. Ranieri, Pisa's patron saint, and the tomb of Holy Roman Emperor Henry VII, carved by Tino da Camaino in 1315. That tomb, originally in the apse just behind the main altar, was disassembled and moved many times over the centuries for political reasons. While the sarcophagus is still in the Cathedral, some of the statues were put in the Camposanto or in the top of the church's fa\u00e7ade. The original statues are now in the Museum of the Opera del Duomo.\nPope Gregory VIII was also buried in the cathedral.  The fire of 1595 destroyed his tomb.\nThe Cathedral has a prominent role in determining the beginning of the Pisan New Year. Between the tenth century and 1749, when the Tuscan calendar was reformed, Pisa used its own calendar, in which the first day of the year was March 25, the feast day of the Annunciation of Mary. Years were counted such that the Pisan New Year begins 9 months before the ordinary one. The exact moment is determined by a ray of sun that, through a window on the left side, falls on an egg-shaped marble, just above the pulpit by Giovanni Pisano; this occurs at noon.\nSome relics brought back during the Crusades can also be found in the Cathedral: alleged remains of three Saints (Abibo, Gamaliel, and Nicodemus), and a vase that is said to be one of the jars of Cana.\nThe building, as have several in Pisa, has tilted slightly since its construction, though not nearly to the extent of the nearby Tower.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Baptistery ==\n\nThe Baptistery, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, stands opposite the west end of the Duomo. The round Romanesque building was begun in the mid 12th century: 1153 Mense August fundata fuit haec (\"In the month of August 1153 was set up here...\"). It was built in Romanesque style by an architect known as Diotisalvi (\"God Save You\"), who worked also in the church of the Holy Sepulchre in the city. His name is mentioned on a pillar inside, as Diotosalvi magister. the construction was not, however, finished until the 14th century, when the loggia, the top storey and the dome were added in Gothic style by Nicola Pisano and Giovanni Pisano.\nIt is the largest baptistery in Italy, with a circumference measuring 107.25 m. Taking into account the statue of St. John the Baptist (attributed to Turino di Sano) atop the dome, it is even a few centimetres taller than the Leaning Tower.\nThe portal, facing the fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral, is flanked by two classical columns, while the inner jambs are executed in the Byzantine style. The lintel is divided into two tiers, the lower one depicting several episodes in the life of St. John the Baptist, and the upper one showing Christ between the Madonna and St. John the Baptist, flanked by angels and the evangelists.\nThe immensity of the interior is overwhelming, but it is surprisingly plain and lacking in decoration. It has notable acoustics also.\nThe octagonal baptismal font at the centre dates from 1246 and was made by Guido Bigarelli da Como. The bronze sculpture of St. John the Baptist at the centre of the font is a remarkable work by Italo Griselli.\nThe pulpit was sculpted between 1255-1260 by Nicola Pisano, father of Giovanni Pisano, the artist who produced the pulpit in the Duomo. The scenes on the pulpit, and especially the classical form of the naked Hercules, show at best Nicola Pisano's abilities as the most important precursor of Italian renaissance sculpture by reinstating antique representations. Therefore, surveys of the Italian Renaissance usually begin with the year 1260, the year that Nicola Pisano dated this pulpit.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Campanile ==\n\nThe campanile (bell tower), commonly known as the Leaning Tower of Pisa, is located behind the cathedral. The last of the three major buildings on the piazza to be built, construction of the bell tower began in 1173 and took place in three stages over the course of 177 years, with the bell-chamber only added in 1372. Five years after construction began, when the building had reached the third floor level, the weak subsoil and poor foundation led to the building sinking on its south side. The building was left for a century, which allowed the subsoil to stabilise itself and prevented the building from collapsing. In 1272, to adjust the lean of the building, when construction resumed, the upper floors were built with one side taller than the other. The seventh and final floor was added in 1319. By the time the building was completed, the lean was approximately 1 degree, or 80 cm (2.5 feet) from vertical. At its greatest, measured prior to 1990, the lean measured approximately 5.5 degrees. As at 2010, the lean was reduced to approximately 4 degrees.\nThe tower stands approximately 60 m high, and was built to accommodate a total of seven main bells, cast to the musical scale:\n\nL'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb)\nIl Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb)\nSan Ranieri, cast in 1719\u201321 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb)\nLa Terza, the first small bell, cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb)\nLa Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262 by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb)\nIl Vespruccio, the second small bell, cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb)\nDal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)There are 296 steps leading to the top of the tower.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Camposanto Monumentale ==\n\nThe Camposanto Monumentale (Monumental Cemetery), also known as Campo Santo or Camposanto Vecchio (Old Cemetery), is located at the northern edge of the square. This walled cemetery is said to have been built around a shipload of sacred soil from Calvary, brought back to Pisa from the Fourth Crusade by Ubaldo de' Lanfranchi, the archbishop of Pisa in the 12th century. This is where the name Campo Santo (Holy Field) originates.\nThe building itself dates from a century later and was erected over the earlier burial ground. The building of this huge, oblong Gothic cloister began in 1278 by the architect Giovanni di Simone. He died in 1284 when Pisa suffered a defeat in a naval battle of Meloria against the Genoans. The cemetery was only completed in 1464. The outer wall is composed of 43 blind arches. There are two doorways. The one on the right is crowned by a gracious Gothic tabernacle and contains the Virgin Mary with Child surrounded by four saints. It is the work from the second half of the 14th century by a follower of Giovanni Pisano. Most of the tombs are under the arcades, although a few are on the central lawn. The inner court is surrounded by elaborate round arches with slender mullions and plurilobed tracery.\nThe Camposanto Monumentale once contained a large collection of Roman sculptures and sarcophagi, but now there are only 84 remaining. The walls were once covered in frescoes, the first were applied in 1360, the last about three centuries later. The Stories of the Old Testament by Benozzo Gozzoli (c. 15th century) were situated in the north gallery, while the south arcade was famous for the Stories of the Genesis by Piero di Puccio (c. late 15th century). The most remarkable fresco is The Triumph of Death, a realistic work by Buonamico Buffalmacco. On 27 July 1944, incendiary bombs dropped by Allied aircraft set the roof of the building on fire and covered them in molten lead, all but destroying them. Since 1945, restoration works have been going on and now the Campo Santo has been brought back to its original state.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Ospedale Nuovo di Santo Spirito ==\n\nThe Ospedale Nuovo di Santo Spirito (New Hospital of Holy Spirit) is located on the southeast corner of the square. Built in 1257 by Giovanni di Simone over a preexisting smaller hospital, the function of this hospital was to help pilgrims, poor, sick people, and abandoned children by providing a shelter. The name of the hospital was later changed to Ospedale della Misericordia (Hospital of Mercy) or di Santa Chiara (Sant Claire), which was the name of the small church included in the complex.\nThe hospital exterior was constructed with brick walls with two-light windows in gothic style; the hospital interior was painted in two colours, black and white, to imitate the marble colours of the other buildings. In 1562, during the time when the Medici dominated the city, the hospital was restructured according to Florentine renaissance canons; all the doors and windows were modified with new rectangular ones encased in grey sandstone.\nToday, the building is no longer entirely a hospital. Since 1976, the middle part of the building contains the Sinopias Museum, where original drawings of the Campo Santo frescoes are kept.\n\n\n== Palazzo dell'Opera ==\nThe Opera Palace is a complex of houses in the north east corner of the square. They have been built in different periods, with the main building dating back to at least the 14th century and the latest to the 19th century.\nOriginally these houses belonged to the workmen of the cathedral complex: the tailor, the gardener, the bell ringers, etc., until the 19th century when the administration offices of the Opera della Primaziale were moved in. In the same years the chapter house was also moved inside the complex. In the course of time the complex was rearranged several times but the fa\u00e7ade of the main building still conserves its original aspect.\nIn the first years of the 21st century the administration offices and the chapter moved again to a nearby palace close to the archbishopric. Only a few rooms on the ground floor are still used as offices for the surveillance and technical staff. After the move, the upper rooms were transformed in a platform for temporary exhibitions (2014). This is the first time people can actually visit those rooms.\nThe most interesting rooms open to the public are the President room, the Deputation room, the chapel and the Chapter room. Among the closed ones are the \"Loggetta\" room (with frescoes by Agostino Ghirlanda), the \"Scrittoio\" room (with a fresco by Il Sodoma), the \"Viola\" room and the technical room.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nAblaq\nArchitecture of cathedrals and great churches\nCathedrals in Italy\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\nPisa cathedral\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nTobino, Mario (1982).

          "I loved this place, God said \u201cbuild it big\u201d and thus it is written. Entrance fee was \u20ac18 this includes a walk up the Leaning Tower, it\u2019s big but not glamorous, easy on the eye and have a look at the lectern, it\u2019s towers over the flock.

          "Best attraction out of the square. It\u2019s free to enter if you buy any other ticket and we spent the most time in here looking round the architecture. My partner did have to put on a bright blue cover up as he had a vest one which was hilarious and absolutely made the holiday.",
          "Very impressive both inside and out. Free to enter but if not climbing the tower you need a timed ticket from the ticket office.",
          "It is what makes pizza what it is. The architecture and the total environment are so pleasant. Amazing amount of crowds show up early and late but you need to do this.",
          "Lovely cathedral, nice and cool inside, plenty of opportunity to take pictures, fabulous ceiling and alter, main bits all roped off so no one can photo bomb. Lots of history, look for the red granite column on the exterior, has a story behind it.",
          "We enjoyed viewing the outside and the inside of the Dumo was a quiet morning so did not have to queue to get in make sure you get a ticket even though it is free to look inside. Plenty to see with all the different chapels inside with lovely art work and a great gold ceiling.",
          "The cathedral is free to enter and we did not need a ticket. It is indeed big but not that impressive. No photos, hats or talking!! (Surprisingly so many people just ignore the signs\ud83e\udd28)",
          "When in pisa see the tower but don't forget the beautiful cathedral. It's free\ud83d\ude01. Just get ticket when get other tickets.",
          "Entry is free but you need a ticket form the building round the back in the Palazzo dell' Opera. There are signs. Free tickets are timed so you need to go there early as numbers are limited. If short of time, buy the free entry with one other entry (approx 5 Euros) and there are",
          "The Cathedral is an amazing building, very big inside with a large nave and very wide transepts. The highlights for me were the 14th century pulpit and the gold nave roof and painted dome. Entry to the Cathedral is free provided you have purchased a ticket for one of the other",
          "Wasn't sure about this before I got there. So glad we got the combo ticket and got to see the Beautiful Duomo.",
          "So glad I was able to visit this one of the most popular Italian destinations again in August. Although there\u2019re numerous tourists as expected, I noticed that all of the little shopping vendors had been evicted to the outside of the gates! So, it was much more pleasant to sight",
          "You get a free entry ticket for the cathedral when you buy any ticket for the complex monuments. Alternately, there are a few free tickets available for collection at the ticket counter. The cathedral is impressive from inside and is the only building I'd recommend visiting from",
          "This building was beautiful. If you forget to bring a shawl to cover your shoulders, they do supply capes to put on.",
          "The cathedral inside is beautiful and really amazing architecture. I had a ticket for the tower and this included the cathedral too. Only had to wait under 5 minutes for entry and this was around midday in the heat of summer! Would recommend visiting",
          "The Duomo forms part of the Piazza dei Miracoli. The exterior is white and coloured marble. It is dominated near the top by columns and arches, but had a variety of wonderful architecture. The interior has sculptures, paintings and a beautifully carved pulpit. The dome contains",
          "Duomo di Pisa was meant to be the main structure of the Piazza di Duomo, but its Leaning Tower had overshadowed everything else on that Plaza (including the Duomo). It is still worth visiting, but you are going to take far more pictures with the Tower rather than with the",
          "The dome is very beautiful and you can go inside for free, by booking the free tickets in the office in front of the building. We had to wait more than an hour, because the tickets are marked with a specific time of entrance, but it was worth it as the dome was very beautiful",
          "So much to see, so take your time. I only wish I knew more about the upper rooms they looked very impressive",
          "They are beautiful! Sleeveless shirts and shorts are not allowed. Amazing detail on both structures. You need to buy tickets for entrance. Try to buy them in advance as the lineup could be long. The acoustics are superb inside the baptistery. Every 15-30 minutes, there is",
          "The Pisa Cathedral (aka Cattedrale Metropolitana Primaziale di Santa Maria Assunta) was started in 1063 in an unique medieval Romanesque architecture style, which became know as Pisan Romanesque. The Piazza dei Miracoli and the Pisa Cathedral were constructed in celebration of",
          "the complete name of the Duomo di Pisa is Primatial Metropolitan Cathedral of the Assumtion of Mary ; construction began in 1063 and ended in 1092 and this monumental cathedral is built in Pisan Romanesque style rivaling with Saint Mark\u2019s Cathedral in Venice ; the cathedral",
          "All Duomo in Italy are impressive and this is no exception. Worth a visit if only to escape heat. An added bonus is it's free where all other surrounding buildings cost to enter.",
          "In the same square as the Tower of Pisa but a much older building, the Cathedral (Duomo) is worth a visit in its own right. The line to the Tower seemed to stretch 500 metres but there are hardly any tourists waiting to get into the Cathedral.",
          "The Cathedral is a must see. Really beautiful inside and out and I loved it. I visit Churches and Cathedrals wherever I go and this one is stunning and one of my favourites for sure. The architecture is amazing and the art too.",
          "Well worth a visit, the cathedral and the baptistry are both stunning inside and outside! Make a visit while waiting for the time slot for the leaning tower, if you have booked there (remember to do that first!)",
          "I absolutely love this place, not just the tower but the whole complex. We were just walking randomly towards the tower when it suddenly appeared into sight and the view of the whole piazza is breath-taking! Is fun to see everybody taking the classic picture of holding the tower",
          "For those who have never been, The Duomo (cathedral), Leaning Tower, and Baptistery are all in the same place called the Field of Miracles. So if you didn't realize it, you are going to get to see all three. While every one goes for the Tower, take time to appreciate this",
          "Pisa is not just about the Leaning Tower. You can also visit the Duomo (Cathedral). Body of San Ranieri is kept inside the Cathedral. Entry to the Cathedral is free, however you need to purchase a ticket to visit the rest of the sites.",
          "The Pisa Duomo is well underestimated by its bell tower - the world famous leaning tower. So, most visitors just pass it, heading to the leaning tower making selfies and all kind of poses pics. This Romanesque masterpiece in white marble occupies the central part of the Miracle",
          "Visiting the sights in Pisa can start to tot up. This cathedral is very beautiful and free to visit if you are on a budget. You must remember to collect tickets in advance at one of the the official ticket offices. The tickets are timed so you need to think ahead slightly.",
          "This cathedral is a nice escape from the humdrum of the Leaning Tower. Filled with very eye-catching art and stunning architecture, it is a lively place to sit, reflect and soak up the peaceful ambience.",
          "This is pretty much a typical Italian Church. They know how to do churches in Italy. Full of artwork, statues, and dead people relics. Lots to look at and no one stopped me taking photo's. I'm sure I didn't see anything saying I couldn't. Didn't use a flash. Easy to spend an",
          "I really enjoyed the trip to the Duomo. Joined a group of 5 with a very knowledgable guide who told really good historic stories of Pisa and the Duomo",
          "A beautiful church in a beautiful location. Worth going inside for a brief look. The art is wonderful, although it is a little dark.",
          "Exterior magical, interior too dark to appreciate. Too many cameras (not allowed) and noisy groups. One or two pieces exceptional.",
          "Founded in 1064, the Cathedral was built in 2 stages and completed untilthe last quarter of the XII Century. The fire in 1595 was devastating to the building and eventually great replacement plans for redecoration were finalized. Really a stunning structure for viewing both",
          "Just aa the rest if the buildings in the area this one is just as beautiful as the rest. Stunning architecture and details, take a closer look at the large metal doors and their intricate artwork!",
          "We came to see the tower, but the Duomo was a nice addition as was the entire piazza. We were there at sunset, and I think the crowd may die down at that time.",
          "At the piazza del duomo everything is underplayed by the famous tower but this cathedral is an absolute check box for any traveller here. This was the biggest attraction of the area excluding the tower of course. And we did encounter a minor line but nothing much compared what",
          "Pisa is full of wonderful buildings, though for many tourists the leaning tower is all there is. That\u2019s a big shame. This cathedral is beautiful, and slightly understated for all that. It\u2019s very well worth the short time it takes to walk round and admire its majesty, and take",
          "Beautiful cathedral, virtually empty (free entry), as most tourists were interested in the leaning tower only. Well worth seeing",
          "This church is beautiful inside as well as outside. Although the whole area is busy with tourists you can enjoy the church as it does not feel busy.",
          "The oldest one in between the three famous buildings on the Piazza dei Miracoli, already pushing the one thousand years of age. The Pisan Romanesque style church achieved its present appearance after several enlarging and restorations. Unfortunately- Or fortunately? -The Duomo",
          "Standing in the Square of Miracles just a short walk form The Tower of Pisa. Built almost 900 years ago, 1152, it looks in great shape. Built with a flair of the orient it is dedicated to St John The Baptist. And a surprise, this building leans a little bit too!",
          "I am so happy we plans to visit Pisa. The whole Italy seems to be the landmark where architecture, history and culture come together.",
          "the entry is free if you buy a ticket for any of the orher buildings or if you pick the ticket up at the museum. we were disappointed by how restricted the area was the one could actually visit. even though the staff try to stop misbehaving tourists (loud chinese phone calls",
          "Wow!! Well worth a visit! We were on a tour group so didn't go inside. Heaps of people everywhere but lots of places to still take amazing photos. Just amazing!",
          "you can't miss this, it adds to the whole experience of viewing the leaning tower. Beautifully restored and maintained",
          "While visiting the Piaza, we visited the Duomo. Having bought tickets to the Baptistero and the Camposanto, the entrance (without specific hour) is included; you enter when you want (a plus). The Duomo has nice decor and is surprisingly pleasant to visit. Since you have to book",
          "This is in the same complex as the Leaning Tower, and has a lot of history behind it. It's quite impressive",
          "Beautiful place, well worth a visit. Be prepared for large crowds of people but enjoy the experience.",
          "Incredible architecture for this Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, the Duomo. We visited as part of our Pisa tour. Saw the Leaning Tower, Cathetral, Baptistery, and Camposanto.",
          "Fortunately this was included in my pass or I would've been upset at the cost. It was a let down and I spent maybe 15 minutes inside looking around. Not much to see inside but the outside was beautiful.",
          "My wife and I loved the cathedral and nearby baptistery in Pisa. There are so many wonders of art, architecture and sculpture inside as well as the beautiful white stoned view outside - be sure to catch the sculpted rear bronze door. Lovers of Renaissance and Medieval art will",
          "The Leaning Tower is the attraction to see but the Duomo and the Basilica are even more beautiful. Make sure to take it in and use the shade provided by the large buildings to grab a snack or take a break from the Hot Italian Summer.",
          "Very quiet,dignified presence.The lawns are perfect for lying down after the long walk.The tickets are available nearby the tourism office. A must do .",
          "It was so amazing to see Pisa Tower. Many tourists had fun by taking pictures Pisa Tower in the background. Also, it was so nice to enjoy sunset there!",
          "It is absolutely beautiful, and, also, for free! You need to get your free tickets in one of the tickets offices around the Piazza ( I guess, so you buy a ticket for the other monuments).",
          "The Romanesque style, repetitive. The arches inside are inspired from the Moorish style. The pulpit, made by Govanni Pisano, is beautiful.",
          "The Duomo, the 1st building in the complex, was constructed starting in 1064 and sits in the middle of Piazza dei Miricoli. It was consecrated in 1118. The interior is configured in the Latin cross design with a large central nave and 2 aisles on either side. It has a 17th",
          "Wow. This is selfie heaven. If you are not taking selfies what are you doing here!? The tower is beautiful and fascinating. However, the visit is dominated by people taking photographs. Selfie sticks everywhere. It is very difficult to appreciate the beauty of the space because",
          "Absolutely stunning external architecture. Inside is cool and peaceful, with beautiful artwork. Well worth a visit.",
          "Tickets at the close by tourist office, reasonable entry price. Stunning exterior and interior. The architecture and decoration is amazing. A must see.",
          "Everyone always focuses on the Leaning Tower (which is also wonderful to see!), but the Duomo is a beautiful site to behold. I recommend going with a guide or getting an audio guide so you can learn about the rich history of this beautiful structure.",
          "Outstanding visual beauty of trilogy of buildings. All 3 monumental buildings compliment each other.",
          "The beauty of the Duomo rivals those in Milan, Venice and Florence. Started in the 11th century and finished in the 12th, it was one of the first churches to have the moorish horizontal striping. The huge brass entry doors have Romanesque panels depicting the life of Christ.",
          "Staggering amount of pictures and other art work inside this magnificent building probably why they feel it necessary to provide a guide in multiple languages to the christian interpretation of the building which is a bit demeaning.",
          "It was hot and my kid was tired. We just stopped there and he ate and rested. I did not go inside. The building from outside is still impressive.",
          "Not only good sights but you can find hidden carvings on outside of buildings. Story is a lot of materials used came from destroyed temples and repurposed.",
          "Before we saw the tower we stopped to visit this beautiful building. There are no words to describe it on the inside. Well worth the visit to see both.",
          "We had a local guide take us through the Duomo and Baptistry. His knowledge of history in a clear concise tutorial was entertaining and informative. This of course is why we all want to visit Pisa. We want to see the bell tower, climb its stairs or hold it up in a selfie.",
          "Free access, but you still need to get a ticket. A crowd control and security measure, no doubt. Unlike the adjacent Leaning Tower, that attracts tourists, Cathedral and Museums seemed empty",
          "Offcourse we liked the Pisa tower and the Duomo but we were only there for one day and that actualy is enough. Its close to Florence so easy to combine by train!",
          "The Cathedral is definitely worth seeing. The queue is always long but when they open door it will be fast entry. The inside is amazing, with lot of history of art to see. Recommended.",
          "This comes as complimentary when bought with another attraction in the Miracoli complex. The Duomo was lovely - the gold ceiling particularly stunning.",
          "So the Duomo is included with the price of your ticket to the tower. It's quite pretty and a nice addition to your visit however I'd prioritise your visit to the tower. If time allows, then have a wander round the Duomo too.",
          "This duomo also carries a lot of history with it, located right next to the famous leaning tower. If you have time, be sure to check it out",
          "The only reason this was worth visiting is its proximity with the leaning tower. Focus on the tower. If you have time check this out.",
          "As we went to the square, we were enchated how beautiful the Duomo, unfortunately we didn't enter inside cause it was dark already but the exterior view was astonishing!",
          "We came to see the tower but were stunned by the Cathedral. Highly recommend a combo ticket for the Bapistry and Graveyard as you get unrestricted access to the Cathedral. You can get a free ticket but its at a specific time",
          "I was pleased to be able to enjoy this wonderful building. It was a busy day when we visited but we were able to really enjoy viewing it",
          "A must see so beautiful inside and out. You can get a pass to go in all the sites except the tower for \u20ac8 definitely worth it",
          "We were lucky that it was not too busy for our visit and there wass space and tiem to relax and enjoy this more. Worth the visit - definitely ! Its huge !",
          "The Duomo is so beautiful, with so much to soak up. Pay 2 Euro for the video/audio tour, it's beautiful.",
          "You have to pay to get in here, but we had bought a ticket for the tower so we could come in on that. It is very beautiful and I'm glad we went in. Wish we could have had more time in there. Spend some time in there if you can, it is worth it.",
          "This is probably obvious to everyone except us; in case it isn't, we made the mistake of coming here on a Sunday morning, during traditional Mass; we got in through the back, but had limited space to tour; still an amazingly spectacular Church!",
          "Beautiful old church with amazing art and sculptures inside. Multi language audio cassettes are available for a self guided tour.",
          "You get in here for free if you pay to go up the leaning tower. What a wonderful place this is. Probably my favourite Duomo in Tuscany. Really worth the effort.",
          "to describe the arts the opulence and the glory of Pisa. along with the leaning tower is a must see when in Italy. enjoy the art and the hospitality of Italy under the Tuscany sun.5 stars",
          "Beautiful with the details of the carvings on its walls,it complements the Leaning Tower.As the weather was brilliant we chose not to go inside.As for the tower,crowds all around.",
          "Absolutely stunning inside and out! Free entry with a ticket for any of the other attractions in the square (Tower, Cemetery, Baptistry). One side of the outside was under renovations but you can still get fantastic pictures without the scaffolding in, and all of the inside is",
          "Buy your ticket at the Tourist office for just an extra Euro coin to avoid the queue. Beautiful cathedral and paintings, statues, arches and organ.",
          "After we went up the tower, we visited here and really glad we did. It was beautiful inside, and outside,",
          "well maintained and ultra protected site . keep off the grass signs all over , used by tourists to stand on , getting shots of the leaning tower , masses of people , very clean site ,,,, drop litter get shot .... ( all those guns make me nervous ) but they keep me safe ...",
          "Very beautiful cathedral. Gorgeous mosaic over the alter. Definitely go inside when visiting the Tower",
          "You must visit this whilst you are at the leaning tower it is so impressive inside it Takes your breathe away Amazing place",
          "Visited the Duomo di Pisa whilst visiting the tower, its a beautiful building and sit opposite the tower. Well worth the visit.",
          "Free entry included on the Tower and Baptistry tickets. It would be a shame to come to Pisa and not visit all 3 outstanding examples of medieval architecture.",
          "With 8 euros you can see this building and other 3 others. Is very worth it just for this building alone. Is amazing once you get inside. You will find the lamp at the center of the nave is called Galileo's lamp, there is a legend saying that the great scientist formulated his",
          "In my opinion it is more beautifully made tower than the Leaning tower of Pisa, but is very much understated and lesser photographed. Sadly people Come to visit and have photographs with leaning tower only.",
          "We took a tour, and always like tours for the in-depth information and cool facts they provide, that we would otherwise miss. This was more impressive than the leaning tower. There is a bathroom, long lines, and you have to pay.",
          "Duomo di Pisa is next to The Leaning Tower of Pisa. The church is very amazing from Inside and there are lot of stories about this place. Famous among students.",
          "The Leaning Tower gets all the attention, but this cathedral is astonishing in its own right. Huge in scale, with an amazing panelled ceiling and some beautiful artwork to look at too. I\u2019m quite sure many tourists are blown away by it, perhaps because they just weren\u2019t",
          "The Cathedral has a special architecture and is worth visiting. Both inside and out. Inside has wonderful sculptures, paintings, chapels, etc.",
          "The cathedral is accessed from the back near the baptistry and you will need a ticket (either the \u20ac18 tower ticket, the \u20ac5 ticket or \u20ac1 if you buy with another building) to enter but once inside there's a few different things to note. The chocolate box coffins like over in the",
          "The Duomo is so much more impressive than expected. The interior is really beautiful. Amazing floor, amazing roof, impressive sculptures and glass.",
          "The scale and opulence of this cathedral is breathtaking. How they built structures like this nearly a 1,000 years ago is mind-boggling. The highlights are the pulpit and the ceilings.",
          "I've never seen anything like it and I travel a lot. The inside is really magnificent and magical, I didn't expect it to be this beautiful :)",
          "The cathedral of Pisa has it all - a fabulous mosaic in the altar area, a coffered ceiling, beautiful floor, Pisano sculpted pulpit, stained glass, and various altars with artwork. It is definitely worth getting the combination ticket to see it.",
          "The inside of the cathedral is terrific. The exquisite marble ambo is truly something to behold. One of my favorites ancient houses of worship in all of Italy.",
          "Entrance to this historic and interesting building was included on our pass. With outside temperatures above 30C this was a welcome shady stop. The exciting staircase within the walls up to the viewing platform, was an adventure in itself for the kids! The fantastic views from",
          "We were on a tour and visited the area late in the day. When we tried to enter they advised us about having to get a ticket. We would not have had enough time to get it and enter. We asked if we could just take a peak, and they absolutely refused. Exterior is wonderful to look",
          "I was surprised and delighted to discover that there were other historic structures connected with the world famous Leaning Tower and even more surprised that this Cathedral exceeded the Tower in impressiveness. Construction began in 1063 and was originally completed in 1180",
          "The Duomo di Pisa is worth the visit. You typically only hear about the leaning tower never about the Duomo.",
          "Free entry, you just need to get a pass from the ticket office. Stunning alternating black and white marble, pieces of art dating back to the 1200\u2019s. Don\u2019t skip this if you just come for the tower.",
          "Another historical beauty in the same area as leaning Pisa . You have to be there to believe the beauty and admire this attraction. Governor Amolak Rattan Kohli",
          "The exterior has very beautiful design and engravings. The beauty continues inside. The paintings, alter, carvings, and so much more must be seen as description of such would not do it justice.",
          "The impressive exterior of the Duomo is only surpassed by the beauty of the interior. I didn't have much time to spend as I had to get back to the train station, but I was amazed at the paintings, sculptures, ceilings and floors. The best part is it is free to go inside with",
          "We were impressed by the beautiful exterior of the Duomo, mostly made of white marble. (And interesting because some of it was apparently recycled from Roman stones, including tombstones with carvings still visible on them.) We were only able to spend about 10 minutes inside,",
          "Forget about leaning tower, instead go inside Duomo and you will be amazed by richness of arts and architecture, sculptures. This church is fully completed and has amazing interior , definitely worth seeing, it was nice surprise.",
          "Of course I know Duomo very well. Still, last week I had a visit from relatives. It is always beautiful and amazing. Stricking to see how Cordoba Mosque is at the heart of this unique Church. Also, visit is free but sometimes there is a crowd and you get a time slot: plan.",
          "One of the Best in this surroundings with all amenities, you can have some Relaxed Time their, highly Recommended",
          "This place is free to visit if you buy any of the other monuments. And it shouldn't be missed. The interior is overwhelming. The details are impressive, and the paintings are incredible. It is a very beautiful duomo,and shouldn't be skipped.",
          "Definitely my favourite from all the cathedrals we saw in Tuscany. Construction began in 1063 by the architect Buscheto. St. Mark's Basilica in Venice was being constructed at the same time and there is an evidence of rivalty between the two republics to see which would create",
          "Due to standing in line for the climb to the top of the Leaning Tower, I did not have much time to see the Duomo and I was very rushed trying to meet a departure deadline. What I was able to see was amazing, although I felt cheated that I didn't have time to enjoy this beautiful",
          "There is a 5E charge to get into the Duomo, but when you go in you can climb to the dome and there is a nice view of the basilica and the tower, making for a nice photo op.",
          "This is a nice Duomo inside out even though when we visited they were doing some works so we were not allowed to see everything.",
          "This Cathedral was built in the late 1090\u2019s, as creation for who can build the most beautiful and luxurious place of worship against the Venetians at that time. This 900 year old structure is a prime example of Pisan Romanesque style made with various colors of marble",
          "I think everything in the area leans. It was all built on bad ground and made of heavy marble. The walk around the basilica is a must.",
          "We walked around the outside of these buildings and looked at the details in the doors and statues. We opted not to go inside as it was too expensive for a family. I am not paying to go into a church.",
          "This is a very beautiful church, Duomo Cathedral. The exterior design looks so fake, just like wallpapers, it\u2019s amazing!",
          "The church is located right next to the leaning tower of Pisa. The building is good and the interior is also very impressive.",
          "We took a day-trip from Florence to Pisa to see the Leaning Tower, without knowing about the Duomo. As we learned the Leaning Tower is just the bell tower for the church. The church is much more interesting and impressive than the Leaning Tower. It's not as big or impressive as",
          "The Duomo di Pisa is extraordinary! Absolutely remarkable features and gorgeous details in the paintings, statues, and structure. You will be mesmerized by the incredible ceiling I have never seen one like it. Truly a must see. Regardless of time, the art work depicted from many",
          "You get a free ticket to enter this cathedral when you buy a ticket for the tower. Most people queue for the tower and climb it, but if you get a chance then go in this cathedral it is beautiful and lovely to be somewhere that is so quiet after battling with the crowds outside.",
          "Our 1st time visit this cathedral, you can enter for free with tickets that you must collect at their museum/office. Expecting great Italian art inside the cathedral. Please come with humble heart and peace in your heart and mind. Feel the presence and peaceful of God.",
          "Had a guide taking us around this Cathedral and what a fascinating place both historically and visually. Its part of the tower complex and is a must see and go in attraction.",
          "On our tour of Italy we have see many churches and this one was better than most. The art work internally is really stunning.",
          "A grand cathedral with beautiful interior. Has a few wonderful mosaics, of which I am a huge fan. It wasn't very crowded in end Oct so it was nice. You need a ticket to get in, but it is free. I got mine online in conjunction with the tower climb.",
          "You can get free entry but it is timed and there will be a wait. Buy an entry for the Miracoli and Baptistry and you get free admisiion at any time. This church was a revelation - i would rate it better than the Duomo in Florence and San Marco in Venice - best of all it wasn't",
          "A ticket to any other of the buildings in the Piazza will give you entry to the duomo as part of the package, otherwise you will have to queue to get a ticket to just the church (free entry on its own I believe). Definitely worth visiting if you are here -probably for the tower.",
          "The Duomo here is just a lovely place. TheLeaning Tower should not be the only attraction for your visit to Pisa.",
          "Truly magnificent Cathedral with some outstanding works of art hidden inside! The episcopal pulpit with lions figures is one of these Renaissance treasures. The entrance to the Duomo is free (just need to get a free ticket at the ticket office), so don\u2019t miss it for any reason.",
          "Lovely place would go here again. Don't forget to get a ticket from the ticket office for free to enter. Or you can use your pisa tower ticket.",
          "The grounds and garden outside is beautiful to spend time and relax in. The tickets are available for the museum and burial and other places to see. With kids it becomes difficult to explore more. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit.",
          "As part of your package buy admittance to the Duomo , museum, Baptistry and the burial area. Great visit, good things to see and do.",
          "The Duomo has undergone recent renovations and is really a beautiful site. The entry is free, however, you must have a timed ticket(available at ticket office behind tower) or if you purchase tickets to other buildings you can enter without a reservation. We bought a ticket",
          "Duomo of Pisa is a sign of power, I see in Italy so much history every step around historic part of city!",
          "A great pilgrimage site! Besides the famous leaning bell tower, the Cathedral and Baptistry show forth a long history of Catholic Faith. Great visually and spiritually. The grand scale shows forth a time when Pisa was a major sea power and wealthy. It shows how much it\u2019s",
          "The entry is free but a ticket must be obtained to enter but must have time to enter. From the outside the doors and dome is amazing. One has to plan a dull day to get time to go inside or else just appreciate from the outside",
          "This cathedral is not particularly remarkable apart from the West End which can clearly be seen to have sunk. They clearly have a bit of a subsidence problem across the whole site! The cathedral is large and was not overly busy when we went. Worth a look if the queues are",
          "This is a timed-entry site. Tickets are free, but you need to get them in the building off to the side. Totally worth the visit.",
          "Can you give 6 stars? Absolutely breathtaking cathedral on the plaza with the learning tower Incredibly beautiful",
          "The masterful cathedral of Pisa was designed by the great architect Buschetto in a recognizable Pisan Romanesque style in the 11th century. The huge building is about one hundred meters long and over fifty meters high and its marvelous facade is one of the most imposing",
          "Very close to the tower and well worth a visit, nice and cool on the inside if its hot outside.Amazing scenes inside.",
          "Looking at the Duomo and trying to fix the best selfie, like any others of the mass of tourists, you are trying to figure out why the Duomo is not fallen. All tourist are asking this question, when you find an acceptable solution you can start admiring this beautiful",
          "We aren\u2019t fans of going into EVERY church in Italy. We did go into this as it was included in our ticket price. If you like churches this one has everything you\u2019d expect, huge paintings, a dome, massive pulpit( feel sorry for the poor lions holding it up\ud83d\ude09). It also has a mummy",
          "This Duomo was simply amazing inside (even liked it more than the one in Florence). The details on everything inside just kept making us say ohhhh and ahhhh. We were impressed with all the amazing architecture.",
          "This cathedral far surpassed our expectations. We both thought it more beautiful than the highly rated Duomo in Florence. You need a timed to ticker to enter but it's free. Definitely worth a visit",
          "We first visited as part of a walking tour. The doors by which you enter give a clue as to what you will find inside. It\u2019s huge and the ceiling is highly ornate, and the original pulpit is a riot of carving. I wasn\u2019t a massive fan of the tomb of St Ranieri but it\u2019s still worth",
          "Quite a simple Duomo, the outside looks amazing but as soon as you enter inside there is nothing impressive to see there.",
          "We entered the Duomo with a guide on a walking tour. It is such a beautiful and historic building from a time when Pisa was powerful. I loved all the different marbles used and the leaning tower adjacent.",
          "Most amazing interior - need to spend a fair time inside to take everything in.Dress code no hats etc",
          "It is absolutely incredible to view such a beautiful dome. Impressive architecture and so vast. The entire area is a wonder not to be missed should you be in Pisa or nearby.",
          "Was part of our Leaning Tower ticket so went in for a look - Pretty impressive. If there is a service, you can only walk in at the back (and supposed to stay quiet). We went back with the same ticket later when no service and got to walk around the whole thing.",
          "Hello, We were at this duomo with our son, it\u2019s very big and impressive. Inside the interior is very well preserved, with good acoustics. Go and visit it! Enjoy!",
          "The Cathedral of Pisa is very beautiful! Its architecture is very impressive. It is beautiful both inside and outside. The color \"gold\" predominates in the ceiling. It has precious details in every part of the cathedral: sacred images, paintings, stained glass... It is amazing.",
          "What a lovely basilica. Much better than the one in Florence which looked impressive from the outside but a major let down on the inside. This church is magnificent and well worth a visit.",
          "This amazing cathedral celebrating 900 years since it\u2019s official dedication is a church of inspiring beauty. You need a ticket to enter even though it\u2019s free. Don\u2019t miss it. Highest recommendation",
          "The ceiling the Medici installed was golden and outstanding with their symbol in the center of course. The striped Islamic marble abounds. Also, the chandelier\u2019s oscillations fascinated Galileo as a child.",
          "This Piazza houses 4 great treasures and this is one of them. This is a medieval Roman Catholic Cathedral. It doesn\u2019t matter what your religion when you enter you will want to genuflect out of respect. The church was completed in 1092. Inside is filled with multicolored marble",
          "Beautiful place to visit. Remember to book your tickets in advance or go for them when the office opens as it gets ever so busy.",
          "The building is really nice, the environtment is peaceful but of course with lots of tourists but there is a lawn which is really nice and well-kept. So you can sit down and enjoy your break in the middle of the day. The view is great, you can see the tower, the duomo, and the",
          "The outside of this place presents very well as it has been well maintained and is in pristine condition. But that doesn\u2019t prepare you for the striking beauty when you enter inside. The marble floors gleam under the pillars and archways all the way to the romanesque ceiling.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral, worth a visit. By the way it is quite large so allow a bit more than a quarter of an hour even if it is just to say \u201cI\u2019ve been there\u201d.",
          "Wasn\u2019t expecting this gem when we went to visit the tower. It is simply stunning. I could add the same photo that have been previously reviewed but it can\u2019t get better than actually going yourself and standing in that beautiful building",
          "This is a masterpiece! The exterior is impressive, but the interior (and its most interesting history) is truly amazing. The black and white marble, the bronze work, the gold leaf, the paintings depicting stories of the Old Testament and the life of Christ gives insight into",
          "After the kinda drabness of the rest of the town this fabulous complex made the journey worthwhile. enjoy",
          "If you want to see something that is stunning and beautiful you really need to see this cathedral, the detail is incredible and to be there in person is breathtaking, photos don\u2019t do it justice. It\u2019s something that you would have to see. Definitely recommend seeing this",
          "This is part of the Field of Miracles and it looks stunning from outside. But we did a mistake by pre booking the inside. There was nothing worth seeing. We just spent the time to rest our legs and sit in shade inside the building. I wouldn't recommend to go inside.",
          "Beautiful building inside and out, less queuing than for the Pisa tower and more to see, buy a package ticket for both and save time and money, recommended.",
          "Great pre reserved building they were celebrating 900 years of age.great spot to visit in Pisa.must see location",
          "Our first visit to Pisa and we booked all 5 of the attractions at the Duomo di Pisa all 5 are worth a visit and would recommend all of them they range from breathtaking views to solemnity. Lots of places to eat but check out a few before deciding.",
          "This is worth the entrance fee, feast your eyes on the Dumo facade before entering built of coloured sandstone. The pulpit by Pisano is a highlight as well as the marble floor.",
          "Seeing all these monumental places in one square is brilliant, really. The cathedral is free, as it should be. We sat in on a mass, that was special. After, you were allowed to walk around and take photos, it\u2019s really spectacular. The art of the marble floors, worth it alone to",
          "It is the centre of the Pisa complex though the tower is more touristically known because of its leaning but it is the tower of the duma but strangely separate",
          "This is within the same complex as the Leaning Tower. Its very interesting to see and learn of the history of this place. Don't miss the photo opportunities!",
          "The Duomo is a beautiful cathedral well worth a visit. Granted there are more impressive cathedrals but this one is really nice. Access is free I think but we had to show our combination ticket anyway.",
          "Simple design but still massive and inspiring. Dress appropriately or you will be asked to purchase a strange looking disposable poncho. A scarf over your shoulders will do. Lots of info inside plus you can watch people clean and preserve the fixtures.",
          "This place has a beautiful interior, white marbles, gold ceilings, paintings, stained glasses, mosaics, sculptures, you name it and this cathedral has it all. It's a beautiful place to go in Pisa. A day's trip is enough for this city.",
          "Hopefully our guide Katerina explained to us so many details about tower and churches making our tour a unique experience. There is only one spot that you can shoot the perfect illusion photo (holding the tower). Go around and find it. Dont stop walking.",
          "Go visit... It's a beautiful unexpected eclectic mixture of styles due to the group of builders that included among others, Moorish prisoners. It's unlike any Italian church I have ever visited.",
          "I have visited before but the ceiling paintings never fail to take my attention. Do sit and take a while to admire the decoration and calmness of this Cathedral. You do need a ticket in advance and these can be bought from the shop at the back of the green square with the",
          "Architecture, white marble, colonnial facades, paintings, gold ceiling, stained glass, mosaics, sculptures, you name it in this cathedral.. a place to visit to stay in awe",
          "love seeing this place have been going since 1968 and it never changes use to could walk right around the tower but its now only the top 2 floors still amazing",
          "We purchased a multi-attraction ticket on the official website before we left the UK and, although entry to the leaning tower is on a strictly timed basis, you're free to enter the Duomo (and the other attractions) at a time of your choice. On that basis, we left our Duomo visit",
          "Very beautifull example of Pisan arhitectural style, a romanesque basilica in white marble, is just unique. The interior is also very beautifull.",
          "It would be easy to pass by the Cathedral at Pisa and not bother going in. After all, you came for the leaning tower, right? But it\u2019s well worth taking the time go inside. It is filled with art treasures, including an incredible, highly sculpted pulpit. And there is a hidden",
          "Beautiful Duomo, that would be worth the visit even if it wasn't for the tower. You can get joint ticket whichis worthwhile. Some beautiful paintings inside, and the remains of San Ranieri on show.",
          "Entrance to this is free so definitely worth going inside if you are in Pisa. You need to cover your shoulders if you have a strappy dress or if the back of your dress is low or cut out (but they give you a paper poncho type thing to wear!)",
          "When you come to Pisa and see this you realize how small you actually are! almost a thousand years old, this beautiful cathedral is a must see for any tourist! This place left me speechless!!!",
          "Great white church, like you can find in almost each town in toscany. Its located next to the famous pisa tower",
          "Most people visit Pisa for the Tower but the Baptistry and Doumo are much less crowded and great places to cool down on a hot day. Dont forget to cover your shoulders otherwise you have to were a funny poncho.",
          "The heart of the piazza, the cathedral is more than 900 years old and has an elaborately carved pulpit.",
          "Make sure you visit the top of the tower - really impressive and fun to walk up the leaning tower :)",
          "Had it not been in the Square of Miracles, we might not have visited this church. However, you\u2019ll find that once at the Square, there\u2019s not much to do besides the Leaning of Tower and a few other buildings of interests so you\u2019ll find yourself visiting them. It is beautiful but",
          "You get spoiled with many of the finest cathedrals in the world in Italy. And if Pisa's isn't quite at that level, it's still excellent inside and out - and pleasantly free for a change. You can either go in free with a ticket for the tower or other campo dei miracoli",
          "We walked round the outside but didn\u2019t go in. It is impressive. You may as well look whilst there to see the tower as it\u2019s just next to it. Parts of it are still being cleaned which demonstrates the contrasting colours.",
          "A definitely must see if you\u2019re in Pisa, and so come to the tower. Unexpectedly lovely, overshadows the other attractions in the square of miracles. Take a shawl if you planning on having a scrappy dress or too on.",
          "Was really blown away by the beauty inside the Duomo. Such an interesting history. Be sure to check out the alter and pulpit which are very modern, and controversial! Galileo\u2019s inspiration for his work on gravity also came from here.... via a swinging pendulum on a huge",
          "Thanks a truly amazing building which you can't help but admire wether religious or not. Worth a visit!",
          "I really like this place. It is very interesting to hear about its history as well. I highly recommend it \ud83d\ude42",
          "It's worth spending time here. They limit access and so you are able to soak up the interior splendor without being rushed. And the architecture and art are just wonderful.",
          "It is quite special to experience the image what you always see on the news or on someone else's pics. Because we were a tourist, the typical pic with the tower shouldn't be missed.",
          "Our tour guide booked us ahead for our entry to the cathedral. The entrance is free but have to be on time otherwise our ticket will be forfieted. Inside is not crowded since per entry of visitors are in small batches. You can take pictures and be marveled with the ceiling and",
          "This unbelievable landmark is well worth a visit as is the leaning tower but there is not too much else about Pisa to see but still worth a visit",
          "This is one of the many beautiful churches in Italy and of a number of lovely buildings in this area. We didn't have time to go inside but am sure the inside is just as lovely.",
          "This cathedral is adjacent to a baptistry and a bell tower. The latter is better known as the leaning tower of Pisa. It's a nice cathedral but we couldn't go all the way in because there was a mass when we visited. Check out the lovely doors, though. Well worth a look.",
          "The leaning tower is certainly a sight to behold, but the cathedral is the real star here. Pisa itself is a bit of a disappointment (essentially an industrial city), but the old town and area immediately surrounding the cathedral is what you'd hope for. The decoration of the",
          "A very busy attraction but it is beautiful to visit. You need to get a ticket but it is free to enter.",
          "The Duomo is in line with the Leaning Tower and Baptistry. All are within about a 2 block area, making them easy to see.",
          "So I just wanted to visit the Cathedral but on reaching entrance was directed to the other side of the Field of Miracles to get a free ticket. Boiling hot but queued in ticket office to get the free ticket which was timed for 11.45 am. Bearing in mind there was no queue",
          "On entering the duomo we were given paper covers for our shoulders (we had forgotten to bring scarves). The duomo is ornate as you would expect from a Roman Catholic church. You may take photos inside.",
          "if you are in Pisa you need to visit this beautiful church and hire a guide to take a tour of this church.",
          "I went early season to Pisa, the attraction was busy but not overcrowded. The grounds are beautifully kept. The ticket office is in the customer service office opposite. They sell tickets on time slots about 30 at a time so, there is no pushing and shoving. Actually it's very",
          "Only went in as it was free with our ticket for going up the tower, and what a surprise! It is beautiful and far more ornate than expected. Worth walking around and it is cool in the July heat.",
          "Came for the tower, stayed for the Duomo. The Duomo was absolutely beautiful. We stopped in Pisa for the tower, but the Duomo absolutely is the show stealer.",
          "So Italy is full of beautiful Cathedral and this is one of them. Our family loves church history so we were fascinated.",
          "Located right next to the tower itself this stunning cathedral is beautiful from every angle inside and outside. To actually get inside the building which we did to kill time before climbing the tower and to get out the sun you have to get a ticket which is free. The queue was",
          "Worth a look inside. It's free though you need to book a time slot. Allow 20 mins to walk round. Very interesting though pretty busy.",
          "Make sure to cover up, they are not very helpful if you don't understand how to put the green material on. Basically, it was a bit day so we wore sleeveless tops, at the door, we were given green material, I put it on like a wrap and was practically scolded by the lady, who",
          "A beautiful, large cathedral that was started almost 1000 years ago, although the current appearance is due to centuries of additions and modifications. You'll need a timed ticket to enter but these are free from the ticket office. The interior, while a little less spectacular,",
          "It is a \"must see\", stunning building. Spacious, beautifully decorated and elegant. Although cathedral in Florence is more famous (purely because of dome size I think) this one is by far more interesting. Spend some time exploring details. Walls are covered with paintings. Entry",
          "I can never get tired of seeing beautiful buildings, luckily within the space of 100 metres you get two, the Duomo and the LeaningTower, doesn't get much better than this.",
          "It was a lot of people around the Leaning tower, but not too much. Great to see this monument, which is a must when in Pisa.",
          "One of the best cathedral in Italy. Not only from outside, but inside is full of white marble carvings, and a lot of valuable treasures. It is a must to visit.",
          "The cathedral is part of the piazza that also has the leaning tower of Pisa. It is actually the main building of the complex and is a beautiful historical marble building with intricate decorations inside of religious paintings, sculptures etc.",
          "If visiting the area make sure to come here and the Tower of Pisa, they are both musts for tourists in the area. It is a really nice cathedral and a lot to see inside there. It is free but you need a ticket from one of the other sites to get in.",
          "When we visited Pisa our chosen restaurant was closed so was the Opera del Duomo museum which I had wanted to visit and then to cap it all the ticket clerk told us the cathedral was closed too! As a result we had to walk round outside. The beauty of the building can also be",
          "The Duomo is almost overlooked by most people who are much more interested in the Leaning Tower. It is fairly typical looking on the outside but I was impressed by the gold leaf covered ceiling of the interior. Masses are held four times on Sundays and anyone can go, the first",
          "Fantastic cathedral, lots to see, around it. Did not have enough time to do it justice, will return agin in the near future to see.",
          "My family visited there on June 21. It\u2019s around 10 minuets walked from tourists car parking and drop off area. Also a part of Miracle Square at Pisa. It\u2019s located near Leaning Tower. It was great and 2nd time visit for me and my wife. But 1st visit for our daughter. It\u2019s really",
          "As most of the cathedrals in Italia it\u2019s quite big and looks great from outside, unfortunately there isn\u2019t much of interest in the inside. In any case I still think it\u2019s the best visit in Pisa and unexpectedly it\u2019s free. Almost any regular church in Firenze is more interesting",
          "The Duomo is next to Pisa tower, can enter together with the same Pisa ticket. It's not very big and not very crowded, still worth a visit.",
          "This building is wedding cake worthy. Almost doesnt look real. Clean and well maintained, also very safe.",
          "This duomo is within the confines of the walls surrounding the leaning tower of Pisa about 300-m from the tower. Its age is about the same as the leaning tower and resembles any cobstruction in Italy..",
          "Comparing to Domes in other cities this one is really small but still nice inside. Better to visit the Dome and the tower in morning hours to avoid the crowds of tourists.",
          "See my prior review with pictures but this is stunning. The most beautiful of all the cathedrals we visited while in Italy. A must see.",
          "The Duomo has a free standing bell tower. The famous Leaning Tower of Pisa. A beautiful structure in a pristine setting. Many tourist around but not exclusively crowded. A must visit venue while in Pisa",
          "If you are in Pisa anyway, you might as well go inside the Duomo. It's beautiful. And it doesn't take long to walk inside and look around.",
          "This is a great place to learn about the history of the people of Pisa, their architecture, and their beliefs. Inside lies the body of a really respectful person called San Ranieri. The Duomo di Pisa sits on the square of Miracles, right next to the bell tower(leaning tower of",
          "We booked tickets in advance. No logic with who enters when. When we came in a old guy started to shout at us in italian. I asked him politely in English what it was about.. he was very aggressive- waving arms in the air.. he told us to cover our shoulders. 3/4 had sleeveless",
          "As part of our visit of the Leaning Tower our entry ticket included access to the cathedral, and whilst it was open, we could only access the immediate entry area at the very back of the cathedral because it was Sunday and Mass was in session. Hence, nor were we allowed to take",
          "We did a day trip to Pisa and visited the Duomo, the architecture was stunning and the inside not to be sneezed at. With the rest of the sights worth going out of your way to get there.",
          "The Cathedral is not to be missed when visiting the Miracle of Squares that includes the leaning tower. This is such a beautiful medieval cathedral with its intricacies and nuances that include its bronze doors, granite and marble columns. Great effort has been made to preserve",
          "Whilst visiting Pisa do not ignore Duomo whilst focusing on the Bell tower. The exterior is currently being refurbished but the interior is very impressive.",
          "With so much to see, and so much to learn, a guided tour is well worth the expense. Book in advance and avoid the queues.",
          "Visited whilst on a cruise which stopped in Livorno - train journey approx 6\u20ac return per person and takes about 20mins. You can walk to Duomo square in about 20mins for Pisa train station. Stunning architecture and a great way to spend a relaxing hour strolling the grounds.",
          "Pisa is o lovely city, can get very busy in the season and it is advisable to get there early collect your timed ticket for the clime up the leaning tower a must when you are there. This is not the only thing to do as the Duomo is very interesting and on a hot day lovely to get",
          "Visit is free once you have a ticket from the ticket office. Need to cover shoulders however you are provided with a thin tabard if you aren\u2019t prepared. It really is a lovely place to visit. Inside you can light a candle and leave a donation in the boxes provided. Very",
          "this was pretty much the only nice thing in Pisa. the cathedral is nice and majestic. you can get a free entrance ticket in the ticket office (the only thing you don't have to pay for in Pisa).",
          "I visited the Pisa Duomo on a Sunday in June. The first thing that strikes you when you walk in to the square (also containing the leaning tower, baptistery and other buildings) is just how clean it is. The grass is like a perfect lawn and the buildings are shining with their",
          "There are a lot of reviews for this site but I have not seen one particularly for the Baptistery. It has some lovely stained glass but the acoustics in the place are amazing. While I was there a singer came out and sang. The place just lit up acoustically and she began to",
          "You need a timed ticket to get into the Cathedral so I recommend you get that first before spending lots of time taking photographs of the tower. The cathedral has a beautiful altar but for me the most amazing piece of architecture was the Pulpit by Pisano. It is simply amazing",
          "This is really pretty! The grounds are perfectly kept and the buildings are amazing works of art. It's worth the trip.",
          "An amazing medieval site beautifully maintained and organized. Yes it's touristy but totally justified. Don't miss it and Take your time",
          "Pisa's cathedral is in harmony with and as beautiful as the Leaning Tower. However the management is laughable. To get in, one must get a ticket (free) from the ticketing office. Each visitor is assigned a time slot and cannot enter the cathedral before that time, even if no one",
          "Didn\u2019t even realise what this was until we walked towards the tower. It\u2019s surrounded by lovely lawns and was very busy or so it seemed walking by. The building is right next to the leaning tower so it\u2019s 2 for the price of one with these attractions.",
          "No photo can really do justice to these majestic buildings in their serene setting with green lawns and enclosinf walls. The interior of the Duomo is sublime with its altar by Niccolo Pisano and the Baptistry offers a smaller, simpler version.",
          "I enter this church and get overwhelmed by the overall darkness, the richness of the decoration, the image of a God and a church \u2018out there\u2019 that compares and judges. This is the opposite of say, La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, and is far from the message of Jesus who was",
          "This is a marvel of architecture and construction, It dates to 1064 when construction commenced and was consecrated in 1118 but not completed until the later years of the century. The structure was largely destroyed by fire in 1595 and the present building is a mix of materials",
          "Very well decorated interior. Polychromy thorough out the building. Closes a bit earlier than other places in the clomplex.",
          "Amazing place . A must see . Beautiful and lots to do in the area . Bring your camera . Italy is beautiful go somewhere different every year . This time stayed in pisa and got the trains to Florence and lucca . Then did 2 trips Tuscany and islands . Seinna a good day to",
          "sadly didnt get and as visits are timed with free tickets but the outside is a marvel and the square even though full of tourists is beautiful",
          "The Duomo is a beautiful building and well worth a visit. It is actually free to get in and if you buy tickets for the other monuments then you can visit any time. If you just want to go in the Duomo you get a free timed entry ticket and these are limited by numbers.",
          "Italy is loaded with so many gorgeous buildings and so much history you may be on overload. This is just another to enjoy",
          "This is a brilliant place to visit. The art is spectacular check out the ceiling. Entry is fre with the other locations in Pisa",
          "Worth a visit if you have not been. Big crowds pretending to \"hold up\" the tower. I think this spot would be the main attraction in the city of Pisa. The duomo is pretty inside.",
          "The Duomo in Pisa is something you should not loose if you are close to the tower. It\u2019s a nice glance of the richness of the Italian churches, and it has some details of art and painting very interesting.",
          "Buy a pass for eight euros and visit four buildings on site. Worth every penny to see the amazing art and artefacts",
          "Leaning Tower of Pisa is actually the cathedral\u2019s Free standing bell tower. It\u2019s indeed a sight to behold. I bought the entry ticket inside and walked up the narrow marble staircases up to the top part where all the bells are. The view on top is very good. But I think the best",
          "The highlight of this church is the 14th century marble pulpit with 400 sculpted figures. During our visit, art restorers were working on the pulpit, though only half was covered so we could still examine this delicate work.",
          "I visited this site in a wheelchair. I was able to see all areas, although obviously not up any stairs to upper levels. There were sufficient ramps and disabled entrances, I was treated with total respect and kindness. The floor surface in the cemetery is, naturally, uneven",
          "A large church undergoing some interior renovation, but not impeding seeing the beauty of the church. Because of it's size it handles crowds reasonably well. The entire area surrounding the tower and church gets thousands of people daily. To get to the area you have to walk the",
          "A sight not to be missed! With a sprawling bed of freshly cut grass which would invite one to sit or lie down to.",
          "Our flight got cancelled and we had one extra day to spend in Tuscany and of course Pisa was #1choice. Very impressive cathedral and totally worths combining the visit with all the sightseeing\u2019s around. We got totally impressed by this place and we enjoyed our day. If you by a",
          "Entry to the cathedral came free with our ticket to the leaning tower, so we ventured in and have to say we were underwhelmed. Having visited many such buildings we felt this was a bit disappointing being rather dark. It's worth a look as it was free.",
          "Why wouldn't you see the inside? It's free and beautiful. Spent a few days in Pisa and there was never a line to get in or to get tickets.",
          "We have visited many cathedrals throughout Europe and to be fair, this was no better than any of the others. Nice to be able to sit down and reflect in the peace and quiet though. Still worth a visit.",
          "A big building just another typical Duomo / church with all of the usual inside, have seen far too many of these on this trip.",
          "Actually the Tower of Pisa is more beautiful because it is Leaning... I'm sure if it was just like the Duomo di pisa it would not be as beautiful.... Duomo di pizza has its own beauty and you cannot miss it if you go to see the Tower of Pisa because it is just next to it...",
          "The actual church inside is strikingly lovely! Some incredible works of art and the ceiling is gorgeous. The grounds of this area are nice and peaceful with people lying around on the grass and relaxing. The pick pockets are very bad in this area, and unfortunately Pisa seemed",
          "So glad we went inside! They have pocket guides in various languages at entrance to help you view, learn, understand the Cathedral and the religion. This is a beautiful cathedral with interesting background.",
          "I love this type of Cathedral. Clean..well preserved and surrounded by large green fields. Breath taking!!",
          "Very impressive and beautiful place. Just walk around and you will be amazed. From any angle you will love it, and you won't stop taking pictures.",
          "a walk around the area and a sit on the grass second time in 11 years how lucky - to people watch very crowded busy day and beautiful skies to make it amazing",
          "Most people come to see the leaning tower and the bonus is the see the Pisa Cathedral as well. This is a medieval Roman Catholiccathedral dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, in the Piazza dei Miracoli. It is a notable example of Romanesque architecture. It is the",
          "Taking a walk in the city is just enough to be satisfied. The beautiful old houses with the great Italian architect and the variety of colors was a sightseeing by them self. The famous piazza del duomo with Pisa leaning tower was a really crowded place , my opinion is to visited",
          "Architecture is amazing, also appears to be sinking as well, follow the stripes...how utterly cool!!",
          "A wonderful cathedral with some stunning pieces of artwork. There was some restoration works going on so didn't see some of it, but didn't stop us from enjoying what was on show.",
          "The three major attractions are in the same locations ,but definitely pre-book whether online or through tour operators.It seems that the lines for booking tickets onsite are always long and since usually it is a day trip to Pisa you don\u2019t want to waste your time standing in a",
          "Large cathedral located next to the tower. When we visited, scaffolding surrounded the dome. It does not really detract from the overall effect of the building. Not as opulent as the Duomo down the road in Florence but still one that must be seen.",
          "You can go into the church for free , but you get your ticket far from the entrance,is silly being in the entrance , going for ticket and returning, so I do not waste time, I saw Florence doumo that was the best",
          "Pisa Cathedral or Duomo di Pisa costs EUR 5 to go in when there is no Mass service taking place or is free of charge to go in if you have a ticket for the Leaning Tower as well that costs EUR 18 for the tower and the cathedral.",
          "This building is very impressive from its architecture. Clean and well maintained, it is worth the stop.",
          "Mass was taking place in duomo so we were respectfully asked to stay at the back of the cathedral and not take any photos, but we were still very impressed with the architecture and decor. It was sad to think that so many seats in the church were vacant, but one was allowed to",
          "One of the most beautiful Duomo interiors in Italy for free...and so close to other iconic buildings also for free in a compact and relatively unspoiled city. What's not to like? A little tired but so would you be at this age",
          "Allow yourself time to visit this beautiful building and be wowed by the incredible architecture. It\u2019s free to get in when you buy a ticket for the Leaning Tower. You can only take small bags in.",
          "This was the best Duomo I have visited in Italy. Exceeded my expectations in every way. The ceilings are magnificent and everything else is of the highest order. Still free to visit but you must book a ticket in advance.",
          "Stunning ceilings are worth a visit. Just pick up the free ticket from the official collection point with unlimited entry time. We visited in the Easter holidays and although there were queues for the Leaning Tower we literally walked straight in to the cathedral.",
          "We could only mange to view from outside, just magnificent place. Wish we had allowed enough time.Combine Pisa tower and Dome. Walk around to feel the place.",
          "Would start by saying if a guided tour is available, definitely take. Took the stairs all the way to the top of the dome. Cannot do without guide. Such beauty and rich with history.",
          "We spend 40 minutes in Pisa just to see the square and that was perfect. Make sure you walk around, don't just focus on the leaning tower, because the other two buildings are nice as well.",
          "Nothing special, needs a lot of maintenance, not worth the visit on its own. Pisa tower is in better shape. .",
          "Th Duomo is never talked about. Everyone always talks about the tower, but they neglect the rest of the beautiful sites nearby. This is just as beautiful!",
          "Located on The Field of Dreams between the Leaning Tower and the Baptistry (the dome shaped building). The entrance is free at the far end of the Duomo from the tower. Inside it is beautiful and serene.",
          "Free to get in if you have a ticket for any other building in the square. The outside is spectacular and inside has plenty of grand frescoes and an amazing pulpit.",
          "This Duomo is in the same vicinity of the Leaning tower of Pisa. One can enjoy the tower as much as one can and then buy tickets to get inside the Duomo. We did not go inside as we had to take our train to Florence .",
          "Another place in Italy I had always wanted to see, and certainly did not disappoint. I always imagined the tower in a town on it's own, I had not realised it stood with two other magnificent buildings. A must see if you get a chance to visit!",
          "Beautiful church from the outside! Unfortunately you have to pay to enter, around \u20ac3 per person. It becomes quite pricey when you have to pay to enter ever church. Also important to note you have to pay around \u20ac0.50 to use a bathroom anywhere in Italy!",
          "Great place to have rest and to be calm with yourself. A lots of tourists but the place is huge so you can always find your spot to enjoy in view.",
          "We did not go in but just walked around the plaza after climbing up the tower. We we're seeing lots of Duomos all over so didn't mind skipping the inside of this one.",
          "The most beautiful place I've ever seen. If you will go Pisa , you should see this place . And Pisa Tower",
          "The leaning tower is one thing - but the architecture on these are incredible. We came in the evening when it wasn't overly touristy and too many people around and it was brilliant. It allows you to take a real look at the buildings and what went into them. Incredible",
          "These domes are located adjacent to Leaning tower of Pisa. Inside there are huge murals and very captivating. The place is under renovation but worth a glimpse.",
          "Large cathedral that the leaning tower was built to accompany as its bell tower. This also is sinking slightly due the sandy ground it was built on. We peeped inside as mass was on so could not look all around unfortunately but what we did see was breath taking the detail is",
          "Not worth going inside, but very attractive from the outside. Worth walking round it and getting a shot with the tower and baptistery.",
          "We went there for a day trip and this place is well worth visiting. One day is more than enough for this place unless you want to do shopping or take train ride to another place.",
          "If you only want to go inside the cathedral it's free, just get your entrance tickets behind the cathedral by the leaning tower, architecture is great and it also has a bunch of art.",
          "The cathedral is between the tower and the baptistery with a beautiful marble facade. Although it is free you need a timed ticket to enter which can be obtained in combination with tickets for the other attractions in the 'campo dei miracoli'. Inside the Romanesque interior",
          "Like everything around the Tower the Duomo is awesome. While in there a lady sang a song which was awesome considering I know very little Italian.",
          "I have always heard of the leaning tower of Pisa, but I didn't know it was part of a beautiful threesome: Church, Baptistery, and Tower. The architecture is beautiful and worth the visit, even if there was no leaning tower. It was crowded, but easy to get around and no long",
          "The cathedral is part of the complex with the Leaning Tower. The cathedral is beautiful inside with extensive artwork and fine craftsmanship. It is the only building that is free to enter. There is a charge to enter the Leaning Tower and baptistery. Both of these were closed",
          "We had this entrance with the tower ticket, great to see although quite sparse but outside was very impressive!!",
          "This is our third trip to Pisa. The Duomo, a large cathedral is under complete renovation, so did not get in. But, considering its age and the surroundings a really impressive place.",
          "Although is the only free building in the area, a ticket to get in is needed. You are asked to select a time slot, I think that is a good idea specially at busy times. But in our case, we went in a winter raining day and we could enter before the time we previously selected.",
          "Just close to the Pisa tower is the Duomo in the same complex. A combined ticket can be booked for the pisa tower and the Battistero. Renovation works was going on during our visit.",
          "It is amazing, like on a picture. Peaceful and great lace for a walk and taking some time for yourself or to enjoy the nice weather in the summer with friends or family",
          "I didn't go in as the line for tickets was really long and I didn't have the time, but just being on the grounds was worth it.",
          "The architecture is incredible well worth at least a walk round like I did. I would have gone inside but I had my suitcase and as a result was not allowed in.",
          "Truthfully, we didn\u2019t visit the Duomo but the building is stunning to look from the outside. Everyone files into this area of Pisa principally for the Leaning Tower but the Duomo and the surrounding grounds is impressive to look at.",
          "A must see place to visit. It's one of those places you have always read about but seeing it in person is really special!",
          "It's one of the must stops when in Pisa , a great medieval Roman Catholic catherdal built in 1064 with an amazing greens all over",
          "The Cathedral of Pisa is part of the Piazza del Duomo where the baptistry and the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa are located. As part of our cruise, we were taken inside the cathedral. It is an interesting one because it has five naves instead of the usual three. Very beautiful",
          "Very high ceilings and full of frescoes and marble! The gothic marble pulpit was the best thing in the cathedral. Most ornate and detailed in its execution. Painted mosaic above high altar was semi concealed during our visit due to restoration work.",
          "Absolutely amazing. The interior is beautifully decorated with stone carvings and paintings, and due to the impressive size, it makes you admire and appreciate the skills of the people who build it a long time ago.",
          "Great view from the top.great architecturing and well preserved.the day that i went was some works on the left side of the church but still the view was amazing",
          "Went during the Christmas holidays : not a lot of tourists about. You can buy a combination ticket for all 4 monuments (cathedral is free if you buy any entrance tickets). You need not specify which monument you want to go in, just the number of places and as you enter a",
          "Well let's face it people dont go here to see the duomo. It's the tower. Or the Battistero. Honestly I also did not go in and see how it is inside.",
          "There isn't much to see inside, however, you get a really lovely view of the cathedral and tower in the background. Worth it just for that. It is apart of the square so you should see it. Just buy the multi-ticket that gets you into everything in the complex (minus the tower).",
          "The Cathedral is in the shape of the Cross if seen from the sky, as most were designed in the fashion during the Christian era of Italy. The craftsmanship is incredible. The building requires admission, and you can buy a timed ticket in the office along the open grass square.",
          "After we saw the leaning tower from many angles, we purchased tickets for the Cathedral and Baptistry. The ticket office is behind the leaning tower. The cathedral does not look that fancy from the outside, but it is very well decorated inside. It is certainly worth a look as",
          "Another beautiful part about visiting the tower, is this cathedral right next to it. We didn't venture inside as we had a plane to catch.",
          "It's really big...and ...well..you sort of wish you had time to find out about it - but you don't - so just look from the outside and snap a few shots - refocus on the tower. Maybe next time you will go inside. Maybe it's cool!",
          "Not the attraction that the tower is, but a beautiful building. Also leans but most people don't know it because of the tower's popularity.",
          "This has been on our places to visit for some time and we were not disappointed. The piazza area is free to explore and you can then choose to pay to enter the individual buildings or climb the leaning tower as you want. We recommend you visit the cathedral if nothing else as",
          "It's free entry .. beautiful architecture. Must visit.. the bronze doors are super intricate.. very pretty",
          "It's free, beautiful and definitely worth seeing. We spent around 15 minutes walking around inside and saw almost everything.",
          "This cathedral, which is in the same \"field,\" is well worth a visit after an easy walk from the train station. Despite the fact that there were many people in the church, the church is so large that it could not be called \"crowded.\" People are free to walk around and take the",
          "This is the cathedral that the famous tower is affiliated with and in my opinion this is the much more interesting structure. The interior is one of the most ornate that we saw in Tuscany and deserves some time to take it all in. This in my opinion is one of the best reasons to",
          "Very close to the Battistero and with a large grass area in the foreground, the Duomo is both impressive and beautiful. Sadly, however, another attraction that is very popular which means long queues",
          "Although there are many great buildings in Pisa that are special the Duomo, as well as being a great expression of the fantastic architectural of its time, it is also an expression of the power that Pisa had as a nation state at the time. Given that we are so used to the image",
          "Beautiful architecture. This place is located inside leaning tower of Pisa compound. Can be reached from station by bus or walk. Bus stop is right in front of the compound. After seeing feels like all buildings are tilted.",
          "Worth visiting. Wonderful inside and outside. There is a dress code and you need to collect your free ticket at the ticket office.",
          "What a lovely place, I really enjoyed viewing this area. We arrived as part of a day trip quite early so there were not great crowds to deal with. I can imagine that this area would get extremely crowded later in the day. The entry point is through a number of stalls so I",
          "If you like Italian things, grounds, buildings, gardens, location...then walking through this area will fill your needs.",
          "I am \"churched out\" after three weeks in Italy but didn't see one that wasn't worth the visit. This Dumo is Hugh-you can get times tickets to go inside. It has enormous doors that tell a s tory in and of themselves and a beautifully decorated pulpit",
          "This is one of the most beautiful sites in Italy. Truly impressive and a must see. I don't recommend staying overnight in Pisa.",
          "It was part of our trip to visit tower di pisa.. this is near to it. Didn't go inside.. saw this from outside .. this a big dome..",
          "Fantastic Cathederal great facade outside ,you can go inside it's free but you have to book a timeslot so get one when you get there from the ticket office.Well worth a visit",
          "Having already seen my share of glorious religious buildings and art in Italy, this building left me uninspired except for its amazingly decorative pulpit.",
          "Again, take your time exploring. Another beautiful Cathedral. You can purchase a pass for 8 euro that gives you access to mostly everything. Worth the price.",
          "What more can you say, Italy's Duomo's in every city all have something gorgeous and unique. The doors alone are enormous and beautiful The outside huge and imposing and the marble just amazing. How was all this even built. The crowds in the entire plaza are huge, with fans",
          "It is a lovely cathedral with beautiful mosaics and doors. Not as large as in the bigger cities, but worth seeing while in Pisa.",
          "This is a definate stop and can be for free at a certain time from the ticket office (go early in the morning)",
          "It is a beautiful done on the outer side but the inner side is plain and simple. You go in , climb to the first level for a view of the opposite cathedral.",
          "Very impressive white marble building right next to leaning tower which was its bell tower . Joint admission ticket worth it for all buildings except the tower . Don't miss the entrance doors on way in",
          "This is a great place it\u2019s big it\u2019s imposing its ornate its well decorated it\u2019s lovely inside and well worth wondering around!",
          "We were blown away by the beauty of this cathedral. The inside has amazing frescoes and mosaics. The sheer size of the columns and the incredible vaulted ceiling left us wandering how they were able to construct this church so many centuries ago.",
          "I know that the Tower of Pisa is the draw to this plaza. But once there, give yourself time to experience this Duomo. You do need a ticket but it is free. If in a group, your guide will take care of that for you. The ceiling is just beautiful and there is something to marvel at",
          "If you visit the cities and towns of Tuscany you will come across many marble-fronted cathedrals. Each one is unique but after awhile they all look the same. The Duomo di Pisa is the best!",
          "You should visit the Duomo and spare time in front of the marble pulpit made by Giovanni Pisano, it's really a masterpiece.",
          "I have to say that the Duomo in Pisa is absolutely amazing thiugh often neglected in favour if it's illustrious neighbour, the leaning tower. That is a pity if course because the Duomo is captivating and well worth a visit to the Piazza de Miracoli in its own right. Beautiful",
          "We visited with a guide on a ticket to also climb the leaning tower. I loved this cathedral..it\u2019s splendour and history and calm in every stone... I\u2019m very pleased I saw this beautiful place",
          "no queue in October 2017, we went in because it's part of the deal of being in Pisa, it's free and it's looks nice. OMG- I was captivated by the place. The ceiling is as good as anywhere else in the world (Hampton Court, Westminster Hall, York Minster etc) and I was very keen",
          "Entry is free if prepared to wait. Entry ticket comes with an allocated time and with hordes of visitors (avoid the cruisers!) the wait could be a long time. Quicker to pay for entry to e.g. the Batisterro which permits entry to Duomo with no time restriction.",
          "This cathedral is free when purchasing a ticket to see any of the other places in the Square of Miracles. The cathedral was under construction when we went to it but it was still a lovely walk around and very interesting to see the detail presented on the pictures and even on",
          "It's much more beautiful to see it, that Pisa tower. Very beautiful inside it shows you the beauty of Pisa town, and it's ancient history. Visiting is free if you buy any other ticket. I advise you to visit Baptistery - it's really great and has special window to make a photo of",
          "Well worth the visit. Entrance is free with a ticket that can be picked up at the Duomo ticket office- after entering the city gates, it's the large building on the right. I recommend taking along a good guidebook (Rick Steves) to learn more about what you are seeing while",
          "Note although free, you MUST have a ticket to enter- you get this free with any ticket to leaning tower or the other sites on Piazza dei Miracoli, or you can just get a free ticket from the ticket office It is a very well kept Italian cathedral, many paintings, statues etc. The",
          "This is really worth a visit. Looks fantastic from outside but when you enter it is so atmospheric. Large building made of stone / marble with much to see. The old pulpit is something special. Include in your tour of Pisa",
          "All three major buildings, the leaning tower, the Duomo and the baptistry, in the plaza of miracles are amazing outside. The church is free to get in to if you get a ticket for a particular time at the museum. It is very interesting inside, as well and worth the visit",
          "This is a pretty Cathedral and very easy to see. We can buy tickets ahead of time and was able to get right in and there weren't many crowds we went in late afternoon",
          "If you think your goal is the leaning tower, you will be greatly surprised that your visit is a package deal. If you ever see pictures of Pisa, one thinks that the tower is the only attraction. Not many know that the tower is the Bell Tower to the Duomo di Pisa, a magnificent",
          "It is a church-like building with lots of history inside. Once you enter it is not as big as it seems but there is a nice view when you go to the top. It is worth to visit once you are in the area",
          "The Cathedral forms part of the 'Piazza dei Miracoli', where you will also find the famous Leaning Tower. My wife and I visited the Cathedral after climbing the Leaning Tower. To say the Cathedral inside is absolutely beautiful, in our opinion, would be a vast understatement. A",
          "Peaceful, beautiful place, interesting artworks and decorations, worth a visit, exemplifies the simple beauty of Pisa",
          "This is a very busy tourist site. Plan to go early so you may find a parking place on the street otherwise plan to park and pay a fee. It is not a very far walk to get inside the wall if you have to pay to park. The cathedral is free but you still have to get a pass to enter",
          "Seem to be visiting a lot of Duomo's but this is yet another beautiful example and you should take a look when at Pisa.",
          "Absolutely amazing. This is a truly beautiful place and well worth booking beforehand. The ceiling alone is awesome and the ambience within is one of tranquility and peace. We had booked for after our visit to the tower and it was well worth it.",
          "the Cathedral on the inside is impressive, the endless columns that give a Masterful touch and the altar is a masterpiece, the frescoes are beautiful.The cathedral is evidence of the wealth possessed by the Republic of Pisa and it was dedicated to Santa Maria Assunta. Most see.",
          "As i had paid to enter the Tower and the Baptistery then you can go at any time, so do reserve via internet is worth it at the end....the Duomo is magnificent and glad it is being taking care, it will take another 2 or 3 years more, but that is another reason to return, and",
          "Lovely cathedral to wander around, with great artwork. The roof is fabulous. It's actually free to get in, so if you don't want to pay to get into any of the buildings, at least you can do this one. Just a quick note to the ladies, your shoulders have to be covered ( they",
          "I visited the Duomo as part of the combination ticket available to purchase. There wasn\u2019t a specific time slot to access the building, but entry is controlled to avoid over crowding. Once inside, the building is magnificent and you are allowed to take pictures with a flash. A",
          "We got the entrance to the Duomo included with our ticket for the Leaning Tower so didn't spend too long in the church but could appreciate the vast scale and beauty of the building. One thing that was a little disappointing was the lack of information inside and upcharges for",
          "Amazing 11th century architecture. Hard to image how advanced the Pisan's were. While they were building this my ancestors were fighting Vikings and waiting for the Norman conquest of 1066. I guess what they say about real estate is true; it's all location, location, location.",
          "If you go to the leaning tower you can't miss the Duomo in Pisa. It seems massively overshadowed because everyone comes to visit the tower but it's nice.",
          "Beautiful building inside. It was marred slightly by the renovations which were VERY loud but I can't complain as I'd rather it were looked after than left in ruin. Space to light a candle and very respectful",
          "Both the tower and duomo are in the same area, some tickets to leaning tower also include free entry to cathedral, but allow plenty of time. You are allowed 30 minutes up tower. Many tourists in the area but can easily get around. World famous place am glad I have visited .",
          "Beautiful , atmospheric but a bit too manic inside to actually pray. The Duomo closes for half an hour at 1 pm for a service but the doormen just closed the door and didn't explain if we could have gone in to attend it.",
          "This amazing building has quite a few magnificent works of art which are brilliant to gaze upon. The main work at the head of the altar was being worked on while we were there so unfortunately we were unable to enjoy it. The space is holy ground and the tourists were quiet and",
          "beautiful piece of architecture, needs weeks ahead booking to go on top of the tower. nothing much to see other pisa tower. We went ahead to visit sienna from pisa.",
          "We visited the Duomo which is free - however be aware the external and internal parts of the cathedral are under renovation. This in effect blights the photos you can take. For example the altar and rear of the nave are totally or partially screened.",
          "Stunning architecture. A wonderful experience that forms part of the whole leaning tower experience. The square of miracles is an amazing architectural feat.",
          "amazing like tower in Pisa.. another must see in Tuscany. There are always a lot of people, but this is not a problem. Must see in Italy",
          "This magnificent building is well worth a visit; if you're visiting the leaning tower of Pisa, make sure to include the cathedral.",
          "Great place to go for a few days. Was there in June.. Before all the others had their vacation. Nice food great wine",
          "Amazing location and a must see venue after the Tower with just as much style character and history to match the tower if not more set in wonderful surroundings",
          "We had to pay to enter this Cathedral. The lines were long but they moved quickly. It's hard to believe anyone could design and build a church like this 500 years ago. One of the more impressive churches we visited on our trip to Italy. They did allow you to take pictures",
          "Which is just as well if you go like us and go on a busy Saturday and find that the first available ticket for the Leaning Tower is not for 4 hours! The Duomo, or Cathedral, is simply stunning and amazingly free to enter (but you must book your entry at the ticket office) - we",
          "Free entry but you still need a ticket. Nice place to walk around while viewing the Leaning Tower of Pisa",

          "You will see this if you go to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Outside is cool, but inside is simply gorgeous. The church is still in use so be respectful inside. Be quiet and don't take selfies. It's a place of calm for worshippers. Such a stunning example of Italian art",
          "Like all of the churches spread throughout Italy, the interior and exterior is just amazing and worthwhile to see.",
          "We enjoyed spending time here and marvelling at the architecture and art on display. We were there longer than we anticipated, and ended up all wandering off to explore different areas and art that interested us, then comparing notes and viewing each other's finds.",
          "We went in on a baking hot day but it was thankfully cool inside. The buildings architecture is beautiful but here are some quirky geometries here and there from the outside. The inside is an impressive space with some fantastic artwork around. Not much in the way of history was",
          "We visited early in the morning which was great for viewing the outside of the buildings as there were only crowds at the entrance (taking photos of the Leaning Tower). Unfortunately that meant that we couldn't go inside as it didn't open until 10 a.m. At the back of the",
          "Not only the tower itself is why ppl come there but the whole complex is really inspiring. Very clean and taken care of. We were there in January, so there were not that much ppl as usually. Is it is on your way, totally worth going",
          "We visited in a large group and had been forewarned to be aware of young 15-21 ish girls, who both pick-pockets or snatch and run with bags, handing-off to others so if they are caught they have nothing on them, they are VERY well practised. The Police don't seem interested,",

          "Excellent cathedral currently undergoing some restoration work, although the work is fairly discrete and does not spoil the visit. Entry to the cathedral is included within the ticket for the Tower. We spent around 40 minutes wandering through the cathedral- we could easily",
          "Very cool place to see also. Although the tower gets most of the press, this place is very impressive also.",
          "Pictures can not truly show the beauty of this place. from the moment my eyes saw the Duomo I was mesmerized.",
          "A splendid Duomo to wander around the outside and then with your ticket for the tower go inside to marvel at the beauty of it, beware of the long queues to get in, especially if queuing in the sun and if the Duomo I holding a service, proper attire is required but well worth",

          "We visited this amazing cathedral whilst visiting Pisa. The inside was amazing. You have to cover your shoulders on entering. They will give you a paper like poncho to wear if you have not got the right clothing on. The acoustics were amazing and were demonstrated to us . This",
          "The building I quite something. The art o the walls inside will take your breath away. Be aware, you cannot go in when a service takes place. Just go for a coffee until the line of people has gone down."

Have a great day there and enjoy it.",

Renaissance really gave Italy grace and splendor in most of its buildings. \nTry not to picture yourself leaning on the tower from a distance!! Tough decision?",
          "Big area, lot of buildings to explore, other structures put the Pisa tower into a good perspective. Lot of space to move around and click photos. You can even get closer to Pisa tower without being interrupted by people there. However you cannot go into the grassy area since it's prohibited there.",

          "It's very well maintained tourist attraction.the church is beautiful and lesser photographed than the leaning Bell tower. The who complex is serene. Go early in the day for a better experience.",
          "Beautiful square \nA truly imposing magnificent building.\nTakes your breath away.\nIts such an iconic building which you associate with Florence .\nMany beautiful buildings to look at .\nLots of shops and cafes around.\nThere is a lot to see on Florence.",
          "So Grand and such stunning architecture, too busy (can barely take photos near buildings) and the church that was suppose to be free was not.",
          "So much artistic and architectural detail, you could never see all of it. So step back and think of the scale of human effort and planning it took to make.",
          "Absolutely Beautiful!   Wonderful and Educational History!  Highly recommend seeing!",
          "Very beautiful and impressive buildings, of course.\nActually, the tower is the least impressive, but very fun to have seen it.\n\nThe dome really blows your mind away.\nTake a few minutes to admire the construction.\n\nLots of the not so wanted tourists.. But what can you do..?\n\nDon't miss it if you are in Tuscany..",

          "A good fun place. Pity we no one was allowed in the grass.",
          "Be prepared for the journey up the stairs. Make sure to book ahead of time on their website for a time slot. Free to go up the Duomo but i believe you need to buy the ticket before you can go up there. The views are nice!",
          "The craftsmanship and time that the artists invested in creating these buildings is befuddling. Beautiful by day but well worth the mid-Summer night enchanting view. Whatever you do, don't miss out on the chant in the baptistry, it will reach you to the core of your soul.",
          "The area is beautiful and the tower is absolutely sparkly clean. But the amount of tourists and especially the street sellers outside the piazza is just ridiculous. Just visit the place to go see the tower, and leave. It's beautiful but doesn't really have much else to offer.",
          "Busy, bustling Piazza with famous Leaning Tower, museums, cathedral and tourist information centre. Beautifully preserved Piazza. Charges to visit most buildings except for cathedral for which you need a no fee ticket.",

          "This place is outstanding. Sunday mornings are best to beat the crowds.",
          "I swear the only thing holding to Leaning Tower up is bloody tourists. \n\nSigh it is beautiful, just very crowded and hard to enjoy in peace. Get there early. I mean sunrise if you want to enjoy it in your own time without getting jostled.",

          "Great place to spend a few hours taking photos and looking around. Best touristic attraction in Pisa",

          "Very beautiful place with so many tourists. Would recommend to visit in super early morning to avoid the traffic.",
          "Piazza del Duomo and Pisa Tower are right in the same area. Just be cautious, our tour guide warned us that there is a group of gypsies where they rob you. Police knows it and does not do anything about it. Be your own guard, use your \u2026",
          "Amazing place to visits and learn about the historic  stories  of the Place",
          "Definitely a place to go and see before you die.",
          "The angle of the tower and story of its construction is fascinating.  Seeing all the tourists in the 'keeping up the tower' pose is extremely amusing!",
          "Very beautiful and relaxing place. Landscape and atmosphere is glorious.",
          "Lucca is a nice town with an intact wall. We explored it on bikes and rode on the walls quickly (over an hour, but we did not stop to look in shops or at sights). Convenient with the bikes but should go early before the crowds make it difficult to ride in town.",
          "Stunning place. Takes your breath away. Duomo is beautiful inside and out, the tower looks unbelievable. The Baptistery is lovely and on the half hours a singer comes in and sings notes and the acoustics are amazing. Went 3 times. Not a \u2026",
          "Most loved place. Romantic, picturesque, beautiful..",
          "It's really a breath taking place and the best part is that you don't pay to see it. Only if you want to go in the leaning tower then you pay.",

          "Be aware of the Pickpocket, if someone sit next to you grab your bag, this is a very well know place, I was in the museum when a woman was opening someone bag, and when I scream she ran so fast, \nBut the people and polizia who work there \u2026",

          "This is a truly magnificent piazza. As good as any in the world.",
          "A beautiful and inviting place where everyone comes to enjoy food, music and the sights.  The architecture is quite magnificent and there is drinking water flowing freely.  Free water appears to be a rarety in Italy.",
          "Nice place to visit and take pictures.",
          "Perfect day, good crowds and very peaceful. If you wish to climb the bell tower book well in advance as there are limited visits per day.",
          "Magnificent place to see the almost a millenium year old tower. Be there early to avoid the crowd.",
          "Great Places to visit day and late evening. Best time to get into the tower as early as possible.",

          "When you get off the local bus and walk through the pedestrian shopping area  ..you wonder where its leading you. But when you walk through the arch  (located opposite McDonald's) the view is spectacular.  The imposing Cathedral, \u2026",
          "Nice small town, did not spend much time other than a guided tour. It is a small walk from the bus stop but the tour guy made us take a paid shuttle. One thing for sure, they are learning how to make money. May be because of economy?",
          "Wonderful, plenty of places to sit, but gets very crowded mid to late morning. Go to the back of the Cathedral for some 'quiet'.",
          "I'm going back again because I loved it.",

          "Pretty little town with some beautiful architecture with the tower of Pisa being the main attraction surrounded by thousands of tourists. Some lovely cafes and restaurants that are worth a stop for after taking in the piazza.",
          "Lots of construction going on (on most of the historical buildings) at the moment but still some lovely views of the buildings, lots of tourists at all times of day, and military, but if you're patient you can get a couple of snaps with only a handful of people.\nSome amazing architecture, and the paintings are just \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4f",
          "Incredible place.  Must climb the tower.  View is amazing.",
          "A great tourist trap. Plenty of vendors selling everything. Pay toilets on one end of the square. I'm glad I went u the Tower. If Ihad to go again, definitely go off season. The cathedral has great paintings on the walls not to be missed.",
          "The only attraction to the city of Pisa and definitely worth seeing the buildings here and walk around.",
          "An iconic part of Italy to visit. This time around we were here from a cruise ship so only had a couple of hours to explore. My wife had never been here before so that's one more thing of the \"to see\" list. It's a very busy area and the question are long so we did not go up the Tower.",
          "Coffee is the one you should taste it.... good!",
          "I thought it would be bigger and in more open space. The walls around are making it isolated and the grass makes it sterile. It made me feel like I was just looking at some chesspieces in the museum.",
          "Absolutely love this place, full of history and definitely a tick off my bucket list. Didn't pay to climb the stairs of the tower, as it was too expensive.",

          "Is just unique place!  You need to go there to see it. Highly recommend \ud83d\ude09",

          "a wonderful historical place \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
          "There is so much more here to see than I thought. One of, if not the best, highlights of our holiday.",
          "Wonderful place to visit in person and lived up to all the pictures I have seen of it in the past.",
          "Fantastic site but heaving with tourists as you might expect.",
          "Of course it is the leaning tower of Pisa but getting inside is expensive\nThe church is free but you have to book in advance and it has a nice park\nBut for the most part it is almost like just being there for a photo session\n\nIts beautiful but somehow it just wasnt my thing I guess",
          "Do not miss  visit this place while you are in Italy , easy to get there by train .\nMake sure to reserve the Pisa tower tour ticket a night before to skip waiting long time .\nThe nearby restaurants are amazing to have your lunch or dinner with variety of food menu and very reasonable prices .\nTake a bus from a Pisa central to the Torre",
          "I wonder how this structure is leaning. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit to see the structure. Building are so beautiful in white and a lawn. It\u2019s definitely one of the wonders of the world",

          "It's Pisa. It's amazing. Stunning buildings!",
          "It\u2019s cool to do once but never come back. This is the only thing to see in Pisa. So many tourists and no system of taking turns taking pictures. People can be so rude and inconsiderate thinking they are entitled to their time taking \u2026",
          "Get there early to purchase tickets for the dome and museums. Then go get a sandwich",
          "Must do. Be early in the morning to escape the crowd. You can book the the pisa tour ticket (official site) online and store it on your mobile. 9am is a good time",
          "Loved this site, very relaxing experience. Good site to spend the day, visit local shops and restaurants, even walk next to the river. I do not recommend spending more than a day here.",
          "Great place to visit if you're passing through Pisa on the train.\nI probably wouldn't stay in Pisa but definitely worth seeing the Piazza and tower if you're passing through.\nThis is a people watching delight.\nFind a spot to sit and watch \u2026",
          "OMG give yourself a lot of time to enjoy the day needs at least 3 hours plus. Hard walking around a trip back in time dont Easter money on the audio it takes to long to tell you what's what. Easy to get lost.",
          "A picture is definitely enough. Not worth visiting.",
          "Beautiful view of the Duomo while being able to shop for hand made and high dollar brands",
          "Big open space when compared to the city itself, however, as it is quite popular for the leaning tower, it is way to overcrowded at moments, making it not so impressive once arrive there. Overall, it is a nice square, nice to be seen in person, but is it that much worth?",
          "I like the Piazza del duomo building, but I don't like the garden beside the building, only the grass looks poorly maintained.",
          "Very well laid out plaza with abundant space for the crowds. Very well kept grounds with knowledgeable staff for any questions.  I issues with this or last visit two years ago.",

          "Very long queues,  craftsmanship of ancient artisans is breathtaking",
          "Very beautiful, so well kept and well worth the visit. Get your free tickets to enter the Cathedral/ Duomo from the ticket office inside the museum (the large door under the clock) early as entry is timed and you might have to wait a while to be let in. If you buy the all inclusive ticket you won't need to wait to go inside.",

          "Must visit in florence! Beautiful architecture!",
          "Worth a peek! Lots of narrow stairs to get to the top but it was pretty cool. You need to get tickets from the main ticket office in the square first so don't stand in line at the door just to have to turn around and go back for tickets!",

          "amazing place but with feet you have to walk",
          "Leaning tower of Pisa is the must see attraction for this city.   Make sure to use the photo OP for pics of friends showing you holding up the tower--everyone will be doing it.  Easy to get there on your own from cruise ports by using \u2026",

          "A very beautiful architectural complex.",
          "If you can disregard the throngs of selfie-taking-tourists (which is nearly impossible; just imagine a horde of mimes all attempting the same pose), the architectural masterpieces of Pisa are really quite stunning, and the Duomo such a contrast to the plain and plains landscape of the area.",
          "This is a wonderful site with many highly interesting and remarkable features. But please, don't come here just to shoot a funny picture of the leaning tower and maybe take the elevator to the top. The square has so much more to offer! \u2026",

          "Very nice. All 4 monuments are good. Go around the entire area and explore new angles. For going up, you need to be right on time. Also the stairs are narrow, you may feel cramped in small space. Clostrophobic people should take care. The \u2026",

          "Beautiful well kept area. Very busy with tourists but if you walk over from where everyone takes the cliche picture you get a quieter area. Nice restaurants close by.

          "Amazing but there is quite a walk to get here.",
          "The leaning tower of Pisa is nicer that I expected given previous suggestions from friends. The best time to visit is at the end of the day with fewer tourists. During the day it is packed with people trying to take a photo of them pretending to be holding the tower from falling.",

She also provided us with some history of the whole \"Square of Miracles\", the Baptistry, and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.",

          "Florence is a great place to visit, and the visual highlight is the cathedral, commonly know as the Duomo. The baptistry is worthy of a visit. Going to the top and seeing the cathedral will currently set you back 18 euros and likely 1 to 2 \u2026",

          "Only a short (\u20ac9) taxi ride from the station and worth it. You can leave luggage at the station in left luggage (at the left hand end of platform 1) for \u20ac5 a bag, but better to take it with you and then get a taxi from piazza del Duomo direct to the airport also for \u20ac9",
          "Attractive place. One place for all the monuments in PISA. Don't waste money in buying tickets to enter inside PISA tower ( my suggestion). Every place has entry ticket. You can get tickets for every monument there on time except PISA tower because entry in it is limited.",

          "very lovely place to take pictures",
          "This is a famous tourist spot and everyone loves it. The first thing which strikes is that the tower of Pisa is not really high. There are three structures - the tower, a church and a baptistery. All have excellent carvings. There are \u2026",

          "Very historic and love the architecture",
          "Pisa isn\u2019t just about the Leaning Tower. Most people have heard of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but most people have no idea of the context of the tower. It is actually just the bell tower for the Pisa Cathedral. The entire cathedral complex \u2026",
          "The plaza itself is breathtaking, but the street vendors swarming the streets on top of the tourist prices make this a very overrated stop on your Italian tour. \n\nKeep an eye on your pockets too.  Surrounding neighborhood is sketchy at best.",
          "Very nice place, Duomo is amazing. Let s have a look in Pise down town, the place is pleasant as well.",

          "Most impressive,a real buzz about this place",
          "Not bad it'd you are on the move and need a quick bite to eat. Prices are actually quite reasonable given its proximity to the leaning tower of Pisa. It's located at the fast end of the church and tower and there is a market here.",

          "You know what you're getting.  This is a perfectly acceptable Italian square. The leaning tower is, exactly what you've seen.    If you only have *one* trip to take to Italy, don't come to Pisa.  If you have a free day and can pop a train \u2026",
          "Great plaza, a must when visiting Pisa. The site is always quite busy. Impressive architecture on all 3 monuments. Do not walk in the grass as it\u2019s forbidden. It\u2019s a pedestrian area",
          "It's understandable many people want to visit.. but they made it one commercial money drain location.    It very sad and I think even disgraceful to ask constantly for money visiting \" the house of God \"  God is getting an attraction to make money.. shame on these people who in charge of this!!",

          "Still a wonderful, beautiful piazza. A feat of human endurance, architecture and just sheer beauty.",
          "Although seen on so many pictures, it is quite an experience to see it live. It looks like it leans much more than you would imagine. Be prepared to fight a crowd for a good angle.",
          "Beautiful square. The cathedral has exquisite architecture, but sadly no photos inside. The walls are available to walk on for a couple Euro. Plenty of decent places to eat in the area as well.",

          "Amazing places ! Just an hour by train from Florence and just 15-20 mins walk from station( or bus every 15 mins) Completely worth the time and money. The tower and cathedral are really nice and are must visit places. As all of these are in the same compound, its convinient.",
          "Although it was pretty amazing to see the Pisa Tower, which I had only seen and learned about in books, I am not giving this a full-rating because of the fact that there isn\u2019t much to do in Pisa or in the surrounding areas. The city seemed \u2026",

          "Nice to see.",
          "If you go to Italy, it's a must to stop here. One of Italy's iconic places.

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italian: Torre pendente di Pisa) or simply the Tower of Pisa (Torre di Pisa [\u02c8torre di \u02c8pi\u02d0za, - \u02c8pi\u02d0sa]) is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of an unstable foundation. The tower is situated behind the Pisa Cathedral and is the third-oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square (Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry.\nThe height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 metres (185.93 feet) on the high side. The width of the walls at the base is 2.44 m (8 ft 0.06 in). Its weight is estimated at 14,500 metric tons (16,000 short tons). The tower has 296 or 294 steps; the seventh floor has two fewer steps on the north-facing staircase.\nThe tower began to lean during construction in the 12th century, due to soft ground which could not properly support the structure's weight, and it worsened through the completion of construction in the 14th century. By 1990 the tilt had reached 5.5 degrees. The structure was stabilized by remedial work between 1993 and 2001, which reduced the tilt to 3.97 degrees.\n\n\n== Architect ==\nThere has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa. For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano, a well-known 12th-century resident artist of Pisa, known for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo. Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town. A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820, but this may be related to the bronze door in the fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595. A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.\n\n\n== Construction ==\nConstruction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. On 5 January 1172, Donna Berta di Bernardo, a widow and resident of the house of dell'Opera di Santa Maria, bequeathed sixty soldi to the Opera Campanilis petrarum Sancte Marie. The sum was then used toward the purchase of a few stones which still form the base of the bell tower. On 9 August 1173, the foundations of the tower were laid. Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on 14 August of the same year during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals. Nearly four centuries later Giorgio Vasari wrote: \"Guglielmo, according to what is being said, in the year 1174, together with sculptor Bonanno, laid the foundations of the bell tower of the cathedral in Pisa\".The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, as the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled. On 27 December 1233, the worker Benenato, son of Gerardo Bottici, oversaw the continuation of the tower's construction.On 23 February 1260, Guido Speziale, son of Giovanni Pisano, was elected to oversee the building of the tower. On 12 April 1264, the master builder Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto, and 23 workers went to the mountains close to Pisa to cut marble. The cut stones were given to Rainaldo Speziale, worker of St. Francesco. In 1272, construction resumed under Di Simone. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved. Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.The seventh floor was completed in 1319. The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the belfry with the Romanesque style of the tower. There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.\n\n\n== History following construction ==\nBetween 1589 and 1592, Galileo Galilei, who lived in Pisa at the time, is said to have dropped two cannonballs of different masses from the tower to demonstrate that their speed of descent was independent of their mass. The primary source for this is the biography Racconto istorico della vita di Galileo Galilei (Historical Account of the Life of Galileo Galilei), written by Galileo's pupil and secretary Vincenzo Viviani in 1654, but only published in 1717, long after his death. During World War II, the Allies suspected that the Germans were using the tower as an observation post. A U.S. Army sergeant sent to confirm the presence of German troops in the tower was impressed by the beauty of the cathedral and its campanile, and thus refrained from ordering an artillery strike, sparing it from destruction.Numerous efforts have been made to restore the tower to a vertical orientation or at least keep it from falling over. Most of these efforts failed; some worsened the tilt. On 27 February 1964, the government of Italy requested aid in preventing the tower from toppling. It was, however, considered important to retain the current tilt, due to the role that this element played in promoting the tourism industry of Pisa.A multinational task force of engineers, mathematicians, and historians gathered on the Azores islands to discuss stabilisation methods. It was found that the tilt was increasing in combination with the softer foundations on the lower side. Many methods were proposed to stabilise the tower, including the addition of 800 tonnes of lead counterweights to the raised end of the base as a temporary intervention.The tower and the neighbouring cathedral, baptistery, and cemetery are included in the Piazza del Duomo UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was declared in 1987.The tower was closed to the public on 7 January 1990, after more than two decades of stabilisation studies and spurred by the abrupt collapse of the Civic Tower of Pavia in 1989.  The bells were removed to relieve some weight and cables were cinched around the third level and anchored several hundred meters away. Apartments and houses in the path of a potential fall of the tower were vacated for safety. The selected method for preventing the collapse of the tower was to slightly reduce its tilt to a safer angle by soil removal 38 cubic metres (1,342 cubic feet) from underneath the raised end. The tower's tilt was reduced by 45 centimetres (17.7 inches), returning to its 1838 position. After a decade of corrective reconstruction and stabilization efforts, the tower was reopened to the public on 15 December 2001, and was declared stable for at least another 300 years. In total, 70 metric tons (77 short tons) of soil were removed.After a phase (1990\u20132001) of structural strengthening, the tower has been undergoing gradual surface restoration to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.\nIn May 2008, engineers announced that the tower had been stabilized such that it had stopped moving for the first time in its history. They stated that it would be stable for at least 200 years.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Surviving earthquakes ==\nAt least four strong earthquakes hit the region since 1280, but the apparently vulnerable Tower survived. The reason was not understood until a research group of 16 engineers investigated. The researchers concluded that the Tower was able to withstand the tremors because of dynamic soil-structure interaction (DSSI): the height and stiffness of the Tower together with the softness of the foundation soil influences the vibrational characteristics of the structure in such a way that the Tower does not resonate with earthquake ground motion. The same soft soil that caused the leaning and brought the Tower to the verge of collapse helped it survive.\n\n\n== Guinness World Records ==\nTwo German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen. Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees. In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the \"World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower\"; it has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower, but was deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.\n\n\n== Technical information ==\n\nElevation of Piazza del Duomo: about 2 metres (6 feet, DMS)\nHeight from the ground floor: 55.863 metres (183 ft 3.3 in), 8 stories\nHeight from the foundation floor: 58.36 m (191 ft 5.64 in)\nOuter diameter of base: 15.484 metres (50 ft 9.6 in)\nInner diameter of base: 7.368 metres (24 ft 2.1 in)\nAngle of slant: 3.97 degrees or 3.9 metres (12 ft 10 in) from the vertical\nWeight: 14,700 metric tons (16,200 short tons)\nThickness of walls at the base: 2.44 metres (8 ft 0 in)\nTotal number of bells: 7, tuned to musical scale, clockwise:1st bell: L'Assunta, cast in 1654 by Giovanni Pietro Orlandi, weight 3,620 kg (7,981 lb)\n2nd bell: Il Crocifisso, cast in 1572 by Vincenzo Possenti, weight 2,462 kg (5,428 lb)\n3rd bell: San Ranieri, cast in 1719\u20131721 by Giovanni Andrea Moreni, weight 1,448 kg (3,192 lb)\n4th bell: La Terza (1st small one), cast in 1473, weight 300 kg (661 lb)\n5th bell: La Pasquereccia or La Giustizia, cast in 1262 by Lotteringo, weight 1,014 kg (2,235 lb)\n6th bell: Il Vespruccio (2nd small one), cast in the 14th century and again in 1501 by Nicola di Jacopo, weight 1,000 kg (2,205 lb)\n7th bell: Dal Pozzo, cast in 1606 and again in 2004, weight 652 kg (1,437 lb)\nNumber of steps to the top: 296About the 5th bell: The name Pasquareccia comes from Easter, because it used to ring on Easter day. However, this bell is older than the bell-chamber itself, and comes from the tower Vergata in Palazzo Pretorio in Pisa, where it was called La Giustizia (The Justice). The bell was tolled to announce executions of criminals and traitors, including Count Ugolino in 1289. A new bell was installed in the bell tower at the end of the 18th century to replace the broken Pasquareccia.\n\nThe circular shape and great height of the campanile were unusual for their time, and the crowning belfry is stylistically distinct from the rest of the construction. This belfry incorporates a 14 cm (5.5 in) correction for the inclined axis below. The siting of the campanile within the Piazza del Duomo diverges from the axial alignment of the cathedral and baptistery of the Piazza del Duomo.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nLeaning Temple of Huma\nList of leaning towers\nLeaning Tower of Niles, a replica of the Tower of Pisa\nLeaning Tower of Zaragoza, was a famous European leaning tower\nGreat Mosque of al-Nuri (Mosul), an ancient leaning tower that stood until 2017; reconstruction efforts are currently underway\nRound tower (disambiguation), for other types of round towers\nThe Greyfriars Tower, the remains of a Franciscan monastery in King's Lynn, nicknamed \"The Leaning Tower of Lynn\"\nTorre delle Milizie, a tilting medieval tower in Rome\nTour de Pise, a rock dome in Antarctica, was named after this tower\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOpera della Primaziale Pisana\u2014official site (in English and Italian)\nPiazza dei Miracoli digital media archive (Creative Commons\u2013licensed photos, laser scans, panoramas), data from a University of Ferrara/CyArk research partnership, includes 3D scan data from Leaning Tower.\nLeaning Tower of Pisa at Structurae",
        "brit": "Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italian Torre Pendente di Pisa,  medieval structure in Pisa, Italy, that is famous for the settling of its foundations, which caused it to lean 5.5 degrees (about 15 feet [4.5 metres]) from the perpendicular in the late 20th century. Extensive work was subsequently done to straighten the tower, and its lean was ultimately reduced to less than 4.0 degrees.Pisa, Leaning Tower ofLeaning Tower of Pisa, Italy.\u00a9 CorbisClose-up of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italy.iStockphoto/ThinkstockLeaning Tower of Pisa (left) and the cathedral, Pisa, Italy.Photos.com/ThinkstockThe bell tower, begun in 1173 as the third and final structure of the city\u2019s cathedral complex, was designed to stand 185 feet (56 metres) high and was constructed of white marble. Three of its eight stories had been completed when the uneven settling of the building\u2019s foundations in the soft ground became noticeable. At that time, war broke out between the Italian city-states, and construction was halted for almost a century. This pause allowed the tower\u2019s foundation to settle and likely prevented its early collapse.Pisa, Leaning Tower ofBell chamber at the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italy.\u00a9 Ron Gatepain (A Britannica Publishing Partner)Giovanni di Simone, the engineer in charge when construction resumed, sought to compensate for the lean by making the new stories slightly taller on the short side, but the extra masonry caused the structure to sink still further. The project was plagued with interruptions, as engineers sought solutions to the leaning problem, but the tower was ultimately topped out in the 14th century. Twin spiral staircases lined the tower\u2019s interior, with 294 steps leading from the ground to the bell chamber (one staircase incorporates two additional steps to compensate for the tower\u2019s lean). Over the next four centuries the tower\u2019s seven bells were installed; the largest weighed more than 3,600 kg (nearly 8,000 pounds). By the early 20th century, however, the heavier bells were silenced, as it was believed that their movement could potentially worsen the tower\u2019s lean.The foundations have been strengthened by the injection of cement grout and various types of bracing and reinforcement, but in the late 20th century the structure was still subsiding, at the rate of 0.05 inch (1.2 mm) per year, and was in danger of collapse. In 1990 the tower was closed and all the bells silenced as engineers undertook a major straightening project. Earth was siphoned from underneath the foundations, decreasing the lean by 17 inches (44 cm) to 13.5 feet (4.1 metres); the work was completed in May 2001, and the structure was reopened to visitors. The tower continued to straighten without further excavation, until in May 2008 sensors showed that the motion had finally stopped, at a total improvement of 19 inches (48 cm). Engineers expected the tower to remain stable for at least 200 years.\r\nGet exclusive access to content from our 1768 First Edition with your subscription. \r\nSubscribe today\n ",

          "I was completely surprised that it wasn't somewhere on it's own. Every photo I saw as a kid the tower always looked like it was sitting on it's own somewhere. There is actually a baptistry and church right next to it. I also didn't realise that it was actually a bell tower.",
          "This is an amazing attraction, it is beautiful. I have heard of this tower since I was a little boy and I really enjoyed seeing it in person. As a bonus it is right next other interesting buildings and churches.",
          "Beautiful structure. It was worth the trip from Florence to Pisa (1 hour by train) to see the tower and the other structures around it. Nice stroll thru Pisa from the train station to the sights. A lot of people come to Pisa just to see this. Not sure what was more entertaining,",
          "Obviously if you\u2019re in Pisa, you\u2019ve come for the tower. It\u2019s a fine sight and certainly worth stopping by. I mostly wanted to warn other travelers that there are two ticket offices, with different prices. The office in the south part of the Field of Miracles (which is the one",
          "Take some time to just look at the intricate work that went into creating the tower, there's some much detail and it's survived history so well. Don't miss the church next door, which is free to visit, just make sure you get your ticket across the street first. We were there in",
          "The one iconic location that IS Italy. My Dad was there in 1945, so I was anxious to see it. We went with a Viking Tour group, had adequate time to visit and take pictures. The entire complex is quite interesting and the bell tower is only one of 3 buildings of interest. By",
          "The tower is definitely worth the stop, as it is by far a bucket list item for many people. The adjacent church is very underrated, as the tower seems to take all of the glory; but I would rate it higher. Lots of history in one stop if you're interested. One note of caution,",
          "An amazing place to visit and to see in real life, the grounds were immaculate and the climb to the top well worth it.",
          "We saw the tower as part of a tour abd arrived at night. The tower is truly spectacular at night. Together with the rest of the duomo and square it's quite stunning.",
          "Lives up to what you\u2019d expect, stunning architecture and a great historical site, we loved waking around and looking at the tower.",
          "The tower is fantastic it\u2019s a breathtaking that it leans on one side and still has not gone down. The cathedral is breathtaking beautiful. So are the museums.",
          "Crowded place. Takes an hour and a half from Florence. BTW, it\u2019s not any more in the list of 7 wonders of world. It\u2019s on the list of UNESCO heritage list.",
          "If you're staying in Florence and heading to San Gimignano or Cinque Terre calling into the Leaning Tower is a detour option which breaks up the driving and provides that essential holiday photo of you holding up the tower.",
          "I loved the trip to Pisa and the experience of seeing the leaning tower in the \u201cflesh\u201d. Recommend for everyone.",
          "So much fun knowing the history of Pisa and how it was finally secured from moving. Quite impressive engineering feat given how unstable the structure was.",
          "We toured the site with Andrea from Discovery Pisa...excellent, informative and very funny. Also, I had heard from others Pisa is not worth visiting. Completely blown away when we saw the square and the tower leaning. One of the highlights of our European holiday has been",
          "We visited Pisa to see the famous tower, and we weren\u2019t disappointed ! The tower is very very beautiful , must better than in pictures ! It costs 18 euros per person to climb it (300 steps) , but I think it worth it! Must visit while in Italy",
          "The leaning tower is a once in a lifetime place to visit We were informed that kids less than 8 years are not allowed to climb so we had seen it from down",
          "My flight got delayed and hence I missed the time slot that I booked for my family. The officers were adamant and dint allow though it\u2019s raining and there is no queue at all. It\u2019s huge money that I lost and I requested at least to allow one person given that it\u2019s not my fault",
          "Worth a visit for this phenomenal tower. Whilst the tix to climb to the top is at \u20ac18 per person, it is an experience climbing a tower that is slanted! General service level from the staff for the various tourist sites in Italy can be further improved on to make the overall",
          "Photos and overt artistic representation do not do it justice. Go and learn insight into the history of the place by yourself. It's quite something to climb to the top",
          "Well known landmark that didn\u2019t fail to deliver. If you don\u2019t mind the crowds of tourists that will inevitably be there, it\u2019s a must see landmark on any trip to Pisa.",
          "Let us not beat around the bush. This is why people come to Pisa, and it is worth the visit. The trek up the tower is very strange and I actually felt a bit of vertigo at first but once you get to the top it will be worth it.",
          "It is suggested in busy times that you book tickets online (at least 2 days in advance - in English and very very easy) from the offical Italian website who charge the same as the onsite ticket office. In early December we had booked tickets for two days later but were able to",
          "Probably everyone has seen a picture at one time or another but there's nothing like seeing it in person. We went as part of a tour group from a cruise we were on and had about 45 minutes for our visit. That's enough time to see, admire, and take some pictures but doesn't allow",
          "We enjoyed our trip. We had a almost-3 year old and she was hard to handle at times. Three of us climbed up, but we couldn\u2019t bring the baby up. We were able to check in our bags for free. All-in-all, a great trip!",
          "Simple advice.....5.15pm reservation, early December. No queues and we were the only ones climbing the 250+ steps to the top. In fact, we were the only ones at the top and could spend as much time as we wanted there. Great watching the sun set....beautiful views!",
          "It is just amazing to see how it holds with the tilt. Good for 1 time visit, but a must visit. We travelled from Rome by train on a day trip to Pisa, so did not have much time. Spent only 1.5 hours at the monument, but I think that was sufficient.",
          "This is a place you have to see! Yes it is full of tourists and we have all see lots of photos but it is on of those things you have to see in person. Sure there were the funny photos and the tourist trap stalls, but it is an unique experience.",
          "The undisputed symbol of the city, we all know why the Leaning Tower has it's name, but it's actually amazing to go and stand in its shadow and see just how much it leans - and marvel at what forces are keeping it up!",
          "We were staying in Florence and had flown into and out of Pisa. Less than 9euros single train ticket. So stopped here on our way to the airport. The Piazza is about 20 minute walk from the railway station, down streets that are not necessarily the nicest in the world. But once",
          "When seeing the Tower for the first time in person, it seems unreal but beautiful. My wife and another couple decided Not to join me,,,(chickens! LOL!!) After paying 18 Euros to climb the Tower, I went through a Security Check...Walking into the Tower of Pisa, I noticed the",
          "On our way to Florence we stop at Pisa to take photos of the leaning tower of Pisa. There were many tourist but still something that you want to do. Lovely sunny day.",
          "Been there done that. Apparently, it\u2019s quite out of the way. The crowd seems ok but you still gotta find your own spot to play with the funny shots. But glad we managed to put a tick off the bucketlist. One hour spent.",
          "It was an amazing thrill to travel to Pisa on a day trip from Florence and experience the town of Pisa. We took a train and it was about an hour each way at a cost of about 15 euros for two people each way. The tower and cathedral are absolutely beautiful. We were able to buy",
          "people say that the town of pisa is not very nice and there are a lot of immigrants hanging around the area trying to sell you stuff but when you see the leaning tower it takes your breath away well worth the trip.",
          "I did a walking tour of pisa with Bella Italia Tours. It was amazing - nice way to learn the history of Pisa, get some exercise and see the tower and cathedrals. I didn't go to the top of the tower but the square is beautiful, busy with tourists. It rained a bit during my visit",
          "I\u2019m not sure what to write about this iconic heritage site that hasn\u2019t already been written...suffice to say it\u2019s a must-see if you are in the area. All three of the historic buildings in the square gleam, their white marble facade shine against the blue Italian sky and the red",
          "Yes, most likely it's a one time visit, but still, it's worth seeing. We actually got great parking free of charge (on a Sunday) 100m from the entrance. The place was obviously crowded, people mostly searching for a perfect selfie, but overall you can enjoy the Cathedral and the",
          "The tower itself is real cool to see. The area itself is not very safe in my opinion. My wife had her phone stolen and street vendors harass you constantly. Overall I was happy to see it, but take caution in Pisa",
          "I don't know if they have recently cleaned the marble of it just looked better in real time than photos but I was impressed with the brightness of the marble (actually never new it was made of marble) IMPRESSIVE ..worth whatever it takes to get there to see it. We did not make",
          "In its anomalous, gravity defying stance lies its USP and the reason for being among the 7 wonders. Take the spiral staircase to the top because there isn't much else to see or do here apart from watching throngs of tourists pretending to lick, kiss, hug, kick, push or lean",
          "Who hasn't heard of the Leaning Tower of Pisa? No one. The experience is a little expensive, but you can climb it. Not too bad a climb although it gets pretty tight right at the top. The steps are well worn and smooth, so make sure you have good footwear and take your time.",
          "If you have time to drive to Pisa, it will be nice to visit it. Otherwise there is nothing except the leaning tower. I spend just half an hour to take piics...",
          "My husband and I visited Pisa in November 2019. We went from a Cruise Ship, but didn't bother with the Cruise trips which are very expensive. For anyone doing it we got the bus to the City Ctr, a local bus to the train station and caught the train to Pisa. Very doable and very",
          "Needless to say, it is the most popular attraction in Pisa and apart from that, you don\u2019t have much to see. Many people take the early morning train from Florence, Visit Pisa and come back by afternoon. It really is the most peculiar and impressive structure \u2013 how it is still",
          "We took the train 20-minutes to Pisa from Livorno; 2.60 euro each way per person. What a delightful surprise to be awed by this nearly 184\u2019-186\u2019 (depending on which side you are on) structure. One needs to pre-book timed-entry to climb the tower. We paid 18 euro each.",
          "Most amazing thing I have ever seen. Just breathtaking. Recommend walking to the top of the tower. Incredible view. All I can say.",
          "On our way from Florence to Milano , The leaning tower of Pisa is a must do stop It has easy access - only 5 minutes walk from the point we had to park our car The tower is really impressive and scary at the same time as it leaves you wondering how it\u2019s still standing The",
          "We enjoyed touring the piazza dei miracoli and walking around the leaning tower. The queue to enter the tower was so huge that we finally gave up the waiting and decided not to enter.",
          "The Leaning Tower of Pisa is another world renowned attraction that you got to check it on your must visit in a lifetime list. Come here to \"support\" the Tower!",
          "It was our first time , one day visit but not enough.... We purchased a ticket to visit the tower and the cathedral and it was perfect. We will come back for sure to visit around, so many things and history",
          "We were with a tour group and were fortunate that it was a clear, sunny day. The tower stood out in the sunshine. All the scaffolding that had been surrounding the tower for construction had just been removed allowing an unobstructed view of the tower. We also visited the",
          "A holiday well needed.We stayed at il hotel Giardino just few minutes away from the Tower.Beautifull Piazza di Cavallieri also must visit.Around 20 min by walk from Pisa train station to reach the Tower.Also around very good restairants .",
          "Lovely walk to the Tower an we stopped off for a drink on the way. Its free to see the tower, but it is charable to go up it.",
          "While contemplating all of the attractions in the astonishing area of Tuscany, one invariably thinks of the, leaning tower of Pisa but might reject a visit as simply a cliche. This would be a mistake since the tower has been beautifully restored along with the wonderful Duomo.",
          "Enjoyed going into this little town to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Nice shops and great tour guide off of Norwegian Epic Cruise. The little souvenir shops were good also. There were street folks trying to sell umbrellas and such, annoying but expect it.",
          "It really is as beautiful as it looks on photo\u2019s, the architecture is amazing! Also very funny to watch the tourists make all this stupid photo\u2019s with the tower. You can enjoy yourself the whole afternoon just sitting here!",
          "In few words, by marketing this smartly, people are realizing the money invested on this failed architecture. Agree, it is an iconic location and kind of a must see but all that is because of the publicity and nothing else.",
          "The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a true global icon and the highlight of any visit to Italy and an architectural landmark that everyone should try and visit once or twice in their lifetime. This was my second visit to the tower having previously visited 15 years ago as part of a",
          "I will never understand why people are happy to see something that was installed incorrectly or go to Europe.",
          "It is always exciting to see, in person, something that you have seen pictures of your whole life. A small percentage of visitors pay the admission to climb to the top. Most stand in the plaza taking selfies or, the obligatory photo of you, from a distance, appearing to be",
          "We traveled through suburbs and modern roads and stopped about 3 blocks away from the grounds. There is a tremendous amount of traffic and tourism all around. After you finally go through the ancient wall, you will go back in time to a place that is a garden surrounded by a",
          "Famous leaning tower! Been here twice. Last time by train and this time by car. The parking outside the wall is easy. Always crowded even in the winter. Many people left after seeing the tower, but the old town is worth visiting too! Very bubbly, and river side view is very nice",
          "Stopped in Pisa for an hour or so as part of a guided tour. Still crowded in October, but we were able to get some nice photos and enjoy some gelato. You don't need much time here unless you plan to climb the tower. There is a museum, restaurants and souvenir vendors near the",
          "Stopped in Pisa for about an hour with a private guide - we arrived before the daily crowds and were able to enjoy the area in relative peace and quiet. The downside is that we were too early for entry to anything, but our guide provided us with amazing history and",
          "Beautifully placed buildings in impressive piazza, and tower leans more than you would think. Worth booking to climb.",
          "I doubt many need to read a review of the tower\u2019s attraction but it is worth mentioning that even in November there are lots of visitors. Get there early if possible to avoid the organised parties. Buying a ticket on line is a bit of a lottery so I would suggest going to the",
          "Pisa is a fascinating place to visit. Although we went to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the complex is much more than that. It also includes the Field of Miracles, the Cathedral (Duomo) and the Baptistery. Adding to the stunning architecture of the magnificent buildings is a",
          "Not quite as impressive as other European landmarks. The space around is far too crowded, the walk up as you'd imagine full of tourist tat. Fridge magnets, cheap scarfs, hats and some of the worst designer fakes I have ever seen. Prepare to be saying no to a lot of people",
          "It's important to see the leaning tower, the Campo Santo, the duomo, the duomo museum. Lots of people hanging around having fun posing for interesting shots of the tower. Fun!",
          "We have family nearby and always take first timers to see the Campo, climb the Tower, and enjoy a snack nearby! A sunny day makes the white of the buildings absolutely spectacular... you gotta do it!",

          "It's cheesy but you have to get that iconic photo with the Leaning Tower! Be prepared to take other people's photos too! A stunning building with the unmistakeable lean. As with all famous attractions, be aware of the scammers and vendors in the streets around trying to make",
          "The Pisa tower is the only reason we visited Pisa and it is an amazing building, the church was great as well",
          "It's just cool to see! It has an interesting history too. Our teens loved taking silly photos with it. Make it one of your stops while visiting the area.",
          "The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a must see. It is better then all the photos posted on Instagram, and when there, be sure to get the iconic photo pretending to hold up the tower. 5 stars given for this stop for sure",
          "There\u2019s only one Leaning Tower of Pisa on the world and to have climbed it on my birthday was absolutely awesome! It costs \u20ac18 for a single ticket to get in. As I drove into the area that it was located in, I could see its head towering other local buildings which was amazing",
          "Tower of Pisa - leaning tower NOT A GREAT PLACE TO VISIT HIGHLY OVER RATED though we had visited in elate evening, the actual effect was not appreciable. Can definitely omit it The only beauty is to click pic in different poses from various sides",
          "The leaning tower of Pisa is a very unique attraction. The area of the tower is beautiful. It was very busy around the tower with everyone trying to get the standard picture of pinching the tower or holding it up. It was a worthwhile visit for a couple of hours.",
          "Splendid view and masterpiece.no other way to enjoy it but to know the history of Piazza dei Miracoli headed by our enthusiast tour guide.\ud83d\udc4dreaching the top of the Leaning Tower is such magnificent experience",
          "Even in October, this area was incredibly busy. We had pre-booked our tickets (I highly recommend doing this!), so our experience was very smooth. We dropped off our bag at the allotted place and queued up in our time slot. The numbers to go up the tower are limited, and I think",
          "Be prepared to line up and wait if you want to climb the tower. Otherwise, wander around at your leisure to explore the grounds that include the tower, the basilica and the baptistery. Don't forget to get your photo holding up the tower. Be aware of pick pockets and the",

The Square of Miracles (the location of the tower) includes several beautiful buildings and of course it has an interesting history. I recommend going if it is something you always thought",
          "Believe it or not, this towew is empty inside, I would like to experience the sound effect of the bells ringing! Two advices; Don\u00b4t walk on the lawns, the fines are heavy! And order your tickets in advance, And - finally - if you get hungry, eat at We love Pasta, five minutes",
          "Leaning tower and Duomo are next to each other. Crowded even in off season and a rainy day but still worth the visit",
          "Make sure you climb up to the top to see the amazing views. Viewing from the outside just isn't enough!",
          "If you are close enough to see Pisa then you must stop! It's a quaint area, not as much to offer as Rome or Florence, but well worth the stop. We stopped on our way through to go to Florence. Had a nice lunch, walked to the tower then caught the train later in the day. Everyone",
          "Pisa is just like all the pictures. Its a Tower and it is Leaning. I am very glad to have seen it, but the Duomo there is even more stunning and doesn't get as much press. This is not the easiest place to get to (if you are not on a tour). Parking is hopeless. There is quite",
          "Not so much to do in Pisa but it is good to visit for a short break if you are looking to spend some relaxed with your other half.",
          "I did not realize the leaning tower is the bell tower for the duomo right next to the tower. Entrance to the duomo is free. Free tickets to the duomo give a time of admission so all visitors can see and appreciate all that is on display. We chose not to climb the tower, so did",
          "We rode the train in from Florence that morning, then walked over to the tower site. It took us about 20 minutes, and 2 of our party had canes. It's incredible seeing the tower for the first time in person. It sounds ridiculous, but my first thought was, \"wow, it really leans!\"",
          "You really cant leave Italy without a photo of this. I didnt climb it but took some great photos of the tower and the duomo. Even in the rain, it was worth the trip!",
          "Absolutely fantastic reserved slot to the summit. Love it, just love it. The most stunning structure I\u2019ve had the privilege of climbing. I was in awe of the tower from all angles",
          "Took the train from Rome to La Spezia. On the way we just jumped off the train went took a basic picture of the tower. Then continued on our way. It is a must see, but no reason to spend too much time on Pisa.",

          "It was awesome! It is much better than the photos! Must visit place! The people are friendly though you need to be careful with the pickpockets! Nothing happened to us but still prevention is better than cure! Highly recommended! Thanks",
          "Recently visited the famous leaning tower. While the tower & monuments in the square are beautiful in themselves there is not much else to see in the square. We went on an organised tour from our cruise ship, which included Florence, but if you dock at Liverno you can actually",
          "It was worth the trip to visit Pisa. The Leaning Tower, Duomo, yard, and Baptistry are remarkable. And you can get the classic picture holding up the tower. Go early as the crowds get heavy.",
          "A must do especially if traveling with kids. Short trip from Florence. Excellent photo opportunity along with stunning cathedral baptistery and a cemetery all in the same complex.",
          "Visited the leaning tower and the cathedral. The tower was worth getting to the top even to view the surrounding grounds and to be at the top when the bells chimed! All belongings have to go into lockers which are situated opposite the leaning tower. Only cameras allowed. The",

          "This was fun to see in real life \u2014 it was a lot bigger than what I expected. It would have cost 18\u20ac to get up to the tower which we didn\u2019t do, it seemed to be kinda expensive. Many tourist shops around the square, everyone selling the same stuff but with a little different",
          "Our cruise ship docked in Liverno and we found little of interest there so we boarded a bus to Pisa. Our bus driver sang the Canadian anthem for us! When we arrived in Pisa we entered a small gate and saw the Cathedral first. After a few more steps there was the leaning tower",
          "You must have seen this once! Although there are many tourists (including us) it is nice to have a look. Tip! If you want to climb the tower, make a time reservation in advance. Otherwise you have the chance that you have to wait a long time!",
          "Absolutely the best place in the world. Fantastic, awesome, a venue Full of history, very very stunning",
          "The tower was good. We also got to visit the cathedral for free. It was a nice day for it. My 8 year did managed to get up the steps to the top. Worth a visit to see what it was like at the top. Wouldn\u2019t go again.",
          "Went there at 8am to beat the crowds and it was absolutely worth it!!! Was so glad to see the leaning tower in person and get a bunch of photos especially before the crowds come.",
          "If you enjoy people watching this is a fantastic opportunity to observe hundreds of individuals all doing the same thing, holding up the tower. It costs \u20ac18 per person to climb the tower and time slots are strictly adhered to.",

          "I visited pisa just to see this tower and I am not disappointed. Pisa has nice surrounding area and leaning tower of pisa is the most famous tourist place here.",
          "As you begin the walk towards the tower there are some really cute cafes to stop in. Get a quick caffe then good to go. The Square itself is very impressive with all surrounding buildings. I agree that you don\u2019t need to spend hours there, but nonetheless it is quite beautiful",
          "Not worth longer than an hours visit, if you're passing that way! Couldnt get a taxi easily either...",
          "I came here with my elderly aunt. We were not interested in seeing the tower and she is disabled anyway so could not climb the stairs. She wanted only two things - to light a candle and say a prayer. Every building demands a ticket and the walk to get tickets is a long one - no",

          "I visited Pisa for a day. Takes about an hour from Florence to get to and it\u2019s situated in the Square of Miracles. But I t\u2019s all about the leaning tower in the square. I suppose after seeing all the pictures of it, I was expecting something more dramatic. It\u2019s a cute tower and",
          "Ok it\u2019s famous but that is about it. Even taking the picture you take is \u2018famous \u2018! Yes go and take this with you for memories sake, but do not expect anything. Pisa should update their tourist program\ud83d\ude2c",
          "The leaning tower is well worth a visit especially in the well coordinated and well kept Square of Miracles with the Cathedral, the Baptistery and the Monumental Camposanto (cemetery). Tickets for the tower climb go on sale 20 days before and some slots sell out quickly, so if",
          "We saw it and we took photos. It was smaller than I thought and not really near any other shops or attractions. I have done it, ticked it off my list of places to see, but I won't be going back. You would struggle to spend an hour in Pisa, even if having lunch as well. ",
          "The town of Pisa offers you a variety of spectacular buildings to see in a quite small area. The leaning tower is really a wonder, though seeing the armed policemen or soldiers at the entrance does not increase your experience.",
          "Honestly, there isn't much to see in Pisa other than the buildings in Campo dei Miracoli. The leaning tower is one of three of these structures, and is really worth a quick stop if you are passing through Pisa. I wouldn't plan out days in the city, but the tower is impressive",
          "This is one of the those places in the world that you need to see--history's most famous architectural mishap. Take your fun photos, then climb to 297 steps to the top of the tower! The ticket price is 18 \u20ac, entry is timed. You can buy tickets online or onsite, if available. For",
          "We purchased tickets online about a week before we went as we didn\u2019t want to miss out climbing it. When you pay \u20ac18 to climb it you also get entry to the cathedral as well. There are 251 steps to the top and if felt weird climbing a building that was tilted. If you need the loo",
          "Exactly how it looks in the pics. Wasn\u2019t too busy as it rained. About 25min walk from main train station",
          "Pisa tower is a phenomenon and deserves attention, however, if the tower didn\u2019t lean wouldn\u2019t it just be another building? Pie is just this, the tower and doumo. This is simply two attractions to see and that\u2019s really it. Don\u2019t expect to plan a whole day there is all I\u2019m",
          "Got off the train just to snap a photo of the tower! It was interesting to see, but no need to spend more than an hour in Pisa.",
          "Arrived close to sunset and whilst it was still very busy we got some lovely photos of the tower. Our guide told us some of the history and that they starting building in 1173 but did not finish until the 14th century! It stands 56 metres tall and is probably the best-known",
          "The tower was everything I expected, and the buildings nearby were beautiful, but oh the crowds, and so many people trying for that \u201cunique\u201d photo propping up, or pushing It over, they were as photogenic, if inexplicable, as the tower itself. I advise going early, which I did",
          "There was a time the tower was not open to the public due to renovation. You have to buy tickets to visit the Cathedral Piaza del Domo, Baptistry,Museum in an ancient hospital, burial sites. Even if you do not get into any of these monuments a walk through the premises is an",
          "An excellent day trip on the train from Florence. Local bus right outside the railway station to the Tower, museum and Cathedral which are extremely well presented. Going up the tower after 42 years since my last visit was just as interesting and challenging as I remember. If in",
          "The leaning tower is the main attraction in Pisa,I suggest you to have a look of this attraction and to go to Siena and Florence!Tuscany is a very beautiful place!I loved it",
          "As you would expect it\u2019s very popular and crowded, there are photo opportunities if you visit last thing in the day for a sunset photo, pre book as queues are very long, not suitable for kids or people with mobility problems 25o stone steps",
          "You can only enjoy this wonder only when you reach near it. Though the inclination is geometrically visible from far distance ,the nearer you are ,more interesting the site becomes. The inclination, angle of tilt ,its history of attempted repairs ,wide campus and all creamy",
          "Its very touristy as expected but once you are in Pisa its a must do and totally worth it. Try to book in advance. Also bags needs to be put in a free locker across the green before getting in the queue. Its great to climb up, you can feel the \u201clean\u201d as you walk around. Nice",
          "This is another one of Italy's must see venues, and do take the time and effort to climb up to the top to soak up the atmosphere but also to enjoy the exercise and views at the top. What history and uniqueness.",
          "Well worth a visit very spectacular but do avoid the Pizzerias near the tower they are catering for the tourist and to be honest not very tasty aim for were the locals dine finally take plenty of money compared to Spain and France it's become very expensive \u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u00a3\u00a3",
          "Ok so it is super touristy but who comes to Pisa and doesn't come to see the leaning tower? We have been up it before so just had a stroll round this time around - an amazing sight",
          "We looked online for tickets to inside the tower in the internet the night before we were planning on going and they said they were sold out. Bummed, we went the next day to walk around and take pictures and on a whim we went into the ticket office and there were tons of tickets",
          "We came on the Sunday of their half marathon. The streets were rather busy. This however did not detract from the spectacle of the leaning tower.",
          "A great place to visit, small, quiet in the town away from the tower, especially in October. Walk the old walls to get a great view of the tower and the town itself. Over the river towards the station is modern, the tower side is the older part. We did a food tour and it was a",
          "Got to visit this icon of Italy and the medieval world with my four year old grandson who saw it through eyes of amazement. It really is a wonder to behold.",
          "Visited The Leaning Tower of Pisa in October 2019. The area is well kept and the structures themselves really are remarkable. The street vendors who are at the kiosks are very nice to deal with, but there are other ones who just walk around who are NOT from Italy. They are",
          "Worth going to see but can get very busy, we skipped going up the tower due to the crowds, but we can say we seen it and it really does lean",
          "Visited last week. A fascinating building that everyone loves to get their iconic pics of. You can get a ticket to cover all the attractions in the area and I would suggest it is worth doing. Having been to the local museum and watching the history about the tower it helped me",
          "Very impressive, especially if you think when it was build. The best way to get tickets to book on the official website, you can pick time and date there for a month in advance. Arrive 15-20 min before time indicated on the ticket. You must leave all bags in the free locker, but",
          "Pretty impressive the first time you see it. We didn't go up the tower as we are traveling with a baby. But our hotel was immediately in front of the tower. Only downside is it was not permitted to walk/sit on the grass around it. Also way too many tourists constantly getting in",
          "Upon disembarking in Livorno, our tour bus went straight to Pisa. Our group was among the first ones to arrive. We had a short walk from the bus parking area to the Square of the Cathedral of Pisa. Before reaching the walls of the church and tower, you will encounter numerous",
          "Visited reasonably late. 8-9.30pm. Still people around taking the typical tourist pictures. Friends I was with weren\u2019t interested in taking the daft pushing picture, selfie stick or tripod recommended. Good ambiance, and still warm enough in the year to not feel too cold.",
          "Pisa is a very nice town. Plenty of things to do and excellent place to have a bite to eat. Taxis are affordable and quick.",
          "We purchased our tickets from the official website in the week prior to our visit. We specified our own date and time. We climbed the steps to the top and had a couple of short breaks on the way up to catch our breath! There are a few places where you can move aside to let",
          "we were on a cruise so this was one of the stops. Of course you have to go and see it, and the buildings are very impressive. There is not much else there really and personally I don't feel it needs more than a couple of hours. We went in September and it was very hot.",
          "I first visited in the early 1970\u2019s before the vendors and the crowds were there and it was free. I\u2019m glad I climbed to the top and walked around the outside. Have visited a couple times since, once when it was closed to visitors and under repair. Times have changed and now",
          "It is hard to travel almost anywhere around Pisa without seeing this obviously leaning tower. Close up it is very impressive - I would guess it would attract tourists even if it were not at a tilt.",
          "Time is enemy for us, we managed to walk around and the weather on July were extremely hot ! My daughter was totally tired as we drove from Florence to Pisa on the same day. We should stay at least one night to really see the place !",
          "This was the last stop on our tour and I loved going there at sunset. We got tickets to climb it. There were quite a bit of steps and it can be difficult going up when you are passing by people going down (and you are on leaning stairs). But the moment you reach the top, you",
          "The tower is about 15-20mins walk from Pisa Centrale station. As we arrived around noon so had lunch along the way in a restaurant call La Buca. Seafood were excellent. The area around the leaning towers were full of tourist so taking photos without other strangers in the",
          "There is no charge to enter the park. Take a train and walk three blocks to see it. The tower is beefier and leans more than photos can show. It's difficult to get a good photo shot because there are hundreds of people doing the same. Lots of venders offering reasonably priced",
          "This has been on my list of things to do for decades, I was not disappointed, the first time you see it in person it is breathtaking. Tickets cost \u20ac18 each, this lets you walk up to the top of the tower and gives you entry into the Cathedral. We think it was worth the money.",
          "We were in Pisa on a day trip by coach. The coach park is around 25mins walk to the area where the Tower is, which was a difficult walk for the less able on our tour. It was a hot day and the roads around the Tower were busy, and as well as crossing them you have to cross the",
          "The leaning tower of Pisa is iconic! It is a beautiful, green area and it was so exciting to see the tower in real life!! We had a blast taking photos with the tower and really enjoyed ourselves. I definitely recommend paying to climb it! The climb wasn't as horrible as I was",
          "It\u2019s one of those things. You travel this far you just have to take the time and go see it. It\u2019s the novelty of it. So grab your camera and that loved one to reach out and look like they are a superhero hold the tower up.",
          "Stopped in Pisa to see the leaning tower. One of this tourists stops that you just gotta do while your there. Spent about an hour and captured some of those \u2018fun\u2019 photos to capture the moment. The history of the tower is interesting as well.",
          "This is such a beautiful place to visit. I was really surprised by how much cheaper it was to eat and drink in this city compared to other Italian tourist spots. To be honest you could see most of this city in half a day but there are a number of attractions worth taking time to",
          "Looks great and beautiful from outside. Ticket is 18 euro (which is overpriced). Also they gives you just 30 minutes on the tower. It is a twenty minutes walk from pisa centrale train station. Ticket is overpriced. Not worth actually. There is not much to see from the top.",
          "A monument that made the 7 wonders of the world had to be seen whilst in Italy. Once seen as photos taken, there is not much to do or see in the area. Be aware of street sellers. They tend to cling on to you.",
          "The experience of climbing the leaning tower of Pisa was an unforgettable experience. But few things to note, -be there at least 15 minutes prior to your scheduled visit as you have to check-in all of your bags. (otherwise,f they can refuse your entry) -comfortable shoes are",
          "Loved our day exploring Pisa. No booking we just caught the train from Florence and then jumped on a bus at Pisa station. Bus driver didn't want our money, we tried to pay however bus was very full and he just waved us all on- same on the journey back to train station! No",
          "Great place to visit and look at. I had the opportunity of going up it and found the process baffling. I had paid for my ticket and found myself in the queue with my bag. After a while I noticed no one else had their bag and I asked if I needed to put it somewhere. I was told I",
          "I can only tell what I\u2019ve seen from the outside, as the line to enter the tower was long plus the ticket was quite price for this kind of attraction. There\u2019s not much to say. It\u2019s a building, a tower and it\u2019s leaning. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the place, just not an absolute",
          "We travelled by train from Florence purely to take a look at the leaning tower. Every bit as expected but not as amazing an experience as I thought it would be. Worth the effort just a pity not more to see in this area.",
          "Great building to see this world famous amazing building in the flesh. Recommend to get there early to get the best pics before more crowds arrive. We were there reasonably early and it was still busy. Building and complex was much larger than expected. There is plenty of space",
          "Nice place. you can take nice pictures. Crowded but still able to take your pictures. Before arriving the leaning tower, our guide warned us several time to watch out for picked pockets. Seems like that is a big issue inside that area. Be alert.",
          "Have been wanted to see this for as long as I remember was well worth the trip. Was a long walk from the station but once you get there is absolutely packed with tourists. Everyone is trying to get that Instagram photo of her in the leaning tower of Pisa. Go early in the morning",
          "On our bucket list so had to be done! We were staying in Florence so really only a hour away on the train and a lovely 15 walk to the Tower! It's really busy but it's also beautiful place to visit and spend a few hours! When you arrive book yourself in a time to climb up the",
          "The tower is a once in a lifetime visit. Pictures don't really do it justice. The whole area around the tower is lovely, the Cathedral and other beautiful buildings. The lovely grassy area is nice to walk around and relax in. This is my second time to see the tower, the last",
          "6 of us went there from the port. We ride the bus. It was very busy, lot of tourist that visiting this leaning towel. We took a lot of picture. The shops around the tower also selling many gift or magnets. Will visit again in the future.",
          "The Pisa Tower is about a 20min walk from the train station. I recommend to just see the piazza area where the duomo and tower are - and then leave to your next destination.",
          "The leaning tower of Pisa was the highlight of out trip to Italy. We arrived not so late in the morning. The tours were not there yet. We managed a lot of photos were done at that time. Then the climb to the top was amazing. The view and the feeling of it were among our lifetime",
          "Not an earth shattering historical land mark, compared to other places you can visit in Italy but it was a nice day trip from Florence. We took the train there and the country side is gorgeous to look at. My husband and I had a great walk along the harbor while the kids messed",
          "The tower is great, as is the lovely cathedral next to it, but Pisa itself is a very poor relation to other places such as Florence, Siena, Lucca, Volterra, San Gimignano. It feels a bit dirty and cheap.",
          "Breath taking. Simply wonderful to see the tower in person . A great experience. Enjoyed the whole feel of the area",
          "It's unbelievable how this structure is still standing after all these years. I traveled from Rome early in the morning. I got there around 7 am. It is a medium walk from the train station to the Tower. It was not too full at the time and photo opportunities were abound. Alas I",
          "had heard & seen photos of the place. standing in the Leaning Tower complex was a dream come true. it has great historical monuments alongside, photography was fun and tourist were enjoying trying to snap themselves supporting the leaning tower",
          "The train station is a bit dodgy and is a 25 min walk to the tower. We booked online to get inside the tower. Note bags are not allowed inside so queue up 15min before your time slot at the cloak room to store your bags. This is a free service located in the yellow/orange",
          "Nice area and a lot to see. Of course it\u2019s a tourist place but what else would you expect. Nice place to take pictures als fun ones.",
          "The leaning tower of Pisa is the easiest attraction to get to and doesn\u2019t require any ticket to see it. The area has got cathedral and Baptist church as well. The tower is an amazing site to experience and the history of this building is very interesting. I didn\u2019t go up the",
          "Actually Visited in September 2018 (not Oct 2018). It was a wonderful place to visit. I was there with friends, and part of a wonderful tour group. We got to Pisa in the mid-morning, and the line to get into the tower was already very long. We didn't wait to go inside, but",
          "It was a spontaneous trip to Pisa while visiting Florence, and I\u2019m so glad we did. Seeing the leaning tower in person was so amazing and unreal. Now I have a picture holding the tower up all by myself!",
          "I learned about the tower many years ago at school and I was fascinated by it. The area surrounding the tower is stunning and the \u20ac18 fee to climb to the top wa well worth it. The view from the top is amazing. Though 80c to use the toilet is a bit cheeky!",
          "Impressive attraction worth seeing and taking the typical photo, but Pisa has a lot more to offer! Take a walk at the river and the inner city and admire the colours of the buildings... True Toscany!",
          "If you're going to Pisa you mustn't miss the chance of doing the tower tour. Why go and just stand outside it like so many others when you have the chance to climb the steps and check out the great views from the top. We booked our tickets online in advance but you can just as",
          "Read a lot of comments that Pisa is boring, that everything you have to see is tower in the middle of some grass. Totally not true. It's surounding by nicely preserved medieval walls, with even more fascinating cathedral and baptisteria (it's hard to find that anybody say",
          "The tilted tower is of course the five star attraction here. Also of interest are the cathedral and the baptistery which features an echo which is performed every half hour.",
          "We visited from Florence to spend the afternoon. Easy to get to by train from Florence then bus from outside the station takes you straight there. Climbing the tower is worth it but the only problem I had was that although most museums in Italy allow disable people in at a",
          "I was so impressed seeing this iconic structure up close. It gleamed in the morning sunshine. Yes, it was busy. Yes, there were people all around getting their corny photo shots. But, hey, it was fun and still a must see. Unfortunately we didn't get tickets to go up to the",
          "Well, the leaning tower. It's a tower. It leans. It's in Pisa. Not bad to check out, but becwary, those people that have to get a pic of them holding up the tower or tower crotch shots can be mean. I'm patient, but if you're going for a professional tower crotch shot with a",
          "High tourism in this area, but everyone can get a get view even with all the photo ops going on in peak season. This beautiful historic structure is a must see.",
          "As I see that many recommended to go onto the tower, even it costs 18\u20ac, I made it too, I recommend to book online and get the earliest or latest one if you want to avoid crowd, I have the first entry at 9am and it is really comfortable. The walk up is slightly tiring but walking",
          "As soon as you walk into the square it brightens up your day. We went on an amazingly sunny day which set the scene perfectly. It\u2019s fairly cheap to go up the tower, you actually get a better view from the top of the baptistery. You can also do a combination ticket :)",
          "A good place to visit lots to see and do we got of the bus at the bus stop after the stop for the tower and walked back towards the tower through all the shops and bars the walk ment you get to see a lot more of what pizza has to offer and gave us a good day out",
          "Nothing new here, everything you've heard is correct. Snap a picture and get out as fast as you can. Pick Pockets, junk for sale in the streets, tents, nasty toilets for .80 euro. I did climb to the top it was nice view up there and wasn't hard to climb the 259 steps. I only",
          "Cool and beautiful tower, funky looking but still work of art. Although he is leaning for many yrars he Is still standing. haha. Joke a side, Leaning Tower of Pisa is something that you must see. That's it. My love and I liked it very much.",
          "My family and I visited the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Granted there was not a whole lot to do in Pisa, except shop and eat, but just seeing the famous tower made the trip worthwhile. Pisa is a very peaceful and relaxed small city. Check prices for items at several vendor stands",
          "Not very interesting, full of tourists. Lots of restaurants around and nice streets. Not more then 2 hours of day trip",
          "Ok, call me a cynic. It\u2019s a tower. And it is leaning. More of a mistake if you as me. It is impressive though and I took a picture to say I had been there. Tons of people doing stupid poses like holding up the tower or pushing it over. Many street vendors selling Tower stuff",
          "The tower was even more impressive than we expected. The climb to the top was challenging for us 60 plus year olds but worth the effort. Went back at night with no crowds and it was magical.",
          "We visited Pisa on a half day tour and I was impressed by the beauty of the Miracle square. The tower is beautiful with its white Carrara marble. I thought it was taller than that!!",
          "I always thought that the tower of Pisa is overrated and enhanced in photos and documentaries. But, now that I have been there, I can say that I was feeling overwhelmed and impressed. It's really big and leaning on a side a lot. Worth seeing it and spending some time in Pisa.",
          "You have to see the tower if you are in Tuscany. It is amazing to see this iconic Italian building in real life. Glad we made the effort to see it.",
          "We had purchased tickets to climb the tower in advanced, since we only had a few hours to spend in Pisa. We expected to arrive in Pisa at 9:00, so I purchased tickets for 10:00. Due to multiple accidents on our drive to Pisa, we arrived in Pisa at 10:30. They take no pity on you",
          "The tower looks smaller than imagined. However, larger than life. The grounds surrounding the tower are roped off and beautiful. You will fight crowds to get the perfect picture but it\u2019s worth the time and effort for sure. There are lots of vendors outside the walls and you have",
          "Have wanted to go to the top of the leaning tower of Pisa for some time. We booked the tickets a few days before we travelled to Pisa via the website. We choose to go up later in the evening mostly because of the heat but also to see the sun set. You arrive about 20 mins before.",
          "Very impressive in real life. Just a shame there are so many people trying to take the usual photos.",
          "As young child I would look at the photo of leaning tower of Pisa with amazement and wonder.....how can a building tilt but not fall over.Then I decided that probably its small so the tilt does not affects its balance.When reseaching for day trips from Florence and up came",
          "Spend your time in Lucca or Siena or Florence they ARE special. Cattedrale di Pisa closed ! Now that you cannot make up. No notice on their web site. Why on earth are there market stalls with plastic plug in models of the Tower everywhere as well as other awful merchandise.",
          "Wow! We just saw one of the Seven Wonders of the World. Got there early but big crowds. Lots of picture takers but a wonderful site to see. If you\u2019re planning to visit, take the train as driving here is insane and parking even worse.",
          "Amazing seen lots of pictures but to see it in the flesh amazing together with other structures Lots of people there so very busy Lots of nice places to eat and drink",
          "Got there relatively early in the morning as they sell a limited number of tickets for each time slot. 266 stairs reasonably wide except for the narrow spiral to get right up to the bell platform. Some stairs well worn and a bit slippery so have good soles. As you climb the",
          "We booked advance tickets to go up the tower at 7pm, so missed the main crowds. I think there were no more than 10 of us climbing.. At the top we had great views us the sun started to set, turning the whole city golden brown. Not sure how late they are open, there was another",
          "It\u2019s a sight to see! Can\u2019t believe it\u2019s hasn\u2019t fallen over. An absolutely must do. You can walk to the top! Fo inside .... it\u2019s weird! The steps to the top lean in and out depending on which side. Don\u2019t miss the 35 additional steps to the very top! 217 to the first level!",
          "I went there at 7:30 in the morning and 7:30 in the evening, without the crowds. It is such an amazing structure and also the plaza around it is so enjoyable to visit. Obviously A must see when in Pisa.",
          "Not only the tower but the whole 'Piazza dei Miracoli'. I recommend visiting this place at least twice: in the daytime and in the evening. You will appreciate both, but, the 'miraculousity', you will feel it after the sunset. Staying in front of the sculpture of young boys",
          "Okay, we all go for the tower. But the Duomo is amazing inside, the other buildings all have something to offer. And do take a stroll down to the river.",
          "Visited as part of a half day tour, personally you\u2019d be better going on your own as it was too rushed. It is a good 15 minute walk from the coach park, and you need to be mindful of pick pockets in the coach area and through the market getting to the landmark. It is worth a",
          "Caught the train from Florence to Pisa Centrale, then walked around 20 mins to see the tower. Pleasant, easy walk to this area. You know when you are close as people start trying to sell you selfie sticks, hats and watches. The whole area around the tower is beautifully kept and",
          "I have read about it in the books since my childhood and was on my bucketlist forever. It was nice to tick it off and seeing in person is truly an experience. Loved it.",
          "It is one of those must see landmarks. Was not disappointed... I had a,ways wanted to visit and when my Mediterranean cruise afforded me the opportunity, I was thankful. The area is small but the landmark is huge... There are little cafes around to get a meal or just a cup of",
          "Had heard a lot about this wonder - the leaning tower of Pisa. Everything was proven true on our visit. The pristine weather culminated our experience.",
          "A must see! Very very crowded but worth it nonetheless. Get that iconic photo, and some tasty gelato while you\u2019re there!",
          "Our family visited the popular Torre de Pisa on our last day of our European vacation in late July. Parking in downtown Pisa is difficult, so we found a spot far away at Eurospin grocery store and walked. It is typically crowded as it was the day we visited. The historic area",
          "Enjoyed seeing the leaning tower again. We were lucky as the weather was pristine so the tower area looked marvelous.",
          "Couldn\u2019t believe how pristine it was and how well it had been maintained. Saw it in sunny daylight as well as night time and both were equally impressive.",
          "Before going to Italy friends had told us there wasn't much in Pisa and to see the Tower then go. We actually found it lovely and the walk from train station to the Tower was really good. The Tower and surrounding buildings are stunning. Yes all the people taking photos can be",
          "Leave NOTHING in your car, YOUR car locks WILL be picked and your luggage or belongings will be gone through or completely stolen. Parking around pisa for several kilometers is not safe. BEWARE the road along the river Lungarno Giacomo Leopardi. They are watching you park and",
          "You cannot believe all you hear about it until you see it in reality. It is a very busy place and you can go up to the top for a fee. Remarkable.",
          "I've been here with my family (husband and seven yers child), but we did not enter because they do not allow children under eight years to go inside. Is a touristic attraction, good to have a picture and that's it.",
          "Italy is Italy!!!!!!! Pisa is one of the best place in Italy to be obliged to visit. Piazza dei Miracoli is spectacular.",
          "It\u2019s an amazing sight to see, and the gardens and the town surrounding it are all beautiful. And of course you have to get the photo of you holding it up. Enjoy",

          "I didn't realise the famous leaning tower was actually a bell tower for the adjacent cathedral and baptistry on a holy site. The white stone of the three buildings looks stunning. I was anticipating a grubby tower in the middle of a built up area but it's nothing like that. The",

          "We went in the evening after dinner. The tower was closed, but the surrounds were free of tourists. Probably the main thing in any event is to see and photograph the leaning tower, which was much easier with no crowds around. It is a remarkable sight, the lean is very",

          "The tower is definitely worth seeing. The area is well maintained with grass areas and the cathedral and museum. The tower is taller than I thought it would be. Plenty of opportunities to take photos. If you fancy climbing to the top then it\u2019s \u20ac18.",

          "I was travelling from France to Rome in a camper van and decided to go to see the tower as it was not much off our route. I Made the mistake of thinking I could get close and missed the restriction signs that prevent wider vehicles from entering the city region. A width barrier",

          "We were staying in nearby Lucca, so we knew we had to see the Leaning Tower of Pisa since we were so close. And it was very, very cool to see such an iconic place in person--it really does lean an incredible amount. That said, battling crowds is not one of my favorite things and",
          "I was not sold on spending the time to get to this but it really is amazing to see. The tower is now open again for tourists to climb but it is not for the faint of heart or anyone with physical limitations. There are several other buildings near by that make the trip worth while",

          "Nice to see this in person... it's crowded, but understandingly why. Everyone is trying to get \"that\" one shot of holding up the tower which is kinda funny to watch. There are several stalls selling goods. Bring water during the summer - it's hot!",

          "Crowded, expensive. One should visit the tower, se it and then run away. Throngs of street vendors, millions of tourists queuing for hours upon hours while taking a gazillion selfies. Not worth the pain, trust me... best time to visit? In the middle of the night and off season.",
          "I've travelled to Italy on many occasions & always wanted to visit this site. The Leaning tower and surrounding area was truly majestic. We were there late afternoon and into the early evening as the light changed. Breathtaking.",

          "If you\u2019re in Pisa or, with in reason, nearby then I\u2019d suggest a visit - but take in the free element of this attraction rather than pay for going up the tower. It is lovely to see, and quite impressive how the tower leans, and even novel and fun to take the stereotypical photo",
          "The tower is amazing, worth a trip up to see the sights but the whole e experience in my opinion is just ruined a little over the amount of people pushing to get a \"I'm holding it up\" picture. Looks beautiful with the lights at night though.",

          "When in Pisa the leaning tower is a must. Obviously, many people walk visit the place as you would expect. You can buy a ticket to enter the church, the baptistery etc., but you can see Giambolognas magnificent bronze doors from the outside without a ticket!",

          "Great to see the sites, but the tour guide, although a very nice lady who spoke excellent English continued to spout uninteresting areas of none interest such as the electric factory, IKEA, colours of the flags, the heron on the canal and how the heron has returned after 5",
          "I was staying in Venice, but decided to hop over to Pisa once I learned that I could reach the historical landmark in about an hour long bus ride. You'll first need to navigate your way through the Market place before entering the grounds where the church and pisa bell are",

          "Totally worth it, even on a rainy day in winter (no crowds!) Spring for the whole cathedral complex - 4 monuments full of amazing art and architectural details. Climbing the tower is not for the faint of heart, but the view is worth it.",
          "The place is very clean and well maintained. Climbing the leaning tower to it's top is the amazing experience I ever had!!",
          "A \"must-see\" before you die! Famous tower of Pisa is worth to see it. And not only the tower. Whole area around the tower has beautiful magic, and also narrow streets of the city tempt to get lost there...",
          "Entering here was more like ending the city of God's. It was kind of out of nowhere. This is an absolute beauty no matter at whatever time you visit. I got a chance to visit both during day and night fortunately.\nSo loved the buildings \u2026",
          "It does, in fact, lean. It looks nice, but the tourists around it really injustice it by posing all around it. There are informational signs that are actually pretty interesting to read, and there are merchandise stalls that actually sell some useful things.",
          "Beautiful place. Easy to park close the historical  complex.  There are many restaurants localized in the secondary streets, inside the complex.",
          "On a bright sunny day, one can take out time and visit all attractions at peace. All are one place. There are good souvenir shops , gelato shops nearby. The washroom is also there which makes it very convenient. One had to leave the bag to \u2026",
          "The tower and the church's next to it were gorgeous. I didn't have the highest of expectations before coming, but in the end was wowed by the beauty of this building. If you are in Florence by all means plan a day trip here and to Lucca.",
          "I thought that this will be just a tourist magnet but the reality is so much more than any picture can show. Despite all the people in the view, the greenery and the buildings around make an exquisite setting. It is easy to find a quiet \u2026",
          "i loved it it was a great experience for me and my family.",
          "Nice picture site, well taken care of. Other sites as well. Town is pleasant and food and stores. Train station not far walk.",
          "Excellent piece of surreal engineering works! Fins out the history of the Pisa tower and how and why it begin to lean to one side. And the measures being taken to maintain it from toppling down.",
          "What place, fantastic, a skyscraper built in a time when a common cold could kill you. An icon of a building.  Must visit to understand the ancient times and how brilliant work ws possible.",
          "we came to leaning tower from Florence city via train and buses. it is easy to find the location, you don't want ticket for out side exploration. 20 eura for full ticket which included  climbing the tower and watch church.",
          "It will be crowded doesn\u2019t matter what time you\u2019re there, be patient and think about the right camera angles. It\u2019s not as big as you might think it is my friend pointed out\n\nTake a half day trip to see this sight, there\u2019s not much else to see in Pisa so maybe stay for a few hours before going to Florence or literally anywhere else.",
          "Amazing!  Do take time to witness this engineering marvel. Also recommend to see it by day and night. It's truly worth it!",
          "All day access around the grounds make it a great place to visit day or night. During the day you can go up to 250+ steps to the top and view the city below. Climbing the tower itself feels a little disorienting with the lean on one side \u2026",
          "Another amazing wonder... \n\nI had some really good ice cream clear by as well I don\u2019t think things are too expensive... but the exchange thing doesn\u2019t always make sense to me \ud83d\ude02",
          "It's Wednesday January great weather and not too overcrowded. Original my trip was based in Florence, but because Pisa is only an hour away by train it was easy and a must see.",
          "Brilliant! Was definitely worth visiting. We got there about 3pm on a Tuesday in February and was able to book to go up it straight away. \u20ac18 each. Didn't feel like too many stairs but if you're unfit then it may be a struggle. Amazing \u2026",
          "Omg!  So cool!  It\u2019s so beautiful to see in person!  The day we were there, it was very hot, so it was hard to stay out as long as we had hoped to. But I\u2019ll definitely go back and spend more time there, either in the spring or early fall. Simply Amazing & worth the trip!!!!! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udc95",
          "The Leaning Tower is gorgeous and although we didn't climb up it, you don't have to in order to appreciate its uniqueness and beauty.\nIt can get very busy so if you are planning to visit, get there early to guarantee entry.\nBring along a picnic on a summer's day, the grounds lend itself to be the perfect chill out zone.",
          "The biggest engineering mistake ever done has become one of the seven world wonders. It is also called as freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide for its nearly four-degree lean, the result of \u2026",
          "Wonderful experience to see the famous tower and be able to climb up to the top!  Be aware that if you are sensitive to motion,  it can be a dizzying experience.   You feel off balance at times due to the angle of the tower!  Wonderful views on top!",
          "They protect their culture and give importance to the history. These historical places are clean and well maintained",
          "We got to pisa at around 9am. I think we were the first group of tour there. But I was very quiet and refreshing. We climb the leaning tower. It was not bad but going down is a little scary for me. The the stairs of the side that it was \u2026",
          "An amazing piece of history, as you walk up the narrow staircase you imagine Galileo or Christopher Columbus walking the same steps. The steps are worn on the side of the direction its leaning. It is a wonder that everyone person should see once in their lifetime.",
          "Great place to visit. Bus from station straight to tower. Very quiet today!!",
          "Happy to give 5star to this beautiful place \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude0d",
          "Nobody is great enough for REVIEWING this place.. of course it is one of the greatest places in the world.. Just a small tip for travellers, check the sunset timing beforehand to enjoy daytime and night time view of this amazing place and avoid relying upon the train timings.. they aren\u2019t quite on time.",
          "Too many people, total tourist trap! I wasn\u2019t surprised I guess, it\u2019s something everyone needs to see at least once in their lifetime, but man was it busy. The sun was out when we went and that attracted all the tourists. Be prepared for \u2026",
          "It\u2018s standing there. With a lot of tourists in front who are still trying to hold it in place on a photo. Look at a picture on the internet and you\u2018re good to go somewhere else.",
          "Beautiful place! Clean and the people are so friendly. The sunset here is a dream. Gelato is so yummy!",
          "One of the most beautiful places in whole Europe, perhaps in the world. What do you need to know more than this? Enjoy",
          "Is not overcrowded, is not charged, options of food around the place. You can spend some time around the area. Will go back again definitely.",
          "Not much to do around there. Literally just taking pictures etc and souvenirs. I had no expectations so had no issues. So nice quick little visit",
          "The tower was leaning, which is good, but the pizza was not there. 3 stars for false advertising.",
          "It is a place with no help and no instructions. Not that you need any. You will just walk in and be patient to find an empty spot and not have someone walking in the middle of your picture. Just patience. And park a couple blocks away in the street.",
          "It's... Alright... It's a big leaning tower, after you've seen that, it's kind of a bit waste of time to be honest. The Opera museum wasn't that interesting, and the cathedral, while beautiful is nothing special. If travelling from Florence, skip Pisa, and go see Sienna instead, much more interesting in my opinion.",
          "Worth only a quick visit from Florence to straighten out the tower. See it. Get out. Get back to Firenze where the good good happens.",
          "Five stars because it is a \"must see\" place :) The view is not that special, but the history around it so fascinating. I was much more impressed by the cathedral: plain on the outside but spectacular on the inside.",
          "Interesting experience climbing up steps as they spiral around to the top. Well worth it. Take your time at the top overlooking Pisa.",
          "The tower is what you would expect. A long winding stair to the top with occasional glances through openings on the way up. The drop off for bags For some reason is not beside the tower and the line can be long so be early if you have \u2026",
          "This was a great place to visit. It was beautiful and a must see, when in Tuscany.",

          "What a treat from this place... beauty of this place is just it\u2019s simplicity... green grass the white constructions inside the secured compound... \nplace is at walkable distance from the Central Station... walk through the streets to know the city better.",
          "Is it a bit clique...maybe, but what an amazing place to visit. We spent around an hour or so here and it was perfect.  Wish we had a bit more time.",
          "I love checking out all the popular tourist places and seeing for myself is it is worth it. We really enjoyed seeing this architectural marvel. I never knew that it was built in sections over time or why it leans, how they stopped it, and \u2026",
          "Amazing site to visit.  Just wish our tour bus hadn't parked so far away.  The long walk and busy street crossings was a bit more \"adventure\" than I had bargained for.",
          "Hi, I'm from Indonesia. I wanted to visit here, but due to distance and economic limitations the desire to come here was difficult to achieve. I want to see this tower in person. I want to count directly the number of stairs which is said \u2026",
          "Nice place, very interesting. Be aware of parking fines, in almost any place there parking is not alowed",
          "One of the best places in the world. It's worth seeing in Pisa and in Europe. Going inside the building that tilts is great feeling. However with a price tag of 18 euros, it seems to be a bit expensive",
          "Wonderful buildings with rich details. Best time to visit, Spring - summer.",
          "Needless to say, it is the most popular attraction in Pisa and apart from that, you don\u2019t have much to see. Many people take the early morning train from Florence, Visit Pisa and come back by afternoon. It really is the most peculiar and \u2026",
          "The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italian: Torre pendente di Pisa) or simply the Tower of Pisa (Torre di Pisa [\u02c8torre di \u02c8pi\u02d0za, - \u02c8pi\u02d0sa]) is the campanile, or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa, known worldwide \u2026",
          "Very cool thing to see and climb. If you're going up make sure to where good shoes the stairs are slippery",
          "Great place, amazing architecture. Well worth the visit if you are in Florence let's say and you have an extra couple of hours or a day to also visit Pisa.",
          "An extraordinary monument with a peculiar slant that makes it famous. A very beautiful example of medieval architecture.",

          "Although I\u2019ve been here for many times in the past. But it\u2019s my first time since my last visit 8 years ago. The place has become cleaner and organized with police and army personnel all around. Felt very safe. It was unbearable hot, but still worth a revisit!",
          "Excellent. I've done lots of travelling and this stands out as one of the most impressive things I've seen. Definitely worth seeing in real life. I'm also impressed that the grounds are free to walk around - I expected the area to be fenced \u2026",
          "One of the nicest places I've been to in Italy so far. This is a very quiet town which is an hour journey from Firenze. There's nothing much to see in Pisa but the Leaning tower, the church and it's baptisery. The church offers free entry \u2026",
          "Came here to take a look at the iconic leaning tower of Pisa. Drove all the way from Florence and back. When you take a look at it you realize how it\u2019s truly leaning, seems like it\u2019s about to tip over sometime soon. Very crowded. Parking \u2026",
          "Its a very pretty sight. I reccomend you buy your tickets to go inside before hand online. DO NOT BUY FROM STREET SELLERS! Also remember that if you buy tickets to go inside the leaning tower of pisa you can also go into the church",

          "This iconic tower does not disappoint, providing lots of fun photo opportunities. Check out the baptistery and cathedral too.",
          "Quite a lot of history to absorb in one day or one visit. Also, It's nice to go back and rediscover artifacts centuries old. I just wish there weren't so much blockage from individuals taking selfies.",
          "Loveeeee!! A fantastic tourist attraction.",
          "I personally think it is ok to see it once but nothing that spectacular which the social media claims it to be. I thought it would be bigger in person but in reality it wasn't tall at all. I was a bit disappointed but nonetheless it is nice \u2026",
          "Plenty of history here.  Hear why the Pisanians and the Venetians have such a healthy dislike for each other via one of the tours. Climbing Pisa is weird and wonderful",
          "Wonderful, iconic landmark with lots of open space around it allowing good views. Free of charge. Slightly sad that every other tourist is doing the ' I'm holding the tower up' pose. Some good restaurants nearby.",
          "My fav site in Italy, the most beautiful.  The surroundings not so much.",

          "Amazing only think a handful of the world's population have seen this and it a truly beautiful piazza",
          "As a quick day trip, it's super interesting to see. The town itself is quite simplistic from my point of view, but it certainly has it's charm.\n\nThe lean is no joke at 5.5 degrees... It's interesting to see how around the 5th level, the \u2026",
          "Stunning! Must visit !. The whole square is beautiful. You will spend about 3 hours here.  Lot of places to eat. Very hot in August...Do carry water with you, wear good comfortable walking shoes.  There are water fountains, where in one can refill their water bottles. Do take a guide.",
          "It was pretty calm and not too crowded, I'm really happy I got to appreciate so much of the tower!!",
          "Nice place to be, and for some fun photography. Went there as an excursion from Florence. I was traveling with family and opted for trains from Florence to.and fro, and its quite easy to reach there. One tip, back side of building gives better view of how lean it is.",

          "Easily accessible by train from other cities, lots of dining options leading up to the tower.",
          "Easy day trip from Florence. There are loads of vendors selling little gifts all around the area. The tower itself is a little underwhelming in person, but take the time to visit the cathedral while you\u2019re there! It\u2019s free to enter the cathedral, just request a free time slot from the ticketing office.",
          "Pictures do not do this monument justice. It\u2019s absolutely breathtaking to see! My group and I spent about 40 minutes at the Leaning Tower, and we were able to see everything we wanted to see. We did not go inside the tower. The entrance fee \u2026",
          "It's a nice to see, very crowded, you have to pay 80c for toilets. Entry to tower is separate. Best place for photo is behind the tower, there are less people at the back. Don't forget to buy souvenirs from the shops . I bought a nice book mark for 3\u20ac",
          "The view is quite spectacular! It\u2019s really good to see that they have managed to restore and/or strengthen the tower from further deterioration/collapse. The engineering feat itself is incredible! Remember to spend some time at the ticketing area and watch the series of videos showing this 10 years of effort...",
          "Pisa is a much smaller city than expected, but getting to see the tower is worth it. It\u2019s smaller than expected but as charming as it can be. Getting in is a little expensive, but I would advice to do so if you are already there. You will \u2026",
          "It is indeed leaning! Crowded place in general.. But worth visiting. Pisa town is nice. Near the tower you can have a walk and something to eat or drink",

          "Very interesting place to visit. Very busy but able to see all that you would want to see.",
          "It's a short walk directly from Pisa Centrale Station, about 1.7km. There's baggage drop off at the station or on the left as you enter the piazza. Tickets are bought from the shop at the opposite side of the tower. You must have a ticket \u2026",
          "What a stunningly beautiful square, go see and look in awe at the work of the master builders.",
          "It was lovely walking around in the evening when most the tourists had retired for the night. We had a quick overnight here and enjoyed the hospitality, I\u2019m glad I fit in a stop here. They had signs with information for you read and we had a late night dinner that was lovely at \ud83d\ude05, I forgot but will try and figure that out.",
          "I very nice tourist place to be. You have a lot to see there. I recommend to all to see because I was surprise when I saw it it very special and unique in Pisa.",
          "The tower is amazing and it's really one of the seven wonders! We enjoyed taking pictures and posing near the tower. We walked around the place collected some souvenirs. Then came the chill time we choose to sit and drink some coffee with a view of the tower.",

          "It's really a wonder..l love looking at the leaning  tower. Beautiful sight from the top of the tower.  It's better to book the tickets online in advance to avoid long queues. It's open also on monday though, someone has updated in Google that it's closed on Monday. Ticket costs 18 euros which also includes an entry pass to cathedral.",

          "One of the most beautiful places in Italy. Town is fine, and the airport is great. But the grounds around the leaning tower \ud83d\uddfc are fantastic. A must do. But a day trip only. \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9",
          "Amazing piece of Italian architecture. the imperfections make it beautiful. I threw some pizza off the top and got arrested.",
          "Definitely must see. Book tickets in advance, always crowded and queues everywhere. Not much more to do over there after.",
          "Beautiful tower. You can climb the tower but you need to buy a ticket. Eat pizza at the restaurants around.",
          "Even though you have seen it on puctures it still surprises you. Best time to visit is in the morning - very small amount of people. Or at evening, the tower is lit and you are there almost alone. Otherwise very crowded",
          "It's beautiful during the day. But...\n\nFull of pick pocketeers and thieves. Be super cautious if you plan to drive to the place. I had my car broken into and they stole everything including my passport. My car was parked along with 25 other \u2026",
          "Breathtaking and beautiful - Long climb to the top, but SO worth it!\nThe grounds are beautifully kept",
          "It's nice to see once you're in Italy but it was really disappointing after seeing everything in Rome. There is no discounted entrance which is ridiculous considering you have a discount as a youth anywhere else in Italy.",
          "Had fun posing for the camera.  Note top of the tower which is inclined in the opposite direction to provide the necessary equilibrium and balance. Be wary of pickpockets though, typically a small group of young teenager girls.",
          "Smaller than you might think. Fun to see everyone posing for pictures running to push the tower up. Long walk to get there.",
          "It's an interesting place, but there's not really that much to there besides walking around and taking pictures.",
          "How can anyone rate this anything but a 5*? Simply a stunning piece of art, a real testament to solid materials and brilliant engineering. Come before 8am to avoid traffic of tourists, middle of the day has best sun position for a great picture. Enjoy!",
          "Very pretty it's white marble really stands out live",
          "Book in advance if you want to climb to the top. It is 18 euros and includes the free entry to the cathedral. The other stops are an additional charge",
          "Beautiful place! After growing up in pisa and moving out of the country, coming back is magical, it changed nothing. It is still in the same good and maintained condition as 6 years ago. Conservation/renovation attempts are also visible which is always nice to see.",
          "This is an amazing place to visit and see this historical place. The building is really a master piece and worthy to visit. There are many illegal sellers before you enter the building and these are sometimes very irritating as they try to \u2026",
          "Another once in a lifetime thing to see. The lines for the tower during the day are endless, so I recommend going in the evening, as it won't be busy up there, and you can practically stay as long as you want. Even though I'm scared of \u2026",
          "I've seen photos of the place, but being there is infinitely better.",
          "Lots of fun here! But make sure to buy your tickets early! For more- go to IG @gillzvacay",
          "It's a mesmerizing experience. So many monuments within a short distance of each other. Buy your tickets to the tower as soon as you reach as there are designated times to enter it. Wander around the other monuments while you wait for your time slot.",
          "Great place. Proper time to see tower while still standing... later it will  e just a story",
          "Read about this structure in high school history books. Saw numerous pics on the internet and in books. Heard several different stories about it, Finally, got to see it with my own eyes.\n\nThe entire complex is beautifully laid out and has 3 \u2026",

          "A must see if you\u2019re ever in Pisa. The info center is very helpful. I booked my ticket to climb to the top of the tower before I went but I saw people making reservations in person at the counter. They have secure areas to place your \u2026",
          "One of the seven wonders of world The Leaning tower of Pisa is the must visit place once in life. I think pictures can't justice with it's beauty. Basically you can't climb on it but you would definitely enjoy it's view. So what are you waiting for visit this spectacular site.",

          "Beautiful place to visit. I didn't need reservation or skip the line ticket at the end of November. I just bought the regular ticket there (18 euros) and went up in the tower.",
          "Bucking popular opinion but whilst it's nice to have seen in person we can't help feeling completely underwhelmed by it all.\n\nIt's a reasonable walk from the train station which really doesn't overly feel worth it. It's naturally packed \u2026",
          "Breathtaking I wished we had more time, there are over 300 stairs to go up in it, being on a tour we were limited on time, so I couldn't go. I think it was 18. Euros to go up it is a winding staircase for FYI",
          "The attraction is amazing.\n\nHowever, the grass is now off limits. It's very crowded on the sides where people walk since everyone is trying to get a good photo. \n\nI get it, they're trying to keep the grass nice and green, but there must be \u2026",
          "Was beautiful and amazing at the same time! It\u2019s an unforgettable vacation. Lots of pictures to take. It wasn\u2019t so crowded that you couldn\u2019t see everything there. We went in May and the weather was beautiful, no rain \u2614\ufe0f. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone going to Italy \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9",
          "Definitely a must-see place if you visit Tuscany. This is often one of the first photo-spots to come into mind when thinking of Italy, so it is very nice to get to see it in person! The stereotypical photos people take with the Leaning \u2026",

          "We came Monday around 1:30(13:00) we parked a couple blocks away and walked up. It's very nice, lots of people but you can get a picture and it's free. Didn't see the need to climb it. \nTheir lots of stands to buy souvenirs and things with tower on it. All different prices and they are willing to go down on prices too.",
          "Leaning tower of Pisa is a worth visit if someone is travelling to Italy. This is one of the very well preserved historical monument in the world. One can get on the top of the tower. Instead of waiting in the line for your turn, you can \u2026",

          "Of course you will have to stop by the Leaning Tower if you are traveling Italy. You\u2019ll feel the real energy of this beautiful place. The area has affordable prices and you\u2019ll be able to take your famous picture! Just make sure to not step on the grass :)",
          "Definitely the highlight of my trip, Pisa is a fabulous place to visit, highly recommend the trip!",

          "It\u2019s as majestic as you expect!  It wasn\u2019t too crowded when I went and a quick train ride round trip to and from Florence.   It\u2019s worth the trip and get your epic shots!",
          "Take out atleast 2-3 hours out of the itinerary for the visit. Visited in the evening and the lighting was splendid",

          "Great historical site and wonderful surroundings good food, good people and fascinating history!!!",

          "It's beautiful but if you go, do it on a day trip where you can see a few other places too. There are lots of tours you can buy that show four towns in one day. Much better to do it like that.",
          "Fortunately, when I got there the weather was fine even it\u2019s November. The view is spectacular. Love to be here.",

          "In Pisa it is just one place you should be,but you should!!!!Great place!!!! Small nice town to walk for two hours",
          "The grand architecture just blows you away. Pisa is an hour and a half's drive from Florence along the beautiful Tuscan countryside. The climb to the top of the tower can be a little tricky though, (especially during the rains as the stairs can be slippery). Again, beware of pick pockets. \n\nOverall a great experience.",

          "Great visit to pretty much the only thing Pisa is known for.  Access was well setup to the tour, and the line was less than 15 minutes long.  Truly enjoyed seeing this bit of history while in our trip\n\nMore available documentation of the \u2026",
          "The tower visibly leans and it's very exciting to see it. I would recommend that one climbs to the top... the staircase is not very long. The cathedral is also very beautiful and worth visiting.",

          "We drove from Rome to visit Leaning Tower of Pisa, with our luggages in the car. It was supposed to be a short trip, in which we will then check in our hotel in Florence. Big mistake. Even though we parked in a legal parking lot, with lots \u2026",
          "The tower is exactly what you would expect from all the pictures from the internet. Just be aware, the place is completely filled with other tourists. Also, the shops there are super overpriced in comparison to the less touristy places in Pisa. So if you want to buy some nice souvenirs, I would recommend going elsewhere.",
          "I visited Piss first time. Lot of new words. In fact visiting Italy after long time.\n\nLearning tower of Pisa is magnificent. Seen lot of photos before. But seeing it personally is totally different. Well maintend clean surrounding. Museum nearby.",
          "It was amazing to see and to take a photo with one of the most famous buildings in the world. Nevertheless, there are a lot of tourists around the Square of Miracles but if you go a bit further, you will enjoy the ancient district of Pisa.",
          "Lovely place, you need 2 hours to see Pisa",
          "I'm going here with my friends. I'm enjoying this place very much. I like this place so i google it then it show me very useful information.\nThe height of the tower is 55.86 metres (183.27 feet) from the ground on the low side and 56.67 \u2026",

          "Having read and heard about throughout the formative years; I always wanted to see this wonder. And the leaning tower of Pisa did not disappoint.

          "You have to come to pisa to see this Torre (Tower). It is spectacular to the eye. You would just want to stand and gaze at the complex and the tower.\n\nDay trip of florence could be it. \nAlso tickets for the tower is 18 euro.",

          "Bucket list. Very very touristy and crowded. I suggest to go very early, i.e., before 8:00 am or late night. Spend a few hours outside the Piazza Di Miracoli compound. The town has a lot of nice restaurants. DO NOT BUY SOUVENIRS INSIDE THE Compound. The souvenirs outside are a lot more cheaper (half or less the price).",

          "What an amazing experience! Don't eat at the touristy places close by. Food was not good. Bought souvenirs at the entrance. Pack a picnic and take everything in whilst sitting and enjoying the view around you.",

        "wiki": "Pisa Cathedral (Italian: Cattedrale Metropolitana Primaziale di Santa Maria Assunta; Duomo di Pisa) is a medieval Roman Catholic cathedral dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, in the Piazza dei Miracoli in Pisa, Italy. It is a notable example of Romanesque architecture, in particular the style known as Pisan Romanesque. It is the seat of the Archbishop of Pisa.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nConstruction on the cathedral began in 1063 (1064 according to the Pisan calendar of the time) by the architect Buscheto, and expenses were paid using the spoils received fighting against the Muslims in Sicily in 1063. It includes various stylistic elements: classical, Lombard-Emilian, Byzantine, and Islamic, drawing upon the international presence of Pisan merchants at that time. In the same year, St. Mark's Basilica began its reconstruction in Venice, evidence of a strong rivalry between the two maritime republics to see which could create the most beautiful and luxurious place of worship.\nThe church was erected outside Pisa's early medieval walls, to show that Pisa had no fear of being attacked. The chosen area had already been used in the Lombard era as a necropolis and at the beginning of the 11th century a church had been erected here, but never finished, that was to be named Santa Maria. Buscheto's grand new church was initially called Santa Maria Maggiore until it was officially named Santa Maria Assunta.In 1092 the cathedral was declared a primatial church, archbishop Dagobert having been given the title of Primate by Pope Urban II. The cathedral was consecrated in 1118 by Pope Gelasius II, who belonged to the Caetani family which was powerful both in Pisa and in Rome.\nIn the early 12th century the cathedral was enlarged under the direction of architect Rainaldo, who increased the length of the nave by adding three bays consistent with the original style of Buscheto, enlarged the transept, and planned a new facade which was completed by workers under the direction of the sculptors Guglielmo and Biduino. The exact date of the work is unclear: according to some, the work was done right after the death of Buscheto about the year 1100, though others say it was done closer to 1140. In any case, work was finished in 1180, as documented by the date written on the bronze knockers made by Bonanno Pisano found on the main door.\nThe structure's present appearance is the result of numerous restoration campaigns that were carried out in different eras. The first radical interventions occurred after the fire of 1595, following which the roof was replaced and sculptors from the workshop of Giambologna, among whom were Gasparo Mola and Pietro Tacca, created the three bronze doors of the facade. In the early 18th century began the redecoration of the inside walls of the cathedral with large paintings, the \"quadroni\", depicting stories of the blesseds and saints of Pisa. These works were made by the principal artists of the era, and a group of citizens arranged for the special financing of the project. Successive interventions occurred in the 19th century and included both internal and external modifications; among the latter was the removal of the original facade statues (presently in the cathedral museum) and their replacement with copies.\nOther notable interventions include: the dismantling of Giovanni Pisano's pulpit between 1599 and 1601 that only in 1926 was reassembled and returned to the cathedral (with some original pieces missing, including the staircase); and the dismantling of the monument to Henry VII made by Lupo di Francesco that was found in front of the door of  San Ranieri  and later substituted by a simpler, symbolic version.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe original building plan was a Greek cross with a grand cupola at the crossing, but today the plan is a Latin cross with a central nave flanked by two side aisles on each side, with the apse and transepts having three naves. The inside offers a spatial effect similar to that of the great mosques thanks to the use of raised lancet arches, the alternating layers of black and white marble, and the elliptical dome, inspired by the Moors. The presence of two raised matronea in the nave, with their solid, monolithic columns of granite, is a clear sign of Byzantine influence. Buscheto welcomed Islamic and Armenian influence.\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\n\nThe rich exterior decoration contains multicolored marble, mosaic, and numerous bronze objects from the spoils of war, among which is the griffin which was taken in Palermo in 1061 and later placed on the eastern part of the roof. In the early 19th century the original sculpture, which can now be seen in the cathedral museum, was removed from the roof and replaced with a copy. The high arches show Islamic and southern Italian influence. The blind arches with lozenge shapes recall similar structures in Armenia. The facade of grey and white marble, decorated with colored marble inserts, was built by Master Rainaldo. Above the three doorways are four levels of loggia divided by cornices with marble intarsia, behind which open single, double, and triple windows.\nThe heavy bronze doors of the facade were made by different Florentine artists in the 17th century. Contrary to what might be thought, from the beginning the faithful entered the cathedral through the door of Saint Rainerius, found in the transept of the same name, which faces the bell tower. This was because the nobles of the city, who approached the cathedral by via Santa Maria, would find themselves precisely at this entrance. This door was cast about 1180 by Bonanno Pisano, and it is the only door not destroyed by the fire of 1595 that heavily damaged the cathedral.\nThe door of Saint Rainerius is decorated with 24 bronze relief sculptures showing stories of the New Testament. This door is one of the first produced in Italy during the Middle Ages, after the importation of numerous examples from Constantinople (to Amalfi, Salerno, Rome, Montecassino, Venice, etc.), and  a completely western sensibility, detached from the Byzantine tradition, can be admired. Above the doors are four open galleries, with, at the top, the Madonna and Child and, in the angles, the four evangelists. The tomb of Buscheto is found to the left of the north door of the facade.\n\n\n=== Interior ===\n\nThe interior, subdivided at the front into a central nave flanked by two side aisles on either side and with the transept and apse in three naves, is covered with white and black marble, with monolithic grey marble columns having corinthian capitals. It has a wooden 17th-century coffered ceiling, painted and decorated with gold leaf, made by Domenico and Bartolomeo Atticciati; it bears the Medici coat of arms. Presumably the earlier ceiling was a structure with wooden trusses.\nThe inside of the dome, found where the central nave and the transepts cross, is decorated using a rare painting technique called encaustic and depicts the Virgin in glory with saints by the Pisan artists Orazio and Girolamo Riminaldi (1627-1631). Restoration of the dome began in 2015 and was concluded in 2018.\nThe granite Corinthian columns between the nave and the apse come from the mosque of Palermo, and are Pisan spoils retained in 1063 after a successful joint attack with the Normans on the Muslims in that city.\nThe large mosaic in the apse of Christ enthroned between the Virgin and Saint John is famous for the face of Saint John, painted by Cimabue in 1302, which miraculously survived the fire of 1595. This is the last work painted by Cimabue and the only work of his for which we have certified documentation. The work evokes the mosaics of the Byzantine and Norman churches found in Cefal\u00f9 and Monreale in Sicily. The mosaic, in large part made by Francesco da Pisa, was brought to completion by Vincino da Pistoia with the Madonna on the left side (1320).\nAmong the medieval works that avoided destruction during the fire of 1595 are the fresco of the Madonna with Child in the triumphal arch by the Pisan artist Maestro di San Torp\u00e8, as well as the cosmati pavement, work rarely found outside of Lazio. It was made using inlaid marble to create geometric patterns (mid-12th century).  Other fresco fragments from the late medieval period have survived, among which is Saint Jerome on one of the four central pylons, as well as Saint John the Bapstist, a Crucifixion, and Saints Cosmas and Damian on one of the pylons near the entrance, partially hidden by the entry way.\n\n\n==== The pulpit ====\n\nThe pulpit, a masterpiece made by Giovanni Pisano (1302-1310), survived the fire but was dismantled during the work of restoration and was not reassembled until 1926. With its intricate architecture and its complex sculptural decoration the work presents one of the most sweeping narratives of the 13th-century imagination which reflects the religious renewal and fervor of the era. On the slightly curved panels are sculpted with an expressive language the episodes of the life of Christ. The structure is polygonal (exactly as seen in the analogous works in the Baptistery of Pisa, in the Siena Cathedral Pulpit, and in the church of Saint Andrew); but this is the first example in a work of this type in which the panels are slightly curved. Other original features include:\n\nthe presence of caryatids, sculpted figures in place of simple columns, that symbolize the Virtues;\nthe use of scrolled 'shelving' in place of arches to support the raised platform;\nthe sense of movement given by the numerous figures that fill up every empty space.For these qualities united to the skillful narrative art of the nine scenes the pulpit is generally considered to be a masterpiece, but more broadly it is considered a masterpiece of Italian gothic sculpture. This pulpit substituted the previous one made by Guglielmo (1157-1162) that was sent to the Cagliari Cathedral. Given the lack of documentation prior to its dismantling, the pulpit was placed in a location different from its original spot, and without doubt, its parts are not in their original positions either. It is unknown if the original work possessed a marble staircase.\n\n\n==== Works of art ====\nThe church also houses the relics of Saint Rainerius, patron saint of Pisa, and the fragmentary tomb of Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor, who died at Buonconvento while holding Florence, in vain, under siege. The tomb, sculpted by Tino da Camaino between 1313-1315, was also dismantled then reconstructed and today sits in the right transept, while its original position was in the center of the apse as a sign of the city's ghibbeline adherence. Moved several times for political reasons, it eventually was separated into many parts (some inside the church, some on the facade, others in the Camposanto, and yet others in the cathedral museum).\nThe 27 paintings that cover the galleries behind the main altar, depicting stories of the Old Testament and stories of the life of Christ, were made between the 16th and 17th centuries mostly by Tuscan artists, among whom are Andrea del Sarto (three works: Saint Agnes, Saints Catherine and Margaret, and Saints Peter and John the Baptist) il Sodoma, and Domenico Beccafumi (Stories of Moses and the Evagelists).\nNumerous and prestigious are the sacred furnishings of the church, including the bronze crucifix found on the main altar, and the angel candleholders placed at the ends of the rich marble transenna, made by Giambologna, as well as the large ciborium in silver designed by Giovanni Battista Foggini (1678\u201386) on the altar of the Blessed Sacrament chapel. On the numerous side altars are located 16th and 17th century paintings. Among these works are the Our Lady of Graces with saints, by the Florentine Mannerist Andrea del Sarto, and the Madonna enthroned with saints in the right transept, by Perin del Vaga, a student of Raphael, both finished by Giovanni Antonio Sogliani. In the Baroque style are: the Disputa del Sacramento by the Sienese painter Francesco Vanni, and the Cross with saints by Genoan Giovanni Battista Paggi. Particularly well-loved is the 13th century image of the Madonna col Bambino, also called the Madonna under the organ, attributed to Berlinghiero Berlinghieri of Volterra.\nThe cathedral, like the leaning bell tower, is sinking perceptibly into the ground, and a few indications of this instability are visible. For example, the difference in the floor levels of the original nave of Buscheto and the bays which were added later by Rainaldo.\n\nThe cathedral's original gr\u00e0dule, constructed by Giovanni Pisano and dating from the late 13th century, were replaced in 1865 by the present parvise. These marble panels, decorated with carved animal figures and faces, were used to create a low wall which was placed close to the outer perimeter of the cathedral and which created an enclosure that provided space for the numerous sarcophagi from the Roman period. During the Middle Ages, these panels were reused for burials of nobles (among them Beatrice of Lorraine) and other well known persons. Some fragments are still visible in the cathedral museum, while the sarcophagi were all moved inside the fence of the Camposanto.\n\n\n=== Organs ===\nInside the cathedral are found the Serassi organ made between 1831-1835, as well as an organ made in 1977 by the company Mascioni of Cuvio.\n\n\n== Main artists who worked in the cathedral ==\n\nBuscheto (architect)\nRainaldo (facade)\nGuglielmo (original pulpit and marble decoration)The three artists listed above are buried in the cathedral.\n\nCimabue (mosaic in the apse)\nTino da Camaino (funeral monument of Henry VII)\nBonanno Pisano (original bronze doors)\nGiambologna and his school (bronze doors of the facade)\nGiovanni Pisano (pulpit)\nNicola Pisano e Giovanni Pisano (crown around the dome)\nPietro Tacca (crucifix and angel candle bearers)\nAndrea del Sarto (various paintings)\nIl Sodoma (various paintings)\nGiovanni Battista Tempesti (various paintings)\nBiduino (marble decoration)\nGiuliano Vangi (pulpit and main altar)\nOrazio Riminaldi and Girolamo Riminaldi (fresco in the dome)\nVincenzo Possenti (chandelier)\n\n\n== Of further interest ==\n\nAt the end of the 10th century Pisa established March 25 as the beginning of its new year. This date was considered very important because it is both the Feast of the Annunciation (occurring nine months before Christ\u2019s birth on December 25) and it falls very close to the spring equinox. To mark the beginning of the Pisan new year a system was devised in the cathedral whereby a beam of light shines through a round window on the south side of the nave and, precisely at noon on March 25, lands on the same spot every year: on top of a shelf affixed to a pylon on the opposite side of the church. This shelf rests on a marble egg, a symbol of birth and new life. In 1750 the first day of the new year was officially changed to January 1, but this event is still celebrated every year accompanied by solemn religious and civic celebrations.\nThe lamp at the center of the nave is called Galileo's lamp, because a legend says that the great scientist formulated his theory of isochronism of the pendulum while watching its oscillations from the roof of the nave. The original, however, smaller and very different than this one, is found today in the Camposanto.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\nOn the north side, to the left side of the facade in front of the Camposanto at about eye level, is an original piece of Roman marble (as testified to by its decoration that can still in part be seen), on which are a series of small black marks. Legend says that these marks were left by the devil when he climbed up to the dome attempting to stop its construction, and so they are referred to as the scratches of the devil. (The legend also says that out of spite the number of scratches always changes when counted.)\nLegend has it that the amphora placed on a small column on the right side of the apse was used by Christ at the wedding feast of Cana when he turned water into wine.\nPope Gregory VIII is buried in the cathedral.\n\n\n== Other images ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Note ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nPiazza dei Miracoli\nArchdiocese of Pisa\nLeaning Tower of Pisa\nBaptistery of Pisa\n\n\n== External links ==\nPlaces of Faith in Tuscany (in both Italian and English)\nStained glass windows of the cathedral of Pisa (In Italian)",

Entrance fee was \u20ac18 this includes a walk up the Leaning Tower, it\u2019s big but not glamorous, easy on the eye and have a look at the lectern, it\u2019s towers over the flock.

          "Best attraction out of the square. It\u2019s free to enter if you buy any other ticket and we spent the most time in here looking round the architecture. My partner did have to put on a bright blue cover up as he had a vest one which was hilarious and absolutely made the holiday.",
          "Very impressive both inside and out. Free to enter but if not climbing the tower you need a timed ticket from the ticket office.",

          "The Cathedral is an amazing building, very big inside with a large nave and very wide transepts. The highlights for me were the 14th century pulpit and the gold nave roof and painted dome. Entry to the Cathedral is free provided you have purchased a ticket for one of the other",

          "Duomo di Pisa was meant to be the main structure of the Piazza di Duomo, but its Leaning Tower had overshadowed everything else on that Plaza (including the Duomo). It is still worth visiting, but you are going to take far more pictures with the Tower rather than with the",
          "The dome is very beautiful and you can go inside for free, by booking the free tickets in the office in front of the building. We had to wait more than an hour, because the tickets are marked with a specific time of entrance, but it was worth it as the dome was very beautiful",
          "So much to see, so take your time. I only wish I knew more about the upper rooms they looked very impressive",
          "They are beautiful! Sleeveless shirts and shorts are not allowed. Amazing detail on both structures. You need to buy tickets for entrance. Try to buy them in advance as the lineup could be long. The acoustics are superb inside the baptistery. Every 15-30 minutes, there is",
          "The Pisa Cathedral (aka Cattedrale Metropolitana Primaziale di Santa Maria Assunta) was started in 1063 in an unique medieval Romanesque architecture style, which became know as Pisan Romanesque. The Piazza dei Miracoli and the Pisa Cathedral were constructed in celebration of",
          "the complete name of the Duomo di Pisa is Primatial Metropolitan Cathedral of the Assumtion of Mary ; construction began in 1063 and ended in 1092 and this monumental cathedral is built in Pisan Romanesque style rivaling with Saint Mark\u2019s Cathedral in Venice ; the cathedral",
          "All Duomo in Italy are impressive and this is no exception. Worth a visit if only to escape heat. An added bonus is it's free where all other surrounding buildings cost to enter.",
          "In the same square as the Tower of Pisa but a much older building, the Cathedral (Duomo) is worth a visit in its own right. The line to the Tower seemed to stretch 500 metres but there are hardly any tourists waiting to get into the Cathedral.",
          "The Cathedral is a must see. Really beautiful inside and out and I loved it. I visit Churches and Cathedrals wherever I go and this one is stunning and one of my favourites for sure. The architecture is amazing and the art too.",
          "Well worth a visit, the cathedral and the baptistry are both stunning inside and outside! Make a visit while waiting for the time slot for the leaning tower, if you have booked there (remember to do that first!)",
          "I absolutely love this place, not just the tower but the whole complex. We were just walking randomly towards the tower when it suddenly appeared into sight and the view of the whole piazza is breath-taking! Is fun to see everybody taking the classic picture of holding the tower",
          "For those who have never been, The Duomo (cathedral), Leaning Tower, and Baptistery are all in the same place called the Field of Miracles. So if you didn't realize it, you are going to get to see all three. While every one goes for the Tower, take time to appreciate this",
          "Pisa is not just about the Leaning Tower. You can also visit the Duomo (Cathedral). Body of San Ranieri is kept inside the Cathedral. Entry to the Cathedral is free, however you need to purchase a ticket to visit the rest of the sites.",
          "The Pisa Duomo is well underestimated by its bell tower - the world famous leaning tower. So, most visitors just pass it, heading to the leaning tower making selfies and all kind of poses pics. This Romanesque masterpiece in white marble occupies the central part of the Miracle",
          "Visiting the sights in Pisa can start to tot up. This cathedral is very beautiful and free to visit if you are on a budget. You must remember to collect tickets in advance at one of the the official ticket offices. The tickets are timed so you need to think ahead slightly.",
          "This cathedral is a nice escape from the humdrum of the Leaning Tower. Filled with very eye-catching art and stunning architecture, it is a lively place to sit, reflect and soak up the peaceful ambience.",
          "This is pretty much a typical Italian Church. They know how to do churches in Italy. Full of artwork, statues, and dead people relics. Lots to look at and no one stopped me taking photo's. I'm sure I didn't see anything saying I couldn't. Didn't use a flash. Easy to spend an",
          "I really enjoyed the trip to the Duomo. Joined a group of 5 with a very knowledgable guide who told really good historic stories of Pisa and the Duomo",
          "A beautiful church in a beautiful location. Worth going inside for a brief look. The art is wonderful, although it is a little dark.",
          "Exterior magical, interior too dark to appreciate. Too many cameras (not allowed) and noisy groups. One or two pieces exceptional.",
          "Founded in 1064, the Cathedral was built in 2 stages and completed untilthe last quarter of the XII Century. The fire in 1595 was devastating to the building and eventually great replacement plans for redecoration were finalized. Really a stunning structure for viewing both",
          "Just aa the rest if the buildings in the area this one is just as beautiful as the rest. Stunning architecture and details, take a closer look at the large metal doors and their intricate artwork!",
          "We came to see the tower, but the Duomo was a nice addition as was the entire piazza. We were there at sunset, and I think the crowd may die down at that time.",
          "At the piazza del duomo everything is underplayed by the famous tower but this cathedral is an absolute check box for any traveller here. This was the biggest attraction of the area excluding the tower of course. And we did encounter a minor line but nothing much compared what",
          "Pisa is full of wonderful buildings, though for many tourists the leaning tower is all there is. That\u2019s a big shame. This cathedral is beautiful, and slightly understated for all that. It\u2019s very well worth the short time it takes to walk round and admire its majesty, and take",
          "Beautiful cathedral, virtually empty (free entry), as most tourists were interested in the leaning tower only. Well worth seeing",
          "This church is beautiful inside as well as outside. Although the whole area is busy with tourists you can enjoy the church as it does not feel busy.",
          "The oldest one in between the three famous buildings on the Piazza dei Miracoli, already pushing the one thousand years of age. The Pisan Romanesque style church achieved its present appearance after several enlarging and restorations. Unfortunately- Or fortunately? -The Duomo",
          "Standing in the Square of Miracles just a short walk form The Tower of Pisa. Built almost 900 years ago, 1152, it looks in great shape. Built with a flair of the orient it is dedicated to St John The Baptist. And a surprise, this building leans a little bit too!",
          "I am so happy we plans to visit Pisa. The whole Italy seems to be the landmark where architecture, history and culture come together.",
          "the entry is free if you buy a ticket for any of the orher buildings or if you pick the ticket up at the museum. we were disappointed by how restricted the area was the one could actually visit. even though the staff try to stop misbehaving tourists (loud chinese phone calls",
          "Wow!! Well worth a visit! We were on a tour group so didn't go inside. Heaps of people everywhere but lots of places to still take amazing photos. Just amazing!",
          "you can't miss this, it adds to the whole experience of viewing the leaning tower. Beautifully restored and maintained",
          "While visiting the Piaza, we visited the Duomo. Having bought tickets to the Baptistero and the Camposanto, the entrance (without specific hour) is included; you enter when you want (a plus). The Duomo has nice decor and is surprisingly pleasant to visit. Since you have to book",
          "This is in the same complex as the Leaning Tower, and has a lot of history behind it. It's quite impressive",
          "Beautiful place, well worth a visit. Be prepared for large crowds of people but enjoy the experience.",
          "Incredible architecture for this Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta, the Duomo. We visited as part of our Pisa tour. Saw the Leaning Tower, Cathetral, Baptistery, and Camposanto.",
          "Fortunately this was included in my pass or I would've been upset at the cost. It was a let down and I spent maybe 15 minutes inside looking around. Not much to see inside but the outside was beautiful.",
          "My wife and I loved the cathedral and nearby baptistery in Pisa. There are so many wonders of art, architecture and sculpture inside as well as the beautiful white stoned view outside - be sure to catch the sculpted rear bronze door. Lovers of Renaissance and Medieval art will",
          "The Leaning Tower is the attraction to see but the Duomo and the Basilica are even more beautiful. Make sure to take it in and use the shade provided by the large buildings to grab a snack or take a break from the Hot Italian Summer.",
          "Very quiet,dignified presence.The lawns are perfect for lying down after the long walk.The tickets are available nearby the tourism office. A must do .",
          "It was so amazing to see Pisa Tower. Many tourists had fun by taking pictures Pisa Tower in the background. Also, it was so nice to enjoy sunset there!",
          "It is absolutely beautiful, and, also, for free! You need to get your free tickets in one of the tickets offices around the Piazza ( I guess, so you buy a ticket for the other monuments).",
          "The Romanesque style, repetitive. The arches inside are inspired from the Moorish style. The pulpit, made by Govanni Pisano, is beautiful.",
          "The Duomo, the 1st building in the complex, was constructed starting in 1064 and sits in the middle of Piazza dei Miricoli. It was consecrated in 1118. The interior is configured in the Latin cross design with a large central nave and 2 aisles on either side. It has a 17th",
          "Wow. This is selfie heaven. If you are not taking selfies what are you doing here!? The tower is beautiful and fascinating. However, the visit is dominated by people taking photographs. Selfie sticks everywhere. It is very difficult to appreciate the beauty of the space because",
          "Absolutely stunning external architecture. Inside is cool and peaceful, with beautiful artwork. Well worth a visit.",
          "Tickets at the close by tourist office, reasonable entry price. Stunning exterior and interior. The architecture and decoration is amazing. A must see.",
          "Everyone always focuses on the Leaning Tower (which is also wonderful to see!), but the Duomo is a beautiful site to behold. I recommend going with a guide or getting an audio guide so you can learn about the rich history of this beautiful structure.",
          "Outstanding visual beauty of trilogy of buildings. All 3 monumental buildings compliment each other.",
          "The beauty of the Duomo rivals those in Milan, Venice and Florence. Started in the 11th century and finished in the 12th, it was one of the first churches to have the moorish horizontal striping. The huge brass entry doors have Romanesque panels depicting the life of Christ.",
          "Staggering amount of pictures and other art work inside this magnificent building probably why they feel it necessary to provide a guide in multiple languages to the christian interpretation of the building which is a bit demeaning.",
          "It was hot and my kid was tired. We just stopped there and he ate and rested. I did not go inside. The building from outside is still impressive.",
          "Not only good sights but you can find hidden carvings on outside of buildings. Story is a lot of materials used came from destroyed temples and repurposed.",
          "Before we saw the tower we stopped to visit this beautiful building. There are no words to describe it on the inside. Well worth the visit to see both.",
          "We had a local guide take us through the Duomo and Baptistry. His knowledge of history in a clear concise tutorial was entertaining and informative. This of course is why we all want to visit Pisa. We want to see the bell tower, climb its stairs or hold it up in a selfie.",
          "Free access, but you still need to get a ticket. A crowd control and security measure, no doubt. Unlike the adjacent Leaning Tower, that attracts tourists, Cathedral and Museums seemed empty",
          "Offcourse we liked the Pisa tower and the Duomo but we were only there for one day and that actualy is enough. Its close to Florence so easy to combine by train!",
          "The Cathedral is definitely worth seeing. The queue is always long but when they open door it will be fast entry. The inside is amazing, with lot of history of art to see. Recommended.",
          "This comes as complimentary when bought with another attraction in the Miracoli complex. The Duomo was lovely - the gold ceiling particularly stunning.",
          "So the Duomo is included with the price of your ticket to the tower. It's quite pretty and a nice addition to your visit however I'd prioritise your visit to the tower. If time allows, then have a wander round the Duomo too.",
          "This duomo also carries a lot of history with it, located right next to the famous leaning tower. If you have time, be sure to check it out",
          "The only reason this was worth visiting is its proximity with the leaning tower. Focus on the tower. If you have time check this out.",
          "As we went to the square, we were enchated how beautiful the Duomo, unfortunately we didn't enter inside cause it was dark already but the exterior view was astonishing!",
          "We came to see the tower but were stunned by the Cathedral. Highly recommend a combo ticket for the Bapistry and Graveyard as you get unrestricted access to the Cathedral. You can get a free ticket but its at a specific time",
          "I was pleased to be able to enjoy this wonderful building. It was a busy day when we visited but we were able to really enjoy viewing it",
          "A must see so beautiful inside and out. You can get a pass to go in all the sites except the tower for \u20ac8 definitely worth it",
          "We were lucky that it was not too busy for our visit and there wass space and tiem to relax and enjoy this more. Worth the visit - definitely ! Its huge !",
          "The Duomo is so beautiful, with so much to soak up. Pay 2 Euro for the video/audio tour, it's beautiful.",
          "You have to pay to get in here, but we had bought a ticket for the tower so we could come in on that. It is very beautiful and I'm glad we went in. Wish we could have had more time in there. Spend some time in there if you can, it is worth it.",
          "This is probably obvious to everyone except us; in case it isn't, we made the mistake of coming here on a Sunday morning, during traditional Mass; we got in through the back, but had limited space to tour; still an amazingly spectacular Church!",
          "Beautiful old church with amazing art and sculptures inside. Multi language audio cassettes are available for a self guided tour.",
          "You get in here for free if you pay to go up the leaning tower. What a wonderful place this is. Probably my favourite Duomo in Tuscany. Really worth the effort.",
          "to describe the arts the opulence and the glory of Pisa. along with the leaning tower is a must see when in Italy. enjoy the art and the hospitality of Italy under the Tuscany sun.5 stars",
          "Beautiful with the details of the carvings on its walls,it complements the Leaning Tower.As the weather was brilliant we chose not to go inside.As for the tower,crowds all around.",
          "Absolutely stunning inside and out! Free entry with a ticket for any of the other attractions in the square (Tower, Cemetery, Baptistry). One side of the outside was under renovations but you can still get fantastic pictures without the scaffolding in, and all of the inside is",
          "Buy your ticket at the Tourist office for just an extra Euro coin to avoid the queue. Beautiful cathedral and paintings, statues, arches and organ.",
          "After we went up the tower, we visited here and really glad we did. It was beautiful inside, and outside,",
          "well maintained and ultra protected site . keep off the grass signs all over , used by tourists to stand on , getting shots of the leaning tower , masses of people , very clean site ,,,, drop litter get shot .... ( all those guns make me nervous ) but they keep me safe ...",
          "Very beautiful cathedral. Gorgeous mosaic over the alter. Definitely go inside when visiting the Tower",
          "You must visit this whilst you are at the leaning tower it is so impressive inside it Takes your breathe away Amazing place",
          "Visited the Duomo di Pisa whilst visiting the tower, its a beautiful building and sit opposite the tower. Well worth the visit.",
          "Free entry included on the Tower and Baptistry tickets. It would be a shame to come to Pisa and not visit all 3 outstanding examples of medieval architecture.",
          "With 8 euros you can see this building and other 3 others. Is very worth it just for this building alone. Is amazing once you get inside. You will find the lamp at the center of the nave is called Galileo's lamp, there is a legend saying that the great scientist formulated his",
          "In my opinion it is more beautifully made tower than the Leaning tower of Pisa, but is very much understated and lesser photographed. Sadly people Come to visit and have photographs with leaning tower only.",
          "We took a tour, and always like tours for the in-depth information and cool facts they provide, that we would otherwise miss. This was more impressive than the leaning tower. There is a bathroom, long lines, and you have to pay.",
          "Duomo di Pisa is next to The Leaning Tower of Pisa. The church is very amazing from Inside and there are lot of stories about this place. Famous among students.",
          "The Leaning Tower gets all the attention, but this cathedral is astonishing in its own right. Huge in scale, with an amazing panelled ceiling and some beautiful artwork to look at too. I\u2019m quite sure many tourists are blown away by it, perhaps because they just weren\u2019t",
          "The Cathedral has a special architecture and is worth visiting. Both inside and out. Inside has wonderful sculptures, paintings, chapels, etc.",
          "The cathedral is accessed from the back near the baptistry and you will need a ticket (either the \u20ac18 tower ticket, the \u20ac5 ticket or \u20ac1 if you buy with another building) to enter but once inside there's a few different things to note. The chocolate box coffins like over in the",
          "The Duomo is so much more impressive than expected. The interior is really beautiful. Amazing floor, amazing roof, impressive sculptures and glass.",
          "The scale and opulence of this cathedral is breathtaking. How they built structures like this nearly a 1,000 years ago is mind-boggling. The highlights are the pulpit and the ceilings.",
          "I've never seen anything like it and I travel a lot. The inside is really magnificent and magical, I didn't expect it to be this beautiful :)",
          "The cathedral of Pisa has it all - a fabulous mosaic in the altar area, a coffered ceiling, beautiful floor, Pisano sculpted pulpit, stained glass, and various altars with artwork. It is definitely worth getting the combination ticket to see it.",
          "The inside of the cathedral is terrific. The exquisite marble ambo is truly something to behold. One of my favorites ancient houses of worship in all of Italy.",
          "Entrance to this historic and interesting building was included on our pass. With outside temperatures above 30C this was a welcome shady stop. The exciting staircase within the walls up to the viewing platform, was an adventure in itself for the kids! The fantastic views from",
          "We were on a tour and visited the area late in the day. When we tried to enter they advised us about having to get a ticket. We would not have had enough time to get it and enter. We asked if we could just take a peak, and they absolutely refused. Exterior is wonderful to look",
          "I was surprised and delighted to discover that there were other historic structures connected with the world famous Leaning Tower and even more surprised that this Cathedral exceeded the Tower in impressiveness. Construction began in 1063 and was originally completed in 1180",
          "The Duomo di Pisa is worth the visit. You typically only hear about the leaning tower never about the Duomo.",
          "Free entry, you just need to get a pass from the ticket office. Stunning alternating black and white marble, pieces of art dating back to the 1200\u2019s. Don\u2019t skip this if you just come for the tower.",
          "Another historical beauty in the same area as leaning Pisa . You have to be there to believe the beauty and admire this attraction. Governor Amolak Rattan Kohli",
          "The exterior has very beautiful design and engravings. The beauty continues inside. The paintings, alter, carvings, and so much more must be seen as description of such would not do it justice.",
          "The impressive exterior of the Duomo is only surpassed by the beauty of the interior. I didn't have much time to spend as I had to get back to the train station, but I was amazed at the paintings, sculptures, ceilings and floors. The best part is it is free to go inside with",
          "We were impressed by the beautiful exterior of the Duomo, mostly made of white marble. (And interesting because some of it was apparently recycled from Roman stones, including tombstones with carvings still visible on them.) We were only able to spend about 10 minutes inside,",
          "Forget about leaning tower, instead go inside Duomo and you will be amazed by richness of arts and architecture, sculptures. This church is fully completed and has amazing interior , definitely worth seeing, it was nice surprise.",
          "Of course I know Duomo very well. Still, last week I had a visit from relatives. It is always beautiful and amazing. Stricking to see how Cordoba Mosque is at the heart of this unique Church. Also, visit is free but sometimes there is a crowd and you get a time slot: plan.",
          "One of the Best in this surroundings with all amenities, you can have some Relaxed Time their, highly Recommended",
          "This place is free to visit if you buy any of the other monuments. And it shouldn't be missed. The interior is overwhelming. The details are impressive, and the paintings are incredible. It is a very beautiful duomo,and shouldn't be skipped.",
          "Definitely my favourite from all the cathedrals we saw in Tuscany. Construction began in 1063 by the architect Buscheto. St. Mark's Basilica in Venice was being constructed at the same time and there is an evidence of rivalty between the two republics to see which would create",
          "Due to standing in line for the climb to the top of the Leaning Tower, I did not have much time to see the Duomo and I was very rushed trying to meet a departure deadline. What I was able to see was amazing, although I felt cheated that I didn't have time to enjoy this beautiful",
          "There is a 5E charge to get into the Duomo, but when you go in you can climb to the dome and there is a nice view of the basilica and the tower, making for a nice photo op.",
          "This is a nice Duomo inside out even though when we visited they were doing some works so we were not allowed to see everything.",
          "This Cathedral was built in the late 1090\u2019s, as creation for who can build the most beautiful and luxurious place of worship against the Venetians at that time. This 900 year old structure is a prime example of Pisan Romanesque style made with various colors of marble",
          "I think everything in the area leans. It was all built on bad ground and made of heavy marble. The walk around the basilica is a must.",
          "We walked around the outside of these buildings and looked at the details in the doors and statues. We opted not to go inside as it was too expensive for a family. I am not paying to go into a church.",
          "This is a very beautiful church, Duomo Cathedral. The exterior design looks so fake, just like wallpapers, it\u2019s amazing!",
          "The church is located right next to the leaning tower of Pisa. The building is good and the interior is also very impressive.",
          "We took a day-trip from Florence to Pisa to see the Leaning Tower, without knowing about the Duomo. As we learned the Leaning Tower is just the bell tower for the church. The church is much more interesting and impressive than the Leaning Tower. It's not as big or impressive as",
          "The Duomo di Pisa is extraordinary! Absolutely remarkable features and gorgeous details in the paintings, statues, and structure. You will be mesmerized by the incredible ceiling I have never seen one like it. Truly a must see. Regardless of time, the art work depicted from many",
          "You get a free ticket to enter this cathedral when you buy a ticket for the tower. Most people queue for the tower and climb it, but if you get a chance then go in this cathedral it is beautiful and lovely to be somewhere that is so quiet after battling with the crowds outside.",
          "Our 1st time visit this cathedral, you can enter for free with tickets that you must collect at their museum/office. Expecting great Italian art inside the cathedral. Please come with humble heart and peace in your heart and mind. Feel the presence and peaceful of God.",
          "Had a guide taking us around this Cathedral and what a fascinating place both historically and visually. Its part of the tower complex and is a must see and go in attraction.",
          "On our tour of Italy we have see many churches and this one was better than most. The art work internally is really stunning.",
          "A grand cathedral with beautiful interior. Has a few wonderful mosaics, of which I am a huge fan. It wasn't very crowded in end Oct so it was nice. You need a ticket to get in, but it is free. I got mine online in conjunction with the tower climb.",
          "You can get free entry but it is timed and there will be a wait. Buy an entry for the Miracoli and Baptistry and you get free admisiion at any time. This church was a revelation - i would rate it better than the Duomo in Florence and San Marco in Venice - best of all it wasn't",
          "A ticket to any other of the buildings in the Piazza will give you entry to the duomo as part of the package, otherwise you will have to queue to get a ticket to just the church (free entry on its own I believe). Definitely worth visiting if you are here -probably for the tower.",
          "The Duomo here is just a lovely place. TheLeaning Tower should not be the only attraction for your visit to Pisa.",
          "Truly magnificent Cathedral with some outstanding works of art hidden inside! The episcopal pulpit with lions figures is one of these Renaissance treasures. The entrance to the Duomo is free (just need to get a free ticket at the ticket office), so don\u2019t miss it for any reason.",
          "Lovely place would go here again. Don't forget to get a ticket from the ticket office for free to enter. Or you can use your pisa tower ticket.",
          "The grounds and garden outside is beautiful to spend time and relax in. The tickets are available for the museum and burial and other places to see. With kids it becomes difficult to explore more. It\u2019s definitely worth a visit.",
          "As part of your package buy admittance to the Duomo , museum, Baptistry and the burial area. Great visit, good things to see and do.",
          "The Duomo has undergone recent renovations and is really a beautiful site. The entry is free, however, you must have a timed ticket(available at ticket office behind tower) or if you purchase tickets to other buildings you can enter without a reservation. We bought a ticket",
          "Duomo of Pisa is a sign of power, I see in Italy so much history every step around historic part of city!",
          "A great pilgrimage site! Besides the famous leaning bell tower, the Cathedral and Baptistry show forth a long history of Catholic Faith. Great visually and spiritually. The grand scale shows forth a time when Pisa was a major sea power and wealthy. It shows how much it\u2019s",
          "The entry is free but a ticket must be obtained to enter but must have time to enter. From the outside the doors and dome is amazing. One has to plan a dull day to get time to go inside or else just appreciate from the outside",
          "This cathedral is not particularly remarkable apart from the West End which can clearly be seen to have sunk. They clearly have a bit of a subsidence problem across the whole site! The cathedral is large and was not overly busy when we went. Worth a look if the queues are",
          "This is a timed-entry site. Tickets are free, but you need to get them in the building off to the side. Totally worth the visit.",
          "Can you give 6 stars? Absolutely breathtaking cathedral on the plaza with the learning tower Incredibly beautiful",
          "The masterful cathedral of Pisa was designed by the great architect Buschetto in a recognizable Pisan Romanesque style in the 11th century. The huge building is about one hundred meters long and over fifty meters high and its marvelous facade is one of the most imposing",
          "Very close to the tower and well worth a visit, nice and cool on the inside if its hot outside.Amazing scenes inside.",
          "Looking at the Duomo and trying to fix the best selfie, like any others of the mass of tourists, you are trying to figure out why the Duomo is not fallen. All tourist are asking this question, when you find an acceptable solution you can start admiring this beautiful",
          "We aren\u2019t fans of going into EVERY church in Italy. We did go into this as it was included in our ticket price. If you like churches this one has everything you\u2019d expect, huge paintings, a dome, massive pulpit( feel sorry for the poor lions holding it up\ud83d\ude09). It also has a mummy",
          "This Duomo was simply amazing inside (even liked it more than the one in Florence). The details on everything inside just kept making us say ohhhh and ahhhh. We were impressed with all the amazing architecture.",
          "This cathedral far surpassed our expectations. We both thought it more beautiful than the highly rated Duomo in Florence. You need a timed to ticker to enter but it's free. Definitely worth a visit",
          "We first visited as part of a walking tour. The doors by which you enter give a clue as to what you will find inside. It\u2019s huge and the ceiling is highly ornate, and the original pulpit is a riot of carving. I wasn\u2019t a massive fan of the tomb of St Ranieri but it\u2019s still worth",
          "Quite a simple Duomo, the outside looks amazing but as soon as you enter inside there is nothing impressive to see there.",
          "We entered the Duomo with a guide on a walking tour. It is such a beautiful and historic building from a time when Pisa was powerful. I loved all the different marbles used and the leaning tower adjacent.",
          "Most amazing interior - need to spend a fair time inside to take everything in.Dress code no hats etc",
          "It is absolutely incredible to view such a beautiful dome. Impressive architecture and so vast. The entire area is a wonder not to be missed should you be in Pisa or nearby.",
          "Was part of our Leaning Tower ticket so went in for a look - Pretty impressive. If there is a service, you can only walk in at the back (and supposed to stay quiet). We went back with the same ticket later when no service and got to walk around the whole thing.",
          "Hello, We were at this duomo with our son, it\u2019s very big and impressive. Inside the interior is very well preserved, with good acoustics. Go and visit it! Enjoy!",
          "The Cathedral of Pisa is very beautiful! Its architecture is very impressive. It is beautiful both inside and outside. The color \"gold\" predominates in the ceiling. It has precious details in every part of the cathedral: sacred images, paintings, stained glass... It is amazing.",
          "What a lovely basilica. Much better than the one in Florence which looked impressive from the outside but a major let down on the inside. This church is magnificent and well worth a visit.",
          "This amazing cathedral celebrating 900 years since it\u2019s official dedication is a church of inspiring beauty. You need a ticket to enter even though it\u2019s free. Don\u2019t miss it. Highest recommendation",
          "The ceiling the Medici installed was golden and outstanding with their symbol in the center of course. The striped Islamic marble abounds. Also, the chandelier\u2019s oscillations fascinated Galileo as a child.",
          "This Piazza houses 4 great treasures and this is one of them. This is a medieval Roman Catholic Cathedral. It doesn\u2019t matter what your religion when you enter you will want to genuflect out of respect. The church was completed in 1092. Inside is filled with multicolored marble",
          "Beautiful place to visit. Remember to book your tickets in advance or go for them when the office opens as it gets ever so busy.",
          "The building is really nice, the environtment is peaceful but of course with lots of tourists but there is a lawn which is really nice and well-kept. So you can sit down and enjoy your break in the middle of the day. The view is great, you can see the tower, the duomo, and the",
          "The outside of this place presents very well as it has been well maintained and is in pristine condition. But that doesn\u2019t prepare you for the striking beauty when you enter inside. The marble floors gleam under the pillars and archways all the way to the romanesque ceiling.",
          "Beautiful Cathedral, worth a visit. By the way it is quite large so allow a bit more than a quarter of an hour even if it is just to say \u201cI\u2019ve been there\u201d.",
          "Wasn\u2019t expecting this gem when we went to visit the tower. It is simply stunning. I could add the same photo that have been previously reviewed but it can\u2019t get better than actually going yourself and standing in that beautiful building",
          "This is a masterpiece! The exterior is impressive, but the interior (and its most interesting history) is truly amazing. The black and white marble, the bronze work, the gold leaf, the paintings depicting stories of the Old Testament and the life of Christ gives insight into",
          "After the kinda drabness of the rest of the town this fabulous complex made the journey worthwhile. enjoy",
          "If you want to see something that is stunning and beautiful you really need to see this cathedral, the detail is incredible and to be there in person is breathtaking, photos don\u2019t do it justice. It\u2019s something that you would have to see. Definitely recommend seeing this",
          "This is part of the Field of Miracles and it looks stunning from outside. But we did a mistake by pre booking the inside. There was nothing worth seeing. We just spent the time to rest our legs and sit in shade inside the building. I wouldn't recommend to go inside.",
          "Beautiful building inside and out, less queuing than for the Pisa tower and more to see, buy a package ticket for both and save time and money, recommended.",
          "Great pre reserved building they were celebrating 900 years of age.great spot to visit in Pisa.must see location",
          "Our first visit to Pisa and we booked all 5 of the attractions at the Duomo di Pisa all 5 are worth a visit and would recommend all of them they range from breathtaking views to solemnity. Lots of places to eat but check out a few before deciding.",
          "This is worth the entrance fee, feast your eyes on the Dumo facade before entering built of coloured sandstone. The pulpit by Pisano is a highlight as well as the marble floor.",
          "Seeing all these monumental places in one square is brilliant, really. The cathedral is free, as it should be. We sat in on a mass, that was special. After, you were allowed to walk around and take photos, it\u2019s really spectacular. The art of the marble floors, worth it alone to",
          "It is the centre of the Pisa complex though the tower is more touristically known because of its leaning but it is the tower of the duma but strangely separate",
          "This is within the same complex as the Leaning Tower. Its very interesting to see and learn of the history of this place. Don't miss the photo opportunities!",
          "The Duomo is a beautiful cathedral well worth a visit. Granted there are more impressive cathedrals but this one is really nice. Access is free I think but we had to show our combination ticket anyway.",
          "Simple design but still massive and inspiring. Dress appropriately or you will be asked to purchase a strange looking disposable poncho. A scarf over your shoulders will do. Lots of info inside plus you can watch people clean and preserve the fixtures.",
          "This place has a beautiful interior, white marbles, gold ceilings, paintings, stained glasses, mosaics, sculptures, you name it and this cathedral has it all. It's a beautiful place to go in Pisa. A day's trip is enough for this city.",
          "Hopefully our guide Katerina explained to us so many details about tower and churches making our tour a unique experience. There is only one spot that you can shoot the perfect illusion photo (holding the tower). Go around and find it. Dont stop walking.",
          "Go visit... It's a beautiful unexpected eclectic mixture of styles due to the group of builders that included among others, Moorish prisoners. It's unlike any Italian church I have ever visited.",
          "I have visited before but the ceiling paintings never fail to take my attention. Do sit and take a while to admire the decoration and calmness of this Cathedral. You do need a ticket in advance and these can be bought from the shop at the back of the green square with the",
          "Architecture, white marble, colonnial facades, paintings, gold ceiling, stained glass, mosaics, sculptures, you name it in this cathedral.. a place to visit to stay in awe",
          "love seeing this place have been going since 1968 and it never changes use to could walk right around the tower but its now only the top 2 floors still amazing",
          "We purchased a multi-attraction ticket on the official website before we left the UK and, although entry to the leaning tower is on a strictly timed basis, you're free to enter the Duomo (and the other attractions) at a time of your choice. On that basis, we left our Duomo visit",
          "Very beautifull example of Pisan arhitectural style, a romanesque basilica in white marble, is just unique. The interior is also very beautifull.",
          "It would be easy to pass by the Cathedral at Pisa and not bother going in. After all, you came for the leaning tower, right? But it\u2019s well worth taking the time go inside. It is filled with art treasures, including an incredible, highly sculpted pulpit. And there is a hidden",
          "Beautiful Duomo, that would be worth the visit even if it wasn't for the tower. You can get joint ticket whichis worthwhile. Some beautiful paintings inside, and the remains of San Ranieri on show.",
          "Entrance to this is free so definitely worth going inside if you are in Pisa. You need to cover your shoulders if you have a strappy dress or if the back of your dress is low or cut out (but they give you a paper poncho type thing to wear!)",
          "When you come to Pisa and see this you realize how small you actually are! almost a thousand years old, this beautiful cathedral is a must see for any tourist! This place left me speechless!!!",
          "Great white church, like you can find in almost each town in toscany. Its located next to the famous pisa tower",
          "Most people visit Pisa for the Tower but the Baptistry and Doumo are much less crowded and great places to cool down on a hot day. Dont forget to cover your shoulders otherwise you have to were a funny poncho.",
          "The heart of the piazza, the cathedral is more than 900 years old and has an elaborately carved pulpit.",
          "Make sure you visit the top of the tower - really impressive and fun to walk up the leaning tower :)",
          "Had it not been in the Square of Miracles, we might not have visited this church. However, you\u2019ll find that once at the Square, there\u2019s not much to do besides the Leaning of Tower and a few other buildings of interests so you\u2019ll find yourself visiting them. It is beautiful but",
          "You get spoiled with many of the finest cathedrals in the world in Italy. And if Pisa's isn't quite at that level, it's still excellent inside and out - and pleasantly free for a change. You can either go in free with a ticket for the tower or other campo dei miracoli",
          "We walked round the outside but didn\u2019t go in. It is impressive. You may as well look whilst there to see the tower as it\u2019s just next to it. Parts of it are still being cleaned which demonstrates the contrasting colours.",
          "A definitely must see if you\u2019re in Pisa, and so come to the tower. Unexpectedly lovely, overshadows the other attractions in the square of miracles. Take a shawl if you planning on having a scrappy dress or too on.",
          "Was really blown away by the beauty inside the Duomo. Such an interesting history. Be sure to check out the alter and pulpit which are very modern, and controversial! Galileo\u2019s inspiration for his work on gravity also came from here.... via a swinging pendulum on a huge",
          "Thanks a truly amazing building which you can't help but admire wether religious or not. Worth a visit!",
          "I really like this place. It is very interesting to hear about its history as well. I highly recommend it \ud83d\ude42",
          "It's worth spending time here. They limit access and so you are able to soak up the interior splendor without being rushed. And the architecture and art are just wonderful.",
          "It is quite special to experience the image what you always see on the news or on someone else's pics. Because we were a tourist, the typical pic with the tower shouldn't be missed.",
          "Our tour guide booked us ahead for our entry to the cathedral. The entrance is free but have to be on time otherwise our ticket will be forfieted. Inside is not crowded since per entry of visitors are in small batches. You can take pictures and be marveled with the ceiling and",
          "This unbelievable landmark is well worth a visit as is the leaning tower but there is not too much else about Pisa to see but still worth a visit",
          "This is one of the many beautiful churches in Italy and of a number of lovely buildings in this area. We didn't have time to go inside but am sure the inside is just as lovely.",
          "This cathedral is adjacent to a baptistry and a bell tower. The latter is better known as the leaning tower of Pisa. It's a nice cathedral but we couldn't go all the way in because there was a mass when we visited. Check out the lovely doors, though. Well worth a look.",
          "The leaning tower is certainly a sight to behold, but the cathedral is the real star here. Pisa itself is a bit of a disappointment (essentially an industrial city), but the old town and area immediately surrounding the cathedral is what you'd hope for. The decoration of the",
          "A very busy attraction but it is beautiful to visit. You need to get a ticket but it is free to enter.",
          "The Duomo is in line with the Leaning Tower and Baptistry. All are within about a 2 block area, making them easy to see.",
          "So I just wanted to visit the Cathedral but on reaching entrance was directed to the other side of the Field of Miracles to get a free ticket. Boiling hot but queued in ticket office to get the free ticket which was timed for 11.45 am. Bearing in mind there was no queue",
          "On entering the duomo we were given paper covers for our shoulders (we had forgotten to bring scarves). The duomo is ornate as you would expect from a Roman Catholic church. You may take photos inside.",
          "if you are in Pisa you need to visit this beautiful church and hire a guide to take a tour of this church.",
          "I went early season to Pisa, the attraction was busy but not overcrowded. The grounds are beautifully kept. The ticket office is in the customer service office opposite. They sell tickets on time slots about 30 at a time so, there is no pushing and shoving. Actually it's very",
          "Only went in as it was free with our ticket for going up the tower, and what a surprise! It is beautiful and far more ornate than expected. Worth walking around and it is cool in the July heat.",
          "Came for the tower, stayed for the Duomo. The Duomo was absolutely beautiful. We stopped in Pisa for the tower, but the Duomo absolutely is the show stealer.",
          "So Italy is full of beautiful Cathedral and this is one of them. Our family loves church history so we were fascinated.",
          "Located right next to the tower itself this stunning cathedral is beautiful from every angle inside and outside. To actually get inside the building which we did to kill time before climbing the tower and to get out the sun you have to get a ticket which is free. The queue was",
          "Worth a look inside. It's free though you need to book a time slot. Allow 20 mins to walk round. Very interesting though pretty busy.",
          "Make sure to cover up, they are not very helpful if you don't understand how to put the green material on. Basically, it was a bit day so we wore sleeveless tops, at the door, we were given green material, I put it on like a wrap and was practically scolded by the lady, who",
          "A beautiful, large cathedral that was started almost 1000 years ago, although the current appearance is due to centuries of additions and modifications. You'll need a timed ticket to enter but these are free from the ticket office. The interior, while a little less spectacular,",
          "It is a \"must see\", stunning building. Spacious, beautifully decorated and elegant. Although cathedral in Florence is more famous (purely because of dome size I think) this one is by far more interesting. Spend some time exploring details. Walls are covered with paintings. Entry",
          "I can never get tired of seeing beautiful buildings, luckily within the space of 100 metres you get two, the Duomo and the LeaningTower, doesn't get much better than this.",
          "It was a lot of people around the Leaning tower, but not too much. Great to see this monument, which is a must when in Pisa.",
          "One of the best cathedral in Italy. Not only from outside, but inside is full of white marble carvings, and a lot of valuable treasures. It is a must to visit.",
          "The cathedral is part of the piazza that also has the leaning tower of Pisa. It is actually the main building of the complex and is a beautiful historical marble building with intricate decorations inside of religious paintings, sculptures etc.",
          "If visiting the area make sure to come here and the Tower of Pisa, they are both musts for tourists in the area. It is a really nice cathedral and a lot to see inside there. It is free but you need a ticket from one of the other sites to get in.",
          "When we visited Pisa our chosen restaurant was closed so was the Opera del Duomo museum which I had wanted to visit and then to cap it all the ticket clerk told us the cathedral was closed too! As a result we had to walk round outside. The beauty of the building can also be",
          "The Duomo is almost overlooked by most people who are much more interested in the Leaning Tower. It is fairly typical looking on the outside but I was impressed by the gold leaf covered ceiling of the interior. Masses are held four times on Sundays and anyone can go, the first",
          "Fantastic cathedral, lots to see, around it. Did not have enough time to do it justice, will return agin in the near future to see.",
          "My family visited there on June 21. It\u2019s around 10 minuets walked from tourists car parking and drop off area. Also a part of Miracle Square at Pisa. It\u2019s located near Leaning Tower. It was great and 2nd time visit for me and my wife. But 1st visit for our daughter. It\u2019s really",
          "As most of the cathedrals in Italia it\u2019s quite big and looks great from outside, unfortunately there isn\u2019t much of interest in the inside. In any case I still think it\u2019s the best visit in Pisa and unexpectedly it\u2019s free. Almost any regular church in Firenze is more interesting",
          "The Duomo is next to Pisa tower, can enter together with the same Pisa ticket. It's not very big and not very crowded, still worth a visit.",
          "This building is wedding cake worthy. Almost doesnt look real. Clean and well maintained, also very safe.",
          "This duomo is within the confines of the walls surrounding the leaning tower of Pisa about 300-m from the tower. Its age is about the same as the leaning tower and resembles any cobstruction in Italy..",
          "Comparing to Domes in other cities this one is really small but still nice inside. Better to visit the Dome and the tower in morning hours to avoid the crowds of tourists.",
          "See my prior review with pictures but this is stunning. The most beautiful of all the cathedrals we visited while in Italy. A must see.",
          "The Duomo has a free standing bell tower. The famous Leaning Tower of Pisa. A beautiful structure in a pristine setting. Many tourist around but not exclusively crowded. A must visit venue while in Pisa",
          "If you are in Pisa anyway, you might as well go inside the Duomo. It's beautiful. And it doesn't take long to walk inside and look around.",
          "This is a great place to learn about the history of the people of Pisa, their architecture, and their beliefs. Inside lies the body of a really respectful person called San Ranieri. The Duomo di Pisa sits on the square of Miracles, right next to the bell tower(leaning tower of",
          "We booked tickets in advance. No logic with who enters when. When we came in a old guy started to shout at us in italian. I asked him politely in English what it was about.. he was very aggressive- waving arms in the air.. he told us to cover our shoulders. 3/4 had sleeveless",
          "As part of our visit of the Leaning Tower our entry ticket included access to the cathedral, and whilst it was open, we could only access the immediate entry area at the very back of the cathedral because it was Sunday and Mass was in session. Hence, nor were we allowed to take",
          "We did a day trip to Pisa and visited the Duomo, the architecture was stunning and the inside not to be sneezed at. With the rest of the sights worth going out of your way to get there.",
          "The Cathedral is not to be missed when visiting the Miracle of Squares that includes the leaning tower. This is such a beautiful medieval cathedral with its intricacies and nuances that include its bronze doors, granite and marble columns. Great effort has been made to preserve",
          "Whilst visiting Pisa do not ignore Duomo whilst focusing on the Bell tower. The exterior is currently being refurbished but the interior is very impressive.",
          "With so much to see, and so much to learn, a guided tour is well worth the expense. Book in advance and avoid the queues.",
          "Visited whilst on a cruise which stopped in Livorno - train journey approx 6\u20ac return per person and takes about 20mins. You can walk to Duomo square in about 20mins for Pisa train station. Stunning architecture and a great way to spend a relaxing hour strolling the grounds.",
          "Pisa is o lovely city, can get very busy in the season and it is advisable to get there early collect your timed ticket for the clime up the leaning tower a must when you are there. This is not the only thing to do as the Duomo is very interesting and on a hot day lovely to get",
          "Visit is free once you have a ticket from the ticket office. Need to cover shoulders however you are provided with a thin tabard if you aren\u2019t prepared. It really is a lovely place to visit. Inside you can light a candle and leave a donation in the boxes provided. Very",
          "this was pretty much the only nice thing in Pisa. the cathedral is nice and majestic. you can get a free entrance ticket in the ticket office (the only thing you don't have to pay for in Pisa).",
          "I visited the Pisa Duomo on a Sunday in June. The first thing that strikes you when you walk in to the square (also containing the leaning tower, baptistery and other buildings) is just how clean it is. The grass is like a perfect lawn and the buildings are shining with their",
          "There are a lot of reviews for this site but I have not seen one particularly for the Baptistery. It has some lovely stained glass but the acoustics in the place are amazing. While I was there a singer came out and sang. The place just lit up acoustically and she began to",
          "You need a timed ticket to get into the Cathedral so I recommend you get that first before spending lots of time taking photographs of the tower. The cathedral has a beautiful altar but for me the most amazing piece of architecture was the Pulpit by Pisano. It is simply amazing",
          "This is really pretty! The grounds are perfectly kept and the buildings are amazing works of art. It's worth the trip.",
          "An amazing medieval site beautifully maintained and organized. Yes it's touristy but totally justified. Don't miss it and Take your time",
          "Pisa's cathedral is in harmony with and as beautiful as the Leaning Tower. However the management is laughable. To get in, one must get a ticket (free) from the ticketing office. Each visitor is assigned a time slot and cannot enter the cathedral before that time, even if no one",
          "Didn\u2019t even realise what this was until we walked towards the tower. It\u2019s surrounded by lovely lawns and was very busy or so it seemed walking by. The building is right next to the leaning tower so it\u2019s 2 for the price of one with these attractions.",
          "No photo can really do justice to these majestic buildings in their serene setting with green lawns and enclosinf walls. The interior of the Duomo is sublime with its altar by Niccolo Pisano and the Baptistry offers a smaller, simpler version.",
          "I enter this church and get overwhelmed by the overall darkness, the richness of the decoration, the image of a God and a church \u2018out there\u2019 that compares and judges. This is the opposite of say, La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, and is far from the message of Jesus who was",
          "This is a marvel of architecture and construction, It dates to 1064 when construction commenced and was consecrated in 1118 but not completed until the later years of the century. The structure was largely destroyed by fire in 1595 and the present building is a mix of materials",
          "Very well decorated interior. Polychromy thorough out the building. Closes a bit earlier than other places in the clomplex.",
          "Amazing place . A must see . Beautiful and lots to do in the area . Bring your camera . Italy is beautiful go somewhere different every year . This time stayed in pisa and got the trains to Florence and lucca . Then did 2 trips Tuscany and islands . Seinna a good day to",
          "sadly didnt get and as visits are timed with free tickets but the outside is a marvel and the square even though full of tourists is beautiful",
          "The Duomo is a beautiful building and well worth a visit. It is actually free to get in and if you buy tickets for the other monuments then you can visit any time. If you just want to go in the Duomo you get a free timed entry ticket and these are limited by numbers.",
          "Italy is loaded with so many gorgeous buildings and so much history you may be on overload. This is just another to enjoy",
          "This is a brilliant place to visit. The art is spectacular check out the ceiling. Entry is fre with the other locations in Pisa",
          "Worth a visit if you have not been. Big crowds pretending to \"hold up\" the tower. I think this spot would be the main attraction in the city of Pisa. The duomo is pretty inside.",
          "The Duomo in Pisa is something you should not loose if you are close to the tower. It\u2019s a nice glance of the richness of the Italian churches, and it has some details of art and painting very interesting.",
          "Buy a pass for eight euros and visit four buildings on site. Worth every penny to see the amazing art and artefacts",
          "Leaning Tower of Pisa is actually the cathedral\u2019s Free standing bell tower. It\u2019s indeed a sight to behold. I bought the entry ticket inside and walked up the narrow marble staircases up to the top part where all the bells are. The view on top is very good. But I think the best",
          "The highlight of this church is the 14th century marble pulpit with 400 sculpted figures. During our visit, art restorers were working on the pulpit, though only half was covered so we could still examine this delicate work.",
          "I visited this site in a wheelchair. I was able to see all areas, although obviously not up any stairs to upper levels. There were sufficient ramps and disabled entrances, I was treated with total respect and kindness. The floor surface in the cemetery is, naturally, uneven",
          "A large church undergoing some interior renovation, but not impeding seeing the beauty of the church. Because of it's size it handles crowds reasonably well. The entire area surrounding the tower and church gets thousands of people daily. To get to the area you have to walk the",
          "A sight not to be missed! With a sprawling bed of freshly cut grass which would invite one to sit or lie down to.",
          "Our flight got cancelled and we had one extra day to spend in Tuscany and of course Pisa was #1choice. Very impressive cathedral and totally worths combining the visit with all the sightseeing\u2019s around. We got totally impressed by this place and we enjoyed our day. If you by a",
          "Entry to the cathedral came free with our ticket to the leaning tower, so we ventured in and have to say we were underwhelmed. Having visited many such buildings we felt this was a bit disappointing being rather dark. It's worth a look as it was free.",
          "Why wouldn't you see the inside? It's free and beautiful. Spent a few days in Pisa and there was never a line to get in or to get tickets.",
          "We have visited many cathedrals throughout Europe and to be fair, this was no better than any of the others. Nice to be able to sit down and reflect in the peace and quiet though. Still worth a visit.",
          "A big building just another typical Duomo / church with all of the usual inside, have seen far too many of these on this trip.",
          "Actually the Tower of Pisa is more beautiful because it is Leaning... I'm sure if it was just like the Duomo di pisa it would not be as beautiful.... Duomo di pizza has its own beauty and you cannot miss it if you go to see the Tower of Pisa because it is just next to it...",
          "The actual church inside is strikingly lovely! Some incredible works of art and the ceiling is gorgeous. The grounds of this area are nice and peaceful with people lying around on the grass and relaxing. The pick pockets are very bad in this area, and unfortunately Pisa seemed",
          "So glad we went inside! They have pocket guides in various languages at entrance to help you view, learn, understand the Cathedral and the religion. This is a beautiful cathedral with interesting background.",
          "I love this type of Cathedral. Clean..well preserved and surrounded by large green fields. Breath taking!!",
          "Very impressive and beautiful place. Just walk around and you will be amazed. From any angle you will love it, and you won't stop taking pictures.",
          "a walk around the area and a sit on the grass second time in 11 years how lucky - to people watch very crowded busy day and beautiful skies to make it amazing",
          "Most people come to see the leaning tower and the bonus is the see the Pisa Cathedral as well. This is a medieval Roman Catholiccathedral dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, in the Piazza dei Miracoli. It is a notable example of Romanesque architecture. It is the",
          "Taking a walk in the city is just enough to be satisfied. The beautiful old houses with the great Italian architect and the variety of colors was a sightseeing by them self. The famous piazza del duomo with Pisa leaning tower was a really crowded place , my opinion is to visited",
          "Architecture is amazing, also appears to be sinking as well, follow the stripes...how utterly cool!!",
          "A wonderful cathedral with some stunning pieces of artwork. There was some restoration works going on so didn't see some of it, but didn't stop us from enjoying what was on show.",
          "The three major attractions are in the same locations ,but definitely pre-book whether online or through tour operators.It seems that the lines for booking tickets onsite are always long and since usually it is a day trip to Pisa you don\u2019t want to waste your time standing in a",
          "Large cathedral located next to the tower. When we visited, scaffolding surrounded the dome. It does not really detract from the overall effect of the building. Not as opulent as the Duomo down the road in Florence but still one that must be seen.",
          "You can go into the church for free , but you get your ticket far from the entrance,is silly being in the entrance , going for ticket and returning, so I do not waste time, I saw Florence doumo that was the best",
          "Pisa Cathedral or Duomo di Pisa costs EUR 5 to go in when there is no Mass service taking place or is free of charge to go in if you have a ticket for the Leaning Tower as well that costs EUR 18 for the tower and the cathedral.",
          "This building is very impressive from its architecture. Clean and well maintained, it is worth the stop.",
          "Mass was taking place in duomo so we were respectfully asked to stay at the back of the cathedral and not take any photos, but we were still very impressed with the architecture and decor. It was sad to think that so many seats in the church were vacant, but one was allowed to",
          "One of the most beautiful Duomo interiors in Italy for free...and so close to other iconic buildings also for free in a compact and relatively unspoiled city. What's not to like? A little tired but so would you be at this age",
          "Allow yourself time to visit this beautiful building and be wowed by the incredible architecture. It\u2019s free to get in when you buy a ticket for the Leaning Tower. You can only take small bags in.",
          "This was the best Duomo I have visited in Italy. Exceeded my expectations in every way. The ceilings are magnificent and everything else is of the highest order. Still free to visit but you must book a ticket in advance.",
          "Stunning ceilings are worth a visit. Just pick up the free ticket from the official collection point with unlimited entry time. We visited in the Easter holidays and although there were queues for the Leaning Tower we literally walked straight in to the cathedral.",
          "We could only mange to view from outside, just magnificent place. Wish we had allowed enough time.Combine Pisa tower and Dome. Walk around to feel the place.",
          "Would start by saying if a guided tour is available, definitely take. Took the stairs all the way to the top of the dome. Cannot do without guide. Such beauty and rich with history.",
          "We spend 40 minutes in Pisa just to see the square and that was perfect. Make sure you walk around, don't just focus on the leaning tower, because the other two buildings are nice as well.",
          "Nothing special, needs a lot of maintenance, not worth the visit on its own. Pisa tower is in better shape. .",
          "Th Duomo is never talked about. Everyone always talks about the tower, but they neglect the rest of the beautiful sites nearby. This is just as beautiful!",
          "Located on The Field of Dreams between the Leaning Tower and the Baptistry (the dome shaped building). The entrance is free at the far end of the Duomo from the tower. Inside it is beautiful and serene.",
          "Free to get in if you have a ticket for any other building in the square. The outside is spectacular and inside has plenty of grand frescoes and an amazing pulpit.",
          "This Duomo is in the same vicinity of the Leaning tower of Pisa. One can enjoy the tower as much as one can and then buy tickets to get inside the Duomo. We did not go inside as we had to take our train to Florence .",
          "Another place in Italy I had always wanted to see, and certainly did not disappoint. I always imagined the tower in a town on it's own, I had not realised it stood with two other magnificent buildings. A must see if you get a chance to visit!",
          "Beautiful church from the outside! Unfortunately you have to pay to enter, around \u20ac3 per person. It becomes quite pricey when you have to pay to enter ever church. Also important to note you have to pay around \u20ac0.50 to use a bathroom anywhere in Italy!",
          "Great place to have rest and to be calm with yourself. A lots of tourists but the place is huge so you can always find your spot to enjoy in view.",
          "We did not go in but just walked around the plaza after climbing up the tower. We we're seeing lots of Duomos all over so didn't mind skipping the inside of this one.",
          "The most beautiful place I've ever seen. If you will go Pisa , you should see this place . And Pisa Tower",
          "The leaning tower is one thing - but the architecture on these are incredible. We came in the evening when it wasn't overly touristy and too many people around and it was brilliant. It allows you to take a real look at the buildings and what went into them. Incredible",
          "These domes are located adjacent to Leaning tower of Pisa. Inside there are huge murals and very captivating. The place is under renovation but worth a glimpse.",
          "Large cathedral that the leaning tower was built to accompany as its bell tower. This also is sinking slightly due the sandy ground it was built on. We peeped inside as mass was on so could not look all around unfortunately but what we did see was breath taking the detail is",
          "Not worth going inside, but very attractive from the outside. Worth walking round it and getting a shot with the tower and baptistery.",
          "We went there for a day trip and this place is well worth visiting. One day is more than enough for this place unless you want to do shopping or take train ride to another place.",
          "If you only want to go inside the cathedral it's free, just get your entrance tickets behind the cathedral by the leaning tower, architecture is great and it also has a bunch of art.",
          "The cathedral is between the tower and the baptistery with a beautiful marble facade. Although it is free you need a timed ticket to enter which can be obtained in combination with tickets for the other attractions in the 'campo dei miracoli'. Inside the Romanesque interior",
          "Like everything around the Tower the Duomo is awesome. While in there a lady sang a song which was awesome considering I know very little Italian.",
          "I have always heard of the leaning tower of Pisa, but I didn't know it was part of a beautiful threesome: Church, Baptistery, and Tower. The architecture is beautiful and worth the visit, even if there was no leaning tower. It was crowded, but easy to get around and no long",
          "The cathedral is part of the complex with the Leaning Tower. The cathedral is beautiful inside with extensive artwork and fine craftsmanship. It is the only building that is free to enter. There is a charge to enter the Leaning Tower and baptistery. Both of these were closed",
          "We had this entrance with the tower ticket, great to see although quite sparse but outside was very impressive!!",
          "This is our third trip to Pisa. The Duomo, a large cathedral is under complete renovation, so did not get in. But, considering its age and the surroundings a really impressive place.",
          "Although is the only free building in the area, a ticket to get in is needed. You are asked to select a time slot, I think that is a good idea specially at busy times. But in our case, we went in a winter raining day and we could enter before the time we previously selected.",
          "Just close to the Pisa tower is the Duomo in the same complex. A combined ticket can be booked for the pisa tower and the Battistero. Renovation works was going on during our visit.",
          "It is amazing, like on a picture. Peaceful and great lace for a walk and taking some time for yourself or to enjoy the nice weather in the summer with friends or family",
          "I didn't go in as the line for tickets was really long and I didn't have the time, but just being on the grounds was worth it.",
          "The architecture is incredible well worth at least a walk round like I did. I would have gone inside but I had my suitcase and as a result was not allowed in.",
          "Truthfully, we didn\u2019t visit the Duomo but the building is stunning to look from the outside. Everyone files into this area of Pisa principally for the Leaning Tower but the Duomo and the surrounding grounds is impressive to look at.",
          "A must see place to visit. It's one of those places you have always read about but seeing it in person is really special!",
          "It's one of the must stops when in Pisa , a great medieval Roman Catholic catherdal built in 1064 with an amazing greens all over",
          "The Cathedral of Pisa is part of the Piazza del Duomo where the baptistry and the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa are located. As part of our cruise, we were taken inside the cathedral. It is an interesting one because it has five naves instead of the usual three. Very beautiful",
          "Very high ceilings and full of frescoes and marble! The gothic marble pulpit was the best thing in the cathedral. Most ornate and detailed in its execution. Painted mosaic above high altar was semi concealed during our visit due to restoration work.",
          "Absolutely amazing. The interior is beautifully decorated with stone carvings and paintings, and due to the impressive size, it makes you admire and appreciate the skills of the people who build it a long time ago.",
          "Great view from the top.great architecturing and well preserved.the day that i went was some works on the left side of the church but still the view was amazing",
          "Went during the Christmas holidays : not a lot of tourists about. You can buy a combination ticket for all 4 monuments (cathedral is free if you buy any entrance tickets). You need not specify which monument you want to go in, just the number of places and as you enter a",
          "Well let's face it people dont go here to see the duomo. It's the tower. Or the Battistero. Honestly I also did not go in and see how it is inside.",
          "There isn't much to see inside, however, you get a really lovely view of the cathedral and tower in the background. Worth it just for that. It is apart of the square so you should see it. Just buy the multi-ticket that gets you into everything in the complex (minus the tower).",
          "The Cathedral is in the shape of the Cross if seen from the sky, as most were designed in the fashion during the Christian era of Italy. The craftsmanship is incredible. The building requires admission, and you can buy a timed ticket in the office along the open grass square.",
          "After we saw the leaning tower from many angles, we purchased tickets for the Cathedral and Baptistry. The ticket office is behind the leaning tower. The cathedral does not look that fancy from the outside, but it is very well decorated inside. It is certainly worth a look as",
          "Another beautiful part about visiting the tower, is this cathedral right next to it. We didn't venture inside as we had a plane to catch.",
          "It's really big...and ...well..you sort of wish you had time to find out about it - but you don't - so just look from the outside and snap a few shots - refocus on the tower. Maybe next time you will go inside. Maybe it's cool!",
          "Not the attraction that the tower is, but a beautiful building. Also leans but most people don't know it because of the tower's popularity.",
          "This has been on our places to visit for some time and we were not disappointed. The piazza area is free to explore and you can then choose to pay to enter the individual buildings or climb the leaning tower as you want. We recommend you visit the cathedral if nothing else as",
          "It's free entry .. beautiful architecture. Must visit.. the bronze doors are super intricate.. very pretty",
          "It's free, beautiful and definitely worth seeing. We spent around 15 minutes walking around inside and saw almost everything.",
          "This cathedral, which is in the same \"field,\" is well worth a visit after an easy walk from the train station. Despite the fact that there were many people in the church, the church is so large that it could not be called \"crowded.\" People are free to walk around and take the",
          "This is the cathedral that the famous tower is affiliated with and in my opinion this is the much more interesting structure. The interior is one of the most ornate that we saw in Tuscany and deserves some time to take it all in. This in my opinion is one of the best reasons to",
          "Very close to the Battistero and with a large grass area in the foreground, the Duomo is both impressive and beautiful. Sadly, however, another attraction that is very popular which means long queues",
          "Although there are many great buildings in Pisa that are special the Duomo, as well as being a great expression of the fantastic architectural of its time, it is also an expression of the power that Pisa had as a nation state at the time. Given that we are so used to the image",
          "Beautiful architecture. This place is located inside leaning tower of Pisa compound. Can be reached from station by bus or walk. Bus stop is right in front of the compound. After seeing feels like all buildings are tilted.",
          "Worth visiting. Wonderful inside and outside. There is a dress code and you need to collect your free ticket at the ticket office.",
          "What a lovely place, I really enjoyed viewing this area. We arrived as part of a day trip quite early so there were not great crowds to deal with. I can imagine that this area would get extremely crowded later in the day. The entry point is through a number of stalls so I",
          "If you like Italian things, grounds, buildings, gardens, location...then walking through this area will fill your needs.",
          "I am \"churched out\" after three weeks in Italy but didn't see one that wasn't worth the visit. This Dumo is Hugh-you can get times tickets to go inside. It has enormous doors that tell a s tory in and of themselves and a beautifully decorated pulpit",
          "This is one of the most beautiful sites in Italy. Truly impressive and a must see. I don't recommend staying overnight in Pisa.",
          "It was part of our trip to visit tower di pisa.. this is near to it. Didn't go inside.. saw this from outside .. this a big dome..",
          "Fantastic Cathederal great facade outside ,you can go inside it's free but you have to book a timeslot so get one when you get there from the ticket office.Well worth a visit",
          "Having already seen my share of glorious religious buildings and art in Italy, this building left me uninspired except for its amazingly decorative pulpit.",
          "Again, take your time exploring. Another beautiful Cathedral. You can purchase a pass for 8 euro that gives you access to mostly everything. Worth the price.",
          "What more can you say, Italy's Duomo's in every city all have something gorgeous and unique. The doors alone are enormous and beautiful The outside huge and imposing and the marble just amazing. How was all this even built. The crowds in the entire plaza are huge, with fans",
          "It is a lovely cathedral with beautiful mosaics and doors. Not as large as in the bigger cities, but worth seeing while in Pisa.",
          "This is a definate stop and can be for free at a certain time from the ticket office (go early in the morning)",
          "It is a beautiful done on the outer side but the inner side is plain and simple. You go in , climb to the first level for a view of the opposite cathedral.",
          "Very impressive white marble building right next to leaning tower which was its bell tower . Joint admission ticket worth it for all buildings except the tower . Don't miss the entrance doors on way in",
          "This is a great place it\u2019s big it\u2019s imposing its ornate its well decorated it\u2019s lovely inside and well worth wondering around!",
          "We were blown away by the beauty of this cathedral. The inside has amazing frescoes and mosaics. The sheer size of the columns and the incredible vaulted ceiling left us wandering how they were able to construct this church so many centuries ago.",
          "I know that the Tower of Pisa is the draw to this plaza. But once there, give yourself time to experience this Duomo. You do need a ticket but it is free. If in a group, your guide will take care of that for you. The ceiling is just beautiful and there is something to marvel at",
          "If you visit the cities and towns of Tuscany you will come across many marble-fronted cathedrals. Each one is unique but after awhile they all look the same. The Duomo di Pisa is the best!",
          "You should visit the Duomo and spare time in front of the marble pulpit made by Giovanni Pisano, it's really a masterpiece.",
          "I have to say that the Duomo in Pisa is absolutely amazing thiugh often neglected in favour if it's illustrious neighbour, the leaning tower. That is a pity if course because the Duomo is captivating and well worth a visit to the Piazza de Miracoli in its own right. Beautiful",
          "We visited with a guide on a ticket to also climb the leaning tower. I loved this cathedral..it\u2019s splendour and history and calm in every stone... I\u2019m very pleased I saw this beautiful place",
          "no queue in October 2017, we went in because it's part of the deal of being in Pisa, it's free and it's looks nice. OMG- I was captivated by the place. The ceiling is as good as anywhere else in the world (Hampton Court, Westminster Hall, York Minster etc) and I was very keen",
          "Entry is free if prepared to wait. Entry ticket comes with an allocated time and with hordes of visitors (avoid the cruisers!) the wait could be a long time. Quicker to pay for entry to e.g. the Batisterro which permits entry to Duomo with no time restriction.",
          "This cathedral is free when purchasing a ticket to see any of the other places in the Square of Miracles. The cathedral was under construction when we went to it but it was still a lovely walk around and very interesting to see the detail presented on the pictures and even on",
          "It's much more beautiful to see it, that Pisa tower. Very beautiful inside it shows you the beauty of Pisa town, and it's ancient history. Visiting is free if you buy any other ticket. I advise you to visit Baptistery - it's really great and has special window to make a photo of",
          "Well worth the visit. Entrance is free with a ticket that can be picked up at the Duomo ticket office- after entering the city gates, it's the large building on the right. I recommend taking along a good guidebook (Rick Steves) to learn more about what you are seeing while",
          "Note although free, you MUST have a ticket to enter- you get this free with any ticket to leaning tower or the other sites on Piazza dei Miracoli, or you can just get a free ticket from the ticket office It is a very well kept Italian cathedral, many paintings, statues etc. The",
          "This is really worth a visit. Looks fantastic from outside but when you enter it is so atmospheric. Large building made of stone / marble with much to see. The old pulpit is something special. Include in your tour of Pisa",
          "All three major buildings, the leaning tower, the Duomo and the baptistry, in the plaza of miracles are amazing outside. The church is free to get in to if you get a ticket for a particular time at the museum. It is very interesting inside, as well and worth the visit",
          "This is a pretty Cathedral and very easy to see. We can buy tickets ahead of time and was able to get right in and there weren't many crowds we went in late afternoon",
          "If you think your goal is the leaning tower, you will be greatly surprised that your visit is a package deal. If you ever see pictures of Pisa, one thinks that the tower is the only attraction. Not many know that the tower is the Bell Tower to the Duomo di Pisa, a magnificent",
          "It is a church-like building with lots of history inside. Once you enter it is not as big as it seems but there is a nice view when you go to the top. It is worth to visit once you are in the area",
          "The Cathedral forms part of the 'Piazza dei Miracoli', where you will also find the famous Leaning Tower. My wife and I visited the Cathedral after climbing the Leaning Tower. To say the Cathedral inside is absolutely beautiful, in our opinion, would be a vast understatement. A",
          "Peaceful, beautiful place, interesting artworks and decorations, worth a visit, exemplifies the simple beauty of Pisa",
          "This is a very busy tourist site. Plan to go early so you may find a parking place on the street otherwise plan to park and pay a fee. It is not a very far walk to get inside the wall if you have to pay to park. The cathedral is free but you still have to get a pass to enter",
          "Seem to be visiting a lot of Duomo's but this is yet another beautiful example and you should take a look when at Pisa.",
          "Absolutely amazing. This is a truly beautiful place and well worth booking beforehand. The ceiling alone is awesome and the ambience within is one of tranquility and peace. We had booked for after our visit to the tower and it was well worth it.",
          "the Cathedral on the inside is impressive, the endless columns that give a Masterful touch and the altar is a masterpiece, the frescoes are beautiful.The cathedral is evidence of the wealth possessed by the Republic of Pisa and it was dedicated to Santa Maria Assunta. Most see.",
          "As i had paid to enter the Tower and the Baptistery then you can go at any time, so do reserve via internet is worth it at the end....the Duomo is magnificent and glad it is being taking care, it will take another 2 or 3 years more, but that is another reason to return, and",
          "Lovely cathedral to wander around, with great artwork. The roof is fabulous. It's actually free to get in, so if you don't want to pay to get into any of the buildings, at least you can do this one. Just a quick note to the ladies, your shoulders have to be covered ( they",
          "I visited the Duomo as part of the combination ticket available to purchase. There wasn\u2019t a specific time slot to access the building, but entry is controlled to avoid over crowding. Once inside, the building is magnificent and you are allowed to take pictures with a flash. A",
          "We got the entrance to the Duomo included with our ticket for the Leaning Tower so didn't spend too long in the church but could appreciate the vast scale and beauty of the building. One thing that was a little disappointing was the lack of information inside and upcharges for",
          "Amazing 11th century architecture. Hard to image how advanced the Pisan's were. While they were building this my ancestors were fighting Vikings and waiting for the Norman conquest of 1066. I guess what they say about real estate is true; it's all location, location, location.",
          "If you go to the leaning tower you can't miss the Duomo in Pisa. It seems massively overshadowed because everyone comes to visit the tower but it's nice.",
          "Beautiful building inside. It was marred slightly by the renovations which were VERY loud but I can't complain as I'd rather it were looked after than left in ruin. Space to light a candle and very respectful",
          "Both the tower and duomo are in the same area, some tickets to leaning tower also include free entry to cathedral, but allow plenty of time. You are allowed 30 minutes up tower. Many tourists in the area but can easily get around. World famous place am glad I have visited .",
          "Beautiful , atmospheric but a bit too manic inside to actually pray. The Duomo closes for half an hour at 1 pm for a service but the doormen just closed the door and didn't explain if we could have gone in to attend it.",
          "This amazing building has quite a few magnificent works of art which are brilliant to gaze upon. The main work at the head of the altar was being worked on while we were there so unfortunately we were unable to enjoy it. The space is holy ground and the tourists were quiet and",
          "beautiful piece of architecture, needs weeks ahead booking to go on top of the tower. nothing much to see other pisa tower. We went ahead to visit sienna from pisa.",
          "We visited the Duomo which is free - however be aware the external and internal parts of the cathedral are under renovation. This in effect blights the photos you can take. For example the altar and rear of the nave are totally or partially screened.",
          "Stunning architecture. A wonderful experience that forms part of the whole leaning tower experience. The square of miracles is an amazing architectural feat.",
          "amazing like tower in Pisa.. another must see in Tuscany. There are always a lot of people, but this is not a problem. Must see in Italy",
          "This magnificent building is well worth a visit; if you're visiting the leaning tower of Pisa, make sure to include the cathedral.",
          "Great place to go for a few days. Was there in June.. Before all the others had their vacation. Nice food great wine",
          "Amazing location and a must see venue after the Tower with just as much style character and history to match the tower if not more set in wonderful surroundings",
          "We had to pay to enter this Cathedral. The lines were long but they moved quickly. It's hard to believe anyone could design and build a church like this 500 years ago. One of the more impressive churches we visited on our trip to Italy. They did allow you to take pictures",
          "Which is just as well if you go like us and go on a busy Saturday and find that the first available ticket for the Leaning Tower is not for 4 hours! The Duomo, or Cathedral, is simply stunning and amazingly free to enter (but you must book your entry at the ticket office) - we",
          "Free entry but you still need a ticket. Nice place to walk around while viewing the Leaning Tower of Pisa",
          "The cathedral was built in 1064, older than the Frienze and Siena Duomos. Even it is free, you need to make a rezervation to see inside. There are very good mozaics on the entrance of the Duome. We could not believe that they are the original colours from a thousand years ago as",
          "There is the usual clothing requirement expected in Catholic churches, but at leeast here they give you a sort of paper poncho to use.",
          "As with most cathedrals I visit a large portion was swathed in scaffolding the amazing white of the exterior was quite dazzeleing in the bright sunshine. The interior had a spectacular ceiling and some good stained glass windows",
          "As the Pisa leaning tower is impressive sight also the Duomo di Pisa is definetly worth to visit. Recommendation.",
          "You will see this if you go to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Outside is cool, but inside is simply gorgeous. The church is still in use so be respectful inside. Be quiet and don't take selfies. It's a place of calm for worshippers. Such a stunning example of Italian art",
          "Like all of the churches spread throughout Italy, the interior and exterior is just amazing and worthwhile to see.",
          "We enjoyed spending time here and marvelling at the architecture and art on display. We were there longer than we anticipated, and ended up all wandering off to explore different areas and art that interested us, then comparing notes and viewing each other's finds.",
          "We went in on a baking hot day but it was thankfully cool inside. The buildings architecture is beautiful but here are some quirky geometries here and there from the outside. The inside is an impressive space with some fantastic artwork around. Not much in the way of history was",
          "We visited early in the morning which was great for viewing the outside of the buildings as there were only crowds at the entrance (taking photos of the Leaning Tower). Unfortunately that meant that we couldn't go inside as it didn't open until 10 a.m. At the back of the",
          "Not only the tower itself is why ppl come there but the whole complex is really inspiring. Very clean and taken care of. We were there in January, so there were not that much ppl as usually. Is it is on your way, totally worth going",
          "We visited in a large group and had been forewarned to be aware of young 15-21 ish girls, who both pick-pockets or snatch and run with bags, handing-off to others so if they are caught they have nothing on them, they are VERY well practised. The Police don't seem interested,",
          "It is a very crowdy location, but a must seen place. Take your time and don't walk on the grass, that is a not done action.",
          "I saw it from the outside and knew that I had to go inside and explore. Inside a beautiful cathedral is welcomes you. So beautiful and charming. It has to be seen to believe and enjoy its beauty.",
          "Excellent cathedral currently undergoing some restoration work, although the work is fairly discrete and does not spoil the visit. Entry to the cathedral is included within the ticket for the Tower. We spent around 40 minutes wandering through the cathedral- we could easily",
          "Very cool place to see also. Although the tower gets most of the press, this place is very impressive also.",
          "Pictures can not truly show the beauty of this place. from the moment my eyes saw the Duomo I was mesmerized.",
          "A splendid Duomo to wander around the outside and then with your ticket for the tower go inside to marvel at the beauty of it, beware of the long queues to get in, especially if queuing in the sun and if the Duomo I holding a service, proper attire is required but well worth",
          "We went there mainly for Torre. Duomo is very close to Torre. It's a good spot to take pictures if you are in the area.",
          "We visited this amazing cathedral whilst visiting Pisa. The inside was amazing. You have to cover your shoulders on entering. They will give you a paper like poncho to wear if you have not got the right clothing on. The acoustics were amazing and were demonstrated to us . This",
          "The building I quite something. The art o the walls inside will take your breath away. Be aware, you cannot go in when a service takes place. Just go for a coffee until the line of people has gone down."

        "wiki": "Santo Stefano dei Cavalieri  is a church in central Pisa located on Piazza dei Cavalieri (Knight's Square).Construction began on 17 April 1565 in order to build a church for the Order of Knights of St Stephan, founded by the Grand Duke Cosimo de' Medici to fight Saracen piracy in the Mediterranean.  The project with designs and oversight by Giorgio Vasari and David Fortini was to build a church on the site of an older church called San Sebastiano alle Fabbriche Maggiori, which dated at least to 1074. The new church on the site was consecrated by 21 December 1569.  The facade, in white marble was designed by Don Giovanni de' Medici, illegitimate son of Cosimo I, with the help of Alessandro Pieroni; their designs were chosen over Vasari\u2019s original plan. An inscription commemorates completion during the reign of Ferdinando I de' Medici.\nThe bell-tower, also designed by Vasari, was completed by 1572 by Giovanni Fancelli. The main altar designs were by Pier Francesco Silvani. Many alterations and additions were proposed and made over the next two centuries, including plans by  Gherardo Mechini, Paolo Guidotti,  Ranieri Gherardi, Torp\u00e8 Donati, Alessandro Gherardesca, Florido Galli, Niccol\u00f2 Matas, and Pasquale Poccianti. The final reconstruction in 1859, completed after the suppression of the order, creates the clearer interior systematization of columns we see today.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe church display numerous trophy banners, captured during naval encounters with Saracen pirates. The font for holy water (1568) was sculpted by Giovanni Fancelli, based on designs by Vasari.\nIn the counterfacade are five monochrome paintings of Stories of St Stefano Pope and Martyr, including one celebrating the entrance of Ferdinando I on 31 March 1588. This grand-duke was to commission the wooden ceiling by Bartolomeo Atticciati (1604).\nThe Ceiling has six paintings on wood depicting episodes historic events in which the military order was active, including the Granting of uniforms by Cosimo I de' Medici by il Cigoli, the Return of the Fleet from the Battle of Lepanto and Sacking of Prevesa by Jacopo Ligozzi, The embarcation at Livorno of Maria de' Medici by Allori, Victory in the Greek Archipelago and Capture of Bona by l'Empoli,\n\nThe polychrome pulpit (1627) was completed by Chiarissimo Fancelli. It contains paintings by the Pisan Aurelio Lomi of Madonna and child with Saints Joseph and Stefano (1593) and a painting of the palace of the Order.\nThe Main altar (1702\u20131709) in the presbytery was designed and sculpted by  Giovanni Battista Foggini with a statue of St Stefano Pope and  allegorical figures of Religion and Faith, and on the bronze throne, a relief with the Decapitation of St Stefano.\nAt the right is a painting by Giorgio Vasari, with the Entombment of St Stefano (1571), while at the right is a Birth of Christ (1564)  by  Bronzino.\nIn the Sacristy is a sculptural group by Foggini of St Stefano and the allegory of Reason and the Trinity (1683), made in occasion of the translation of the body of the saint to this church in 1682.\nThe chapel of the Holy Sacrament was completed in 1837 by Florido Galli.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThere are three organs in the church, the first from 1571 by the Cortonese organ-maker  Onofrio Zeffirini.  On the left is an organ by the Sienese Azzolino Bernardino della Ciaja reconstructed in 1733. In 1931, Giovanni Tamburini builds a new organ behind the 1733 organ. The modern organ is the only functioning one in the church.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

        "wiki": "The Campo Santo, also known as Camposanto Monumentale (\"monumental cemetery\") or Camposanto Vecchio (\"old cemetery\"), is a historical edifice at the northern edge of the Cathedral Square in Pisa, Italy.\n\"Campo Santo\" can be literally translated as \"holy field\", because it is said to have been built around a shipload of sacred soil from Golgotha, brought back to Pisa from the Third Crusade by Ubaldo Lanfranchi, archbishop of Pisa in the 12th century. A legend claims that bodies buried in that ground will rot in just 24 hours. The burial ground lies over the ruins of the old baptistery of the church of Santa Reparata, the church that once stood where the cathedral now stands.\nThe term \"monumental\" serves to differentiate it from the later-established urban cemetery in Pisa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe building was the fourth and last one to be raised in the Cathedral Square. It dates from a century after the bringing of the soil from Golgotha, and was erected over the earlier burial ground.\nThe construction of this huge, oblong Gothic cloister was begun in 1278 by the architect Giovanni di Simone. He died in 1284 when Pisa suffered a defeat in the naval battle of Meloria against the Genoans. The cemetery was only completed in 1464.\nIt seems that the building was not meant to be a real cemetery, but a church called Santissima Trinit\u00e0 (Most Holy Trinity), but the project changed during the construction. However we know that the original part was the western one (and this should be, at least for a while, the mentioned church), and all the eastern part was the last to be built, finally closing the structure.\n\n\n== Building ==\nThe outer wall is composed of 43 blind arches. There are two doorways. The one on the right is crowned by a gracious Gothic tabernacle. It contains the Virgin Mary with Child, surrounded by four saints. It is the work from the second half of the 14th century by a follower of Giovanni Pisano. This was the original entrance door. Most of the tombs are under the arcades, although a few are on the central lawn. The inner court is surrounded by elaborate round arches with slender mullions and plurilobed tracery.\nThe cemetery has three chapels. The oldest ones are the chapel Ammannati (1360) and takes its name from the tomb of Ligo Ammannati, a teacher in the University of Pisa; and the chapel Aulla, were there is an altar made by Giovanni della Robbia in 1518. In the Aulla chapel we can see also the original incense lamp that Galileo Galilei used for calculation of pendular movements. This lamp is the one Galileo saw inside the cathedral, now replaced by a larger more elaborate one. The last chapel was Dal Pozzo, commissioned by archbishop of Pisa Carlo Antonio Dal Pozzo in 1594; it has an altar dedicated to St. Jerome and a little dome. In this chapel in 2009 were translated the relics of the Cathedral: the relics include among the others eleven of the twelve Apostles, two fragments of the True Cross, a thorn from the Crown of Thorns of Christ and a small piece of the dress of the Virgin Mary. Also in the Dal Pozzo chapel sometimes a Mass is celebrated.\n\n\n== Sarcophagi ==\nThe Campo Santo contained a huge collection of Roman sarcophagi, but there are only 84 left together with a collection of Roman and Etruscan sculptures and urns, now in the Museum of the vestry board.\nThe sarcophagi were initially all around the cathedral, often attached to the building itself. That until the cemetery was built, then they were collected in the middle all over the meadow. Carlo Lasinio, in the years he was the curator of the Campo Santo, collected many other ancient relics that were spread in Pisa to make a sort of archeological museum inside the cemetery. Nowadays the sarcophagi are inside the galleries, near the walls.\n\n\n== Frescoes ==\nThe walls of the vast structure were covered in over 2600 meters squared of frescoes, a greater expanse than the Sistine Chapel. The earliest, attributed to Francesco Traini, were painted 1336/41 in the south-western corner.  The Last Judgement, Hell, Triumph of Death, and the Thebaid (stories of the Desert Fathers), usually attributed to Buonamico di Martino da Firenze, detto il Buffalmacco , were painted in the years after the Black Death. The cycle of frescoes continues with the Stories of the Old Testament by Benozzo Gozzoli (15th century) that were situated in the north gallery, while in the south arcade were the Stories of Pisan Saints, by Andrea Bonaiuti, Antonio Veneziano and Spinello Aretino (between 1377 and 1391), and the Stories of Job, by Taddeo Gaddi (end of 14th century). In the same time, in the north gallery were the Stories of the Genesis by Piero di Puccio. The last images date from the early 17th century.\nOn 27 July 1944, a bomb fragment from an Allied raid started a fire in the Camposanto, which burned for three days, causing the timber lead roof to collapse. The destruction of the roof severely damaged everything inside the cemetery, destroying most of the sculptures and sarcophagi and compromising all the frescoes. An initial effort to rescue the frescoes was organized by Deane Keller of the U.S. Army's Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program. Pieces of the frescoes were salvaged and a temporary roof was erected to prevent further damage.After World War II, restoration work began. The roof was restored as closely as possible to its pre-war appearance and the frescoes were separated from the walls to be restored and displayed elsewhere.\nOnce the frescoes had been removed, the preliminary drawings, called sinopie were also removed. These under-drawings were separated using the same technique used on the frescoes and now they are in the Museum of the Sinopie, on the opposite side of the Square.\nThe adhesivity of the casein glue initially used to fix the paint layers  to wooden supports, failed after mold penetrated the glue. This required the ungluing, transferring again, and re-affixing of all the paintings to new supports. To  prevent intramural condensation from seeping into the panels, an elaborate system of sensors woven into a synthetic fabric was placed between wall and panel. These sensors adjust the temperature of the wall to within 3 degrees of the ambient temperature every 10 minutes, thus preventing condensation.\nThe restoration campaign concluded with the reinstallation of part of the Buffalmacco cycle in 2005; the Thebiad frescoes in 2014; Hell in 2015; the Last Judgement in 2017; and the Triumph of Death in July 2018. \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nTobino, Mario (1982).

          "This is an interesting place to visit. The frescoes are quite beautiful and it\u2019s interesting to see the restoration being done when you visit. I also found it interesting to see that people can still get buried here. Do visit the side chapel where they keep a great number of",
          "Prepare yourself for majestic marble sculptures, frescoes, fine murals... a place worth visiting. Quiet, accessible and a very well kept cemetery. It's a place to enjoy and relax in, away from the busy life of pisa",
          "Just one of the main attractions in the Piazza dei Miracoli in Pisa's main tourist area. The Camposanto isn't as crowded as some of the other attractions, so walking around is somewhat more relaxing. There are some amazing examples of frescoes and there was quite a bit of",
          "Camposanto is known also as a holy field. A legend claims that bodies buried in that ground will rot in just 24 hours.",
          "Walk these cloistered spaces and take time to read the inscriptions. Sit on the stone seating and take a good look at the wall paintings. Centuries old but full of things to see.",
          "Located at the northern edge of the square, the cemetery is an architectural wonder! Worth the visit.",
          "A one off of a building that's definitely worth including in your ticket if you're seeing anything else on piazza duomo / Campo dei Miracalo besides the tower. It has the proportions, scale and grace of an ancient abbey, oddly placed in the middle of a city. And you can walk",
          "Definitely enjoyed seeing the amazing frescos here. Some of them were truly huge, and it was wonderful to watch some artisans actually restoring parts of the fresco. The various sarcophagi were also interesting.",
          "Wonderful, massive building in the course of interior reconstruction, in effect a huge mausoleum for the great and the good of Pisa. It's well worth a visit as an add-on to the tower and cathedral.",
          "The Camposanto or the cemetery is across the cathedral at the side. Though tourists are less attracted to the place because they focus more on the leaning tower yet the place is rich in history. Clean restrooms are near in this area.",
          "I have a \u201cthing\u201d for old cemeteries\u2026 and this one is really outstanding in all its glory. Beautiful build building with lot of history - please hire a guide for more detailed information \u2013 really worth your money. The tomb stones are beautiful and place has so much reverence",
          "Situated just on the edge of the Cathedral Square delivers totally different emotions. The moment you cross the gate you leaving the crowded and noisy space and you find yourself in peaceful and friendly place. It is quiet here. You can walk around looking at hundreds of tombs",
          "I enjoyed this site, with all its history. I wish I have found some better reading on it, as I am sure there were elements I would have enjoyed more if I understood them. For example, I was surprised to see recent burials there and would be interested in finding out what that",
          "There are not too many cemeterise which are worth to visit. This one of them. Much more calm than on the piazza. Beautiful frescos, nice columns and very peraceful",
          "I visited this old cemetery today with a friend. It's rather beautiful with the frescoes covering the walls (which are largely unrestored) and the statues. There is also a garden running through the centre, where I saw a woman sitting on the steps reading a book. It cast be",
          "This is a really nice cemetery and I would recommend coming here. The wall frescoes are amazing even though a lot of them are still unrestored. The frescoes alone are a reason to come to this place.",
          "This special place sparsely decorated on the outside reveals a large rectangular cloister inside with a grassed central open courtyard. The frescoes are immense and the grave stones set into the floor are a mixture of some that are very old and surprisingly some that are very",
          "I didn't except too much from the outside but it was worth to see! You can walk around a half an hour or more and watch the huge frescos on the walls and the finely wrought heading of the vaults. While we were here restorers was working on the old frescos in front of us just a",
          "walk slowly thru and enjoy the tombstone things in the floor here. But espec the big frescoes on the wall. Remember that the soil under the grass is from the Holy Land. and has magical powers.",
          "You may go for the leaning tower but this is the one not to miss. Superb frescoes that are simply stunning. The Design of this building means a breeze follows you as you walk round and the images are something to behold.",
          "There you can see probably the biggest set of frescoes on the world, all of them were completed during the last several centuries.",
          "One of biggest series of frescoes in the world all around the approximately 300m. Perimeter of Rectangular gothic Camposanto of Pisa. Frescoes, dated from medieval era to renaissance, have in the Triumph of Death, Last Judgement and life of Anacoreti, all recently restored, the",
          "The wall paintings are very interesting it makes you think how they were so creative so long ago.There is a little chapel with bones incased in boxes strange!,,The graves are very interesting from 1800 all the way to 2000 incredible.",
          "Spend time with the frescoes. The details are very amusing. You see angels and devils fighting over humans. There are many amusing details. This is what the priesthood, in medieval times, wanted you to think about the glories of heaven and the sufferings in hell. We spent a lot",
          "It's free to have a look at the outside of all of the attractions at the Piazza dei Miracoli - which is where the leaning tower is - but if you want to have a look inside, you have to pay. EVERYONE wants to climb the tower, meaning a long wait and a shorter than expected climb",
          "A stunning building Camposanto literally means Holy ground and when you\u2019re strolling through the grounds with its beautiful courtyards with it\u2019s artefacts and the manicured lawns it is truly peaceful. We went in mid May and the crowds were not at all large. No queuing for",
          "Very beautiful, atmospheric and a real addition to the Pisa experience... holy land soil brought to the city to bury the great and good. Historians should add this to the visit to the tower",
          "Beautiful building, peaceful atmosphere, zero explanation unless you\u2019re with a guide in a tour group. What does it say about equality in death?",
          "This seemed to be the forgotten building on 22nd April, crowds everywhere else. Five euros and I was in. The building dates to 1278 but was not completed until 1464. It was initially conceived as a church but became the cemetery as it was constructed over an earlier burial",
          "You need to buy a ticket for entry at the ticket office and I found The Camposanto fascinating. It's 5 euros just to visit here but you can visit 2 monuments for 7 euros or 3 for 8 euros. Unfortunately the Opera del Duomo Palace was closed when I was there.",
          "Really amazing building to picture from the inside of, but I didn't really know what it was. There was no audio guide apart from a fixed listening point as you enter. I think this was my least fave place. Of course the leaning tower was my fave place!",
          "walk around the whole building - the frescos on the wall are amazing, would have liked to see more translations of the stories into English though",
          "Really, it's not worth a special trip. Beautiful and well-worth the time walking around inside once you're there, but only because you're there anyway.",
          "Worth the extra few \u20ac to walk among the past....knowing your Roman numerals will definitely come in handy....the camposanto is a definite must while seeing the tower of Pisa, the Bastillio and the cathedral....bring a comfortable pair of shoes.",
          "We opted to check out the Camposanto, Baptistery and the Museum for an additional \u20ac8 (the Tower is a separate admission price of \u20ac18). Loved it here, it is very peaceful and the frescoes are faded but great. It's worth a visit!",
          "Good pizza and pasta. Good value and pleasant service. Locals eating there - not just a tourist haunt. However we were short changed when paying cash by \u20ac5. This was soon rectified but it always gives you a feeling it could have been deliberate. We were going to tip in any case",
          "I really enjoyed going to the camposanto especially after going to the museum nearby and learning more about the artwork beforehand. It was very picturesque and eye-opening, proving that Pisa is more than just the tower.",
          "This is fully accessible and a lovely peaceful wander around ancient tombs and amazing frescoes that are in the process of being restored. There's a little chapel at the far end which is worth a look if you're into holy relics (or the brightly decorative ceiling if not). We",
          "The architecture and sense of space is interesting but to be honest the frescoes and faded murals were just ok. The arched windows and structure of the building cast beautiful shadows on the flag stone floors and there were snippets of detail we found to photograph but a quick",
          "This is an Amazing place to visit full of culture history you can do guided tours or look around at your own leisure it is stunning full of statues and the burial place of many. The grounds are beautiful too. You do pay to enter but it is worth it especially on a warm day with",
          "Really fascinating to see and walk over (!!!) the graves of these rich and famous of their time, will not take you long to go around...and even more beautiful on a sunnier day I\u2019m sure. Situated right near to the leaning tower of Pisa so not one to miss, tickets available at",
          "for the rich and famous though. Most tranquil place with its marbled columns and partly damaged frescoes but these frescoes were very beautiful.",
          "Mrs. TwoInMaine would have given this a three-of-five average, but Mr. wanted especially to see the Camposanto. It is a four-sided colonnade surrounding the ancient burial ground. The colonnade is filled with memorial stones under your feet, sarcophagi by the walls, ruined",
          "It has a series of burial Chambers.. the place has a interesting history and the story behind it....",
          "This is a series of burial chambers, very interesting, but a bit macabre in its display of bone parts. I found the displays and information about those buried here well done, but this is not a site that kids would like or appreciate.",
          "All part of the experience of Pisa,the tower, the cathederal,the baptistry and the cemetery. If you see the others then see this as well. Visually fantastic and you must see it ,take photo's and enjoy the history of it. But again book your tickets early.",
          "Many old and some surprisingly new graves, a pretty courtyard, and some lovely frescos. The courtyard gets sun, so can be a nice quiet place to enjoy a sit down or snack.",
          "On a quick half day trip to Pisa we made this one of our two monuments to visit in addition to the tower. This burial site and series of chapels surrounding a central courtyard is an architectural marvel. The cool quite colonnades allow for contemplation of the frescos and tombs",
          "This is an interesting place to have a wander around it\u2019s quite big and has some lovely Fresca\u2018 sand nice statues! I think it\u2019s a place of rest! It\u2019s a must visit if your at the square of miracles!",
          "Great building with frescos and marble tombs... also Galileo's lamp is visible and a few small chapels.....",
          "What a lovely, cool, breezy building to visit on a hot summer day! There's a calm and timeless feeling. Don't overlook the Camposanto while visiting the leaning tower and cathedral. We found it comparatively uncrowded. The architecture, frescoes, sarcophagi and monuments in this",
          "I didn't know until we got to the end that this cemetery is still in use, Archpriests from the cathedral being currently buried here. Flowers on their tombs are moving (presumably laid by friends, family or colleagues). We went in October- busy outside but not super-busy- and",
          "They are well maintained. The graves have been well depicted and the old mural paintings are well depicted.",
          "One can get a ticket for this as part of a trio of sites around the Piazza dei Miracoli. The other 2 are interesting but this is the absolute highlight. Having said which one really should go to the Museo del Sinopie BEFORE this- this is another of the 3 sites on the multi",
          "This building needs your respect. It is not one for young children. Take your time walking around the building taking in all the frescos and other artefacts. Then spend some time sitting and taking in the peaceful atmosphere away from the busy outside world.",
          "We had a limited time with our tour guide and it was her recommendation to enter this area, otherwise I fear we would have overlooked. This is a cemetery that contains art and history not seen, appreciated, or well known. Inside are a number of fresco's that were damaged during",
          "At any time of day, avoiding the crowds in the Piazza Miracoli is needed for sanity. The Camposanto is a perfect little retreat from the mayhem outside. And what a place. Ancient burial plots, statues and sepulchars, and of course, the frescoes. A perfect hour of quietness",
          "Worth visiting with a joint ticket for cathedral and tower also. The frescos when you walk in of the day of judgement are breathtaking given there age.",
          "We visited the Camposanto (cemetery), which is one of the many attractions situated within the Piazza dei Miracoli. We booked and paid for tickets online, before leaving home, for all the attractions that we wanted to visit during our 1 day in the area. This was a good move as",
          "This really has to be seen - if you only see the 2 large frescoes that portray the medieval thoughts on heaven and hell. The building is rather spectacular and is a must along with leaning tower.",
          "This is a beautiful cemetery with the most beautiful chapels for family's and well kept graves there are also many frescoes about so don't miss it .",
          "The tower gets all the plaudits, and whilst it is cool, the cemetery is the hidden gem. It's absolutely beautiful and worth paying the extra few \u20ac to get in. So so peaceful with a delightful tiny chapel at one end. The sculptures and frescos on the walls are interesting to look",
          "Everyone is focusing on the amazing tower but Camposanto is an amazing place full of scupltures and 'frescos' among the tombs. When I visited there were just few people and we could enjoy a great visit. I spent one hour there but it depends on you, if you are in a rush 15",
          "I noticed many people chose not to go in here - which is a shame as - although it's a cemetery it's very interesting. Old frescoes, carved burial spaces and a very beautiful setting. Well worth a visit.",
          "When visiting the tower of Pisa, it is best to go to this cemetery as well. This place is an indoor cemetery wherein people of important stature in Pisa during the old times were buried. As with cemeteries, you will find quite a number of sarcophagi, tombstones and funerary",
          "You can easily spend a couple of hours, walking and sitting around this incredible place. A good guide will make a lot of difference as there is a lot to take in.",
          "When I first entered this building I wasn't sure what it was. As I was walking around I soon realized I was walking on graves. Many of the graves lined the floor so it was impossible to avoid stepping on them. Apparently only prestigious people dating back about 700 years ago",
          "The entrance fee is included in your ticket to climb the Tower of Pisa. It's basically a graveyard, but it's so serene, what's left of the frescos is captivating... after spending two weeks visiting churches, cathedrals, and palaces I thought I would be all fresco'ed out, but",
          "We weren't really sure what to expect as we walked inside and all 3 of us just stared. The scale, the faded grandeur, the beautiful garden in the centre. We were just awestruck by the scale of it. Loved it.",
          "Wonderful cemetery unlike any I've ever seen, it's a bit underrated and overshadowed by the Tower, but a worthy place to visit in the Piazza dei Miracoli ensemble. The advantage is that it's not as crowded as other attractions there.",
          "When we were advised that one of the best attractions was the cemetery we were amazed but thought we had to see for ourselves. It is amazing, beautiful frescoes, stunning sculptures and very peaceful. I would recommend this as a definite place to visit in Pisa.",
          "Very peaceful and quiet away from the crowds outside this is heaven. Wall to wall frescos, statues and history all together in a very cool place away from the heat. Again we purchased tickets at the tourist information center to save time.",
          "I love the camposanto so much. It's amazing. One hundred years ago people came to Pisa to see this, not the leaning tower. The frescos are amazing, the tombs are amazing, and the collection in the side rooms are amazing. It's always nice and cool in here and a great place to",
          "This was the highlight for me of our one night stay in Pisa (we were on our way to Siena). Steeped in amazing history and very tranquil - the central garden is especially well cared for. Highly recommended.",
          "This was a haven of peace in the very busy square. A beautiful location. The staff were very friendly and the frescoes amazing!",
          "The Camposanto is the open air crypt or burial ground for the plaza and is well-worth the ticket price, even if you are not particularly interested in such venues. An excellent fresco dominates one wall.",
          "Not as impressive as the rest of the Field of Miracles, but worth a stop just to get away from the tourists. Very peaceful, lovely spot. It's a cemetery filled with dirt from Jerusalem (to get ahead in line at the end of days). Check out the chains on the wall - these blocked",
          "I've never been in a place like this. Just gorgeous. Not a lot of people were in the Camposanto. Beautiful statues and a room for what appears to be cremation remains in elaborate glass boxes that weren't quite finished. It's very odd -- took a minute to figure out what we were",
          "This large space serves as a graveyard (the floor consists of tombs), a cloister and an art galllery (sculptures and paintings on the walls). it is a beautiful building and rather empty in he morning... as the crowds gather around the duomo and tower...and the tours skip this",
          "We bought a combination entry ticket which covered entry to the Tower and Camposanto. There was no queue for the Camposanto and it was quieter within this building. Large murals and burial monuments adorn the walls. It was interesting to visit, very calm and cool. We probably",
          "If you buy the combined ticket, you get access to the camposanto as part of it and it's worth visiting to get away from the busy areas for a relax. It's an enclosed graveyard also containing some impressive sarcophagi and frescos. The layout and architecture is also really nice.",
          "Worth a slow stroll through the old cemetary to take in the unique designs of the crusaders tombstones.",
          "Never knew this place was here as my husband and I were really only visiting Pisa to see the leaning tower. We were glad we visited here. It was just amazing - a huge covered cemetery containing many tombs, frescoes and statues. I think it is a must see. You can purchase a",
          "This is quite an amazing building, it was originally constructed to house the sarcophagus\u2019s from the Roman era and before that were in a number of nearby buildings in Pisa, and has since been added to with many remarkable paintings, plaques, tapestries and the like. There are",
          "This was, surprisingly, one of my favourite bits of Pisa. I hadn't really paid much attention to reading about the Camposanto before visiting the \"Field of Miracles\" but was pleasantly surprised once we were inside. The site contains the remains of some very interesting",
          "Wonderful tombs, sculptures and frescoes however no information boards so this makes it difficult to get much out of. The sarcophagi are incredible.",
          "If you want some time to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Tower and its surroundings this is the place to go. Rectangular, collonaded, marble walkways - tombstones actually - memorials to the powerful and wealthy of Pisa and deceased popes. Central, lawned 'courtyards'",
          "After having visited the 'stuccos' in Piazza dei Miracoli, Camposanto has the frescos being started from the 'stuccos'; it is still amazing that these pieces of art have come to our time from generation to generation and passing through peace times and triturated times.",
          "The plain exterior does not hint at the treasures to be found inside. Much of the Camposanto was destroyed by bombing in 1944 and was restored in the 1970's. This is a cool, quiet sight taking one back to the 13th Century. Fascinating burial markers, sculptures, and statues.",
          "This is a nice place if you appreciate history and know who is buried there. On the internet you can find information about it or get a tour guide.",
          "I'm not normally one to visit cemeteries, especially not on holiday, but Camposanto is really worth the visit. Cool and calm - it gets you away from the crowds. Lovely stonework and lots to see.",
          "You can enter the cathedral for free on a timed ticket or go whenever you like if you buy a ticket for one of the other monumnets too so we had not planned to see anything else but were really glad we did. We chose (on the advice of one of the staff) the camposanto which is",
          "Beautiful ceiling art & floor tributes with many unique wall statues and comes part of the tourist package. Some of the ceiling & wall artwork is undergoing restoration but still plenty to see & admire.",
          "Peaceful and a beautiful setting, we wandered around at our own pace and found it absolutely fascinating",
          "A calm place to spend up to an hour. The recovered frescos are a great insight into how the locals appeared and dressed all those centuries ago. We could have done with a better guide, either written or audio(there wasn't one). I only managed to pick out Fibanachi, but probably",
          "This is the burial old burial/graveyard, a very good place to unwind from the noise surrounding the tower, its very calm & quiet.",
          "On the outside, this is not a terribly impressive building to look at, but inside it is amazing. The walls are covered with beautiful frescos, some in better shape than others, but all amazing. Be sure to check out the fresco of the mediaeval cosmos in one corner of the",
          "I think we spent 20 minutes walking around this, and that included getting stuck and back tracking because they were working on a section and we couldn\u2019t get to the exit. Not much to see. I don\u2019t think I took any pictures.",
          "When you read in the guidebooks it sounds great but it is not well presented. You keep looking for the relics, there is an earth from Golgotha here , plenty of old sarcophagus and paintings on the wall, maybe even famous people buried but you have difficulties in finding it and",
          "This is a beautiful cemetery that could be easily overlooked, but if you buy a ticket for the tower you can also include a visit to this little cemetery. It has a lovely, peaceful courtyard. Many of the frescoes were damaged during World War II. There isn't much information",
          "This building looks like a library or an accounting office. But in fact its a cemetery. Not sure if everybody would like to see it.",
          "This is a huge walled and covered cemetery that also has some frescoes and statues that have survived fires and WW II bombing. I found the tombs fascinating and haven't seen another cemetery like this. If you take the time to come and see the Leaning Tower you should also",
          "So interesting This is a cemetery full of graves and sarcophagi Also many interesting frescoes on the walls",
          "When I last visited about 3 years ago, I did not have to pay to visit this site - and from what I remember of it, it did not warrant a fee.",
          "The frescoes have undergone some restoration and are amazing to see. The tombs are fascinating. You get some interesting views of the cathedral and the tower through the openings in the courtyard. Be sure to visit the museum exhibit as well to learn more about the restoration.",
          "Much of the frescoes on the walls are missing or heavily damaged. There are a number of statues from tombs present which are worth seeing and it is a quieter place compared to the other attractions. Overall worth visiting.",
          "This was probably one of the most humbling places we visited, had tombs from the 13th century until 40 years ago I was with my granddaughter of 11 yeears old and we spent more time in here than anywhere else, fantastic on a nice sunny day but no more spoilers",
          "The entrance to Camposanto was included in the ticket I bought to visit the Leaning Tower and the Baptistery. It is a very quiet place full of beatiful and historical graves but not as interesting as expected",
          "A visit to the Camposanto is definitely recommended for any visitor to Pisa. In terms of things to see, there isn't much, but in terms of taking in the history of the place, it's incredible. The legend is that the Camposanto was built around a shipload of soil from Christ's",
          "We paid for entrance to three of the attractions here and have to say we were not disappointed. The hell fresco is quite eerie and I couldn't bring myself to photograph it! The building is stunning and does not feel crowded at any time. Well worth a visit.",
          "The Hell Fresco is amazing. It took me a few moments to realize what I was seeing when I was there: Satan chewing up sinners, digesting them, and then pooping them into hell!",
          "Amazing place. Wonderful frescoes, statues, floors and was good to get away from noisy crowds near Tower.",
          "Camposanto was constructed in 1277. You have to purchase either one, two or three monument tickets to get into the Cathedral, Baptistery, Camposanto or Leaning Tower. We purchased the one monument ticket which got us into Camposanto plus the Cathedral. Cannot get into the",
          "Very interesting place to visit. Wasn't expecting for what I saw. This was worth visiting as it gave an invite to the rich history of Italy",
          "This building was beautiful. We didn't go inside because it was too expensive. We did walk arounbd and admire the architecture. Lots of people there the day we were there.",
          "Everyone take a photo of the tower, a lot go into the cathedral, not so many visit the battistero, and almost no one decide to go into this amazing and beautiful place... roman sarcophagus reused in medieval times, huge frescoes from renaissance, and an unforgettable atmosphere.",
          "If it is a hot day this is the building to go in to cool down, very high ceilings and lots of open space.",
          "This building contains many monuments and statues and seems to currently being restored by the inclusion of copies of the original painted walls. It is a surprisingly large building enclosing a small garden. The full history is in the nearby museum. A relatively cheap entrance",
          "An ancient cemetery with some history behind it. But there was little information provided with boards or audio guides. A good place to visit nevertheless.",
          "My wife and I were moved by this gravesite built as a abbey shaped building with tombs laid in the floors with elaborate stones over a 1000 year span. The large frescos on the walls are in a state of repair( damaged in WWW 2 ). The ones finished are beautiful and elaborate! It",
          "The building is a great place to visit. However, make sure that you have the internet or a guidebook to hand as there is zero information displayed. You can pay to listed to comments at a phone by the entrance, but that is it! A simple handout to be returned on leaving would do",
          "Absolutely loved visiting this site as the crowds outside bustled to take photos of the tower and wander around the Piazza. The frescoes within Camposanto are breathtaking and really worth seeing. I was struck by how quiet this site was and how lucky we were to have an almost",
          "Pisa is all about the tower, but this stunning building is well worth the time! It's peaceful and tranquil, almost everything the tower isn't. The walls are decorated with beautiful murals and frescos that are currently being restored to their previous glories. Spend the time,",
          "The Campo Santo cemetery was constructed in the 13th and 14th C. That the frescoes have even survived is somewhat astonishing. But they are also very powerful and engaging. Relatively few of the tourist crowds come into the Campo Santo so you can enjoy the frescoes in",
          "We purchased the 8 euro ticket that also included entry to the Baptistry, Camposanto and Museo deile Sinopie. Most people walked through the Camposanto relatively quickly since there were not many descriptions in English. Several of the frescoes were being restored. This site",
          "Theres nothing to say except say incredible and amazing moment in my wedding 10 ANNIVERSARY, will be back again n again",
          "It's a long rectangular building around a grassy central courtyard. A bit like cloisters. But the purpose is to be a burial ground for the great and good of Pisa. Local bigwigs chose to be buried here. Lots of professors from the university of Pisa. Bishops, deputy",
          "This place is really amazing with really interesting features in the exterior and with amazing architecture. It is advisable to go even to the interior, but i had no time due to the fact that I was on a tour and thus I was tight with time.",
          "We visited Pisa's Piazza dei Miracoli for the Leaning Tower but also bought tickets to visit the other buildings and I am so glad we did, as the Camposanto for us was the highlight of the day! It is a long rectangular building which surrounds a lawned courtyard and contains some",

          "The \"camposanto\" is actually a monumental cemetery, with dozen of roman sarcophagus , frescos , statues and marbles. It really worth a visit when you visit piazza dei miracoli, where the leaning tower is. BUT the visit to the Camposanto was discouraging : there was no direction",

          "Got the ticket pack and this was bonus. We went in a summer morning and there were few people inside. There is an amazing history: all the monuments and frescoes were destroyed by a bomb and after World War II restoration work began.",

          "I think that the best part of this structure is the interior garden. Again, so many people seem to go to Pisa only for the tower and miss out on so much more history. Inside there are crypts and even the floor contains remains of nobles and what appear to be religious figures.",
          "The Camposanto is, again, surprisingly large but quiet and beautiful. Walking amongst the very old sarcophagi and epitaphs was very interesting as were the very old frescoes within. Again, well worth the visit.",

          "We were just going to do a quick walk through, Heaven forbid I should miss something! But we spent an hour and a half in this lovely monumental cemetery. There were only a handful of people inside, which is a shame as it's definitely worth visiting. The statuary on the tombs",

          "Brought entrance tickets along with Leaning Tower of Pisa + another mounment, so we paid Leaning tower of Pisa entrane fee 18 euros + 7 euros for entrance into the 2 mouments. The toilet is just before the camposanto and i think it was 1 euro. Once inside the place is stunning",
          "Only 5 euro and not so crowded, camposanto had beautiful frescos and graves. We even stumbled upon fibonnaci's grave. Camposanto is supposedly to be built on top of soil that was brought from Israel. Definitely worth a short visit.",

          "The Camposanto was the most interesting of the monuments at Piazza dei Miracoli. The tombs in the floors tell the story of the city in almost two millenia, and so do the beautiful old sarcophagi along the walls. Also it is quiet and not very crowded compared to the other",
          "This is a terrific place to visit. Although a lot of the frescoes were destroyed during a fire caused by bombing in WWII, the marble scultures and Roman sarcophagi are still there. There are 3 chapels there and we visited the chapel of holy relics which supposedly contains"

        "wiki": "Santa Maria della Spina is a small church in the Italian city of Pisa. The church, erected around 1230 in the Pisan Gothic style, and enlarged after 1325, was originally known as Santa Maria di Pontenovo for the newer bridge that existed nearby, collapsed in the 15th century, and was never rebuilt. \nThe name of della Spina (\"of the thorn\") derives from the presence of a thorn, putatively part of the crown of thorns placed on Christ during his Passion and Crucifixion. The relic was brought to this church in 1333. In 1871 the church was dismantled and rebuilt on a higher level due to dangerous infiltration of water from the Arno river. The church was altered in the process, however, and John Ruskin, who visited Pisa in 1872, was outraged about the restoration.. The church no longer houses the \u201cthorn\u201d. The \u201cthorn\u201d is now in the Chiesa di Santa Chiara, which is on show inside and can be found on Via Roma.\nThe church of Santa Maria della Spina has always been administered by the city, except for short interruptions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when it fell to the responsibility of the local hospital.\n\n\n== Exterior ==\nThe church has one of the most outstanding Gothic edifices in Europe: it has a rectangular plant, with an external facing wholly composed of marble, laid in polychrome bands. The exterior appearance is marked by cusps, tympani and tabernacles, together with a complicated sculpture decoration with tarsiae, rose-windows and numerous statues from the main Pisane artists of the 14th century. These include Lupo di Francesco, Andrea Pisano with his sons Nino and Tommaso, and Giovanni di Balduccio.\nThe fa\u00e7ade has two gates with lintelled arches. Among these lies the tabernacle with the statues of Madonna with the Child and two Angels, attributed to Giovanni Pisano. Two niches open in the upper part of the fa\u00e7ade: these house the statue of Christ among the two Annunciation ones, and two other angels.\nThe right side has also a rich decoration with cusps and thirteen statues of the Apostles and Christ, from Lupo's workshop. The small sculptures portraying Saints and Angels over the tympani are from Nino Pisano's workshop, while the niche in the right pillar has a Madonna with Child by Giovanni di Balduccio.\nThe back side has three round arches with simple windows. The tympani are decorated with the Evangelists' symbols, intervalled by niches with the statues of the Saints Peter, Paul and John the Baptist. The high pyramid-like spires end with the statues of the Madonna with Child between two angels, by Nino Pisano.\n\n\n== Interior ==\nIf compared to the rich exterior, the interior appears quite simple. It has a single room, with a ceiling painted during the 19th century reconstruction. In the presbytery's centre is one of the highest masterpieces of Gothic sculpture, the Madonna of the Rose by Andrea and Nino Pisano. On the left wall is the tabernacle in which once was the crown's relic, by Stagio Stagi (1534). Another statue by the Pisanos, the Madonna del Latte, was once here, but has been moved to the city's National Museum of San Matteo.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGothic architecture in Italy\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Santa Maria della Spina (Pisa) at Wikimedia Commons\n\nPage at Antropologia Arte Sacra",

          "We hit upon this gem of a church, sited at the riverside. It has free access and is definitely worth a visit, inside and outside due to the magnificent sculptures adorning the walls.",
          "This beautiful Pisan gothic church, which reportedly had one of the thorns of Jesus crown, was moved from a lower level by the river to its current location, just overlooking the river. At sunset, the sunlight enters through the coloured glass windows for a truly magnificent",
          "Lovely small church sitting at the edge of the Arno on the sidewalk. It\u2019s my guess that the road that bisects the river and the church was shifted slightly so as to not have to move/damage this church - it is sort of out there on its own \u2018island.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t open when I visited,",
          "Amazing location for this small little church. Very interesting design and worth a stop off for a photo.",
          "We visited Pisa on a Thursday and discovered this charming little church right on the banks for the Arno. It is an incredibly beautiful church from the outside so I was really hoping that we could see inside - alas it was closed both when we walked past on the way to the",
          "The Thorn of the crown of Jesus Christ is supposedly the reason to built this edifice. It offers an insight in the minds of people in the early renaissance. Truly astonishing...",
          "George C from Toronto was right when he wrote that this little gem is \u201cfairy tale beautiful.\u201d I saw it from the bus on the way to the Leaning Tower and found it captivating to look at. I had no idea what in the world it was and why in the world it was situated by the river",
          "All locked up - we walked a long way to visit this. Should read the reviews first. No information regarding opening times at the church so didn't go back.",
          "Came across this walking from the station to our hotel. Very ornate on the outside church right on the side of the river. Unfortunately it was closed when we visited, look up the opening times if you want to see this",
          "Came across this by chance on the way from the railway station to the tower. Fantastically decorated on the outside, rather plain inside, well worth searching out for those wanting to see something else in Pisa, apart from the usual suspects.",
          "This tiny church on the river bank once stood by a long out bridge so now it looks slightly apart form its surroundings. It is a gem of a building both outside and in. It has been renovated but it is a stunning building with distinctive stone work. Free entry.",
          "This little church is right on the Arno River as you are going from the train station to the Tower. In great shape and so well preserved. I believe it is from the 13th century. Make sure you take time to see it.",
          "This little church looks like something from a Disney movie set. Unfortunately it was scaffolded and under renovation in June 2019 when we walked along the Arno from our free parking near the bus terminal to the Piazza Dei Miracoli to see the Tower. If the renovations are",
          "This is a very beautiful Gothic church. If you take a walk along the Arno river you will notice first it's strange location: as it is located right on the embankment of the river. As if it could drop into the water at any moment. On the outside it's all marble, and crowded with",
          "We took a wrong turn walking from the station looking for our appartment next to Palazzo Blue and ended up this quaint little church built into the river wall. I was quite captivated and we returned later (minus our luggage) to look inside. I loved the interior for its humilty",

          "It's a lovely odd thing to see, a perfect miniature (Tuscan) Gothic cathedral, and you're going to be admiring the city-scale of Pisa along the Arno anyway. Walk away from behind, and keep walking to the next bridge, you'll more fine full-sized structures on your right,",
          "By the side of the river this de-consecrated church has been renovated and open to the public for free.",
          "Very very small! Would only be here for less than 5 minutes! But the outside is absolutely stunning! And it was on the way from the station to the Piazza Del Duomo",
          "We could see this from our hotel room, so decided to walk round to it. Lovely walk at the side of the river and a beautiful little church, we did not go in, as it was closed.",
          "Very pretty on the outside as it sits along the river with the mountains in the background. Not too much on the inside. We stopped by on our way to the Tower from the train station.",

          "When you are just walking along the river, you will just \"meet\" this amazing piece of art. Nothing hype around this church, but there should be, because it's just so amazing, detailed, and it caught your eyes. Inside, it was surprising for us because lots of chairs were inside",
          "A lovely, simple church but nothing to it. I suppose the way religious prayer was meant to be, simple and modest but as a tourist its not overly worth going to. But if you are walking by, step in as its free and something to see at the end of the day but i wouldn't rush to it by",
          "If you're in Pisa, make sure to stop at this little church. The architecture is beautiful and reminded me of some of the churches in Florence because of the colors. It is right on the Arno River and easy to get to from most locations.",

          "Walking from the train station toward the Leaning Tower of Pisa, before crossing the bridge across the river, many will find it almost impossible not to stop, walk down a just bit to see this beautiful little church close up. Part fairy tale castle, part sugar decoration, the",
          "This is a nice stop before visiting the famous Leaning Tower. Midway between the train station and the tower, it belongs to the unique Pisan architectural style and shares some similarities with the tower. The interior is relatively austere.",

          "Passing buy on a wet Sunday we visited this very small church after reading about the history. I was a bit disappointed that it was no longer consecrated but the outside alone is well worth a visit.",
          "But we only saw the outside. It is open 3 to 6 in the afternoon only so a visit needs to be planned, not random as ours was!",
          "Located along the Arno riverbank, between Lungarno Gambacorti and the Arno it sits by itself. It dates from the early 1200\u2019s and is gothic in style. Worth stopping by for a look at the intricate outside and the relatively spartan interior.",
          "A cute little church which is easy to miss. There is nothing inside worth seeing, but it\u2019s worth a trip across the river to have a look at the exterior. Difficult to photograph due to the road and shade, but very cute nonetheless.",
          "We had a great picture of the Chiesa, the river and the snowy mountains behind. It is a free entrance, it is small but it is worth it visit it.",
          "Visible from a distance on a bank of the Arno, and compelling to visit, this tiny chapel is absolutely beautiful. Not always open but worth seeking out.",

          "It's a very small interesting church ..located in the Bank of Arno river.. very charming and different then the other churches in Italy",
          "The church is a very small but fantastically detailed treasure of a building. If you are interested in design and the architecture that past centuries and cultures have passed down to us, then this is a must. It is just one of the many delights a visit to Pisa gives you the",
          "We did not research enough about this place, so when we got there we were surprised that it is so small. We were also surprised that we could not get in. I am not sure why it was closed to the public. But it is very nice, all the details are great, we only spent a few minutes",
          "Whilst the thorn from the crown of Jesus has not been at this church for many centuries we thought we should still take a look . The exterior is outstanding despite all the work at surrounding area . Closed during the week unfortunately",
          "Amazing construction on the outside, like a fairytale castle. Inside.. an art instillation comprising of a few metal blocks. Situated on the river Arno.",
          "Thus church is right by the river and is much smaller than you expect. The architecture is amazing and incredibly ornate. The interior, however, is a complete anti climax. Legend stats that one of spikesof Christs crown of thorns once rested there however there is no narrative",
          "This gem of a building--like a marble reliquary, has often not be open, since it not a functional church, This season the New York MInimaist Richard Nonas created an installation of parallelpipeds for the usually empty interior. Thus I finally coud see the inside, which is",
          "an interesting little church this with a long history. gothic in style it was built to hold a relic, a thorn said to come from Christ's crown of thorns. originally built further down the river, on lower ground, and moved to its current spot to save it from any water damage.",
          "what an absolutely small but glorious church - especially outside ! it just looks like an overdone wedding cake but close up there is just so much to see and admire - the stone work is absolutely beautiful ! even inside which is not as ornate is worth a visit (we were not",

          "A very beautiful little church on the borders of the Arno. Don't expect anything greats, but enjoy the nice statues en especially the ceiling",
          "A bit deceptive, BEAUTIFUL little chapel from the outside, but if you pay the 2\u20ac to look inside you will find...well, nothin'! The crown of thorns relic has long gone and so it basically an very small empty, nondescript chapel. Stay outside and save yourself 2\u20ac!",
          "The church is beautiful from the outside and has an interesting history which can be found on a plaque outside the door of the church. Entrance is currently (June 2017) \u20ac2, in which you get another information board, and can see an art exhibition. At the moment it is an",
          "This church is sat by the side of the river and looks like it's just been plonked there! It is very clean and fancy but looks out of place sat there all by itself!",
          "It's a nice little church right next to the river. It's used to display art exhibitions now so it cost me \u20ac2 to go inside. The exhibit was pretty weird. The architecture is beautiful and very intricate. I enjoyed the inside but the outside is also really beautiful!",
          "This is a very pretty, very little, church on the banks of the Arno river in the centre of Pisa. The intricate decoration of the exterior is worth stopping to admire. The interior is less elaborate but well worth a look too when it is open. When we visited it was hosting a",

          "Small Gothic church next to river Arno Original architecture Found it on way back to the railway station Its so interesting walking and finding places like this",
          "Witness beautiful Italian architecture in this Duomo, situated along the river...one of the few sights in Pisa away from the Piazza della Miracoli, The Chiesa Di Santa Maria is definitely worth a visit while strolling along the river bank.",
          "It is a very small but beautiful church by the river in Pisa. I found it by luck while trying to reach the the leaning tower. Unfortunately it was closed but I guess it might be worth a visit.",

          "You can't miss this unassuming chapel beside the river with its beautiful architecture and unique story - makes for a photogenic moment beside the river particularly during sunset.",
          "Walking along beside the River Arno, I just happened to see this very beautiful little church but closed & I went back another day to see the inside which was well worth visiting - basically a simple space, i.e. no seats, but architecturally interesting & worth photographs.",
          "Aside the river in Pisa, this small little church is a marvel, with excellent carved stone decorations and not very knows to the tourists.",

          "I highly recommend visiting this little gem. the architecture on the outside is incredible. In the inside you wont find much as it's quite bare but the outside is well worth it",
          "Free to enter, this tiny church has a beautiful carved roof and is lovely inside as well as out. I went out of my way to look at it and it was well worth the detour.",
          "Walking along the river you can't help but notice this little church, so as the sun was shinning we investigated. It was closed when we got there but a friendly local gave us amazing talk of the church, it is rich in marble and even more in history.but one thing that amazed me",

          "Well worth the short walk from the famous Tower of Pisa, and there are plenty of places to eat or get ice cream along the way. It's about halfway between the Tower and the railway station, and looks very quaint situated on the river bank.",
          "This is one of the smallest churches in Pisa, but also one of the most beautiful. The architecture is just stunning and its location next to the River Arno is lovely. We saw this church nearly every day. Take a few minutes to go and have a look.",
          "I think this is the most beautiful building in the whole of Pisa. The only downer was it was closed when we went past so we couldn't pop in.",
          "On the South bank of the river Arno which more or less divides Pisa in two. It's possibly the most elaborate church architecture per square metre in the world. Supposedly named after a thorn (spina) from the crown of thorns that they gave Jesus Christ before his execution -",
          "Some of the most amazing sculpting. Caution - opening hours are 10-12 and 17-20, but it's worth the trip just to see the outside.",
          "Not a major walk from the leaning tower so well worth it. Stunning little church. As most people have said you can't go inside but it's so beautiful, it would be crazy to miss it if your in Pisa. The detail on the church is just amazing. Right by the river on a sunny day it's",
          "Just like most architecture in Italy this was one to definitely see - very beautiful, peaceful and easy to get to.",
          "Once again, at times, you feel as if Pisa is struggling to find things to interest it's visitors after they've seen the Tower. This is a pretty little church built on the side of the Arno. It didn't appear to be open when we passed so was only viewed from the outside.",
          "It's well worth walking past this little church on the way to the main attractions. It's a wonderful, if not tiny, little Gothic church built to house a thorn from Christ's crown. Interesting and beautiful.",
          "It's a very small but intricate Church on the side of the River Arne. Couldn't see it from the inside and it got its name from the one Thorn of Jesus's Crown at the Crucifiction that is apparently kept here.",
          "We spotted this little place when at our hotel, walked past it while looking round the newer part of Pisa and it is a great looking little place.",
          "A rather weird little church with intricate external carvings. It's difficult to get a good look at the front because of its close proximity to a busy road and nearby streets/buildings.",
          "nice building from outside but inside is just not much happening - not much to say specially that it is just a small building used for exhibitions.",
          "Art installation took up much of the internal space. Lovely little church, directly on the the edge of the Arno. Certainly worth a stop when you are walking along the river or crossing the Ponte Solferino on your way someplace else",
          "This was the first sight I saw in Pisa as I passed it on my way too and from my hotel visiting all the big sights. I spent a lot of photographic time on it. I hope you do.",
          "Really unusual church sitting on a bridge. It was housing an art exhibition, but was worth going in to look around. The style is breathtaking.",
          "For a stroll along the river Arno the Spina is a beautiful sight. Entrance is not normally possible. But you will enjoy the exterior of the building located directly by the river Arno.",
          "The most beautiful feature of this small church is the outside. When we visited there was a small art exposition inside and entrance was free",
          "Couldn't gey in, it was closed but very beautiful architecture. Right on the river easy to get to. Was a stop on the way to the mural, i need to write 100 characters really?",
          "We were given a tour here by our local guide. So much information and kind of similar to other church around Italy but has their own local cultural touch.",
          "This is a unique little church, built right on the Pisa riverbank. Don't worry, however, if you can't get in to see the inside of the church. I was there when there was a special art exhibit. You quickly realize that all the decoration was saved for the outside; the inside is",
          "Cant really miss this building it stands out on the river bank near the Ponte Mezzo. Only 10 15 minutes from the tower.",
          "This ornate building seems out of place on the banks of the river Arno but is the more interesting for it. Good views against a more modern background add to the interest.",
          "This tiny church is built on the river bank and I managed to get in to have a look around five minutes before closing. It's amazing from the outside with beautiful and unique details both inside and out. It won't take much time to stop and enjoy but well worth it.",
          "Went to visit Chiesa and I was really impress. It is located alongside the Arno's river, its amazing architecture is simply perfect. It is a miniature which, I think, makes it more enchanting. Apparently it is not open so you can see it from outside but it is worth.",
          "I could see the Chiesa from my hotel room, and I ran by it on my early morning jogs along the Arno. Beautiful Gothic architecture in miniature. It's basically never open for visitors, but is lovely and photogenic from outside.",
          "We had read about this Church which was built to house a thorn from Jesus's crown of thorns and found it quite easily on the banks of the river Arno. However, we were disappointed that it was locked up and we were unable to view the inside.",
          "Lovely little church on the walk up from the station to the Tower. Check opening times, though, because it is often shut.",
          "this is a truly beautiful church next to the tower of pisa. On taking a tour around you will love the beauty and be amazed at the way it has been maintained all these years.",
          "Against the other churches in Pisa this could be overlooked which is a shame as it is small but beautiful and is a significant part of the waterfront. Worth going out of your way to see which will also include the river views.",
          "Beautiful little church perched on the river bank in the middle of the city. Stands out from the crowd even though it's surrounded by present buildings. You can't actually go in but the architecture on the outside is lovely. You can still even see the war wounds it has.",
          "This church is close to the river, very easy to reach, but we spent three days in Pisa and it was always closed and there is information about when it's open. Anyway, outside is really beautiful and if you are close, go to see it.",
          "you could literally spend a long time sitting and looking at all the carvings on the building.. if you are into architecture.. :) cool",
          "We just walked by this church on our walking tour around Pisa, but it is very pretty - quite small - but so white clean and unusual with the three peaks spires. Very nice to look at from the outside.",
          "We took a long walk around the water to visit this beautiful little building. From the outside it is very quaint and lovely - but it is closed. Personally I would not recommend taking a long walk to view the Chiesa, but if you are within a reasonable walking distance then it's",
          "It was closed so you can only views it from all angles from the street. Not sure why it is closed but would have loved to go inside. It is truly beautiful from afar and so intricate when you get up close.",
          "We had seen this building on the way to our hotel and again when we were on our horse carriage ride what a beautiful looking building",
          "After visiting Piazza dei Miracoli, we decided to walk back to the train station. since I know there are few places worth visiting on our way back and this church is one of them. Situated on one of the banks of Arno River. It has a gothic style architecture. We were only able to",
          "I have visited Catholic Cathedrals in many Italian cities, but this one had my favourite interior. The intricate detail on the ceilings and the sculpted marble is exquisite.",
          "It looks lovely, it is on a funny spot, so close to the river... but it is still closed.. it is an option walk past it on your way to the palazzo blu (museum 200 m further), but looking at it wont take more than 5 minutes. I found it funny to see, nice, but not a must see.",
          "This small gothic style church in the bans of the Arno is worth a passing look. It was closed when we were there. The outside is ornate and in a style somewhat different to other Italian churches.",
          "The intricate architecture on this mini church is stunning and it is not to be missed a few hundred yards from Palazzo Blu.",
          "Chiesa di Santa Maria della Spina is a little island of beauty and vintage style, located on the shore of the river Arno. In spite of its small size this church fits on its facade a whole symphony of art. The building is fantastic, not overloaded with unnecessary elements; the",
          "Walking down the Arno you are confronted with a small chapel on the quay. There is no other word than just NIFTY.",
          "Went to look at this church on a Wednesday at about 10 am but it was closed. Its external architecture is beautiful but could not appreciate its interior.",
          "I saw photos of this small gothic church on the Internet before my holidays, so when visiting Pisa I walked there to get some photos, but sadly the entire building was covered in scaffolding as part of a major restoration project. I am sure it will be worth seeing when the",
          "Stroll by the church on our way to lunch! A lovely surprise for us, we did enjoy it's beauty and is just by the river",
          "This interesting little church is a part of the walkway that lines either side of the River Arno. As such, it is quite unusual. It was under renovation, so we could not go inside.",
          "Fabulous looking church alongside the Arno River. The church is probably one of the most outstanding Gothic edifices ever but, unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t see much or even look inside because it\u2019s currently undergoing major restoration work. So disappointing not to be able to see",
          "Very small place but it is built wonderful lots of views and not to difficult to find. We were unable to get inside to see it but as it was by the canal. Nice to see",
          "This looked like an interesting attraction so we decided to stop by. It is actually on a busy street with no parking near by. It is closed for renovation. The picture is also somewhat deceptive. It is actually a very small building: about 13m x 13m. It is cute but may or may not",
          "Surrounded in scaffolding in Sept 15, but still interesting from the outside.can be easily reached via the left hand road from the rail staton to the tower. Also just by a bridge over the Arno.",
          "Ciao Florence Tours really let us down by not booking or reserving the FREE tickets required to see the interior of this building. We were told only 15 minutes before arriving after travelling from Florence. Likewise the leaning Tower... Hopeless.",
          "Liked... the location & the history of the building. Shame it was our turn to encounter scaffolding all over it... but understand these places have to be looked after with major preservation work at some time. Thank you Pisa.",
          "A tiny church covered in scaffolding right now. But we've visited several times in the past and you should check the web sites to see when the cleaning is complete. You won't be going to Pisa for Santa Maria della Spina so you might check when you cross the Arno on the way to",
          "The entire church was covered in plastic sheets and metal scaffolding when we visited in mid-July. All entrances were also blocked so we couldn't even peep inside to have a look. Very disappointing as the story about the church was so interesting. Maybe on another visit",
          "The Church of Santa Maria della Spina on the River Arno was erected in 1230 and allegedly houses a piece of thorn from part of Christ\u2019s crown of thorns brought here in 1333, or so the story goes. Unfortunately there are extensive renovations being carried out and we were unable",
          "The whole church is covered in scaffolding. Not worth a visit. I think you can still go inside, however",
          "After reading a review my husband and I walked down to the river to see this pretty church, only to find it has not been open to the public for a long time it is just a shell at present and it will be quite a while before it reopens. Check before going",
          "Beautiful building in a beautiful city. One of many stunning in Pisa. Well worth a visit. Amazing place",
          "Fantastick ! Spend time meditating. Go to confession and take comunion. Try to get there for early Mass.",
          "It is not often that buildings so thoroughly Gothic can be found in Italy. This tiny but gorgeous church can be found on the bank of the river Arno, you can find it while taking an evening stroll along the river",
          "We found this church by chance whilst walking along the river. its currently under renovation but its beauty can still be seen and admired. Wish I had gone inside.",
          "Currently closed and covered in scaffolding, but you can still see some of the fine architectural details and sculptures on the outside. A little gem.",
          "This tiny little church, covered in more decorations than a wedding cake, sits on the banks of the Arno river which flows through Pisa. If you are walking from Pisa Centrale railway station up to the Piazza dei Miracoli (to see the leaning tower) then it is on the way. It's",
          "Read a lot about this small but elegant church. So, when were on Pisa, we were quite eager to see it. But unfortunately it is undergoing restoration. But whatever we could see from outside looked nice. It is placed right along the Arno which adds to the view.",
          "this was a must see during my visit in Pisa, but unfortunately for me it was undergoing restoration in December, 2014. I still got to see bits here and there and I would still strongly suggest it. It is a charming Gothic church just beside the river, rich of history and",
          "Santa Maria della Spina is a small but very beautiful church located right at the Arno River in Pisa. Pisa is mostly known for its Leaning Tower, but this remarkable tiny church is worth a closer look. It was built in 1230 and originally named Santa Maria di Pontenovo after the",
          "Well worth the visit to spend time looking the art and marble. The peace and tranquility was marvelous allowing us time for contemplation.",
          "I spent more time in this church than in many bigger churches. It just has so many nice small paintings, statues and things to see that don't pale in contract to each other. There is no big altarpiece here, just a lot of nice things to see. This opens up the mind to explore all",
          "A pity that the Santa Maria della Spina was under construction (nothing mentioned on the internet). So instead of a beautiful little church along the Arno, it looked like a sad heap of stone with nothing to offer. I hope that you will be luckier when you get there to admire this",
          "Wonderful art, but the brochures and explanations that are in English are almost incomprehensible - a strong recommendation to the Italian authorities - give them more support!!",
          "It's a nice old church, free to view, didn't get to go inside but it great to read the history also written in English.",
          "I saw this church on one of Rick Steve's travel shows to Italy. Well worth the stop as your crossing over the river.",
          "Incredible carvings. It is so beautiful right on the river. Unbelievable that it survived the second word war. There are bullet holes in the structure still remaining. Very beautiful and very small. Worth a quick stop while in Pisa",
          "This church is very small but a spectacular building. The work on it is amazing, its very close to the river. Unfortunate for us it was closed when we visited but well worth a visit just to look at the outside.",
          "Of all the churches that I visited while in Italy, this is by far, the most memorable. It is also the cutest church I've ever seen. It appears tiny when looking at the buildings that dwarf it just across the street. It has a gorgeously intricate gothic facade that seems quite",
          "It sounds ironical but despite the small size, this church looks grandeous because of its beauty and style. It was one attraction I did not see from inside, but its outer beauty is enough to impress me.",
          "We searched and joy of joys it was open exhibiting plumb bobs from the 2nd century to the present day. Get there from 5pm until the 26 July and you can see the interior of this wonderful building. My wife thought the exhibition was hilarious, she is a philstine!",
          "Beautiful amazing architecture with statues and frescoes, This amazing little church on the banks of the River Arno (which basically cuts Pisa into two) The church was always closed when we wanted to visit. So alas we will have to visit Pisa again!",

          "From a distance on the other side of the Arno, it looks appealing and close-to the detail on the exterior is just amazing. So much work. Sadly the place was locked up and so we couldn't get in to have a look round. Maybe it's permanently locked?",
          "Lovely small Church on the bank of the Arno, with some impressive sculptures outside. However was closed so couldn't see the inside, which was a bit of a let down. Still worth going to see, if you enter Pisa by train then it's directly north of the train station and south of the",
          "We had to walk past this little church to get from our hotel to the city centre. As others have mentioned, it seems to be closed all the time. The hotel looked it up for us and gave us some times but it was still fermata. Fortunately the people setting up the exhibition happened",
          "Yes, Pisano decorated the exterior which is quite ornate, and the interior is relatively sparse and adorned by statues of women, the only Catholic church in which I've seen women. I haven't been in a while and to hear from fellow writers that it's usually closed is a shame.",
          "Lovely from the outside but sadly was not open when we were there. Lots of the statues are actually in the museum near San Matteo church the opposite side of the river",
          "This tiny church was closed when we were there but the sight is still amazing -- like a miniature of one of the great churches. Most interesting point: it was disassembled stone by stone and reconstructed 3 meters (?) higher along the Arno to preserve it from flooding. It's",
          "Imagine my surprise and delight to come upon this gorgeous little church sitting right on the side of the Arno River! I had not read about this church, and was not able to enter, but feasted my eyes instead on the incredible Gothic architecture. Whether or not you're able to go",
          "This beautiful little chapel, on one bank of the River Arno, was built to house what was believed to be one of the thorns from Christ's crown of thorns. The road has to depart from the river bank to go round it, so it's easy to veiw the exterior, but we were disappointed that",
          "The exquisite church of Santa Maria della Spina is one of the prettiest fairy-tale churches in Italy. Designed in classic Pisan Gothic style, the building dates back to 1230, with Gothic enlargements in the 1350s. Originally, the building sat close to the river, and it was moved",
          "Visited here on a day trip from Florence. Was disappointed as although it was a beautiful building it was not open and not signage to say if and when it was. The guide books rated it highly due to having an apparent thorn from Christs crown.",
          "We managed to find this beautiful little church we spied it from the main bridge over the Arno we crossed and walked along the riverside to the next bridge and crossed back to it. The architecture was awesome. We would have liked to have gone in as there is supposed to be one of",
          "Don't pass by this little cathedral, we stopped by it at sunset, and God, how amazed we were. The sun over the Arno river and the colourful buildings nearby contrasted beautifully with the building's facade.",
          "This is a tiny church built to house a thorn ('spina') from the Crown of Thorns. Its fa\u00e7ade is viewable when crossing the Arno on the Ponte Solferino. We stopped to see it while walking from the train station up to the Campo dei Miracoli, and were so glad to have done so! There",
          "We passed by this lovely little church walking back to the train station after climbing the tower. Its so pretty right on the river that we just had to stop in.",
          "This beautiful building is easy to miss, but worth the walk. The Gothic features of the little church are exemplified by sculptures on the facade. Every character is rendered in exquisite detail. It's the surprise art treat that most tourists miss.",
          "An architectural gem but difficult for the tourist to access. Non the less, look at the detail. Note the wonderful detail, keeping in mind the relic from the crown of thorns is supposedly inside. Then cross the bridge and look back at the river that once was home to the",
          "Conspicuously white, small church on the bank of Arno, on top of small, thin, Gothic turrets. It\u2019s also special for me because I had seen just large Gothic churches. Opening hours: October to March: Tuesday-Sunday 10-14.; April to September: Tuesday-Friday 10-14 and 15-18",

          "it was small, closed and totally pointless to make an effort to see. Theres so much more beautiful and cultural things to see. It really is just a nothing to a tourist who is looking to see something impressive. Its a small church. Thats it",
          "Everything in Florence was built in greatness and enormous in sizes but this church was humbly constructed on a very small scale in 1230 but it was really worth a visit. It sits right by the Arno river and you can't miss it on your way to the Piazza dei Miracoli from the train",
          "Santa Maria della Spina is more interesting from the outside as it is an architecture masterpiece of Gotic Style, if you manage to find it open do visit, it will take you about 10 minutes.",
          "Santa Maria della Spina is a charming little church perched above the Arno like a cathedral in miniature. The designs on the exterior are worth a close look. It is fascinating to learn that the church once sat below the Lungarno and was disassembled and moved above the river.",
          "Beautiful looking but very small. When we visited it was being used as an art gallery which was quite interesting",
          "This is such a picturesque church, in such a lovely setting. Definitely worth going to look. Unfortunately it has limited opening hours and when we went there was a contemporary art exhibition inside which rather distracted from the interior",

        "wiki": "Pisa ( PEE-z\u0259, Italian: [\u02c8pi\u02d0za] (listen) or [\u02c8pi\u02d0sa]) is a city and comune in Tuscany, central Italy, straddling the Arno just before it empties into the Ligurian Sea. It is the capital city of the Province of Pisa. Although Pisa is known worldwide for its leaning tower (the bell tower of the city's cathedral), the city of over 91,104 residents (around 200,000 with the metropolitan area) contains more than 20 other historic churches, several medieval palaces, and various bridges across the Arno. Much of the city's architecture was financed from its history as one of the Italian maritime republics.\nThe city is also home of the University of Pisa, which has a history going back to the 12th century and also has the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, founded by Napoleon in 1810, and its offshoot, the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, as the best-sanctioned Superior Graduate Schools in Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nThe origin of the name, Pisa, is a mystery. While the origin of the city had remained unknown for centuries, the Pelasgi, the Greeks, the Etruscans, and the Ligurians had variously been proposed as founders of the city (for example, a colony of the ancient city of Pisa, Greece). Archaeological remains from the fifth century BC confirmed the existence of a city at the sea, trading with Greeks and Gauls. The presence of an Etruscan necropolis, discovered during excavations in the Arena Garibaldi in 1991, confirmed its Etruscan origins.\nAncient Roman authors referred to Pisa as an old city. Strabo referred Pisa's origins to the mythical Nestor, king of Pylos, after the fall of Troy. Virgil, in his Aeneid, states that Pisa was already a great center by the times described; the settlers from the Alpheus coast have been credited with the founding of the city in the 'Etruscan lands'. The Virgilian commentator Servius wrote that the Teuti, or Pelops, the king of the Pisaeans, founded the town 13 centuries before the start of the common era.\nThe maritime role of Pisa should have been already prominent if the ancient authorities ascribed to it the invention of the naval ram. Pisa took advantage of being the only port along the western coast between Genoa (then a small village) and Ostia. Pisa served as a base for Roman naval expeditions against Ligurians, Gauls, and Carthaginians. In 180 BC, it became a Roman colony under Roman law, as Portus Pisanus. In 89 BC, Portus Pisanus became a municipium. Emperor Augustus fortified the colony into an important port and changed the name as Colonia Iulia obsequens.\nPisa supposedly was founded on the shore, but due to the alluvial sediments from the Arno and the Serchio, whose mouth lies about 11 km (7 mi) north of the Arno's, the shore moved west. Strabo states that the city was 4.0 km (2.5 mi) away from the coast. Currently, it is located 9.7 km (6 mi) from the coast. However, it was a maritime city, with ships sailing up the Arno. In the 90s AD, a baths complex was built in the city.\n\n\n=== Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages ===\n\nDuring the last years of the Western Roman Empire, Pisa did not decline as much as the other cities of Italy, probably due to the complexity of its river system and its consequent ease of defence. In the seventh century, Pisa helped Pope Gregory I by supplying numerous ships in his military expedition against the Byzantines of Ravenna: Pisa was the sole Byzantine centre of Tuscia to fall peacefully in Lombard hands, through assimilation with the neighbouring region where their trading interests were prevalent. Pisa began in this way its rise to the role of main port of the Upper Tyrrhenian Sea and became the main trading centre between Tuscany and Corsica, Sardinia, and the southern coasts of France and Spain.\nAfter Charlemagne had defeated the Lombards under the command of Desiderius in 774, Pisa went through a crisis, but soon recovered. Politically, it became part of the duchy of Lucca. In 860, Pisa was captured by vikings led by Bj\u00f6rn Ironside. In 930, Pisa became the county centre (status it maintained until the arrival of Otto I) within the mark of Tuscia. Lucca was the capital but Pisa was the most important city, as in the middle of 10th century Liutprand of Cremona, bishop of Cremona, called Pisa Tusciae provinciae caput (\"capital of the province of Tuscia\"), and a century later, the marquis of Tuscia was commonly referred to as \"marquis of Pisa\". In 1003, Pisa was the protagonist of the first communal war in Italy, against Lucca. From the naval point of view, since the 9th century, the emergence of the Saracen pirates urged the city to expand its fleet; in the following years, this fleet gave the town an opportunity for more expansion. In 828, Pisan ships assaulted the coast of North Africa. In 871, they took part in the defence of Salerno from the Saracens. In 970, they gave also strong support to Otto I's expedition, defeating a Byzantine fleet in front of Calabrese coasts.\n\n\n=== 11th century ===\n\nThe power of Pisa as a  maritime nation began to grow and reached its apex in the 11th century, when it acquired traditional fame as one of the four main historical maritime republics of Italy (Repubbliche Marinare).\nAt that time, the city was a very important commercial centre and controlled a significant Mediterranean merchant fleet and navy. It expanded its powers in 1005 through the sack of Reggio Calabria in the south of Italy. Pisa was in continuous conflict with some 'Saracens' - a medieval term to refer to Arab Muslims - who had their bases in Corsica, for control of the Mediterranean. In 1017, Sardinian Giudicati were militarily supported by Pisa, in alliance with Genoa, to defeat the Saracen King Mugahid, who had settled a logistic base in the north of Sardinia the year before. This victory gave Pisa supremacy in the Tyrrhenian Sea. When the Pisans subsequently ousted the Genoese from Sardinia, a new conflict and rivalry was born between these mighty marine republics. Between 1030 and 1035, Pisa went on to defeat several rival towns in Sicily and conquer Carthage in North Africa. In 1051\u20131052, the admiral Jacopo Ciurini conquered Corsica, provoking more resentment from the Genoese. In 1063, Admiral Giovanni Orlandi, coming to the aid of the Norman Roger I, took Palermo from the Saracen pirates. The gold treasure taken from the Saracens in Palermo allowed the Pisans to start the building of their cathedral and the other monuments which constitute the famous Piazza del Duomo.\nIn 1060, Pisa had to engage in their first battle with Genoa. The Pisan victory helped to consolidate its position in the Mediterranean. Pope Gregory VII recognised in 1077 the new \"Laws and customs of the sea\" instituted by the Pisans, and emperor Henry IV granted them the right to name their own consuls, advised by a council of elders. This was simply a confirmation of the present situation, because in those years, the marquis had already been excluded from power. In 1092, Pope Urban II awarded Pisa the supremacy over Corsica and Sardinia, and at the same time raising the town to the rank of archbishopric.\nPisa sacked the Tunisian city of Mahdia in 1088. Four years later, Pisan and Genoese ships helped Alfonso VI of Castilla to push El Cid out of Valencia. A Pisan fleet of 120 ships also took part in the First Crusade, and the Pisans were instrumental in the taking of Jerusalem in 1099. On their way to the Holy Land, the ships did not miss the occasion to sack some Byzantine islands; the Pisan crusaders were led by their archbishop Daibert, the future patriarch of Jerusalem. Pisa and the other Repubbliche Marinare took advantage of the crusade to establish trading posts and colonies in the Eastern coastal cities of the Levant. In particular, the Pisans founded colonies in Antiochia, Acre, Jaffa, Tripoli, Tyre, Latakia, and Accone. They also had other possessions in Jerusalem and Caesarea, plus smaller colonies (with lesser autonomy) in Cairo, Alexandria, and of course Constantinople, where the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus granted them special mooring and trading rights. In all these cities, the Pisans were granted privileges and immunity from taxation, but had to contribute to the defence in case of attack. In the 12th century, the Pisan quarter in the eastern part of Constantinople had grown to 1,000 people. For some years of that century, Pisa was the most prominent merchant and military ally of the Byzantine Empire, overcoming Venice itself.\n\n\n=== 12th century ===\nIn 1113, Pisa and Pope Paschal II set up, together with the count of Barcelona and other contingents from Provence and Italy (Genoese excluded), a war to free the Balearic Islands from the Moors; the queen and the king of Majorca were brought in chains to Tuscany. Though the Almoravides soon reconquered the island, the booty taken helped the Pisans in their magnificent programme of buildings, especially the cathedral, and Pisa gained a role of pre-eminence in the Western Mediterranean.\nIn the following years, the mighty Pisan fleet, led by archbishop Pietro Moriconi, drove away the Saracens after ferocious combats. Though short-lived, this success of Pisa in Spain increased the rivalry with Genoa. Pisa's trade with the Languedoc and Provence (Noli, Savona, Fr\u00e9jus, and Montpellier) were an obstacle to the Genoese interests in cities such as Hy\u00e8res, Fos, Antibes, and Marseille.\nThe war began in 1119 when the Genoese attacked several galleys on their way to the motherland, and lasted until 1133. The two cities fought each other on land and at sea, but hostilities were limited to raids and pirate-like assaults.\nIn June 1135, Bernard of Clairvaux took a leading part in the Council of Pisa, asserting the claims of Pope Innocent II against those of Pope Anacletus II, who had been elected pope in 1130 with Norman support, but was not recognised outside Rome. Innocent II resolved the conflict with Genoa, establishing the sphere of influence of Pisa and Genoa. Pisa could then, unhindered by Genoa, participate in the conflict of Innocent II against king Roger II of Sicily. Amalfi, one of the maritime republics (though already declining under Norman rule), was conquered on August 6, 1136; the Pisans destroyed the ships in the port, assaulted the castles in the surrounding areas, and drove back an army sent by Roger from Aversa. This victory brought Pisa to the peak of its power and to a standing equal to Venice. Two years later, its soldiers sacked Salerno.\n\nIn the following years, Pisa was one of the staunchest supporters of the Ghibelline party. This was much appreciated by Frederick I. He issued in 1162 and 1165 two important documents, with these grants: Apart from the jurisdiction over the Pisan countryside, the Pisans were granted freedom of trade in the whole empire, the coast from Civitavecchia to Portovenere, a half of Palermo, Messina, Salerno and Naples, the whole of Gaeta, Mazara, and Trapani, and a street with houses for its merchants in every city of the Kingdom of Sicily. Some of these grants were later confirmed by Henry VI, Otto IV, and Frederick II. They marked the apex of Pisa's power, but also spurred the resentment of cities such as Lucca, Massa, Volterra, and Florence, which saw their aim to expand towards the sea thwarted. The clash with Lucca also concerned the possession of the castle of Montignoso and mainly the control of the Via Francigena, the main trade route between Rome and France. Last but not least, such a sudden and large increase of power by Pisa could only lead to another war with Genoa.\nGenoa had acquired a largely dominant position in the markets of southern France. The war began presumably in 1165 on the Rh\u00f4ne, when an attack on a convoy, directed to some Pisan trade centres on the river, by the Genoese and their ally, the count of Toulouse, failed. Pisa, though, was allied to Provence. The war continued until 1175 without significant victories. Another point of attrition was Sicily, where both the cities had privileges granted by Henry VI. In 1192, Pisa managed to conquer Messina. This episode was followed by a series of battles culminating in the Genoese conquest of Syracuse in 1204. Later, the trading posts in Sicily were lost when the new Pope Innocent III, though removing the excommunication cast over Pisa by his predecessor Celestine III, allied himself with the Guelph League of Tuscany, led by Florence. Soon, he stipulated a pact with Genoa, too, further weakening the Pisan presence in southern Italy.\nTo counter the Genoese predominance in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, Pisa strengthened its relationship with their Spanish and French traditional bases (Marseille, Narbonne, Barcelona, etc.) and tried to defy the Venetian rule of the Adriatic Sea. In 1180, the two cities agreed to a nonaggression treaty in the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic, but the death of Emperor Manuel Comnenus in Constantinople changed the situation. Soon, attacks on Venetian convoys were made. Pisa signed trade and political pacts with Ancona, Pula, Zara, Split, and Brindisi; in 1195, a Pisan fleet reached Pola to defend its independence from Venice, but the Serenissima managed soon to reconquer the rebel sea town.\n\nOne year later, the two cities signed a peace treaty, which resulted in favourable conditions for Pisa, but in 1199, the Pisans violated it by blockading the port of Brindisi in Apulia. In the following naval battle, they were defeated by the Venetians. The war that followed ended in 1206 with a treaty in which Pisa gave up all its hopes to expand in the Adriatic, though it maintained the trading posts it had established in the area. From that point on, the two cities were united against the rising power of Genoa and sometimes collaborated to increase the trading benefits in Constantinople.\n\n\n=== 13th century ===\nIn 1209 in Lerici, two councils for a final resolution of the rivalry with Genoa were held. A 20-year peace treaty was signed, but when in 1220, the emperor Frederick II confirmed his supremacy over the Tyrrhenian coast from Civitavecchia to Portovenere, the Genoese and Tuscan resentment against Pisa grew again. In the following years, Pisa clashed with Lucca in Garfagnana and was defeated by the Florentines at Castel del Bosco. The strong Ghibelline position of Pisa brought this town diametrically against the Pope, who was in a strong dispute with the Empire, and indeed the pope tried to deprive the town of its dominions in northern Sardinia.\nIn 1238, Pope Gregory IX formed an alliance between Genoa and Venice against the empire, and consequently against Pisa, too. One year later, he excommunicated Frederick II and called for an anti-Empire council to be held in Rome in 1241. On May 3, 1241, a combined fleet of Pisan and Sicilian ships, led by the emperor's son Enzo, attacked a Genoese convoy carrying prelates from northern Italy and France, next to the isle of Giglio (Battle of Giglio), in front of Tuscany; the Genoese lost 25 ships, while about a thousand sailors, two cardinals, and one bishop were taken prisoner. After this outstanding victory, the council in Rome failed, but Pisa was excommunicated. This extreme measure was only removed in 1257. Anyway, the Tuscan city tried to take advantage of the favourable situation to conquer the Corsican city of Aleria and even lay siege to Genoa itself in 1243.\nThe Ligurian republic of Genoa, however, recovered fast from this blow and won back Lerici, conquered by the Pisans some years earlier, in 1256.\nThe great expansion in the Mediterranean and the prominence of the merchant class urged a modification in the city's institutes. The system with consuls was abandoned, and in 1230, the new city rulers named a capitano del popolo (\"people's chieftain\") as civil and military leader. In spite of these reforms, the conquered lands and the city itself were harassed by the rivalry between the two families of Della Gherardesca and Visconti. In 1237 the archbishop and the Emperor Frederick II intervened to reconcile the two rivals, but the strains did not cease. In 1254, the people rebelled and imposed 12 Anziani del Popolo (\"People's Elders\") as their political representatives in the commune. They also supplemented the legislative councils, formed of noblemen, with new People's Councils, composed by the main guilds and by the chiefs of the People's Companies. These had the power to ratify the laws of the Major General Council and the Senate.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\n\nThe decline is said to have  begun on August 6, 1284, when the numerically superior fleet of Pisa, under the command of Albertino Morosini, was defeated by the brilliant tactics of the Genoese fleet, under the command of Benedetto Zaccaria and Oberto Doria, in the dramatic naval Battle of Meloria. This defeat ended the maritime power of Pisa and the town never fully recovered; in 1290, the Genoese destroyed forever the Porto Pisano (Pisa's port), and covered the land with salt. The region around Pisa did not permit the city to recover from the loss of thousands of sailors from the Meloria, while Liguria guaranteed enough sailors to Genoa. Goods, however, continued to be traded, albeit in reduced quantity, but the end came when the Arno started to change course, preventing the galleys from reaching the city's port up the river. The nearby area also likely became infested with malaria. The true end came in 1324, when Sardinia was entirely lost in favour of the Aragonese.\nAlways Ghibelline, Pisa tried to build up its power in the course of the 14th century, and even managed to defeat Florence in the Battle of Montecatini (1315), under the command of Uguccione della Faggiuola. Eventually, however, after a long siege, Pisa was occupied by Florentines in 1405. Florentines corrupted the capitano del popolo (\"people's chieftain\"), Giovanni Gambacorta, who opened by night the city gate of San Marco. Pisa was never conquered by an army. In 1409, Pisa was the seat of a council trying to set the question of the Great Schism. In the 15th century, access to the sea became more difficult, as the port was silting up and was cut off from the sea. When in 1494, Charles VIII of France invaded the Italian states to claim the Kingdom of Naples, Pisa reclaimed its independence as the Second Pisan Republic.\n\nThe new freedom did not last long; 15 years of battles and sieges by the Florentine troops led by Antonio da Filicaja, Averardo Salviati and Niccol\u00f2 Capponi were made, but they never managed to conquer the city. Vitellozzo Vitelli with his brother Paolo were the only ones who actually managed to break the strong defences of Pisa and make a breach in the Stampace bastion in the southern west part of the walls, but he did not enter the city. For that, they were suspected of treachery and Paolo was put to death. However, the resources of Pisa were getting low, and at the end, the city was sold to the Visconti family from Milan and eventually to Florence again. Its role of major port of Tuscany went to Livorno. Pisa acquired a mainly cultural role spurred by the presence of the University of Pisa, created in 1343, and later reinforced by the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (1810) and Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies (1987).\nPisa was the birthplace of the important early physicist Galileo Galilei. It is still the seat of an archbishopric. Besides its educational institutions, it has become a light industrial centre and a railway hub. It suffered repeated destruction during World War II.\nSince the early 1950s, the US Army has maintained Camp Darby just outside Pisa, which is used by many US military personnel as a base for vacations in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPisa experiences a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), since only a single month receives less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rain. The city is characterized by cool-mild winters and hot summers. This transitional climate keeps Pisa from enjoying a summer devoid of rain, typical of central and southern Italy, as the summer (the driest season) experiences occasional rain showers. Rainfall peaks in the autumn.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nWhile the bell tower of the cathedral, known as \"the leaning Tower of Pisa\", is the most famous image of the city, it is one of many works of art and architecture in the city's Piazza del Duomo, also known, since the 20th century, as Piazza dei Miracoli (Square of Miracles), to the north of the old town center. The Piazza del Duomo also houses the Duomo (the Cathedral), the Baptistry and the Campo Santo (the monumental cemetery). The medieval complex includes the above-mentioned four sacred buildings, the hospital and few palaces. All the complex is kept by the Opera (fabrica ecclesiae) della Primaziale Pisana, an old non profit foundation that operates since the building of the Cathedral (1063) to the maintenance of the sacred buildings. The area is framed by medieval walls kept by municipality administration.\nOther sights include:\n\nKnights' Square (Piazza dei Cavalieri), where the Palazzo della Carovana, with its impressive fa\u00e7ade designed by Giorgio Vasari may be seen. Sited on the square\nSanto Stefano dei Cavalieri, church sited on Piazza dei Cavalieri, and also designed by Vasari. It had originally a single nave; two more were added in the 17th century. It houses a bust by Donatello, and paintings by Vasari, Jacopo Ligozzi, Alessandro Fei, and Pontormo. It also contains spoils from the many naval battles between the Cavalieri (Knights of St. Stephan) and the Turks between the 16th and 18th centuries, including the Turkish battle pennant hoisted from Ali Pacha's flagship at the 1571 Battle of Lepanto.\nSt. Sixtus. This small church, consecrated in 1133, is also close to the Piazza dei Cavalieri. It was used as a seat of the most important notarial deeds of the town, also hosting the Council of Elders. It is today one of the best preserved early Romanesque buildings in town.\nSt. Francis. The church of San Francesco may have been designed by Giovanni di Simone, built after 1276. In 1343 new chapels were added and the church was elevated. It has a single nave and a notable belfry, as well as a 15th-century cloister. It houses works by Jacopo da Empoli, Taddeo Gaddi and Santi di Tito. In the Gherardesca Chapel are buried Ugolino della Gherardesca and his sons.\nSan Frediano. This  church, built by 1061, has a basilica interior with three aisles, with a crucifix from the 12th century. Paintings from the 16th century were added during a restoration, including works by Ventura Salimbeni, Domenico Passignano, Aurelio Lomi, and Rutilio Manetti.\nSan Nicola. This medieval church built by 1097, was enlarged between 1297 and 1313 by the Augustinians, perhaps by the design of Giovanni Pisano. The octagonal belfry is from the second half of the 13th century. The paintings include the Madonna with Child by Francesco Traini (14th century) and St. Nicholas Saving Pisa from the Plague (15th century). Noteworthy are also the wood sculptures by Giovanni and Nino Pisano, and the Annunciation by Francesco di Valdambrino.\nSanta Maria della Spina. A small white marble church alongside the Arno, is attributed to Lupo di Francesco (1230), is another excellent Gothic building.\nSan Paolo a Ripa d'Arno. The church was founded around 952 and enlarged in the mid-12th century along lines similar to those of the cathedral. It is annexed to the Romanesque Chapel of St. Agatha, with an unusual pyramidal cusp or peak.San Pietro in Vinculis. Known as San Pierino, it is an 11th-century church with a crypt and a cosmatesque mosaic on the floor of the main nave. \n\nBorgo Stretto. This medieval borgo or neighborhood contains strolling arcades and the Lungarno, the avenues along the river Arno. It includes the Gothic-Romanesque church of San Michele in Borgo (990). There are at least two other leaning towers in the city, one at the southern end of central Via Santa Maria, the other halfway through the Piagge riverside promenade.\nMedici Palace. The palace was once a possession of the Appiano family, who ruled Pisa in 1392\u20131398. In 1400 the Medici acquired it, and Lorenzo de' Medici sojourned here.\nOrto botanico di Pisa. The botanical garden of the University of Pisa is Europe's oldest university botanical garden.\nPalazzo Reale. The (\"Royal Palace\"), once belonged to the Caetani patrician family. Here Galileo Galilei showed to Grand Duke of Tuscany the planets he had discovered with his telescope. The edifice was erected in 1559 by Baccio Bandinelli for Cosimo I de Medici, and was later enlarged including other palaces. The palace is now a museum.\nPalazzo Gambacorti. This palace is a 14th-century Gothic building, and now houses the offices of the municipality. The interior shows frescoes boasting Pisa's sea victories.\nPalazzo Agostini. The palace is a Gothic building also known as Palazzo dell'Ussero, with its 15th-century fa\u00e7ade and remains of the ancient city walls dating back to before 1155. The name of the building comes from the coffee rooms of Caff\u00e8 dell'Ussero, historic meeting place founded on September 1, 1775.\nMural Tuttomondo. A modern mural, the last public work by Keith Haring, on the rear wall of the convent of the Church of Sant'Antonio, painted in June 1989.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMuseo dell'Opera del Duomo: exhibiting among others the original sculptures of Nicola Pisano and Giovanni Pisano and the treasures of the cathedral.\nMuseo delle Sinopie: showing the sinopias from the camposanto, the monumental cemetery. These are red ocher underdrawings for frescoes, made with reddish, greenish or brownish earth colour with water.\nMuseo Nazionale di San Matteo: exhibiting sculptures and paintings from the 12th to 15th centuries, among them the masterworks of Giovanni and Andrea Pisano, the Master of San Martino, Simone Martini, Nino Pisano and Masaccio.\nMuseo Nazionale di Palazzo Reale: exhibiting the belongings of the families that lived in the palace: paintings, statues, armors, etc.\nMuseo Nazionale degli Strumenti per il Calcolo: exhibiting a collection of instruments used in science, between whose a pneumatic machine of Van Musschenbroek and a compass probably belonged to Galileo Galilei.\nMuseo di storia naturale dell'Universit\u00e0 di Pisa (Natural History Museum of the University of Pisa), located in the Certosa di Calci, outside the city. It houses one of the largest cetacean skeletons collection in Europe.\nPalazzo Blu: temporary exhibitions and cultural activities center, located in the Lungarno, in the heart of the old town, the palace is easy recognizable because it is the only blue building.\nCantiere delle Navi di Pisa - The Pisa's Ancient Ships Archaeological Area: A museum of 10,650 square meters - 3,500 archaeological excavation, 1,700 laboratories and one restoration center -, that visitors can visit with a guided tour.\n\n\n=== Educational institutions ===\nPisa hosts the University of Pisa, especially renowned in the fields of Physics, Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science. The Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna and the Scuola Normale Superiore, the Italian academic \u00e9lite institutions are noted mostly for research and the education of graduate students.\nConstruction of a new leaning tower of glass and steel 57 meters tall, containing offices and apartments was scheduled to start in summer 2004 and take 4 years. It was designed by Dante Oscar Benini and raised criticism.\n\nThe Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa was founded in 1810, by Napoleonic decree, as a branch of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure of Paris. Recognized as a \"national university\" in 1862, one year after Italian unification, and named during that period as \"Normal School of the Kingdom of Italy\" (Superior Graduate Schools in Italy i.e. Scuola Superiore Universitaria).Located at: Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa \u2013 Piazza dei Cavalieri, 7 \u2013 56126 Pisa (Italia)\n\nThe Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies of Pisa or Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna is a special-statute public university located in Pisa, Italy, emerging from Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa and operating in the field of applied sciences, (Superior Graduate Schools in Italy i.e. Scuola Superiore Universitaria)Located at: Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, P.zza Martiri della Libert\u00e0, 33 \u2013 56127 \u2013 Pisa (Italia)\n\nThe University of Pisa or Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, is one of the oldest universities in Italy. It was formally founded on September 3, 1343 by an edict of Pope Clement VI, although there had been lectures on law in Pisa since the 11th century.

One can also get a train directly to Florence from a Central rail station in Pisa (Pisa Centrale). Local buses connect the city of Pisa with all the neighboring cities (come to Pontedera, then take a bus for Volterra, San Miniato, etc.). Taxis come when requested from Pisa International Airport and Central Station.\n\n\n=== Pisamover ===\nPisa has an international airport known as Pisa International Airport located in San Giusto neighborhood in Pisa. The airport has a people mover system, called Pisamover, opened in March 2017, that connects Airport and Pisa central railway station, that is 2 km (1.2 mi) away.  It's based on a driverless \"horizontal funicular\" that travels the distance in 5 minutes, with a 5-minute frequency, having an intermediate stop at parking station San Giusto & Aurelia.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nUrban lines CPT (Compagnia Pisana Trasporti):\nSuburban lines CPT to/from Pisa:\n\n\n=== Trains ===\nThe city is served by two railway stations available for passengers: Pisa Centrale and Pisa San Rossore.\nPisa Centrale is the main railway station and is located along the Tyrrhenic railway line. It connects Pisa directly with several other important Italian cities such as Rome, Florence, Genoa, Turin, Naples, Livorno, and Grosseto. \nPisa San Rossore links the city with Lucca (20 minutes from Pisa) and Viareggio and is also reachable from Pisa Centrale. It is a minor railway station located near the Leaning Tower zone.\nThere was another station called Pisa Aeroporto situated next to the Airport with services to Pisa Centrale and Florence. It has been closed on 15 December 2013 for the realization of a people mover.\n\n\n=== Cars ===\nPisa has two exits on the A11 Florence-Pisa road and on the A12 Genoa-Livorno road, Pisa Nord and Pisa Centro-aeroporto.\nPisa Centro leads visitors to the city centre.\nParking: Pratale (San Jacopo), Pietrasantina (Via Pietrasantina), Piazza Carrara, Lungarni.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n \nFootball is the main sport in Pisa; the local team, A.C. Pisa, currently plays in the Lega Pro (the third highest football division in Italy), and has had a top flight history throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, featuring several world-class players such as Diego Simeone, Christian Vieri and Dunga during this time. The club play at the Arena Garibaldi \u2013 Stadio Romeo Anconetani, opened in 1919 and with a capacity of 25,000.\nShooting was one of the first sports to have their own association in Pisa. The Societ\u00e0 del Tiro a Segno di Pisa was founded on July 9, 1862. In 1885, they acquired their own training field. The shooting range was almost completely destroyed during World War II.\nIn Pisa there was a festival and game fr:Gioco del Ponte (Game of the Bridge) which was celebrated (in some form) in Pisa from perhaps the 1200s down to 1807. From the end of the 1400s the game took the form of a mock battle fought upon Pisa's central bridge (Ponte di Mezzo). The participants wore quilted armor and the only offensive weapon allowed was the targone, a shield-shaped, stout board with precisely specified dimensions. Hitting below the belt was not allowed. Two opposing teams started at opposite ends of the bridge. The object of the two opposing teams was to penetrate, drive back, and disperse the opponents' ranks and to thereby drive them backwards off the bridge. The struggle was limited to forty-five minutes. Victory or defeat was immensely important to the team players and their partisans, but sometimes the game was fought to a draw and both sides celebrated. In 1927 the tradition was revived by college students as an elaborate costume parade. In 1935 Vittorio Emanuele III with the royal family witnessed  the first revival of a modern version of the game, which has been pursued in the 20th and 21st centuries with some interruptions and varying degrees of enthusiasm by Pisans and their civic institutions.\n\n\n== Festivals and cultural events ==\nCapodanno pisano (folklore, March 25)\nGioco del Ponte (folklore)\nLuminara di San Ranieri (folklore June 16)\nMaritime republics regatta (Folklore)\nPremio Nazionale Letterario Pisa\nPisa Book Festival\nMetarock (Rock music festival)\nInternet Festival\nSan Ranieri regatta (Folklore)\nTurn Off Festival (House music festival)\nNessi\u00e1h (Jewish cultural Festival, November)\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nPisa is twinned with:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of PisaRenouard, Yves (1969).

      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Pisa Baptistery of St. John (Italian: Battistero di San Giovanni) is a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical building in Pisa, Italy. Construction started in 1152 to replace an older baptistery, and when it was completed in 1363, it became the second building, in chronological order, in the Piazza dei Miracoli, near the Duomo di Pisa and the cathedral's free-standing campanile, the  famous Leaning Tower of Pisa. The baptistery was designed by Diotisalvi, whose signature can be read on two pillars inside the building, with the date 1153.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe largest baptistery in Italy, it is 54.86 m high, with a diameter of 34.13 m. The Pisa Baptistery is an example of the transition from the Romanesque style to the Gothic style: the lower section is in the Romanesque style, with rounded arches, while the upper sections are in the Gothic style, with pointed arches. The Baptistery is constructed of marble, as is common in Italian architecture.\n\nThe portal, facing the facade of the cathedral, is flanked by two classical columns, while the inner jambs are executed in Byzantine style. The lintel is divided in two tiers. The lower one depicts several episodes in the life of St. John the Baptist, while the upper one shows Christ between the Madonna and St John the Baptist, flanked by angels and the evangelists.\n\nThe interior is overwhelming and lacks decoration. The octagonal font at the centre dates from 1246 and was made by Guido Bigarelli da Como. The bronze sculpture of St. John the Baptist at the centre of the font, is a  work by Italo Griselli.\nThe pulpit was sculpted between 1255-1260 by Nicola Pisano, father of Giovanni, the artist who produced the pulpit in the Duomo. The scenes on the pulpit, and especially the classical form of the nude Hercules, show Nicola Pisano's qualities as the most important precursor of Italian Renaissance sculpture by reinstating antique representations: surveys of the Italian Renaissance often begin with the year 1260, the year that Nicola Pisano dated this pulpit.\nConstructed on the same unstable sand as the tower and cathedral, the Baptistery leans 0.6 degrees toward the cathedral. Originally the shape of the Baptistery, according to the project by Diotisalvi, was different. It was perhaps similar to the church of Holy Sepulchre in Pisa, with its pyramidal roof. After the death of the architect, Nicola Pisano continued the work, changing the style to the more modern Gothic one. Also an external roof was added giving the shape of a cupola. As a side effect of the two roofs, the pyramidal inner one and the domed external one, the interior is acoustically perfect, making of that space a resonating chamber.\nThe exterior of the dome is clad with lead sheets on its east side (facing the cathedral) and red tiles on its west side (facing the sea), giving a half grey and half red appearance from the south.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of Medieval Arabic and Western European domes\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRory Carroll, \"Pisa Baptistery is giant musical instrument, computers show,\"",

          "If you are going to the Battistero, I recommend going near a half-hour mark so you can hear the demonstration of the acoustics in this beautiful building. Every half hour an employee comes out to \"sing\" so you can hear the ethereal echo. The building itself is stunning, and I",

          "At intervals during the day the doors are shut and a demonstration of the acoustics is carried out by a member of staff. There is a narrow, curving staircase to the mezzanine where you can look down upon the font and pulpit. There are guides present and well worth talking to.",

          "This is a lovely building from outside. Not much to see, but we walked up the steep stairs to a gallery area and was able to look down. When we went down we sat and just took it in. A lady started to sing briefly and the acoustics were amazing. That was the best part of the",
          "This baptistry is part of the same religious complex as the Duomo and the famous Leaning Tower. To me it looks like a wedding cake being white and with multiple layers. It truly is a jewel of Italian architecture and should be visited along with the famous tower which it is",
          "I love the Tower and the Duomo, but the Baptistery might be my favorite part of the Field of Miracles. It is so unlike anything that I have ever seen. I've always thought that it looks kind of other-worldly. And it is interesting to compare and contrast this with the",
          "The Baptistery is the first building you'll encounter when entering the square from the little Piazza in front, after the medieval walls. From this entry point is the best view of the entire Piazza Miracoli with all - the Baptistery, the Duomo and the Leaning tower.",
          "Worth the climb to gallery. Wait to hear the chanting by the custodian. It is a beautiful building .",
          "The Battistero founded on 15 Aug,1152 that stood within Piazza dei Miracoli, was just a replacement to the original one. The doomed roof was still not complete. The opulent decorations and the echo effects inside was nice. Entrance fee is required but worth to climb up to have",
          "This building has some stunning architecture and makes for a great picture with the right lighting and cloud scenery. The whole area is beautiful so just go here and try hang out in the spots where the least amount of people are.",
          "Again very interesting and beautiful to see we loved it the stain glass windows were beautiful take the 62 steps to top to get a better view .the accoustic was excellent",
          "It\u2019s not as famous as the leaning tower, but the Baptistry of Pisa is quite unmissable! Spare at least a few minutes to go in, and admire this amazing building, with its beauty and its fabulous acoustics. Despite the notices asking people to be quiet, it didn\u2019t happen, but every",
          "The baptistery is probably the first structure you will encounter if you enter the piazza from the south side. Now before you dismiss this as trivial I would urge you to go in and have a seat inside. First of all, the place is cooler than the outside and quieter too. The piazza",
          "Every half hour they close the doors and an attendant with sing out harmonizing notes that echo all along. Unfortunately this time the singer was a bit off key. But still something to make sure to see if you're in the piazza.",
          "Beautiful building in a wonderful setting but best of all is when one of the attendants sings operatic/choral notes standing in the middle of the building.The experience will stay with me for ever,spine tingling,awe inspiring. I wish I could listen to it every day",
          "Beautiful building with a great view of the tower and cathedral. We paid 10 euro for 2 of us to go to the baptistery and cathedral well worth it.",
          "Well worth a visit and worth a climb up to the gallery. Once up there you may be lucky and someone will come in a sing. This is to demonstrate the echo as it reverberated around the dome. Nasty modern video/sound guides litter the floor. Quite innapropriate. But I guess they",
          "when you book your tickets through the official website ( do not book elsewhere as they will charge you extra ) you will be offered choices as to which ticket you want. One of the options is to include the Battistero and I would do so. It is a beautiful building outside and",
          "The long centuries didn't ruin the eternal beauty of this baptistry. The sturdy but yet lacy and graceful walls completely fascinated me. A worthy companion to the triumvirate of Duomo and Belltower.",
          "theres an audioguide avaliable inside for 2\u20ac, worth the while. entry is 5\u20ac. it was nice to have knowledge about the building process and purpose of the building. at the back of the podium, behind the babtising basin, there aretwo amazing floor works. because the battisterio",
          "you only have to see the outside, and the setting with the duomo and the tower to appreciate the beauty of it",
          "The domed roof was added years, many years after the Baptistery was built. Originally, the open roof let the heavenly rain water fall, and collect to baptize the babies. The men were on the first floor, the women had to climb the narrow staircase and watch the ceremony from",
          "This is part of the beautiful tower area of Pisa. The architecture of the building is really beautiful and the roof fascinated me as it is half lead and half red tiles. It\u2019s a lovely area to explore.",
          "The volume of the Battistero is impressive. Beside not having much to see inside, going to the first tier allows you to view, in height, the Duomo and the Tower behind.",
          "Beautiful place, well worth a visit. Be prepared for large crowds of people but enjoy the experience.",
          "Our tour guide Angelica, was lovely and full of knowledge on the beautiful architecture that makes up The Square of Miracles in Pisa, Italy. This baptistery is the largest in Italy and started in 1152. Incredible architecture for such a long time ago.",
          "It feels cold inside, it is obvious that the main goal of this baptistry was to show-off in that period, around 1250. However, the pulpit made by Nicola Pisano is outstanding.",
          "This is the largest baptistery in Italy, construction started in 1152 and is topped by a statue of St. John the Baptist. Inside surrounding the altar, font and pulpit are 8 columns and 4 pillars, which support the structure. The font dates from 1246 and the pulpit next to it",
          "Such a beautiful building inside and out. If you're feeling brave and fit I highly recommend climbing the stairs to the upper gallery.",
          "Visited as part of the Duomo ticket. Worth a visit and climb up to the gallery. Much more simple than the Duomo but beautiful nonetheless.",
          "Make sure you like to walk because wherever you travel to see sights you need to walk. this site is awesome the architecture is incredible half the roof is terra cotta other lead to warn ships off the coast.",
          "I think this was my favourite it is so pretty, can't believe the craftmanship from all those years ago",
          "If it were standing alone it would be spectacular in its own right but, surrounded by the Duomo, the Leaning Tower and the Camposanto, it certainly enriches all four and multiplies the WOW factor. We were fortunate to be inside when a woman performed the 3-4 minute vocal piece",
          "Interesting dedicated baptismal building with an useful window on the gallery to the right of the up stairway where they have cut a square in the mesh to allow a photo shot over the cathedral to the tower.",
          "During our visit to the Leaning Tower , visited what was mentioned as the Baptistery. Every 30 minutes, a demonstration of Echo in the dome which lasts about 2-3 minutes is the highlight. Nothing else to see really.",
          "One of the buildings in the compex in Pisa, it is possible to climb to the top of the baptistery, the view is good.",
          "No doubt you will want to have a close look at this building when visiting the Tower. It's quite imposing and stunning. Perhaps take some time and sit on the grass to fully appreciate it's beauty",
          "Do tip the ticket taker so she/he will demonstrate the beautiful sound. It's designed so that one can create a chord using one voice. The sustain is amazing. The building is pretty but the sound and the view of the cathedral with the tower in the background are the two main",
          "Alone this would be fantastic but as its grouped with the tower, cathedral and field of miracles not as compelling but still worth a visit, very inexpensive. Go here first, then Cathedral and last Garden of Miracles",
          "It's beautiful outside but not much to see inside. I am glad i seen it but i wouldn't go in there next time. Everywhere else is fantastic we are going again next year",
          "Again we had limited time and couldnt queue up to enter the building, which would have taken hours. Managed to take some very impressive photos.",
          "We only looked at this from the outside as our time was limited, but I recommend you allow some time in your schedule.",
          "This place is located in Pissa, where leaning tower is also situated. It is best to visit in afternoon time.",
          "Lovely inside and out, and some great opportunities to learn more with the headsets inside. Lovely floors, small but worth the visit!",
          "The Baptistery is a beautiful building, but it comes alive when, every half-hour or so, the guides close the doors, ask the visitors to be quiet and the building's natural echo responds to their singing a few notes. Quite moving.",
          "Lying next to the Tower and Cathedral,beautiful circular Baptistery.Did not go inside as the weather was brilliant.Best seen from the town walls where you avoid the crowds.",
          "Pretty from the outside, but not too much to see inside! Best thing about the baptistry is a fantastic view of the cathedral from the upper floor! Overheard some interesting stories and facts by one of the nearby tour groups so reckon this would be a lot more interesting with",
          "Buy your tickets first! A lovely quiet place to visit. So eerie when a member of staff makes a noise so you can hear the echo. Walk up to the first floor to get a great view of the cathedral but watch out for the uneven steps. Definitely worth a visit.",
          "Located on the piazza dei Miracoli next to the beautiful cathedral and the tower, this round monument is stunning as well. Don\u2019t forget to go on the first floor for an impressive view. Every 30 minutes you can listen to the stunning echo inside the round building.",
          "Went in here because we had the combined ticket for all the buildings and glad we did, it was very impressive.",
          "Typical baptistery. Not too much going on inside but still cool to have a look. There were some pretty stained glass windows.",
          "There is practically nothing inside worth seeing.But you have to pay 5 euro for the ticket and then you can enter the Duome for free.",
          "The most beautiful building so impressive a must while you are in Pisa Go inside it\u2019s beautiful you can go up high and look down",
          "Wow... amazing architecture. Don\u2019t bother about the high priced yours there is plenty of information on site should you want to read it! Well worth a visit tho",
          "A wonderful combination of romanesque and gothic architecture. And: the battistero is also leaning! You can check it against the cathedral wall!",
          "Worth visiting if you have going to the leaning tower. Very quiet in February, but I am sure in the summer it will not be the same experience.",
          "Over shadowed by the tower, but a fantastic building in it's own right , amazing acoustics. The best place to take a pick of the cathedral is from a window opposite in the Baptistry.",
          "You will pay 8 euros to go see the 4 buildings in this area. This is small building with one floor that allows you a great picture from the cathedral.",
          "Why have I said this? Just nothing much to see. If you're into empty marble 4 berth got tubs (for baptising). So to get your tickets head to the museum if you didn't book online with the leaning tower \u20ac5 if you book a single or \u20ac1 if added to a ticket for the cathedral etc, see",
          "Incredible exterior carvings. Huge interior space on two levels. Very quiet and atmospheric. We were lucky, while we visited one of the staff just stepped into the setting and sang a beautiful prayer, the music echoed around the interior and it was magical. There is a hidden",
          "Worth a visit if you're visiting the tower but to be honest, I think this building is perhaps more impressive externally than internally.",
          "The ornate exterior of the Baptistry is in stark contrast with its fairly austere interior. This building is also leaning, towards the cathedral. Inside there is a 13th century baptismal font and pulpit. The stained glass windows are old and new. there is one depicting John Paul",
          "It's nearby the Leaning Tower of Pisa so good for taking photo after done taking with Pisa Tower. Did not went inside the building cause it's quite crowded",
          "The water for the baptistry drops from a hole in the ceiling (rainwater) thought to be good because of its purity. The acoustics are remarkable!",
          "The interior is more beautiful than the exterior. You can go to second floor of you desire. The random singer performed when we were there. Great sound inside.",
          "5 euros for visiting both baptistery and cathedral it's nothing..the baptistery is beautiful from outside but nothing much inside but the cathedral is amazing from the inside so it's something you must do if you visit Pisa",
          "When I arrived to see the tower, I was surprised to see the other attractions that were available with my ticket. The building is amazing to see from the outside and beautiful inside. The views from the 2nd floor across the Duomo were awesome.",
          "Came as part of a visit to the leaning tower and had no idea there was so much else here to see. Really beautiful and amazing to think how it was built so long ago. Beautiful building and you are silent in there which adds to the atmosphere",
          "You can enter the Battistero and then after visiting the first floor you can climb uostairs from where, at a window you'll have a great view over the duomo and the leaning tower.",
          "I was not able to visit this attraction due to the limited time our tour had at Pisa. They limited us to 2 hours which seems like a lot of time, but if you are climbing the Leaning Tower, which I was, you have to be in line early and you stand in line awaiting your turn to",
          "It is nice to go and visit it but there is not very much to see really. But definitely if visiting Pisa and passionate about art, you can\u2019t miss it.",
          "This Romanesque and Gothic style baptistery is dedicated to St John and was built in the late 1150\u2019s. It is the largest baptistery in Italy. When we visited in September 2018, they were commemorating it\u2019s 900 year celebration. It is truly a beautiful piece of history that",
          "This building has interesting sculptures around the entire building. Lots of space fenced off so that you can get good photos without a lot of people in the way. Everyone knows that the tower leans but this building does also. The other thing is that the Pisans ran out of money",
          "Walking around the outside to and from the Tower, it was beautiful from a distance which was an unexpected surprise to all of us because they have big grass areas that are off limits and makes for great photos. Tickets for inside were too expensive",
          "It's easy to miss the beauty of this because of its proximity to the Leaning Tower but it really is stunning, particularly in early evening as the light fades. In well kept gardens there is a little market and very good cafe nearby, try and ignore the McDonald's.",
          "The lady guide sang for us in the building and it was glorious, no microphone could come close to the amplification of her voice, travelling to Pisa for day trip from Florence was a great idea. Only takes little over an hour, by car and the countryside is beautiful. Pisa is",
          "Most people come here to see the leaning tower, but this building is far more beautiful. You buy an entrance ticket and you can stay as long as you wish. So you are not rushed through. You can climb to the upper level where you have fantastic views of the tower for the windows.",
          "I really enjoyed going in the baptistry. Everything from the acoustics to the way the floor slopes so the water can drain out the doors is really cool. I loved hearing the history of the place and how it was used.",
          "Saw the Battistero as part of our 'off cruise' excursion to Pisa. it's a striking building and was a bonus as we thought we would only see the tower. Unfortunately time didn't allow us to go in. so we are now looking at weekend breaks so we can explore it in more detail.",
          "We pre booked tickets for the Tower and opted to visit the Cathedral and Bapistry to. The Bapistry was so quiet and peaceful with beautiful stained glass windows. Worth staying for the wonderful tones of the singer that beautifully filled the building with echoes. Worth a",
          "Situated in a large walled area in the center of Pisa. A striking monument with its round shape. The Baptistery is on the Unesco World Heritage List. The exterior is richly decorated but the inside of the Baptistery is very sober.",
          "A wedding cake from the outside, the baptistry is relatively free of decoration on the inside. Worth the walk up to the gallery for views down inside and through a window towards the duomo and tower.",
          "Didn't go in this building but took pictures from outside and got a good view from the tower. Biggest of its kind in Italy.",
          "This is present in the same complex as the Pisa tower. One can avail tickets to view inside - with children it was tough for us to explore more. The architecture and intricate work on the dome is definitely impressive.",
          "As part of the whole package this experience is icing on the cake for your trip to Pisa. When the vocalist make his prince felt it is truly a wonderful \"noise unto the lord\".",
          "Modeled after the circular dome Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem it is huge and beautiful site. It leans to the north (the Tower leans to the south). Lots of light as you enter and the same black and white stone walls and arches as the Duomo. The font is the first",
          "These buildings stand in this square and ooze majestic spiritual powers. They are most stunning and you can tell there are restoration works being undertaken but they do not hinder their beauty",
          "The Saint John Baptistery that stands opposite the west end of the cathedral is round Romanesque building, designed by Diotisalvi, but finished by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano who built the Gothic-style dome. With the circumference of 107.25 meters it is the largest baptistery in",
          "Don\u2019t pay to go inside unless you really do love churches etc. It\u2019s the same as a lot of Italian catholic buildings, very ornate, dark with lots of ornamentation. The outside is stunning in its use of building stone though.",
          "This is a little gem to see while visiting the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The ornate building on the outside is really incredible. We walked around it to take it all in but sadly the lines to get in were just too long and our time to go up the tower was approaching",
          "Amazing architecture - fine detail on the exterior of this building. Good for a couple of photos but not much else.",
          "The outside of the building is very ornate, the interior very plain. However, time your visit for the hour or the half hour to hear something truly amazing. The hour tends to be better as this features one person turning his voice into a choir. The acoustics are truly incredible",
          "Pay the \u20ac5 and add this when you go see the leaning tower. Look at the famous baptism area and the paintings (especially John the Baptist) but stay long enough for someone to start singing to demonstrate the acoustics (usually a guard). It\u2019s very impressive.",
          "Nothing to say about this Battistero but average, the best thing about this place is that you can go up to the second floor and take a nice picture of the duomo from above.",
          "4 th port of call on our recent Mediterranean cruise. What a great pieceof architecture kept in wonderfull condition.",
          "I have to admit that we bought the tickets to visit this site simply as a way to enter the cathedral right away versus waiting for the next available time slot in 2 hours. The site itself is very small and doesn't take a lot of time to view. However, the inside (which I had",
          "Also an external roof was added giving the shape of a cupola. This is a beautiful baptistery, probably the largest one in Italy. Because of its architecture it is a resonating chamber, and we were lucky to hear the demonstration of unforgettable sounds in the baptistery.",
          "Hello, We were at this monument with our son, inside it\u2019s a big chamber, kind of empty, but you can go up some stairs and have a good look from above. You also can take some beautiful pictures of the duomo and the Pisa Tower. Enjoy!",
          "Well worth a visit. If you\u2019re at the Tower is next door. Not much to look at inside. Just a quick 5 minutes will do it.",
          "This may sound lame, but our few minutes at Battistero and the Tower were a surprise and worthwhile pit stop. We were traveling between Cinque Terre and Florence by train. Pisa was not planned into our trip but most trains transferred there so we put an hour between stops and",
          "Such fantastic architecture in this square. A total visual delight for all. It\u2019ll get You busy on your camera to catch all the fine details. Highly recommended",
          "Find out when the echo Demonstration is given. They close the doors to entrants just beforehand. There are 2 concentric domes that create an echo effect. The climb to the top level is not very far, and the view of the floor from up above worth the short staircase.",
          "The Baptistery is in front of the Cathedral. It\u2019s easy to recognize because of the colored dome. When talking inside the acoustics are amazing. This was just a place to get baptized so not much decorating but the architecture and bronze sculpture of St. John the Baptist is",
          "The Battistero is just an amazing place and the ticket costing to enter is 5 \u20ac and inside the architecture is very beautiful.",
          "This building is on the square of the tower and the duomo, so it's just an amazing place to visit and to relax. Behind the Battistero you can see the old city walls, it's another amazing view from there. The building itself is very detailed, big and just amazing architectural",
          "The baptistery was interesting to see inside with all of its arches, dome, ornaments, pulpits, and stained glass windows as well as the font. Worth a look while you are there.",
          "We were really lucky - as we entered the staff closed the door and conducted a sound demo. Hearing the sound reflected back was just amazing.",
          "Having visited many baptisteries we were debating whether to see this one. Am I ever glad we did. Its interior is simple and beautiful. The acoustics have to be experienced to be appreciated. Very well worth a visit.",
          "Lovely place to see , lots going on with stalls restaurants near by . The tower area is stunningly beautiful but gets very busy and hot !",
          "This is a beautiful Baptistery. We had the pleasure of hearing the incredible sound as a staff member hummed a few notes. It's really something to see and hear. The main floor can also be viewed from the second story with railings overlooking the main floor. PHOTOS: We took",
          "this is a great visit, esp if you can't wait to go up the tower. Climb the steps inside for great views in and outside.",
          "...but inside, well, boring. Nothing really to see, and all these places have those electronic video displays telling the story for \u20ac2.00, sorry, no thanks. The outside is a hundred times more interesting.",
          "This building is part of the Leaning Tower complex. We loved sitting on the lawn and taking pictures. Pisa can be terribly hot in July, take a hat and have sun shades",
          "The Battistero is a beautiful building on the outside but inside it is not as exciting as I expected. Sure the architecture is beautiful as are the stained glass windows but that\u2019s it.",
          "It\u2019s best to walk up the steps to get a great view inside and outside. Incredible design. Make sure you go to the ticket office first, or schedule online. Don\u2019t walk over....they don\u2019t sell tickets at the door.",
          "Heard that this is one of the oldest and largest baptistry in the world. Must see from inside. Architecture is interesting, Romanesque style.",
          "Free standing Baptistery is a masterpiece of Nicola Pisano, bulit with the same marble as a Cathedral. The style is from romanesque to gothic.",
          "We purchased a multi-attraction ticket whilst still in the UK which included the Baptistery and it was the first place we visited. The size of the building was quite a surprise and the external architecture, particularly the roof, was very impressive. Inside, the building was",
          "It\u2019s a lovely quiet space amid the bustle of a busy tourist spot. Cool and interesting. Sit on the side and listen because every now and then one of the guides will chant and the sound resonates about the building making it sound like a choir. Climb the short staircase to",
          "Another white tower next to the duomo and pisa tower. Free to view and walk around. To pay to enter the tower.",
          "This a 1000 years old building and it looks great as we walked around it is in the middle of the historical Pisa complex",
          "The accoustics in this building are fabulous and once an hour a soloist sings which was unexpected. If you pay 5 euros it means you can skip the line on the Doumo de Pisa.",
          "The largest of its kind in Italy, and a few cms taller than the tower, the scenes on its pulpit and the acoustics add to the charm of the place!",
          "This is a nice building with some nice architecture but make sure you are in there when the echo demonstration is on it\u2019s awesome. I think it is on the hour, it was definitely on at 11 on a Sunday.",
          "This place is directly beside pisa you can see when going to visit pisa... Would recommend going in evening as the crowds have gone.. During the day it's crazy busy",
          "This baptistery is beautiful and shouldn\u2019t be missed. You\u2019ll find that there\u2019s not many options to do in the Square of Miracles, so you might as well. You\u2019ll be glad you did.",
          "I was amazed by this place and I was delighted with her beauty.I would like to go again because I did not have enough time to do this",
          "A beautiful building - richly carved in white on the exterior, but quite simple on the inside with its plain dome connecting earth and heaven, so they say. Well worth visiting if you're already visiting anything else you pay for besides the tower (if not quite as good as the",
          "This is on the same site as the tower so worth looking at, although we didn\u2019t go inside. It\u2019s slightly quieter at that end of the grounds. You can sit and relax on the grass nearby as well.",
          "A great place to visit if you\u2019re already in the square of miracles. It\u2019s overshadowed by the other monuments but it is lovely. Nice and cool inside with plenty of place to sit and be still.",
          "Enjoyed the quietude here. Each half hour, a security guard sings to capture the amazing acoustics. Definitely try to be there at the top of the hour, or on the half. It only lasts a minute, but it is beautiful. Great views from the higher floor.",
          "Amazing building to look round with lots of history on offer. Worth a visit for the views from the first floor windows alone.",
          "The structure is beautiful. Just across the Cathedral. Tourists are less attracted to it since almost all are fascinated to the leaning tower wc is a few meters away. But the Baptistry is really nice from the outside. We didnt have the chance to get in though.",
          "This lovely piece of architecture is often unmentioned due to the hype about the nearby famous tower. I actually thought that this was by far the most architecturally striking and beautiful building of the site. It too leans... but no so obviously.",
          "This is really worth visiting while a trip PIsa. It\u2019s a cleverly designed and modestly decorated space.",
          "The baptistry is part of a complex including a cathedral and bell tower, the latter better known as the leaning tower of Pisa. It's a lovely building with some great history. We had a tour guide with us who gave us lots of fantastic background. She got us to the baptistry at",
          "As part of the Pisa ticket combo is the Battistero and the Cemetery, whilst the cathedral is a free to enter.",
          "As a part of Pisa as a whole its also fabulous ro see the architecture and history Worth coming and viewing a piece of art and respect these people has to build these momuments that have lasted the test of time",
          "All 3 must-sees, Leaning Tower, Cathedral and Baptistry are within easy reach of each other, all within about a 2 block area. Baptistry is beautiful outside and currently undergoing some renovations. Inside the construction allows for wonderful echoes. We happened to be there",
          "Get there as soon as it opens to experience it empty and quiet. Good views from the gallery. Good echoes!",
          "We entered by chance and it\u2019s really beautiful. Everybody goes to pisa in order to see the tower but the surrounding is more beautiful.",
          "We visited the Battistero during our trip to Pisa, at first sight it fits in well with the surrounding monuments. But when you get inside there appears to be little to see. If you look closer you will notice intricate details everywhere and the stained glass windows are very",
          "The baptistry was my least favourite out of the monuments in Pisa. The feeling I got whilst I was inside was just a bit naff. It was a little disappointing compared to the other monuments I went inside at pisa. There are some nice stained glass windows to look at and there are",
          "So great to see all this history, the whole complex is really well maintained and organized, the battistero is interesting to see and good to read up about the history of this place",
          "Visited Pisa during a Port stop on a Mediterranean cruise. Called into Port Livorno where we chose to visit Pisa, after a short bus ride from Livorno centre to the train station caught a train for a few euros to Pisa. On arrival the leaning tower was around a 20 walk tough the",
          "We didn't manage to see inside though enjoyed the views of its stunning exterior. A beautiful building with a lot of history.",
          "Lovely bit of architecture, worth the euros to enter. Not too much to see in it apart from the architecture and views from the windows. The acoustics were pretty cool due to the shape and size of the building. One of the attendants demonstrated this by singing - truly amazing",
          "This is the largest baptistry in the Christian World. The chandelier inside is where Galileo discovered the law of the pendulum. This was a beautiful place.",
          "The building itself is worth the visit - the expansive interior and the baptismal pool, and upstair, with the great Tower & Cathedral picture spot. But it's only truly magical twice per hour (hour and half hour), when the security guard closes the doors and perform an amazing",
          "The Battistero is not very nice from outside, but inside as well. The accustic is excellent. You can climbe up the balcony and very good photo oppertinities, also from the whole Piazza del Miracoli.",
          "In the same piazza as the famous leaning tower. It is a pretty building which is used as the baptistery. If you climb up to the terrace level you have great views.",
          "Comparing this baptistry to the one in Florence, there is just no comparison, the one in Florence is sooo much nicer. However, the views from the top were really good.",
          "Very few people inside when we visited one hot afternoon in June so it was very peaceful. The best part for me was to climb up to the balcony where you can really appreciate the space from above. There are also magnificent views of the front facade of the Duomo through a window",
          "My family visited there on June 21. It\u2019s really great and happy to see all leaning tower and heritage buildings. It\u2019s a part of Leaning Tower area(Miracle Square). It\u2019s also amazing architecture and must see place in Pisa.",
          "The inside has few decorations, very simple. Climb up to next level and find a beutiful view of both the inside and the outside.",
          "Located very close to the Leaning Tower so notably overlooked. It is a glorious building. Queues weren\u2019t very long at all and you get a lot of time to relax walking around seeing all the gorgeous decorations. The main attraction is the sound resonance inside the building which",
          "Loved this. Happened to time our visit with some chanting and as we were in the top level it sounded absolutely amazing. Don\u2019t miss this. It\u2019s superb.",
          "Remarkable building , with beautiful architecture in the structure. Very busy in the walkways , beautiful photo opportunities.",
          "If you go inside is because you've been completely fooled and have buy the ticket to visit all the monuments. When are you going to be back in Pisa? So let's buy the full pass. After the visit, you'll know for sure there is no reason to going back to Pisa in the future. The",
          "Part of the tour package/tickets we bought, you want to go see it. Not a whole lot to it but it is unbelievable in beauty. One great thing is the picture you can take from the second floor (the steps up are tight and fun) of the cathedral. Do it.",
          "In the same complex as the Leaning Tower of Pisa (stand alone bell tower of Pisa) The detailing in the structure is beautiful, would suggest taking binoculars to see the detaining closer. Entrance can be gained and a better view available from higher. The grounds are kept",
          "Not clear how much the tickets were until we had to pay. We asked for the price multiple times and the lady at the ticketcounter seemed to no understand English. Once inside we got disappointed by the amount of people, the crowd and the place. Nothing special- why did we pay?",
          "we could not enter the place , from outside looks great no details available for batiste monument may be next visit",
          "The building is a marvel in itself - constructed in marble. Climb up the stairs to the very top and there is a small window where one can take pictures of the Duomo and the leaning tower. There is a sitting area inside for quiet and reflection. Take a moment to absorb it all in.",
          "This was finished in 1363! The stories it could tell... Make sure you go inside and check it out. The guide said that it is still used for baptisms if you arrange/book in advance.",
          "Wait for the member of staff to demonstrate the acoustics of the building, the echo is amazing and unforgettable",
          "Such a wonderful setting and although busy very well organized. Clean and genuine. Don't miss all of the buildings on the site.",
          "Only steps from the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Cattedrale, the Battistero is an architectural celebration of ornament and detail. In many respects, it feels like the pretty baby sister of Tuscany's duomos and it's not possible to deny it's many charms. Yet another reason to",
          "Pisa's baptistery is another architectural highlight in the famous Piazza dei Miracoli. Its shape and unique appearance is the reason why it attracts so many tourists.",
          "Very quick to get around and see. Less than 10 minutes. We were lucky to be around at 12pm when one of the attendants demonstrated the incredible acoustics by chanting/singing up into the hemispherical roof. Awe inspiring, but not essential.",
          "Construction dates to 1152 and this building, dedicated to St. John was completed in 1363 and is the largest Baptistery in Italy. Although the style of architecture is subtly different from the Cathedral and Tower, it is nevertheless in harmony with columns and arches. Beautiful",
          "I loved singing and hearing the echo. The secury guard yelled silence at me, which I thought was an oxymoron. So I started to sing Silenzo in fancy ways.",
          "I was so impressed with this place. You buy tickets next door. Worth it. Takes only a few minutes. At noon each day they have a sound test. Impressive.",
          "seeing as this is right opposite the leaning tower, you might as well duck into here as well. It wont take you long to view. Maybe 15-30 mins.",
          "Got too go in and admire this building and the quality of the restoration, its worth it take your time and soak in the beautiful atmosphere",
          "make the effort to climb the stairs to the top. Great views and wonderful when the guide sings, using the building acoustics to echo off the walls",
          "This the largest baptistry in Italy has prefect acoustics, so its attendants are constantly asking for silence \"Listen!\". A Beautiful building, far superior to the Duomo Baptistry of Florence.",
          "This building has beautiful carvings, particularly on the pulpit. Disabled entrances is up a ramp to the side of the building. It is possible to get to the upper gallery, but not unless you can manage stairs.",
          "This is a very simple place. You must be there when the custodian sings and the cascading of his voice is almost mesmerizing. Plan ahead and have your iPhone set on record to retain this mini-program.",
          "To reach the place from stazione Pisa centrale is about 15-20 minutes by bus. Use the continue ticket starting from 60 minutes, 90 minutes even you may choose the 24 hours ticket. There are restaurant, cafe and merchandize store surround the Battistero place that same location",
          "Others have written about fortunate timing to hear the acoustics. It happens on the hour & half hour when the custodian steps into the space. Some custodians are better than others, but make sure you time your visit.",
          "Well preserved and maintained and you can take your time looking round. Write ups are in English and all staff can speak English fluently.",
          "We got lucky to be in here as a guide was doing a demonstration of this place's really unique acoustics, which is the only thing separating it from every other beautiful building like it. So I guess find the singing tour guide or hang around in there long enough to luck out.",
          "You can get into the Baptistery for 5 Euro and that includes free admission to the cathedral. Stay for the demonstration of the acoustics, you will be very impressed.",
          "We've seen a lot of churches and sites thru our travels but I don't think I have expected to be so moved by what I heard by visiting the Battistero. It's a MUST to be present for the sound check....it will truly leave you with and incredible experience and wonder how in the",
          "Was disappointed with this building. Very ornate on the outside, but very little to look at once inside. There is an ancient stone staircase which takes you up to a balcony from which you look down onto the font etc, but it was really hard work and not worth the effort. Cost of",
          "Right next door to the leaning tower and it is a free entrance if you are going to pray. Worth the visit.",
          "this was a cruise excursion and our tour guide took us inside to see this magnificent building. second time in 11 years how lucky i was to see this again. magnificent.",
          "If your coming to see the Leaning Tower then you will also see the Battestero by default. It's the largest baptistery in Italy topping a height of 54.86 m and diameter of 34.13 m. The Baptistery is constructed of marble, as is common in Italian architecture. Constructed on the",
          "This was my first visit to a Baptistry, and what a great one to visit! It is, quite simply, a very large, ornate and gorgeous building used to house a large immersion baptismal font in the middle of the main floor. Don\u2019t expect a lot other than that! Of course the stained",
          "Carvings are breathtaking, also gentleman comes to center for singing/chant to so you can experience echo that is quite amazing.",
          "In olden days, to enter a church, one must have been baptized. Hence, baptisteries located in front of cathedrals. This baptistery was started in 1152 and is the largest in Italy. As with both the Duomo and Torre, the baptistery leans, albeit slightly. Well worth seeing when",
          "One of the four great religious edifices within the Piazza dei Miracoli, this Baptistry is such an awe-inspiring architectural wonder. Grand in physical and historical proportions yet intricate in detail in both aspects. Best seen and witnessed with a tour guide or someone",
          "Be sure to see the many intricate sculptures at the top of the columns. This is beautiful. Bring a camera with a close up lense!",
          "The battistero was amazing. We were asked to keep as quiet as possible due to the acoustics of this place but were treated to just what those acoustics were capable when one of the attendants sang some notes. This happens around every 15 minutes or so I believe. It was lovely",
          "No queue generally, and free to boot so well worth a short stroll to view. If you've only just arrived in Pisa and want to get something under your belt this is the one.",
          "If you buy a ticket for the Baptist you get a ticket to the cathedral. Tickets are available in the visitor building b4 you turn up to the Baptistry it is 5 euro If you get in near the half hour and a singer will demostrate the acoustics. Climb to the top for unique views",
          "Definitely my favourite of the buildings in this area of Pisa - it's an incredible sight and the finish and time spent on this is amazing. Definitely worth visiting.",
          "Nice but short expierience :-) Its nice to see from outside and not needed to go inside. You can save the money :-)",
          "I was fascinated by the fact that the architecture seen at Miracle Square is so beautifully unified. The Battistero is stunning with its dome and round shape - an architectural feat. The acoustics are amazing and the love and care taken in the finishing and decoration here is",
          "This is a lovely place to visit it is so full of history and is based on two levels. You pay for entrance but it\u2019s worth the money especially if you are lucky enough to hear somebody sing while you are in there as this place is purpose built to echo the sound. Go pay a visit you",
          "The Baptistery is quite a plain building inside although it has a magnificent pulpit by Nicola Pisano. But it does have a very harmonious and calm feel to it. The thing that makes it five stars is the demonstration of the building acoustics which the attendants perform every",
          "Incredible domed structure, incredible acoustics in the baptistry. The pulpit is intricate carved marble",
          "Great time must of taken 100 pictures. Some good restaurant and bakeries. Beware of pick pockets especially while using the bus. A couple of my friends had their phone and wallet stolen.",
          "We paid 5 euros each to enter. Basically each site on the territory is 5 euros. With the ticket you can enter the Duomo. Religious art inside. Worth the wait for one of the attendants to sing several octave harmony. I read this is a regular thing.",
          "I didn't have any expectations but this was included in the ticket we bought and it was well worth the visit! Climb the stairs for a look from above and make sure to stay for one of the regular echo tests. Absolutely breathtaking listening to the guy sing with amazing acoustics!",
          "This is an amazing building - it's hard to grasp that the builders had such a grasp of engineering that they were able to build something with such acoustics. There's a guy here who chants on the ground floor at regular times, and it can be heard clearly all around the building.",
          "A 14th century building constructed between 1100 to 1300's. Its is in the same complex between Pisa tower and the Cathedral. A combined tickets can be booked for the Battistero and the pisa tower.",
          "I didn't go in as the line for tickets was really long and I didn't have the time, but just being on the grounds was worth it. It is a beautiful building and take the time if you can to walk all around it.",
          "when here make sure you take a guided tour , its about 2 hours long but for sure worth doing it , there is so much information that can be shared in doing this",
          "Absolutely beautiful building would highly recommend paying the small fee to have a look around inside - a must see!",
          "This in my opinion is better that the crooked tower but this is a slightly biased opinion as I really like the architecture on this Battistero. You can go inside but I wasn\u2019t allowed as I had my suitcase but I wish I had able too.",
          "We visited here over the Christmas holidays and found whilst still busy, most of the attention is focused towards the leaning tower. At sunset the place changes colours and presents an amazing photo oppurtunity. it is very well light once the sun completly sets and once again,",
          "This is a very interesting place of worship, with galleries overlooking city and tower , the price to get in for three museums is \u20ac8 , so it\u2019s good value",
          "The pulpit by Nicola Pisano --inspired by sculpture on Roman sarcophagi in the Campo Santo-- wants to be looked at carefully, but it is high up and badly lit. Bring a powerful flashlight. On the half hour, someone comes to sing various notes and demonstrate the amazing",
          "The Baptistry is part of the Piazza del Duomo where the cathedral and the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa are located. As part of our cruise, we were taken inside the baptistry. There are steps up to the upper level where you can see down into the gallery and also windows where you",
          "Pretty marbled font and ornate pulpit with intricate carvings. Make sure you are there on the hour or half hour if you want to hear the brilliant acoustics in action.",
          "Not much to be seen inside and there is an entry fee. It is mostly empty, except for a couple of tombs.",
          "big Battistero with amazing architecturing and great positioning.it is located in the piazza de mirakoli",
          "Went during the Christmas holidays : not a lot of tourists about. You can buy a combination ticket for all 4 monuments (cathedral is free if you buy any entrance tickets). You need not specify which monument you want to go in, just the number of places and as you enter a",
          "We did not find this bapistery to be nearly as intresting on the inside as others we visited in other Tuscan cities. Very plain and would spend the time at the graveyard rather than here.",
          "Oh this surely had my attention. The beauty and majesty of this building puzzled me. How is it that they let this overshadow the duomo itself.",
          "The building was awe inspiring especially with the echo demonstration. Worth a visit it is on the same sight as the tower and it\u2019s better to go there on your way to Florence if you land at Pisa airport",
          "I wasn't overly impressed with the interiors. I think it can be enjoyed more from the outside which is much more impressive",
          "The baptistery is the \"other bookend\" of the Campo dei Miracoli, the first being the Leaning Tower, with the cathedral in the middle. It is striking outside; quite beautiful inside. Worth a quarter hour or more of your time.",
          "We purchased tickets for the baptistry. It is a very large building that is well decorated. It is worth some time to visit it and enjoy the inside. The ticket office is behind the leaning tower. You also get a ticket for the cathedral there.",
          "It's yet another beautiful building. The baptistery, cathedral, leaning tower is all located together.. and cab be seen in the same day..",
          "Not just interesting from the outside but the acoustical properties of this building are incredible. Every 30 min on the half hour a staff member closes the doors and then starts voicing differently pitched notes. The echo lasts for so long it ends up sounding like a symphony.",
          "While others are visiting the leaning tower and ignoring some of the other attractions, I found this attraction to be the most fascinating. Take the time to climb the internal stairs for the grand view of the ceiling and the first floor. The crowds are smaller here.",
          "I would say that this place was quite interesting, though not as interesting as either the tower or especially the duomo. It is larger than the baptisteries in Florence or Siena, though less grand than the latter. Definitely worth seeing if you are already here, but not worth a",
          "It is easy to view this marvellous old building, if not to get inside it because of the queuing visitors who through the centre of Pisa",
          "What a lovely place, I really enjoyed viewing this area. We arrived as part of a day trip quite early so there were not great crowds to deal with. I can imagine that this area would get extremely crowded later in the day. The entry point is through a number of stalls so I",
          "What is nice about Pisa is that there are many wonderful places all within walking distance. Great there a signs for people to keep off the grass as this makes for great photos and a special memory.",
          "Little to be known a stone throw from the meaning tower is this beautiful building. Sadly it wasn\u2019t part of the tour so only got to enjoy its external beauty.",
          "The architecture for the times never ceases to amaze me. The domed structures are smething for their times and must be appreciated.",
          "Fantastic from the outside alot bigger than you think .You can go inside and go to the top but get your tickets early. What a building to be baptised in had a walking tour to learn the histoy very informative",
          "No comparison to the Battisterero in Florence, quite stark without a beautiful ceiling and very little to see inside.",
          "Well worth seeing as part of the complex.. Outstanding complex of world fame, all concentrated and a must see.",
          "Worth taking a look inside the Baptistry. It's very pretty. We were fortunate enough to hear someone singing inside. The acoustics are fantastic.",
          "Pretty on the outside and a few things on the inside. You are able to get up to the second level to look down on the interior, but beware should they be moving anything (as they were when we there) it is jarringly loud.",
          "We respectfully viewed the exterior and interior of this magnificent large structure. The stained glass is exquisite and the workmanship of the alter, speakers platform and baptismal font are all outstanding. The climb to look down is steep but worth it. Admission is nominal.",
          "I was interested to learn the history of why this ornate white marble building exists. In days gone by people who were not baptised were not allowed to enter a church so had to be baptised in a seperate building first . The detail on the exterior is amazing",
          "This is part of the square of miracles it is ok it doesn\u2019t take very long to look around the one thing it does have is perfect acoustics!",
          "Better from the outside than in. Very plain interior but worth a visit if you combine it with the echo demonstration - ours was on the hour - it\u2019s fascinating. Photo taken from inside overlooking Cathedral.",
          "The Baptistery costs 5 euros, but the amazing acoustics makes the visit worthwhile. A staff members sings every half hour to demonstrate the echo effects, so plan accordingly. Climb to the top on the spiralling stairs for the look down.",
          "As we walked into the baptistery, the Moorish influence was discussed and became very evident to us in the stone work around the central font. The rest of the interior is made up of elaborately detailed sculpture work and reliefs throughout, including the columns and statues.",
          "It's the most beautiful architecture on the exterior side. Simple interiors. Climb to see the top of the cathedral. Worth the shot!",
          "The place is so nice and very quiet, there were people but very calm and one can enjoy taking pictures!",
          "Be sure to get along to the Baptistery for 4pm when the door is closed and the choristers voice echoes throughout the entire building. Haunting. The climb up the stairs is worth the view of the font below and the piazza and cathedral and the tower nearby.",
          "You just need to go in for several minutes and it is a beautiful quiet historic building with lots of memories left inside",
          "Although the building itself doesn't really have much to look at, every 30 minutes the doors are closed and someone sings a few notes to show the acoustic quality of the building. The echos are incredible, it's really difficult to know when the singer stops and the echo",
          "The Baptistry in Pisa is well worth a visit. It would be a pity to go to the Piazza de Miracoli and not take it in. You buy tickets at the Duomo ticket office. The Battistero is behind the cathedral, the opposite side to the leaning tower. It is a very beautiful and ornate",
          "U can't miss this . Right next to Pisa tower. Lovely grounds. Very easy to get to. See my previous review of leaning tower. Great place for selfies. McDonald's is next door almost. Bag stalls and souvenirs available from street vendors at great prices.....enjoy...",
          "Just another place to see climb 100+ steps to gallery will give you prospective of the place, but basic not very interesting,",
          "October 2017, we bought the entry a combo with the Camposanto opposite, The Baptistry is so very lovely, holy, beautifully crafted and the carving is great. I was very surprised how deep the walkway was in the gallery ( I was expecting quite narrow) and the view of the sanctuary",
          "Stunning building - woth a look, but will not take long. Helpful one-way system up one set of steps to the top and down another. A quiet place to escpe the mayhem outside.",
          "Entrance requires a ticket- purchased at the Duomo ticket office - the building on the right as you enter the city gates. There's not a lot to see, but it's all right. I used the Rick Steves guidebook for additional context when inside. For neat view of the baptistry and outside",
          "Tha Battustero is a very ok and emotive structure. Part of the Tower Of Pisa complex, it cannot fail to ioress. The interior, however is a bit of an anticlimax and us very bland",
          "Might have rated it higher except that it suffers by comparison with the tower, cathedral and camposanto. Plus when we went there were building works going on with a partial closure. Having said which some great windows (2 in gold), the font is incredible and so forth. Given",
          "This building is really special. After spending time on the ground floor (the main baptistery) take the stairs to the high gallery. When we there a guide stood in the centre and sung some notes which echoed around the building - he was even able to sing a chord with his own",
          "Great buliding in Piazza dei Miracoli. It is nice to see from the Tower of Pisa. Even you do not go inside it is worth seeing it.",
          "Unlike Rome, Tuscany was the first area where we came to learn about Baptistries as a separate and equally ornate structure. Understanding that baptisms today are very much different than how/when they were performed during Medieval and Renaissance times and yes, it has it's",
          "The Pisa Baptistery of St. John is the largest baptistery in Italy. It is located across from the leaning tower of Pisa with the cathedral in the middle. The architecture is very beautiful as everything is in the Piazza dei Miracoli. Many might not notice, but Battistero di",
          "All I can say is that it is amazing inside. Great art work and architecture. This is well worth a visit.",
          "We paid to go in the baptistery with free entry to the Cathedral included. It was very special inside and made more so when someone sang some notes with a lovely acoustic.",
          "Whilst in the area, and after having visited the Leaning Tower, and the Cathedral, we visited the Baptistery, as planned. We bought all the tickets online before leaving home for all the attractions that we wished to visit which were within the Piazza dei Miracoli. It saved us",
          "This is worth a visit if you have the time. Opposite the Tower with the cathedral in between the two.",
          "Lovely architecture and in a wonderful setting with outstanding frescoes. Not much else to say really.",
          "Great acoustic when a singer provided a short demonstration. Many steps to ge to the top not much up there once you get there but looks directly down into the lobby",
          "Quick visit in and out, still worth seeing. The outside is more impressive than inside . The pulpit is beautiful the height of the dome and the sculptures are incredible. Worth the visit.",
          "You really don't need a guide to see this building, as there is an information audio kiosk with headphones for 2 euro and describes the history of construction and function of the Baptistery. The building itself is amazingly huge and has great acoustics - while we were there",
          "if you are here, it is worth paying the entrance and climbing to the women\u00b4s floor and have the view from above. the acoustics are amazing as well, so worth the 5 euros.",
          "We saw this lovely baptistery as part of our tour of the Piazza dei Miracoli. It was built in the mid 1100-1200s, of zebra-work grey and white marble, with an Arabian influence, like the Duomo next to it. It is the largest baptistery in Italy, a huge cylinder, encircled by",
          "visiting the leaning tower of Pisa you will come to see this beautiful building give yourself time to enjoy the architect",
          "This building is awesome and what makes it even more awesome are the buildings all around it the tower of Pisa and the duomo . Must visit place",
          "Compared to the elegant interior of the Duomo, the Battistero may come as a disappointment. The beauty of this building is definitely on the outside. There aren\u2019t many people inside as it seems to be the least popular building on the site. It\u2019s worth visiting though whilst",
          "Spend the 8\u20ac and see the inside of the baptistery and other buildings and the museum. The dumo is free but you need to pick up a ticket at the same place as for buying the baptistery ticket so spend the money and see everything. You'll not regret it.",
          "If you visit the leaning tower of Pisa you can't miss this. Seems overshadowed by all the people visiting but it's still a nice enough site and with the Duomo makes a nice trio of views",
          "The cathedral was BEAUTIFUL! But this was a touch bland- it was about 2 minutes of Ooo- now what. The Duomo was worth it and so was the tower view but this not so much",
          "You see the baptistery, duomo, cemetery and leaning tower on one site and pay for what you want to visit. The baptistery is the most ornate and beautiful building I think I have every seen. Yes you have to see the leaning tower but this was favourite of all. The inside however",
          "It's amazing to me that a Baptistry would be built separately from a Cathedral and to this grand scale! But that's what they did and it is a most magnificent space. The beauty of the pulpit itself is breathtaking. Every half hour the security guard comes out and sings four notes",
          "Very interesting and the tile work amazing. The upper gallery allows you to look down on the mosaic floor below for best view. Worth a visit",
          "Gleaming white baptistry in pristine surroundings. Acoustics inside are amazing, thanks to the architectural design; inner and outer domes with a void between them.",
          "If you are passionate about architecture you are in the right place. Is beautiful and impressive in the same time!!!!",
          "One can go inside the Battistero paying 5 euros (the cathedral entry is free if you take the Tower ticket or Battistero ticket). The acoustics of the building with stunning echoes is marvelous. Every half an hour an official demonstrates it.The inside of the building is not very",
          "Another stunning Italian design building you will see on grounds of Leaning Tower of Pisa. Take your time and carefully view the detail of the exterior going form top to bottom and side to side. Like every other building on these grounds, your jaw will drop in amazement at",
          "The Battistero was an incredible structure to visit, especially the outside that had so many components to it near the roof that made you stand in awe. Also the surrounding area was great where was sat and had a glass of wine and dinner.",
          "I visited for around 10 minutes and sad upstairs, suddenly a man started singing and that was really magical. He must have worked here, the acoustics were incredible. Without this I think my visit would have been a bit average, but the singing was incredible.",
          "Looks amazing in real life. Incredible architeture that is beyond words to describe. The echo accoustics are angelic. A must see in Pisa.",
          "You can know that what ever religion you maybe, the history and architecture will just blow you away.",
          "Very beautiful stunning building. Romantic and lots of room to sit and laze about. Very enjoyable. Just watch out for pick pockets",
          "We came as a group organised by our cruise ship. We had a guided tour and enjoyed every minute. Although there were thousands outside in the area around here, we were not rushed or over crowded in here. Beautiful architecture. Shoulders have to be covered up so you are provided",
          "Unfortunately we weren't able to go inside but it is a beautiful building and the whole setting is lovely. I assume that it opens at 10 a.m., like the cathedral. The roof is interesting as half is of lead and half of tiles - I don't know why!",
          "We were glad to go inside and climb up as it was lovely. There was a huge sign saying silence which everyone ignored!",
          "Time your visit so it is on the hour then you can hear one of the guides test out the brilliant echo with a little recital.",
          "Great thing to see in Pisa! I would recommend to anyone to enter Battistero instead of climbig the tower. Tickets for basilica and 3 other buildings nearby is 8\u20ac alltogether, while tower alone is 18\u20ac. While we were inside (on 1 floor) a guy suddenly started to sing to show",
          "A beautiful place to explore, in a lovely setting. The acoustics were absolutely amazing when the doors were closed and the attendant sang - stunning. Hard to believe it was only one voice.",
          "Its very beautiful architect and its worth visiting it.. it takes 5 euro to go inside.. You have to think if you want to go inside or not because outside is all what you can see..",
          "The structure is amazing in itself but when the singer went to the middle of the room where each echo lasts 12 seconds and sang some notes the sound blew us away. Much more interesting than the tower although our cruise tour did not allow time to climb the leaning tower. Must",
          "Standing behind the main attraction is this wonderful building. It surprises you as you walk around the Piazza to the old wall to the city.",
          "Waited for a bit to be admitted inside, but were instantly mesmerised and amazed by the great acoustics of the baptisery.",
          "The tower gets the attention, but this place was amazing as well. Much larger than I expected it to be.",
          "A facinating and fine building. There was an interesting experience to walk up the stairs that went around inside the outer wall of the building. Exciting to look down from the upper galley. It was very high.",
          "Special place to hide from the crowds outside, Second floor windows offer nice views as well. Beautiful exterior, interior might look essential, but that was the way it was centuries ago.",
          "A very charming perfect building in the Square of Miracles, stunning stonework on the outside, plenty to look at and admire, especially when waiting for you time to climb the tower. Go inside and try out the acoustics if time permits on your visit to Pisa, its impressive.",
          "Lovely place to visit whilst visiting the Tower of Pisa. Beautiful stonework. Was to busy to go inside though",
          "Quite some building in its own right next to the Duomo. Set within the old city walls the whole area is stunning.",
          "even though we did not go inside - the outside more than makes up for it ! some stunning stonework - which again is worth a visit after dark - when floodlight and the crowds have all disappeared !",
          "One of the guides will be able to demonstrate the echo effect in here which is very clear. Climb up to get a good view of the surrounding area.",
          "A beautiful building ideal for a quick visit before visiting the leaning tower, some great views to be had once you have climbed the stairs and great acoustics inside, you do need tickets to enter, these are allocated for times so try to book in advance or get there early",
          "Great round building where you can run up the stairs get a great view of below and out of the windows. First floor circular run around down the stairs and out into the heat again",
          "Wow, what a magnificent building, with the back drop of the old city walls. It is right across from the Bell tower.",
          "The Battistero is small but really beautiful and the view from the first floor stunning, well worth a visit.",
          "We specifically bought tickets for entry to the Battistero as we were told about the fantastic acoustics and the building inside. On entering we were a little disappointed as to how 'spartan' the place was inside, although still very beautiful. We waited with 'baited breath' for",
          "Make sure you clim until the first floor. The view is unbelievable. For photographs you can take a nice picture of the Duomo from one of the window - the is a hole in it. The most unforgettable is the echo song. Make sure you listen to it even if you have to wait for a while",
          "you need tickets to go inside these buildings, so get there early, i would have loved to see inside but the next allocation of tickets was 7pm and we had to get back to our ship :(",
          "Quite basic inside but what there is is well worth the visit. Steps to the second level should you feel the need of a bird's eye view. If you can find a time when there is someone singing to get advantage of the sound inside it is areal treat.",
          "Obviously steeped in history but sadly very little written information available and no audio or printed material available which leaves you on your own. A spectacular building nonetheless.",
          "the is a typical baptistery, however it's not ornate and is very plain. There is no great art to amazing architecture to see here. Just a lot of stone. Worth stopping by just to say you've been here.",
          "If anything the outside is more impressive than the inside - circular with 24 statues set 2/3rds up the structure. Inside the octagonal baptistry and hexagonal pulpit are worth noting and worth doing the climb up to the gallery. The acoustics are demonstrated every half hour",
          "Great building besides Duomo and Leaning Tower of Pisa! All is on the same piazza! Parking is just nearby and it's easy to access!",
          "To my mind, this is a real must visit place in the Piazza Dei Miracoli - you can get it as part of the \u20ac8 package excluding the leaning tower. It is beautiful inside with great acoustics - I was lucky enough to hear one of the attendants chanting, which was just amazing.",
          "Withe the Duomo in the middle and the leaning tower at one end this really complements the buildings. As beautiful as the other two and with two types of material used on the roof. On a guided tour you only get to see the outside so it is worth revisiting on your own to do the",
          "We went into the Baptistery first before going into the cathedral because there wasn't a queue. A young lady started to sing and we didn't realise it was just one voice. Amazing.",
          "A beautiful building from the outside, matched by the beauty of the acoustics inside. One of the staff was very helpful and came in and sang scales to demonstrate - fabulous!",
          "Again don't advertise but free entry for disabled and career on proof of disability .photo of PIP was sufficient . Short climbed to top limited views from small windows but one has a good view of cathedral and tower .",
          "The exterior is stunning, i would not bother to go in. Its very boring and there is little to no design. The view of the cathedral is okay, but you cannot see the tower. Enjoy the sunseting behind it also!",
          "The Baptistry is just that - the building devoted to Catholic baptisms. Galileo was baptised here. You can climb the stairs to the upper level for a good view (the building is not large). Stay for the echo test to hear the marvellous acoustics, but you won't be able to enter the",
          "Most visitors are drawn to the famous Leaning Tower and the cathedral but the Baptistry is well worth a visit. For the best view, climb the internal stone staircase to the viewing gallery and look down on the altar, font and pulpit. There are also (limited) viewing portals out",
          "On the same piazza as the leaning tower of Pisa and the stunning Duomo. Definitely worth seeing as well. Has really sound effects inside too!",
          "Well worth going into alongside the more famous tower (the campanile), but it leans the other way. Go in on the half hour and hear one of the docents sing their own accompaniment using the stupendous acoustics of this building, where the echoes form the harmony. Worth walking",
          "This is a very interesting place- not overly ornate but still very beautiful in a simpler way. You can go up some steps to view from the upper gallery.The guide demonstrated the wonderful acoustics by giving a short singing performance!",
          "This beautiful baptistery was built not only for baptisms (during a time when one could not enter a cathedral until they were baptized) but also with such lovely acoustics that it's certain there was intention for musical performances of some kind. Each hour on the half hour",
          "Try and catch the singing - wonderful acoustics. Calm atmosphere inside. Exquisite carvings and interesting history.",
          "This is the largest baptistery in Italy, almost 55m high, with a diameter of 34m. It is an example of the transition from Romanesque to the Gothic style architecture. Visitors can look around inside and out and can view the building from the upper level. There is also a good",
          "We arrived at 9 am (opening time) on weekday in early June without a reservation and were able to get two tickets up to the top of the tower. I think we got lucky and would recommend reservations prior to your arrival. For 2 adults, it was 46 EUR/$51.50 to go to the top of the",
          "The baptistery is an integral part of the cathedral complex. Interestingly, the building sinks the way the tower does but nobody calls it the leaning baptistery of Pisa for some reason.",
          "This is by far the least interesting baptistery we've seen. It underdelivers in the fact there is only an altar and a plupit in the building. Although the inside is \"library of congress\" like.. it isn't worth the entrance price. Don't mind skiping this.",
          "From afar, this structure was as beautiful as the tower. Upon entering the Pisa tower complex, we will find the Battistero first. It was like part of the tour within the complex. I didn't get inside though, but marveling its structure from afar was already a great experience. I",
          "We had a combined ticked that allowed us access to the baptistery, you can book these in advance and print them. The baptistery itself is an incredible building and is worth a visit. While we were upstairs one of the staff walked into the centre of the baptistery and started",
          "This place takes some beating!! It's structure it awe-inspiring you can just look and look and look and not get bored...well worth a visit.",
          "We bought a combination entry ticket for the Tower and Baptistry. We didn't need to queue to get into the Baptistry, and it wasn't time-slot entry. We were able to climb to the first level of the Baptistry which gave some elevated views of the Piazza, but these were through wire",
          "It is a beautiful building, and you can go up to the higher level once inside, however, there is not much to see. There are however several audio kiosks that you can pay a couple of Euro to listen to the history of the building construction and such. Entrance is paid for as",
          "The Battistero (baptistery), was built in the same Pisan-Romanesque style as the cathedral, taking over 200 years to finish, and has another fine pulpit, sculpted by the father of the sculptor who did the one in the Duomo. The function of this building is clearly baptism. The",
          "The Pisa Baptistery of St. John is the largest baptistery in Italy and took over 200 hundred years to build it out of marble. It is taller than the leaning tower of Pisa, if you count the statue on top, standing some 180 feet tall. If you are lucky there might be a bunch of",
          "Gets very busy, plenty hawkers to annoy you selling shoddy fakes watches etc. Also loadsa souvenier stalls. Place itself is stunning the tower looks even more on the tilt in real life!! Plenty to see and reel off photo after photo. Easily accesible by bus from train station",
          "You're lucky if you visit it when one of the stuff members will song a few notes to show you how amazing is the acustic of the place.",
          "Beautiful building, but the best part was listening to the guard sing, so we could admire the acoustics of the building.",
          "Intricately carved marble figures adorn this beautiful building. Next to the cathedral and the leaning tower, this is a must when visiting Pisa. I stopped over for a couple of hours en route to Bologna. The main attractions in Pisa are closely located, so it's easy to visit",
          "This is another one of the buildings near the leaning tower. It is constructed in marble to match the nearby cathedral but in the relatively cavernous interior it has very little decoration. Very well worth seeing as part of all the buildings on this site.",
          "This is also a must visit venue. The acoustics are fantastic and if you climb the many steps to the upper level you will not only have a great view of the interior of the building but a brilliant view of the west door of the cathedral. definitely a must do",
          "This is a very ornate & impressive dome, situated next to the leaning tower. When we visited the area was very busy due to an historic Ferrari tour rally being parked next to it.",
          "When visiting Pisa we were delighted to include a visit to the historic Battistero Classic and historic Hope to return soon",
          "This building is quite simple inside but it has an amazing acoustic. We just missed a demonstration which seem to happen randomly. We also climbed to the second level. A surprisingly steep climb though. It gives a completely different perspective.",
          "This building is located in the Pisa Tower area. Very gorgeous architecture outside, inside is not so attractive.",
          "If you come to Pisa- then there are a number of monuments or buildings you absolutely must visit, this is without a doubt one of them. When you think that this was built in 1152 it's absolutely amazing when you look at the quality of workmanship, the architecture etc. companies",
          "The exterior of the Baptistery in Pisa is in keeping with the rest of the \"field of miracles\" and so is attractive and has some interesting and beautiful detail when you get up close. This is both a strength and also a weakness in that it does mean that the interior itself comes",
          "This was opposite the cathedral and it was nice to look around and take a view of the Torre di Pisa. This is a 15/20 minute attraction - but worth going in.",
          "So much to see at this location. Don't miss it. It's walkable, and on a beautiful day, it is just so stunning.",
          "The Architecture of this is outstanding! This whole area is quite beautiful and worth the time to visit. The area can be crowded and tough to get some outstanding pictures so patience is required. Enjoy It!",
          "It is a beautiful building next to Cathedral and the Leaning Tower of Pisa. The most wonderful aspect of this building is, all the structure including huge Dome is standing on the Walls, a beautiful structure from inside and out, and the ground next to it is a wonderful place to",
          "The baptistery is not anywhere near a big as the cathedral but that doesn't stop it from being a stunning building in its own right. The view from the upper floor down inside the building is great and it's even better looking out towards the cathedral with the leaning tower in",
          "The acoustics in the baptistry are our of this world. Listening to someone sing and as the sound echos going up inside the building it sounds like it is changing chords. Beautiful architecture. Well worth going to see.",
          "Iconic building on the Piazza adjacent to the cathedral. Stunning external architecture but disappointing, empty and plain within. Some good views from the upper deck of the square and the distant mountains.",
          "Stunning exterior is well worth admiring in detail. Look especially for the reliefs over the portal illustrating scenes from the story of St. John the Baptist. Interior is impressive in a very different manner, with fewer details and a focus on the baptismal font and its statue",
          "This was an interesting site, made more interesting by the short Rick Steve's audio file that we downloaded for free before going. We were lucky enough to be there on the half hour when a security guard went to the center of the baptistry and demonstrated its amazing acoustics",
          "Lovely place to see inside and out, all part of the ticket for the tower and cathedral, it's a lovely spot with nice manicured lawns, a must see whilst there.",
          "Went to visit the tower and the baptistery. The queue was quite long so just enjoyed the grandness from the outside while having a picnic on the grass. Well worth the relaxing time.",
          "The baptistry is a classic example of Pisan Romanesque, and has amazing acoustics. Really worth a visit if you have the time.",
          "An unusual round baptistry in which Galileo Galilei was baptised. The nominal cost to visit the Battistero and the Duomo represents great value for money...going with a guide is certainly useful. The baptistry though started in 1152 was not completed until it was remodelled by",
          "Great Italian architecture, sad that others couldn't realise the enormity of engineering to provide such an interesting building. We were even treated to the dulcit tones of a security person to let us hear how the echoes work in the dome.",
          "Exterior looks great. Interior is really not that exciting. After visiting the one in Florence, it's seemed like a let down",
          "Our visit to this wonderful building was enhanced by the fact that as we entered a choir was singing, and it was exquisite,their voices soaring into that beautiful, lofty dome. Clearly no one can guarantee such an addition to their visit but it is a truly lovely place with a",
          "Needs a minimum of 15 minutes to visit. Stairs to the second floor are somewhat steep but manageable. The acoustics is incredible! Heard a tour guide (I think) testing out the acoustics and it was beautiful.",
          "Wonderful site to see and considering how long its been there it looks great! We cam to visit and have lunch here and we enjoyed ourselves. I think the lawn was one of my favorite aspects of it.",
          "Beautiful & stunning architectural viewing inside and. Outside, a. Great place to unwind. Great pictorial opportunities",
          "This is well worth a visit. It is not as gilded or fancy as the one in Florence, but it is quite remarkable, and the baptismal font is beautiful. Definitely go up onto the upper level for a full sense of the amazing space of the Baptistry. If you can, stick around for one of",
          "The Tower is the headline but the Baptistry is the star. What a building. What architecture and colour. A quiet contemplative space after the hubbub of the Piazza !",
          "There\u2019s not much to this, we spent maybe 15 minutes inside, and that included going up to the second level. Every thirty minutes an attendant demonstrates the acoustics, which was interesting to hear. If you\u2019re in the area to climb the tower, it\u2019s worthy a pop-in, but do not",
          "After the stunning architecture of the Duomo , we were a little disappointed as there did not seem much to admire or marvel at. You have to pay and get a ticket to visit whilst the Duomo is free and is much more impressive",
          "This was a touching place. We enjoyed the walk up to the second and received a special treat when we arrived. A gentleman came and sang a song that echoed thru the room. It was a wonderful experience.",
          "The baptistry had been described to me as beautiful but the external is actually the most beautiful thing about it. The baptistry of Il Duomo in Florence is a much more beautiful and spiritual place to visit.",
          "This is a beautiful building with a fairly simple interior. Pick up a guide book that can explain the art inside to you. Make sure you visit on the hour or half hour when a guard will come to the center of the baptistry and demonstrate the amazing acoustics. Our guard was able",
          "This is a place where they baptise you. It is huge and with lots of carvings to see. Near the church and the cemetery. First thing you see, as you enter the area.",
          "This is one of the beautiful buildings in the Piazza dei Miracoli in Pisa along with the Duomo and the leaning tower, Its construction dates back to the 12th century and is the largest baptistery in Italy. Inside it is quite plain with only a little bit of decoration.",
          "its at the same location of the TOWER of PISA, right in front. good camera here gives you some really nice pictures :)",
          "We found this, along with the other attractions in Pisa to be a bit of a waste of money. You pay to enter but then have to pay extra to learn about what you are looking at - no plaques etc but a chargeable audio machine. It was lovely but (maybe as we had just come from",
          "The Baptistery is an awe-inspiring building It is circular with phenomenal acoustics Great view from upper gallery",
          "This baptistery is beautiful and serene. The building has fantastic acoustics. Of course you can't talk or sing out loud, but every thirty minutes an attendant will sing a few notes for you. The sound is amazing. It's where Galileo Galilei was baptized. You can see his the font",
          "This is a beautiful baptistery, more ornate on the outside. The inside is rather plain but interesting nonetheless. Once an hour someone comes out and \"sings\" to give the audience a brief demonstration on how sounds travel inside this cylinder. Construction of this building goes",
          "Stopping by the Leaning Tower? Well you'll walk past the Battistero to get to the Tower so stop look and take pictures. You won't regret it!",
          "the acoustics, the artwork, the architecture are all excellent. A great work of art. Not to be missed when in Pisa",
          "Worth being there 'on the hour' for demonstration of acoustics; then climb stairs to gallery for great view of Duomo front. Great lit up in evening and crowds gone",
          "If you're already here then why not spend 20 minutes wandering around the baptistery? You'll notice the much cooler temperatures inside and be greeted with the open expanse of the interior. There are listening guide machines (2 euro) which provides you with the background",
          "It is a Romanesque building and I fall immediately with its rustic roof. I did not go inside but I spent a great deal of hours outside laid down on my back and enjoying the Batistry's scenery with bluest sky as a background.",
          "Kind of plain after visiting the Duomo, but worth at least one visit just to say you have been there. The ceiling is interesting.",
          "It is a small building and it is mostly empty without any special decorations inside, although as part of the sightseeing in Pisa it is recommended. There are some stairs to reach the upper floor which might be challenging to some. Relatively peaceful compared to the crowds",
          "Worth going in.Supposed to be silence but someone with a beautiful voice brought the sound to life.Make the effort to climb the stairs to the mid floor",
          "You start off by going onto the ground floor which is pretty large with a couple of areas for people to sit, then you are lead up by some narrow stairs to the top floor where you can look out of the windows to see fantastic scenery and a good photo shoot places then you look",
          "There isn't much more to say about the Battistero other than it is just beautiful. It is not something you can easily describe - you have to experience it yourself. It is so stunning and impressive from the outside and has a profound peace inside, particularly if you hear the",
          "An amazing building & we are so lucky to be able to enter & see such an ancient site. It was particularly spectacular to climb up inside & see the inside the better, & this also offered a (restricted) view of the Duomo.",
          "The exterior architecture was stunning expecting the same inside which it was very dull. Climbed to the top where you can look at the other monuments and took my breath away at the scenic beauty. Picture perfect.",
          "The tower is great and a must see, but the Duomo and Battistero are the hidden gems. Take the time see both, it's worth it.",
          "With such a beautiful fa\u00e7ade I was expecting an extraordinary interior. However I was completely disappointed with it.",
          "Been there after the visit to the tower and the Cathedral Nothing superb but if you are there, worth a visit",
          "A baptistry - but not just your average church font! This building is 100% baptistry - nothing else. Massive font with full immersion possible beneath an amazing dome. Which you can climb inside for great views over Pisa",
          "Adored this building and spent a lot of my time photographing it together with the Leaning Tower. A must-see, particularly if you have an interest in the spectacular details of its breathtaking architecture/design.",
          "This building might not be on the tip of everyone's tongues when thinking of Pisa, but is absolutely amazing. Walking into it, you cannot fail to be amazed by the scale of the dome. The acoustics inside are incredible, perhaps you'll be fortunate enough to hear some chanting",
          "As part of a multi site ticket we went to see this. Quite a piece of architecture with a beautiful backdrop.",
          "My husband and I went to the leaning tower and the Basicilla we enjoyed everything the pisa had to offer well worth the trip if you are in the area",
          "When I climbed the stairs to the balcony of the Baptistery I was the only one in this marvelous place besides two chit-chatting guards. Therefore, I disregarded the signage and broke into song, imagining that the acoustics would be amazing. I was not disappointed so the tourists",
          "Our small group of cruise ship passengers has been herded to Italy\u2019s largest Baptistery (Battistero di San Giovanni) in Pisa. We are told construction began in the Romanesque style under Diotisalvi in 1153. Nicola and Giovanni Pisano gave the upper part a Gothic transformation",
          "Don't miss it during your visit to the Leaning Tower. Different from the Tower because it is still upright. But the architecture and design on the outside of the building are magnificent. Spend some time walking around the outside and you will not be disappointed. Inside, it",
          "We had booked tickets online for the Tower and were waiting for our time slot, in the meantime we visited Battistero di San Giovanni, so glad we did. It is a beautiful piece of architecture, full of arches and columns, with a stunning amount of detail. There is not a great",
          "Looking afar, this may look like just another building. However, looking closer, you can observe the sheer beauty and intricacies of the sculptures surrounding the building.",
          "Seen this site as part of out your to see the Leaning Tower. The Baptistery is dedicated to St. John the Baptist, it's construction began in 1152 and was not completed until 1363, so total construction time is 211 years. The crowds here a crazy, it is a very busy place. A very",
          "We bought tickets here and were a bit surprised to see that it's pretty much an empty dome. Of course if we knew anything about babtisteries beforehand, we wouldn't have, but this was our first visit to one so it was certainly interesting. Absolutely great place to take a photo",
          "Need to buy a ticket from the information centre and worth the visit. Maker sure you go up the stairs to view from the balcony",
          "I lay down on the grass and just chilled out right infront of this at night. The pictures don't do it any justice, its absolutely incredible to see with your own eyes and touch with your own hands. Marvellous works of art.",
          "Mentally, one should try to replace the 21st century throngs in Pisa by their medieval equivalent, sans cameras of course. These are awe-inspiring structures designed by creative architects and built by determined people. Look and marvel at the details, and try to imagine how",
          "The second building near the Duomo di Pisa and very nice building. I could imagine its meaning in the history.",
          "Not sure whether there is a pre-planned time but got lucky when the guy on the door comes in and 'sings' for amazing acoustic effect. Also look out for dog in (East side) stained glass window",
          "The building is beautiful from the outside, but from inside it's very empty. The echo is definitely quite amazing in there.",
          "If you are at Pisa, you must see that Battistero. It's just next to Pisa leaning tower. Has a great historical structure. If you are on visit, please visit Pisa and all around.",
          "Yes, everyone knows the leaning tower, but the Battistero is actually the most beautiful building in the Square of Miracles. The exterior is breathtaking and while the interior is a little more stark, the scale is unbelievable. Definitely make a climb up to the dome as the",
          "This stunning Battistero next to the Duomo and The Campanile (The Leaning Tower) complements them perfectly and the three of them together in the beautiful setting of the enclosed garden is idyllic. It is beautifully made and decorated, both on the inside and the outside, don't",
          "The acoustics in the Battistero are amazing. Every half hour an employee would demonstrate how the sound traveled so perfectly. if you climb the stone stairs you can walk completely around the balcony and get a great view of the Duomo. The Leaning Tower and the Duomo are right",
          "After having visited the magnificent Baptistry in Florence we were hopeful this would also prove to be worth the price of admission. Regrettably the real beauty is on the exterior of the building. Inside the large baptismal font and altar are impressive but we would not have",
          "Wonderful outside and in, if historic architecture is your thing. Upstairs also gives a great view back to the cathedral and leaning tower through one of the small windows. Whilst we were there were treated to a demonstration of the acoustic properties of the dome by a young",
          "This building is amazing! The architecture is really something to see even if just from the outside. We were there in October and it was crowded so I can imagine what it would be like in the Summer.",
          "Maybe not so famous as the tower, this Romanesque and Gothic building is wonderful. Not forget to admire the pulpit by Nicola Pisano, masterpiece of the late gothic sculpture.",
          "This was an amazing place and beautifully presented and restored. We enjoyed the ticket inspector who stood in a certain place in the Baptistry & sang towards the roof producing an amazing echo. Make sure you coincide with this activity!",
          "The batispher is as beautiful in the interior as in the exterior ! From Inside you can have a nice view to the catherdrale.",
          "When you d3cide to go to bisit pisa tower you have to visit it.it is just located next to tower.and it is also beautiful",

      "text": {
        "wiki": "Keith Allen Haring (May 4, 1958 \u2013 February 16, 1990) was an American artist whose pop art and graffiti-like work grew out of the New York City street culture of the 1980s. Much of his work includes sexual allusions that turned into social activism. He achieved this by using sexual images to advocate for safe sex and AIDS awareness.Haring's work grew to popularity from his spontaneous drawings in New York City subways\u2014chalk outlines of figures, dogs, and other stylized images on blank black advertising-space backgrounds. After public recognition he created larger scale works, such as colorful murals, many of them commissioned. His imagery has \"become a widely recognized visual language\". His later work often addressed political and societal themes\u2014especially homosexuality and AIDS\u2014through his own iconography.Haring died on February 16, 1990, of AIDS-related complications. In 2014 Haring was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco\u2019s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields.\" In June 2019, Haring was one of the inaugural fifty American \"pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\" inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City's Stonewall Inn.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\n\nKeith Haring was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, on May 4, 1958. He was raised in Kutztown, Pennsylvania, by his mother, Joan Haring, and father, Allen Haring, an engineer and amateur cartoonist. Keith attended Kutztown Area High School and graduated in 1976. His family attended the United Church of God. He had three younger sisters, Kay, Karen, and Kristen. He became interested in art at a very young age, spending time with his father producing creative drawings. His early influences included Walt Disney cartoons, Dr. Seuss, Charles Schulz, and the Looney Tunes characters in The Bugs Bunny Show.In his early teenage years, Haring was involved with the Jesus Movement. Later, he hitchhiked across the country, while selling T-shirts that he made featuring the Grateful Dead and anti-Nixon shirts. He studied commercial art from 1976 to 1978 at Pittsburgh's Ivy School of Professional Art, but eventually lost interest. He was inspired to focus on his own art after reading The Art Spirit (1923) by Robert Henri. This influenced his decision to leave the Ivy School after two semesters.Haring had a maintenance job at the Pittsburgh Center for the Arts and was able to explore the art of Jean Dubuffet, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Tobey. He was highly influenced around this time by a 1977 retrospective of Pierre Alechinsky's work and by a lecture that the sculptor Christo gave in 1978. From Alechinsky's work, he felt encouraged to create large images that featured writing and characters. From Christo, Haring was introduced to ways of incorporating the public into his art. His first important one-man exhibition was in Pittsburgh at the Center for the Arts in 1978.Haring moved to New York in 1978 to study painting at the School of Visual Arts. He also worked as a busboy during this time at the nightclub Danceteria. While attending school he studied semiotics with Bill Beckley and experimented with video and performance art. Haring was also highly influenced in his art, by author William Burroughs.\n\n\n== Career ==\n\n\n=== Early work (up to 1981) ===\nHaring first received public attention with his graffiti art in subways where he created white chalk drawings on a black, unused advertisement backboard in the stations. He considered the subways to be his \"laboratory\", a place where he could experiment and create his artwork and saw the black advertisement paper as a free space and \"the perfect place to draw\". Starting in 1980, he organized exhibitions at Club 57, a gallery that hosted performances and exhibitions from emerging artists, which were filmed by the photographer Tseng Kwong Chi. Around this time, \"The Radiant Baby\", a crawling infant with emitting rays of light, became his most recognized symbol. He used it as his tag to sign his work while a subway artist. His images were primarily composed of solid, bold lines with vibrant colors.Symbols and images (such as barking dogs, flying saucers, and large hearts) became common in his work and iconography. The writings of Burroughs and Brion Gysin inspired his work with lettering and words. In 1980, he created headlines from word juxtaposition and attached hundreds to lamp-posts around Manhattan. These included phrases like \"REAGAN SLAIN BY HERO COP\" and \"POPE KILLED FOR FREED HOSTAGE\" among others. \nThat same year, in one of his earliest public projects, Haring altered a banner advertisement above a subway entrance in Times Square that showed a female embracing a male's legs, blacking-out the first letter so that it essentially read \"hardon\" instead of \"Chard\u00f3n\", a French clothing brand (pictured here). He later used other forms of commercial material to spread his work and messages. This included mass producing buttons and magnets to hand out and working on top of subway ads.In 1981, he sketched his first chalk drawings on black paper and painted plastic, metal, and found objects. Haring would buy materials from hardware stores to use, such as tarpaulin or muslin, and he would utilize any medium that could provide a proper context for his work and/or could hold the marks. As a result, Haring's works spread quickly and he became exceedingly more recognizable. He used his imagery during the last years of his life to speak about his illness and to generate activism and awareness about AIDS.\n\nIn December 2007, an area of the American Textile Building in the TriBeCa neighborhood of New York City was discovered to contain a Haring painting from 1979.\n\n\n=== International breakthrough (1982) and rise to fame ===\n\n1982 was an important year for Haring. He was featured in Documenta (Germany) and the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennale (Brazil). In October 1982, he had his first exclusive exhibition in the Tony Shafrazi Gallery with artist LA II. He was in several group exhibitions including Fast at Alexander Milliken Gallery in New York City which included Jean Michel Basquiat.He created more than 50 public works between 1982 and 1989 in dozens of cities around the world. He often used lines to show energy and movement. One of his early works, \"Untitled\", in 1982 depicts two figures with a radiant heart-love motif, which critics have interpreted as a boldness in homosexual love and a significant cultural statement.In the following years, Haring traveled in many countries for exhibitions and public projects in Europe, America and Asia.Throughout the 1980s, Haring made art for a variety of sources, nightclubs and discotheques, such as the Palladium in Manhattan, MTV set decorations, a backdrop for the Philadelphia stage of the iconic 1985 Live Aid concerts for world hunger, walls on the Lower East Side, and props for various dance works. His works also included murals for the CAPC Mus\u00e9e d'Art Contemporain de Bordeaux, the Children's Hospital in Washington, D.C., and the Necker Children's Hospital in Paris.In 1984, Haring visited Australia and painted murals in Melbourne (such as the 1984 'Detail-Mural at Collingwood College, Victoria') and Sydney, and received a commission from the National Gallery of Victoria and the Australian Centre for Contemporary Art to create a mural which temporarily replaced the water curtain at the National Gallery. He also visited and painted in Rio de Janeiro, the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, the Whitney, Minneapolis and Manhattan. He continued to be politically active, designing a Free South Africa poster in 1985 and in the same year, worked on his project, Citykids Speak on Liberty which involved 1000 children. In spring 1986, he had his first solo museum exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, where he also painted a mural on the museum's then-storage facility. In 1986, Haring was asked by the Checkpoint Charlie Museum to create a mural on the Berlin Wall. The mural was 300 meters long and depicted red and black interlocking human figures against a yellow background. The colors were a representation of the German flag and symbolized the hope of unity between East and West Germany.Haring also created public murals in the lobby and ambulatory care department of Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center on Flushing Avenue, Brooklyn.Haring collaborated with Grace Jones, whom he had met through Andy Warhol. In 1985, Haring and Jones worked together on Jones's two live performances at the Paradise Garage, which Robert Farris Thompson has called an \"epicenter for black dance\". Each time, Haring covered Jones' body with graffiti. Haring also collaborated with David Spada, a jewelry designer, to design the sculptural adornments for Jones. He also collaborated with fashion designers Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren on their A/W 1983/84 Witches collection, with his artwork covering the clothing which was most famously worn by a pink-wigged Madonna for a performance of her song \"Like a Virgin\" on the British pop-music program Top of the Pops and the American TV dance program Solid Gold.\n\n\n=== Pop Shop 1986 ===\n\nIn April 1986, Pop Shop was opened in Soho and made Haring's work readily accessible to purchase at reasonable prices, though he was highly criticized for the commercialization of his work. Shirts, posters, and other items showing his work was sold there. The Pop Shop remained open after Haring's death and profits go to the Keith Haring Foundation.\nI could earn more money if I just painted a few things and jacked up the price. My shop is an extension of what I was doing in the subway stations, breaking down the barriers between high and low art. \nCommercialization allowed Haring's art to be easier and more affordable to own. Throughout his career, Haring made his art widely available through the location of his subway art and art on billboards, as well as through the Pop Shop. His attempts to make his work relatable and accessible to a wide audience can also be seen in his figures not having discernable ages, races, or identities. By the arrival of Pop Shop, his work began reflecting more socio-political themes, such as anti-Apartheid, AIDS awareness, and the crack cocaine epidemic. In 1987, he had his own exhibitions in Helsinki, Antwerp, and elsewhere. He also designed the cover for the benefit album A Very Special Christmas. In 1988, he joined a select group of artists whose work has appeared on the label of Chateau Mouton Rothschild wine.His \"Crack is Wack\" mural, created in 1986, is visible from New York's FDR Drive. It was originally considered as vandalism by the New York Police Department and Haring was arrested. But after local media outlets picked up the story, Haring was released on a lesser charge. While in jail, Haring's original work was vandalized. This mural is an example of Haring's use of consciousness raising rather than consumerism, \"Crack is Wack\" rather than \"Coke is it.\" He later made an updated version of the mural on the same wall. In 1989, he criticized the avoidance of social issues such as AIDS through a piece called \"Rebel with Many Causes\" that revolves around a theme of \"hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil\". A rare video of Haring at work demonstrates his energetic style. In his journal, in 1978, he wrote: \"I am becoming much more aware of movement. The importance of movement is intensified when a painting becomes a performance. The performance (the act of painting) becomes as important as the resulting painting.\" Haring would often work quickly, trying to create as much work as possible\u2014sometimes completing as many as 40 paintings in a day.\n\n\n=== Final years ===\nWhen Haring's friend Jean-Michel Basquiat died of a drug overdose in New York in 1988, he paid homage to him with his work A Pile of Crowns, for Jean-Michel Basquiat.Haring was openly gay and used his work to advocate for safe sex. In 1988, he was diagnosed with HIV.From 1982 to 1989, he was featured in more than 100 solo and group exhibitions and produced more than 50 public artworks in dozens of charities, hospitals, day care centers, and orphanages. He used his imagery during the last years of his life to speak about his illness and to generate activism and awareness about AIDS. In 1989, he was invited by the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center to join a show of site-specific artwork for the building at 208 West 13th Street. He chose the second-floor men's room for his mural Once Upon a Time. In June, on the rear wall of the convent of the Church of Sant'Antonio (Italian: Chiesa di Sant'Antonio abate) in Pisa, he painted the last public work of his life, the mural \"Tuttomondo\" (translation: \"All world\"). He died in 1990 at the age of 31.\n\n\n=== Friendships ===\nIn the early eighties Haring had established friendships with fellow emerging artists Futura 2000, Kenny Scharf, Madonna, and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Haring and graffiti artist Angel \"LA II\" Oritz collaborated in producing a T-shirt design for friends Willi Smith and Laurie Mallet\u2019s clothing label WilliWear Productions in 1984. He later became friends with Grace Jones, Yoko Ono, James Rosenquist, Niki de St Phalle, Jean Tinguely and Claude Picasso.Andy Warhol, who befriended him in 1983, was the theme of several of his pieces, including \"Andy Mouse\". His friendship with Warhol would prove to be a decisive element in his eventual success. \"I met (Warhol) finally through (photographer] Christopher Makos, who brought me to the Factory. At first, Andy was very distant. It was difficult for him to be comfortable with people if he didn\u2019t know them. Then he came to another exhibition at the Fun Gallery (February 1983), which was soon after the show at Shafrazi (October 1982). He was more friendly. We started talking, going out. We traded a lot of works at that time. Andy Warhol mentions in his diaries going to the closing party on November 13, 1982, of the exhibition at Shafrazi.\n\n\n== Death ==\nHaring died on February 16, 1990, of AIDS-related complications. He is among those commemorated in the AIDS Memorial Quilt. As a celebration of his life, Madonna declared that the first New York date of her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour would be a benefit concert for Haring's memory and donated all proceeds from her ticket sales to AIDS charities including AIDS Project Los Angeles and amfAR; the act was documented in her film Madonna: Truth or Dare. Additionally, his work was featured in several of Red Hot Organization's efforts to raise money for AIDS and AIDS awareness, specifically its first two albums, Red Hot + Blue and Red Hot + Dance, the latter of which used Haring's work on its cover. His art remains on display worldwide.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn 2014 Haring was one of the inaugural honorees in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco\u2019s Castro neighborhood noting LGBTQ people who have \"made significant contributions in their fields.\"In June 2019, Haring was one of the inaugural fifty American \"pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\" inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City's Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history, and the wall's unveiling was timed to take place during the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.\n\n\n=== The Keith Haring Foundation ===\nIn 1989, Haring established the Keith Haring Foundation to provide funding and imagery to AIDS organizations and children's programs. The foundation's stated goal is to keep his wishes and expand his legacy by providing grants and funding to non-profit organizations that educate disadvantaged youths and inform the public about HIV and AIDS. It also shares his work and contains information about his life. The foundation also supports arts and educational institutions by funding exhibitions, educational programs, and publications.\n\n\n== Influences ==\nHaring's work demonstrates political and personal influences. References to his sexual orientation are apparent throughout his work, and his journals confirm its impact on his work. There are symbolic allusions to the AIDS epidemic in some of his later pieces, such as Untitled (cat. no. 27), Silence=Death and his sketch Weeping Woman. In some of his works\u2014including cat. no. 27\u2014the symbolism is subtle, but he also produced some blatantly activist works. Silence=Death, which mirrors the ACT UP poster and uses its motto, is almost universally agreed upon as a work of HIV/AIDS activism.Haring's use of commercial brands and flat, bold colors demonstrate the influence of Pop Art on his work.Haring was influenced by fellow artists, including Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Frank Stella, and Roy Lichtenstein.In some of his art he drew connections between the end of the world and the AIDS virus. In a piece that he made with William Burroughs, he depicts the virus as demon-like creatures, the number 666, and a mushroom cloud.Haring's proximity to the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island had a large impact on him. His fear of nuclear disaster started to appear in his art. An example of this is a black and white striped flag that he said symbolized the danger of a nuclear apocalypse.Haring was deeply influenced by the Jesus Movement as a youth, and it continued to play a role in his art for his entire career. The movement was an extremely evangelical, loosely organized, diverse group of Christians. They were known for their anti-materialism and anti-establishment beliefs, focus on the Last Judgement, and their compassionate treatment of the poor. As a young teenager, Haring became very involved in the movement. Religious symbols started to be incorporated into his drawings around that age as well as Jesus Movement sentiments. This includes anti-church establishment views that can be seen in some of his later work. Though his time as a \"Jesus Person\" did not last beyond his teenage years, religious images, symbols, and references continued to appear in his art. In an interview near the end of his life he commented, \"[All] that stuff stuck in my head and even now there are lots of religious images in my work. Some people even think my work is by a religious fanatic or maniac.\"When he was a subway artist, Haring used a tag to sign his work. His tag (the Radiant Child) depicts a baby with lines radiating out of it, alluding to the Christ child. He continued to make images depicting the Christ child, including Nativity scenes in his characteristic style during his time as a subway artist. His last pieces were two religious triptychs; both went to Episcopal cathedrals. In them he illustrates the Last Judgement, though who is being saved in the pieces is ambiguous.\n\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nHaring contributed to the New York New Wave display in 1981 and in 1982, had his first exclusive exhibition in the Tony Shafrazi Gallery. That same year, he took part in Documenta 7 in Kassel, Germany, as well as Public Art Fund's \"Messages to the Public\" in which he created work for a Spectacolor Board in Times Square. He contributed work to the Whitney Biennial in 1983, as well as in the S\u00e3o Paulo Biennial. In 1985, the CAPC in Bordeaux opened an exhibition of his works, and he took part in the Paris Biennial.During his lifetime, Haring had over 50 one person shows, and, since his death, has been featured in over 150 exhibitions around the world.Haring has been the subject of several international retrospectives. His art was the subject of a 1997 retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York, curated by Elisabeth Sussman. In 1996, a retrospective at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia was the first major exhibition of his work in Australia. In 2008 there was a retrospective exhibition at the MAC in Lyon, France. In February 2010, on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Haring's death, Tony Shafrazi Gallery showed an exhibition containing dozens of works from every stage of Haring's career. In March 2012, a retrospective exhibit of his work, Keith Haring: 1978\u20131982, opened at the Brooklyn Museum in New York. In April 2013, Keith Haring: The Political Line opened at the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris and Le Cent Quatre In November 2014, then at the De Young Museum in San Francisco. His work was exhibited in 2019 at Gladstone Gallery in Belgium.The first major UK exhibition of Haring\u2019s work, featuring more than 85 artworks, was at Tate Liverpool from June 14 until November 10, 2019.\n\n\n== Collections ==\nHaring's work is in major private and public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Morgan Library and Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Art Institute of Chicago; the Bass Museum in Miami; Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; the Brant Foundation Art Study Center in Greenwich, Connecticut; the Carnegie Museum of Art and the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh; the Ludwig Museum in Cologne; and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. He also created a wide variety of public works, including the infirmary at Children's Village in Dobbs Ferry, New York, and the second floor men's room in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center in Manhattan, which was later transformed into an office and is known as the Keith Haring Room. In January 2019 an exhibit called \"Keith Haring's New York\" opened at New York Law School in the main building of its Tribeca campus.The Nakamura Keith Haring collection, established in 2007 in Hokuto, Yamanashi, Japan, is an art museum exhibiting exclusively the artworks of Haring.\n\n\n== Art market ==\nHaring created the Pop Shop in 1986 SoHo district of Manhattan, selling T-shirts, toys, posters, and other objects that show his works\u2014allowing his works to be accessible to a larger number of people.\nHaring was represented until his death by art dealer Tony Shafrazi. Since his death in 1990, his estate has been administered by the Keith Haring Foundation and the Pop Shop. The foundation has a two-fold mission of supporting educational opportunities for underprivileged children and financing AIDS research and patient care. The foundation is represented by Gladstone Gallery.\n\n\n=== Authentication issues ===\nThere is no catalogue raisonn\u00e9 for Haring; however, there is copious information about him available on the estate's website and elsewhere, enabling prospective buyers or sellers to research exhibition history. In 2012, the Keith Haring Foundation disbanded its authentication board; that same year, it donated $1 million to support exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art and $1 million to Planned Parenthood of New York City's Project Street Beat. A 2014 lawsuit, filed by a group of nine art collectors at the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, argued that the foundation's actions have \"limited the number of Haring works in the public domain, thereby increasing the value of the Haring works that the foundation and its members own or sell.\"\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nHaring is the subject of a composition, Haring at the Exhibition, written and performed by Italian composer Lorenzo Ferrero in collaboration with DJ Nicola Guiducci. The work combines excerpts from popular chart music of the 1980s with samples of classical music compositions by Lorenzo Ferrero and synthesized sounds. It was featured at \"The Keith Haring Show\", an exhibition which took place in 2005 at the Triennale di Milano.\nIn 2006, he was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of LGBT History Month.In 2008, filmmaker Christina Clausen released the documentary The Universe of Keith Haring. In the film, his legacy is \"resurrected through colorful archival footage and remembered by friends and admirers such as artists Kenny Scharf and Yoko Ono, gallery owners Jeffrey Deitch and Tony Shafrazi, and the choreographer Bill T. Jones\".Madonna, who was friends with Haring during the 1980s, used his art as animated backdrops for her 2008/2009 Sticky and Sweet Tour. The animation is standard Haring, featuring his trademark blocky figures dancing in beat to an updated remix of \"Into the Groove\".Keith Haring: Double Retrospect is a monster sized jigsaw puzzle by Ravensburger measuring in at 17 by 6 feet (5.2 by 1.8 m) with 32,256 pieces, breaking Guinness Book of World Records for the largest puzzle ever made. The puzzle uses 32 pieces of his work and weighs 42 pounds (19 kg).On May 4, 2012, on what would have been Haring's 54th birthday, Google honored him in a Google Doodle.Haring created numerous public artworks with social messages, including the iconic image of a mother and child chosen to appear on the first A Very Special Christmas album benefitting Special Olympics in 1987. Through the decades, this image has graced subsequent albums in the collection, which has become the most successful benefit series in music history. The iconic image for the A Very Special Christmas compilation album consists of a typical Haring figure holding a baby. Its \"Jesus iconography\" is considered unusual in modern rock holiday albums.Haring had a balloon in tribute to him at the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.Tim Finn wrote the song \"Hit The Ground Running\", on his album Before & After, in memory of Haring.In 2017, his sister Kay Haring wrote a children's book, Keith Haring: The Boy Who Just Kept Drawing, which ranked among the top ten sellers every week for over a year in the Amazon category of Children's Art History.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLGBT culture in New York City\nList of LGBTQ people from New York City\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nReading Public Museum, Keith Haring: Journey of the Radiant Baby, Piermont, New Hampshire : Bunker Hill Publishing Co., 2006.

          "For us New Yorkers, it was a lovely surprise to find a Keith Haring artwork in pristine condition in Pisa. Painted in 1989, the colors of the mural are more pastel and softer than the his previous work. There is nice cafe opposite the mural. The location is at the corner of the",

          "We were spending the night in Pisa so wanted to catch a few other things besides the Leaning Tower. This was on our list and since we arrived via train, it was a convenient stop on our way to both our apartment and the tower!",

          "Worth a look if you are in the area, bit not worth making a specific trip to see it. Train station, shops and a nice square near by.",

          "We had decided to try and avoid the tourist trap attractions so did a bit of research and found this smashing piece of art work on a walk. We went twice as each time you study it you see something different. Easy to find, 5 minutes from the railway station and main shopping",
          "As you come out of the station you're greeted with a courtyard which you'll push through to a lazy roundabout which creates another courtyard type space. To the left opposite the pergola you'll see this mural on the wall. The base is lined in glass panels to protect the bottom &",
          "If you\u2019re entering Pisa via train, this mural is located half way between the station and the famous tower, so you will almost certainly walk past it. It\u2019s worth a visit, especially if you\u2019re an art lover.",

          "I like to see 'landmarks' so we made a slight detour between our hotel and Piazza dei Miracoli to see this. It's a big picture on a wall opposite a cafe named after it. Certainly an interesting piece of street art and as I said if you know of the artist probably more exciting. I",

          "We found this online before visiting Pisa but you'd easily miss it as it's slightly off from the main tourist path, located just off from Pisa Centrale station. Reading up on the meanings of the mural while were there helped take in the great artwork. There's also a cafe",

          "We enjoyed viewing the mural, which was attracting quite a lot of attention the day we were there. It was fun to see, and in a very good location, close to the station and the lovely Piazza Victor Emmanuelle. There is a very good cafe just beside it too, selling good food",
          "I belive this is only for true lovers of modern art and Keith Harrington fans. There is a road between painted wall and pavement from where you look at it, so you cant even take a normal picture. Sure it is a great modern art act but for average traveler there is nothing",
          "Nice piece of art! Being close to the train station, it's easy to visit plus no crowds, easy to find. Think is worthy to pass by",

          "I'm not a fan of this type of art, however if you're walking to the field of miracles from the train station this mural is on the way. It's worth a quick stop because it's literally right on the way. maybe grab a photo or two and move along to the field of miracles.",
          "As others have observed, this is a pretty impressive piece of street art, bringing an otherwise plain wall to life. Probably not worth a special trip, but you should certainly make a slight detour to see it if you are travelling from Pisa central station.",
          "If you happen to be close-by, have a look. It occupies a large wall of a building and is beautifully colorful and lively.",

          "Yes the mural is interesting and arty but let's be honest, you want a good time right? Well the cocktail bar opposite this wall has the most amazing cocktails and Aperitvo. Aperitivo, for those who don't know, is when you order an alcoholic drink and then you can pick and choose",
          "Keith Haring's wall mural is colorful and filled with his well known figures that will set your fantasy in swing if you let it. It deserves some time to take it in. There is a cafe opposite the mural and it could be nice to use it as a viewing point.",
          "It's worth a stroll around to see the mural. During the daytime there is a bar directly opposite where you can chill for a little whilst admiring the artwork. It's worth taking the time of a glass of wine or a coffee just to take it all in, as in that time you will then seen",

          "Yjis was a mpst impressive work, and is a nice counterpoint to all the historic buildings on the other swide of the River Arno. It is good to see that the lower parts of the mural are protected by perspex as this is an area with much grafitti...",
          "This has been reviewed as iconic - as if it reveals an inner, deeper truth about the human condition. It isn't and it doesn't. Its not that great at all, it's in the wrong place, its meaning is hardly original nor profound and how this is rated above medieval Basillicas and",

          "It is set out of the tourist path, aside a square. Do not miss it when in Pisa, a great work from Keith Haring.",
          "Well, it is a mural - so....a point of interest maybe. But not overwhelming. We did a detour during a town walk in order to se this. But if you miss it, don't worry!",
          "Let's be honest, I'm not a fan of street art, this mural looks ok, not too big, not too small. There's some cafes opposite, so one can sit down, relax and contemplate modern art.",
          "This is a fun mural by Keith Haring and one of his last works. Its close to the railway station and is not what you expect to see in Pisa.",
          "We went out of our way, and away from the crowds, to find this wall art. It's very colourful and a piece that I recognised. We did not stop at the cafe but it looked nice.",
          "Really beautiful mural by the famous artist in Pisa, so much more enjoyable since the road is quiet and closed to traffic, there is a bar just in front where you could sit, children amusement, and other bars and shops nearby.",
          "This is a nice wall to look at and the cafe seemed nice, too. Plus it makes you walk through the city which is much nicer than the area around the tower, Pisa is absolutely worth walking through!",
          "I'm don't really like Graffiti unless it is done well and actually a piece of art, not just some scribble. This is a piece of art and well done. It's very colourful and fun.",

          "There's a Keith Haring caf\u00e9 opposite where you can sit and look at the mural. After we had looked at it for about 15 minutes and nobody had come to serve us, we gave up and left. It's possible that they were horribly busy inside, or that it's a self service place (unusual in",
          "Saw this as we were touring the town. I didn't know about Keith Haring before hand and had to look it up. It's a bit of fun and photos well so go and see it. It is now protected by a glass wall and there is a bar opposite you can sit and look at it.",
          "I put this on my list to visit while in Pisa and at that time I have no idea of Keith Haring. I just randomly put this on my list as it is one of the walkable and possible area to explore with our limited time. It's quite hard to be found but we make it and I am glad that I put",
          "Finally protected by a glass, this Wall really deserves a visit and it is for free as it was conceived. In front of it there is a nice caf\u00e9 dedicated to Keith Hering where you can sit and taste food and drinks.",
          "Great mural from a great artist well kept and nice bar in front of it with a great atmosphere not mentioned in travelguides but this part of the town is much less crowded",
          "I read a few blogs on what to do in Pisa and nothing much came up besides the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Very few mentioned the Keith Haring - Tuttomondo Mural located not to far from the train station. The Tuttomondo Mural was visually stunning compared to all the older building",
          "Came here by accident as we were strolling through Pisa a little bit away from the crowd. Quite big and beautiful from the known Keith Harings. Between 2 piazza in Piazza San Antonio en Piazza V.Emanuel 2.",
          "The exact location of this Keith Haring mural is on the wall of the church of St. Anthony near the Piazza Victor Emanuele II and the train station - look for a few wavy rock like formations embedded into the ground and the mural will be looming right over you. Titled",
          "Another quick thing to do in Pisa! This mural is way bigger than I imagined. So cool to see. Makes for a great picture. Our taxi driver took us by this mural straight from the airport on the way to our accommodation. Pisa isn't a large city.....it's a fun easy stop to be made!",
          "Beautiful Keith Harring's painting in excellent condition. Nice coffee shop in front of the painting allows you to enjoy the painting while having a good coffee.",
          "Easy to take in during the walk from the hotel to the Tower - looking a bit tired , but worth a quick look .",
          "It was easy to see from walking up from the train station. If you like Keith Haring it is worth stopping up on the way to the tower.",
          "This is by far one of the most interesting things you can see in Pisa for free. Unfortunately, lots of people just go straight to the Duomo complex in order to see the Leaning Tower and miss on this great piece of contemporary art coming from the mind of the late Keith Haring.",
          "Much bigger than I thought, easy to find, worth a look when in the area, not far from the train station and Vittorio Emmanuele.",
          "Just off the Main Street running through the center of Pisa we found the impressive mural by Keith Haring. What a wonderful sight. Directly across from the mural is the Keith Haring cafe, so you can sit and contemplate the mural with a good cup of coffee. Don't miss it!",
          "I had no idea that this was here in Pisa! It's an impressive piece of his work and is supported by a nice cafe and gift shop. Worth the walk and take your time to sit and observe 'Tuttomondo' and enjoy it. Highly recommended!",
          "It was quite easy to find (my b&b was just one street away), it is very close to the train station and next to Piazza Vittorio Emanuele. You may have a coffee at the bar in front of the mural and there is a playground next to it! After you can head to the shopping street which",
          "I had read that this mural takes up the whole of one side of a building and is near the station, but I had not expected it to be so difficult to find as there are no signposts or other indications as to its location. So,if like me, you are looking for it, here's how to find it.",
          "this is truly impressing and the area is a refreshing change from the medieval cities you normally visit in Tuscany The otherwise boring side of a house has been turned into something special. the whole area is nice as there is a playground for kids and a new wave bar opposite",
          "A 5 minute walk from the railway station . Stop by to enjoy and appreciate this Murale as you walk into the Pisa shopping street. Quick 2 minute halt and photo oppurtunity.",
          "near the railway station, this is an enjoyable gift of the great American artist to the city of pisa",
          "There isn't much to do in Pisa other than visiting the Tower and the buildings around it. This mural is probably just as exciting as seeing the tower (if you're a fan of modern art). It is free to the public and so easy to find. It's located a few minutes from the train",
          "We kept encountering street art in the medieval streets of Pisa -- very interesting but not the quality one encounters in major urban areas. When we referenced our travel book we discovered that there was a Keith Haring mural near the station so we went in search of it. It was",
          "This was more exciting than the Leaning Tower of Pisa!! It's huge and beautiful, whether you're a fan of Keith's work or not. I just graduated college in Keith's home town so it held a special place in my heart. Definitely a must-see if you're in Pisa and it's so close to",
          "This wall wasn't very far from our hotel so we visited early morning. Nice piece of art near the main shopping street of Pisa",
          "The location for the murial is very nice and you can get some lovely photos. However, I was slightly disappointed with the actual artwork if honest.",
          "I never knew Keith Haring made this painting but I'm glad I found out about it. We we're on the wrong day because the caf\u00e9 was closed though.",
          "Seeing such fun Street art was a real bonus. Some might not like it but it adds a modern touch to a old town.",
          "we where just walking to a bus stop, had no idea to find this in pisa. u can admire it while having a drink in the bar in front of it.",
          "Keith Haring painted this thinking about world peace and harmony. There's a lot of unusual figures and I just couldn't stop looking at it. The cool part, it that although the figures look chaotic, they do fit like their own puzzle.",
          "Easy to access, great modern art for free and no crowds. Sit at the caf\u00e9 in front an enjoy for a while. The level of detail will merit it.",
          "Just walking along . . . and there it is. Huge mural on the side of a building. Centrally located. Famous piece of art by Keith Haring. Well worth a look.",
          "Such a weird site..an entire mural of Keith Haring next to an Italianen square. Have a coffee at Keith's caf\u00e9 opposite of the mural and enjoy the view!",
          "You need to visit the place It's an Amazing painting and a very nice area around with cafes. There is a small cafe bar exactly opposite the painting.",
          "I love just looking at this great mural done by Keith Haring. It's really close to Pisa Centrale and if you arrive via this station just cross the street and walk on over to admire it.",
          "Cool, colorful mural. It's one last thing to get a photo of or in front of before you leave the city via train. There were a few passersby when we were there in late October but it was easy to get a photo of the wall without people in it.",
          "This is so easy to go and see as it is just by the train station, its a lovely piece of work and something a bit different from the usual sight-seeing.",
          "Tourists love taking photos in front of this beautiful mural done by Keith Haring a talented American artist who loved Pisa, and sadly died of Aids in the early years of the disease. There is a themed bar opposite that sells souvenirs.",
          "Just off the main square by the station, Keith Haring's last work offers a nice and contrasting break from the typical (although by no means boring) Tuscan architecture. It is exceptionally well looked after and is worth spending ten minutes letting your eyes wander over this",
          "Totally surreal seeing Keith's last mural! There's a bar/gift shop too (sadly it was closed when we visited). It's super close to the train station too, so as you're walking to the leaning tower it's easy to swing by!",
          "The more time you spend looking at the mural the more you get from it. It is very clever and rewards those that give it more than a passing glimpse. There are some stone benches to admire it from.",
          "Having studied Keith Haring at school, this was pretty cool to see! We were worried because with our busy schedule we could only see it in the evening when dark. However, it was lit very well so we were very pleased! It was bigger than i had imagined and as another reviewer",
          "I enjoyed finding this but once there we didn't stay very long, just looked for a couple of moments as it was late in the evening and we had a very early start. I like how modern it is and the scale was impressive, I guess it could be quite easily over looked but I was glad we",
          "This mural is fairly easy to find on leaving the main train station. It is extremely large and fills the entire wall with its weirdly formed characters. It is worth sitting and contemplating each of the character s to see how they fit in with each other. Unfortunately there",
          "One whole wall paint of famous art. It's great but there is nothing else. So you need only a few minutes to enjoy it.",
          "Very clean surroundings and the mural is kept in great shape. A pleasant coffee shop/store/Haring temple is right across from the wall giving this a very intimate feeling.",
          "The mural is just random colorful figures on a wall near the train station. I didn't think it was anything special. The plaque didn't give much explanation for the mural either and didn't make it stand out as something exceptional.",
          "This is really easy to get to, it's a 3 minute walk from the station, we'd seen it on trip advisor and went to have a look and well worth it, we spent about 2 hours here in the keith cafe which is directly opposite. It's reasonably priced at \u20ac3 for a beer), there is food there",
          "I saw Haring while he was creating it. It was a beautiful experience to see its creation.You can enjoy its view as well as some pictures taken during the creating painintg in nearby Haring cafe. There are very few public works by this artist.",
          "The Mural is actually on the way to the Pisa Centrale Train Station from the Piazza dei Miracoli so it is a very convenient stop on the way. The mural is very thought-provoking. My daughter and I sat against some odd shaped cement seats and pointed out the odd sort of people we",
          "Sounds strange but it's true. On a church's wall (San Antonio Abate) a full wall is covered by original Keith Haring's mural. Enjoy the little figures maybe while drinking a coffee at the bar on the opposite side of the pedestrian area",
          "We have found it by accident, but it was worth it. Looks pretty nice and it's easy to find - you can even see it from the bus (there is a bus stop next it).",
          "Great mural near Garibaldi Piazza, easy to find, very colourful, interesting and worth a look. A different highlight in Pisa.",
          "that somebody allowed a painting by Keith Herring on a Church in the 90's. I love the mix of styles and expression. It is worth!",
          "While visiting Pisa, we went to see that mural. Looks very good. As our hotel was very close to mural, we went there few times to take pictures when no people around.",
          "If you are in Pisa you must visit this painting. It is free and really worthy. You can have a relaxing coffee in the nice bar in front of the murals. You Will have a nice experience!",
          "When I discovered that one of my favorite contemporary street artists came and loved the city of Pisa, I was really excited since Pisa is a beautiful city where the past and modernity overlaps easily. Being close to the train station by only two walks, makes it easy to visit!",
          "Since you are in Pisa, why not drop by? Another attraction, something new to see! I was dead tired after walking all the way through Pisa since morning, but it was still worth it to figure where this mural was. I sat down and had fun analyzing some of the characters for a",
          "we visited pisa in february and had some things in mind to visit during our stay. we missed this one about 2-3 times when we were heading for the train station to take a train to florence/lucca/livorno. yet, we knew it was somewhere on our way - seems it was in a narrow street",
          "Apart from all the beautiful historical sights, Pisa also has a modern sight since 1989: \"Tuttomondo\" by Keith Haring, his latest work before his early death. Keith has made several murals, but they were never everlasting. That's why this mural is so special, because it will",
          "The restaurant that overlooks the murale is very good value so good view while having a beer or glass of wine.Not sure of Haring work very odd but might appeal to someone but not me",
          "We sought out the mural and I loved it, my husband less so, its close to the station so if you're nearby have a look and make up your own mind, and you can always have a coffee at the 'keith cafe' opposite whilst you're deciding",
          "The painting is really nice and you can look at it the easiest way, if you take a coffe in the nice Caf\u00e9 that's vis-a-vie the painting. The stuff is really nice and helpfull, and they also speak a little english or german. You can sit in a semi open terrace and watch people walk",
          "We pass by the mural everyday we were in Pisa. It is in a rather grungy area. It is nice but we've already seen many of Keith Haring's work in California at various locations: in the Art Centre of Design, Pasadena and in the Museum of Modern Art, downtown Los Angeles for",
          "It's a nice mural with a kids playground by Keith. Of you like his works then come around and take some pics and enjoy the mural.",

          "We were group of friends, who went 10 days road trip through all Italy. This was one of our destination to see.... I m still surprising how people like this kind of art, but every-one is different - for me was terrible experience...",
          "As you walk from the train station toward the Field of Miracles just past the first memorial square look to your left for Keith's Bar. Keith's Bar looks directly at this amazing mural. Unexpected and inviting, this Keith Harding mural is a treasure. Take the time to seek",
          "Had no idea this existed. The desk clerk at our hotel recommended it. The images are compelling and thought- provoking. The proximity to a small cafe offers a chance to sit and reflect, way from the hordes at the Tower. Prompted me to learn more about the artist, as well.",
          "Only a few minutes' walk from Pisa central railway station and just off Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II, this wonderful mural so full of vitality, rich in colour, shapes and ideas is well worth looking for whilst in Pisa. And if you haven't come across Keith Haring's work or story",

The name, meaning \"Palace of the Convoy\", derives from the three-year period undertaken by the initiates of the Order for their training, called \"la Carovana\".\nThe fa\u00e7ade is characterized by a complex scheme with sgraffiti representing allegorical figures and zodiacal signs, designed by Vasari himself and sculpted by Tommaso di Battista del Verrocchio and Alessandro Forzori, coupled to busts and marble crests. The current paintings date however to the 19th-20th centuries.\nAmongst the sculptures are the Medici Coat of Arms and that of the Knights, flanked by the allegories of Religion and Justice by Stoldo Lorenzi (1563). The upper gallery of busts of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany (who were all also the Grand Masters of the Order) were added  in the late 16th-early 18th centuries, sculpted by Ridolfo Sirigatti, Pietro Tacca and Giovan Battista Foggini.\nThe double-ramp staircase was remade in 1821. The rear area is a modern addition (1928\u20131930) for the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. Some halls of the interior house 16th-century paintings.\n\n\n== External links ==\nPalazzo della Carovana",

China ==\nThe English word \"palace\" is used to translated the Chinese word \u5bae (pronounced \"g\u014dng\" in Mandarin). This character represents two rooms connected (\u5442), under a roof (\u5b80). Originally the character applied to any residence or mansion, but starting with the Qin Dynasty (3rd century BC) it was used only for the residence of the emperor and members of the imperial family. Chinese palaces are different from post-Renaissance European palaces in the sense that they are not made up of one building only (however big and convoluted the building may be), but are in fact huge spaces surrounded by a wall and containing large separated halls (\u6bbf di\u00e0n) for ceremonies and official business, as well as smaller buildings, galleries, courtyards, gardens, and outbuildings, more like the Roman or Carolingian palatium.\n\n\n=== List of Chinese imperial palaces, in chronological order ===\nXianyang Palace (\u54b8\u967d\u5bae), in (Qin) Xianyang (\u54b8\u967d), now 15 km/9 miles east of modern Xianyang, Shaanxi province: this was the royal palace of the state of Qin before the Chinese unification, and then the palace of the First Emperor when China was unified.\nEpang Palace (\u963f\u623f\u5bae \u2013 probable meaning: \"The Palace on the Hill\"), 20 km/12 miles south of (Qin) Xianyang (\u54b8\u967d), now 15 km/9 miles west of Xi'an (\u897f\u5b89), Shaanxi province: the fabulous imperial palace built by the First Emperor in replacement of Xianyang Palace.\nWeiyang Palace (\u672a\u592e\u5bae \u2013 \"The Endless Palace\"), in (Han) Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), now 7 km/4 miles northeast of downtown Xi'an (\u897f\u5b89), Shaanxi province: imperial palace of the prestigious Western Han Dynasty for two centuries. This is the largest palace ever built on Earth, covering 4.8 km\u00b2 (1,200 acres), which is 6.7 times the size of the current Forbidden City, or 11 times the size of the Vatican City.\nSouthern Palace (\u5357\u5bae) and Northern Palace (\u5317\u5bae), in Luoyang (\u6d1b\u967d), Henan province: imperial palaces of the Eastern Han Dynasty for two centuries, the Southern Palace being used for court hearings and audiences, the Northern Palace being the private residence of the emperor and his concubines.\nTaiji Palace (\u592a\u6975\u5bae \u2013 \"The Palace of the Supreme Ultimate\"), also known as the Western Apartments (\u897f\u5185), in (Tang) Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), now downtown Xi'an (\u897f\u5b89), Shaanxi province: imperial palace during the Sui Dynasty (who called it Daxing Palace \u2013 \u5927\u8208\u5bae) and in the beginning of the Tang Dynasty (until A.D. 663). Area: 4.2 km\u00b2 (1,040 acres), imperial section proper: 1.92 km\u00b2 (474 acres).\nDaming Palace (\u5927\u660e\u5bae \u2013 \"The Palace of the Great Brightness\"), also known as the Eastern Apartments (\u6771\u5185), in (Tang) Chang'an (\u9577\u5b89), now downtown Xi'an (\u897f\u5b89), Shaanxi province: imperial palace of the Tang Dynasty after A.D. 663 (it was briefly named Penglai Palace (\u84ec\u840a\u5bae) between 663 and 705), but the prestigious Taiji Palace remained used for major state ceremonies such as coronations. Area: 3.11 km\u00b2 (768 acres).\nKaifeng Imperial Palace (\u6771\u4eac\u5927\u5185\u7687\u5bae), in Dongjing (\u6771\u4eac), now called Kaifeng (\u958b\u5c01), Henan province: imperial palace of the Northern Song Dynasty.\nHangzhou Imperial Palace (\u81e8\u5b89\u5927\u5185\u7981\u5bae), in Lin'an (\u81e8\u5b89), now called Hangzhou (\u676d\u5dde), Zhejiang province: imperial palace of the Southern Song Dynasty.\nKarakorum (\u54c8\u62c9\u548c\u6797)\uff0csite of the imperial palace of the Mongol Empire.\nShangdu (\u5143\u4e0a\u90fd) and Khanbaliq (\u5143\u5927\u90fd)\uff0csite of the imperial palace of the Yuan dynasty.\nMing Imperial Palace (\u660e\u6545\u5bae), in Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac), Jiangsu province: imperial palace of the Ming Dynasty until 1421.\n\nForbidden City (\u7d2b\u7981\u57ce), now known in China as Beijing's Old Palace (\u5317\u4eac\u6545\u5bab), in Jingshi (\u4eac\u5e2b), now called Beijing (\u5317\u4eac): imperial palace of the Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasty from 1421 until 1924. Area: 720,000 m\u00b2  (178 acres).Apart from the main imperial palace, Chinese dynasties also had several other imperial palaces in the capital city where the empress, crown prince, or other members of the imperial family dwelled. There also existed palaces outside of the capital city called \"away palaces\" (\u96e2\u5bae) where the emperors resided when traveling. The habit also developed of building garden estates in the countryside surrounding the capital city, where the emperors retired at times to get away from the rigid etiquette of the imperial palace, or simply to escape from the summer heat inside their capital. This practice reached a zenith with the Qing Dynasty, whose emperors built the fabulous Imperial Gardens (\u5fa1\u5712), now known in China as the Gardens of Perfect Brightness (\u5713\u660e\u5712), and better known in English as the Old Summer Palace. The emperors of the Qing Dynasty resided and worked in the Imperial Gardens, 8 km/5 miles outside of the walls of Beijing, the Forbidden City inside Beijing being used only for formal ceremonies.\nThese gardens were made up of three gardens: the Garden of Perfect Brightness proper, the Garden of Eternal Spring (\u9577\u6625\u5712), and the Elegant Spring Garden (\u7dba\u6625\u5712); they covered a huge area of 3.5 km\u00b2 (865 acres), almost 5 times the size of the Forbidden City, and 8 times the size of the Vatican City.  comprising hundreds of halls, pavilions, temples, galleries, gardens, lakes, etc. Several famous landscapes of southern China had been reproduced in the Imperial Gardens, hundreds of invaluable Chinese art masterpieces and antiquities were stored in the halls, making the Imperial Gardens one of the largest museum in the world. Some unique copies of literary work and compilations were also stored inside the Imperial Gardens. In 1860, during the Second Opium War, the British and French expeditionary forces looted the Old Summer Palace. Then on October 18, 1860, in order to \"punish\" the imperial court, which had refused to allow Western embassies inside Beijing, the British general Lord Elgin \u2013 with protestations from the French \u2013 purposely ordered to set fire to the huge complex which burned to the ground. It took 3500 British troops to set the entire place ablaze and took three whole days to burn. The burning of the Gardens of Perfect Brightness is still a very sensitive issue in China today.\nFollowing this cultural catastrophe, the imperial court was forced to relocate to the old and austere Forbidden City where it stayed until 1924, when the Last Emperor was expelled by a republican army. Empress dowager Cixi (\u6148\u79a7\u592a\u540e) built the Summer Palace (\u9824\u548c\u5712 \u2013 \"The Garden of Nurtured Harmony\") near the Old Summer Palace, but on a much smaller scale than the Old Summer Palace. There are currently some projects in China to rebuild the Imperial Gardens, but this appears as a colossal undertaking, and no rebuilding has started yet.\n\n\n=== More Palaces ===\nSome other palaces include:\n\nSummer Palace in Beijing\nMukden Palace in Shenyang\nChengde Mountain Resort at Chengde\nPotala Palace in Lhasa \u2013 Main residence of the Dalai Lama, Lhasa\nNorbulingka Palace \u2013 Summer palace of the Dalai Lama\n\n\n== Colombia ==\nPalacio de Nari\u00f1o\nPalacio Lievano\nPalacio de San Francisco\n\n\n== Croatia ==\nDiocletian's Palace\n\n\n== Czech Republic ==\n\n\n=== Prague ===\nArchbishop's Palace (Prague)\nBelvedere (Prague)\nCzernin Palace (Prague)\nClam-Gallas Palace (Prague)\nKaunitz Palace (Prague)\nKinsky Palace (Prague) \u2013 former residence of the Kinsky princely family\nKolowrat Palace (Prague, Hradcanske namesti)\nKolowrat Palace (Prague, Loretanska)\nKolowrat Palace (Prague, Ovocny trh)\nKolowrat Palace (Prague, Valdstejnska)\nLiechtenstein Palace (Prague, Kampa Island)\nLiechtenstein Palace (Prague, Malostransk\u00e9 n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed)\nLobkowicz Palace (Prague Castle)\nLobkowicz Palace (Prague, Mala Strana)\nMartinic Palace (Prague)\nMorzin Palace (Prague)\nOld Royal Palace (Prague Castle)\nPalfy Palace (Prague)\nPrague Castle \u2013 built in a Palace style\nRosenberg Palace (Prague)\nSalm Palace (Prague)\nSch\u00f6nborn Palace (Prague)\nSternberg Palace (Prague, Hradcany)\nSternberg Palace (Prague, Mala Strana)\nSchwarzenberg Palace (Prague) \u2013 former residence of the Schwarzenberg princely family\nThun Palace (Prague)\nThun-Hohenstein Palace (Prague)\nTroja Palace (Prague)\nTuscan Palace (Prague)\nWallenstein Palace (Prague)\n\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\nArchbishop's Palace (Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e)\n\n\n== Denmark ==\n\nAmalienborg Palace, winter palace of the Danish royal family, Copenhagen\nChristiansborg Palace, Copenhagen\nFredensborg Palace, spring and autumn residence of the Danish monarch, Fredensborg\nFrederiksberg Palace, Frederiksberg municipality in Copenhagen City\nFrederiksborg Palace, Hiller\u00f8d\nGr\u00e5sten Palace, summer residence of the Danish royal family, Gr\u00e5sten\nKastellet, Copenhagen\nRosenborg Castle, Copenhagen\nCharlottenlund Palace, Copenhagen\nKronborg Castle, Elsinore (at which Shakespeares \"Hamlet\" takes place)\n\n\n== Egypt ==\n\n\n=== Pharaonic ===\n16th century BC Unknown king palace, Naqada\n14th century BC Palace of Amenhotep III in Malkata (or Malqata) in Luxor.\n1346 BC Amarna palaces of Pharaoh Akhenaten, in al-Minya\n14th century BC Amenhotep III palace at Avaris (Pi-Ramesses), in Eastern desert.\n13th century BC Palace of the Pharaoh Merenptah in Memphis, Egypt.\n13th century BC Palace of Rameses II, Ramesseum, Luxor\n13th century BC Palace of Rameses II, Fayoum\n1175 BC The Temple & Palace of Rameses III at Medinet Habu, Egypt\n6th century BC Palace of Wahibre (Apries) in Memphis, Egypt.\n\n\n=== Ptolemaic ===\nCirca 2nd century BC The Ptolemaic palace in what is now Silsila district in Alexandria\n50s BC Caesareum palace which was built by Cleopatra in honor of Julius Caesar or Mark Antony in Alexandria\n50s BC Antirrhodus island palace, was erected off of Alexandria's mainland in the Eastern Harbour.(later on was submerged by sea)\n\n\n=== Roman ===\n100 AD Roman palace at El Haiz area in the Bahariya Oasis, western desert.\n\n\n=== Arabic ===\n870 AD Ahmad ibn Tulun Palace at al-Qatta'i in Old Cairo.\n12th century AD Fatimid palaces (Eastern & Western) at Khan el-Khalili area at Old Cairo.\n12th century Ayyubid dynasty palace.\n13th century Sultan al-Salih palace in Rhoda Island in Nile in Cairo.\n13th century The Ablaq Palace of Al-Nasir Mohamed Ibn Qalawun, in Old Cairo.\n1293 Amir Khayrbak Palace or Amir Alin Aq Palace at Bab al-Wazir Street, Tabbana Quarter, Old Cairo.\n14th century Palace of Manjak al Yusufi al Silahdar, Cairo Egypt.\n1330 Amir Qawsun Palace (Qawsoun Yashbak min Mahdi) in Cairo, Egypt\n1334 Beshtak Palace\n1352 Amir Taz Palace in Cairo Egypt\n1366 Palace of Emir Tashtimur (Hummus Akhdar) in Cairo, Egypt\n15th century The Ghouri Palace\n1496 Amir Mamay Palace (Bait al-Qady)\n16th century Bayt Al-Razzaz palace or Palace of al-Ashraf Qaytbay.

        "wiki": "The Cittadella Nuova (New Citadel), now called the Giardino di Scotto or Giardino Scotto (Scotto's Garden) is an old fortress in Pisa.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe citadel was called \"nuova\" (new) to distinguish it from the older Cittadella Vecchia on the seaward side of the city. The Cittadella Nuova is located on the extreme opposite side of the city walls of Pisa in Lungarno Fibonacci, on the south bank of the river Arno between the Ponte della Vittoria and the Ponte della Fortezza.\nConstruction began in 1440 during the first period of Florentine rule. In the course of the Pisan revolt and battles which led to the Florentine reconquest of the city, the fortress was damaged and had to be restored by architect Giuliano da Sangallo.\nThis new reconstruction was designed to stand against forces using cannon - one of the first fortresses in Italy to do so.\nInside the fortifications of the Cittadella Nuova, there is an extensive garden created at the beginning of the nineteenth century by architect Giovanni Caluri for the Livornese shipping-magnate, Domenico Scotto.\nThe Scotto brother had acquired the fortress in 1798 when grand-duke Leopold I of Tuscany put it up for sale and quickly began work on the construction of a palace with a vast green space. Legend has it that the enormous plane tree which rises in the middle of the garden, was planted during a theatrical performance by Carlo Goldoni, but in reality he died before the Scotto family acquired the garden.\nIn the 1930s, the area became a public garden and was used for shows, theatrical performances, concerts and as an open-air cinema in summer - a role which it retains to this day.\nThe Scotto family's palace was largely destroyed during the Second World War and the garden grew ever more degraded until 2008 when it was largely reconstructed and refitted.\n\n\n== Other images ==",

          "We came here by accident and were happy to find out it was for free!. They had a huge exhibition about Italian cinema, interesting, but really more for Italians than other tourists. Up you also have several rooms, 8 or so with very old coins and paintings and furniture from",

It has a rich collection of antique paintings, including works by Berlinghiero Volterrano, Giunta Pisano, Simone Martini, Lippo Memmi, Francesco Traini, Masaccio, Beato Angelico, Benozzo di Lese, and Ghirlandaio. The museum also has a collection of medieval illuminated manuscripts, wooden religious sculpture from 13th century to 15th century, and antique ceramics.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe nucleus of the collection was initially started by a 1796 endowment by the Canon of the Pisa Cathedral, Sebastiano Zucchetti. Further works were added after the Napoleonic closure of many religious establishments, and through the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1893, a local Jewish citizen, Igino Benvenuto Supino, helped found the Pisan Museo Civico.

        "wiki": "Pisa ( PEE-z\u0259, Italian: [\u02c8pi\u02d0za] (listen) or [\u02c8pi\u02d0sa]) is a city and comune in Tuscany, central Italy, straddling the Arno just before it empties into the Ligurian Sea. It is the capital city of the Province of Pisa. Although Pisa is known worldwide for its leaning tower (the bell tower of the city's cathedral), the city of over 91,104 residents (around 200,000 with the metropolitan area) contains more than 20 other historic churches, several medieval palaces, and various bridges across the Arno. Much of the city's architecture was financed from its history as one of the Italian maritime republics.\nThe city is also home of the University of Pisa, which has a history going back to the 12th century and also has the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, founded by Napoleon in 1810, and its offshoot, the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, as the best-sanctioned Superior Graduate Schools in Italy.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Ancient times ===\nThe origin of the name, Pisa, is a mystery. While the origin of the city had remained unknown for centuries, the Pelasgi, the Greeks, the Etruscans, and the Ligurians had variously been proposed as founders of the city (for example, a colony of the ancient city of Pisa, Greece). Archaeological remains from the fifth century BC confirmed the existence of a city at the sea, trading with Greeks and Gauls. The presence of an Etruscan necropolis, discovered during excavations in the Arena Garibaldi in 1991, confirmed its Etruscan origins.\nAncient Roman authors referred to Pisa as an old city. Strabo referred Pisa's origins to the mythical Nestor, king of Pylos, after the fall of Troy. Virgil, in his Aeneid, states that Pisa was already a great center by the times described; the settlers from the Alpheus coast have been credited with the founding of the city in the 'Etruscan lands'. The Virgilian commentator Servius wrote that the Teuti, or Pelops, the king of the Pisaeans, founded the town 13 centuries before the start of the common era.\nThe maritime role of Pisa should have been already prominent if the ancient authorities ascribed to it the invention of the naval ram. Pisa took advantage of being the only port along the western coast between Genoa (then a small village) and Ostia. Pisa served as a base for Roman naval expeditions against Ligurians, Gauls, and Carthaginians. In 180 BC, it became a Roman colony under Roman law, as Portus Pisanus. In 89 BC, Portus Pisanus became a municipium. Emperor Augustus fortified the colony into an important port and changed the name as Colonia Iulia obsequens.\nPisa supposedly was founded on the shore, but due to the alluvial sediments from the Arno and the Serchio, whose mouth lies about 11 km (7 mi) north of the Arno's, the shore moved west. Strabo states that the city was 4.0 km (2.5 mi) away from the coast. Currently, it is located 9.7 km (6 mi) from the coast. However, it was a maritime city, with ships sailing up the Arno. In the 90s AD, a baths complex was built in the city.\n\n\n=== Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages ===\n\nDuring the last years of the Western Roman Empire, Pisa did not decline as much as the other cities of Italy, probably due to the complexity of its river system and its consequent ease of defence. In the seventh century, Pisa helped Pope Gregory I by supplying numerous ships in his military expedition against the Byzantines of Ravenna: Pisa was the sole Byzantine centre of Tuscia to fall peacefully in Lombard hands, through assimilation with the neighbouring region where their trading interests were prevalent. Pisa began in this way its rise to the role of main port of the Upper Tyrrhenian Sea and became the main trading centre between Tuscany and Corsica, Sardinia, and the southern coasts of France and Spain.\nAfter Charlemagne had defeated the Lombards under the command of Desiderius in 774, Pisa went through a crisis, but soon recovered. Politically, it became part of the duchy of Lucca. In 860, Pisa was captured by vikings led by Bj\u00f6rn Ironside. In 930, Pisa became the county centre (status it maintained until the arrival of Otto I) within the mark of Tuscia. Lucca was the capital but Pisa was the most important city, as in the middle of 10th century Liutprand of Cremona, bishop of Cremona, called Pisa Tusciae provinciae caput (\"capital of the province of Tuscia\"), and a century later, the marquis of Tuscia was commonly referred to as \"marquis of Pisa\". In 1003, Pisa was the protagonist of the first communal war in Italy, against Lucca. From the naval point of view, since the 9th century, the emergence of the Saracen pirates urged the city to expand its fleet; in the following years, this fleet gave the town an opportunity for more expansion. In 828, Pisan ships assaulted the coast of North Africa. In 871, they took part in the defence of Salerno from the Saracens. In 970, they gave also strong support to Otto I's expedition, defeating a Byzantine fleet in front of Calabrese coasts.\n\n\n=== 11th century ===\n\nThe power of Pisa as a  maritime nation began to grow and reached its apex in the 11th century, when it acquired traditional fame as one of the four main historical maritime republics of Italy (Repubbliche Marinare).\nAt that time, the city was a very important commercial centre and controlled a significant Mediterranean merchant fleet and navy. It expanded its powers in 1005 through the sack of Reggio Calabria in the south of Italy. Pisa was in continuous conflict with some 'Saracens' - a medieval term to refer to Arab Muslims - who had their bases in Corsica, for control of the Mediterranean. In 1017, Sardinian Giudicati were militarily supported by Pisa, in alliance with Genoa, to defeat the Saracen King Mugahid, who had settled a logistic base in the north of Sardinia the year before. This victory gave Pisa supremacy in the Tyrrhenian Sea. When the Pisans subsequently ousted the Genoese from Sardinia, a new conflict and rivalry was born between these mighty marine republics. Between 1030 and 1035, Pisa went on to defeat several rival towns in Sicily and conquer Carthage in North Africa. In 1051\u20131052, the admiral Jacopo Ciurini conquered Corsica, provoking more resentment from the Genoese. In 1063, Admiral Giovanni Orlandi, coming to the aid of the Norman Roger I, took Palermo from the Saracen pirates. The gold treasure taken from the Saracens in Palermo allowed the Pisans to start the building of their cathedral and the other monuments which constitute the famous Piazza del Duomo.\nIn 1060, Pisa had to engage in their first battle with Genoa. The Pisan victory helped to consolidate its position in the Mediterranean. Pope Gregory VII recognised in 1077 the new \"Laws and customs of the sea\" instituted by the Pisans, and emperor Henry IV granted them the right to name their own consuls, advised by a council of elders. This was simply a confirmation of the present situation, because in those years, the marquis had already been excluded from power. In 1092, Pope Urban II awarded Pisa the supremacy over Corsica and Sardinia, and at the same time raising the town to the rank of archbishopric.\nPisa sacked the Tunisian city of Mahdia in 1088. Four years later, Pisan and Genoese ships helped Alfonso VI of Castilla to push El Cid out of Valencia. A Pisan fleet of 120 ships also took part in the First Crusade, and the Pisans were instrumental in the taking of Jerusalem in 1099. On their way to the Holy Land, the ships did not miss the occasion to sack some Byzantine islands; the Pisan crusaders were led by their archbishop Daibert, the future patriarch of Jerusalem. Pisa and the other Repubbliche Marinare took advantage of the crusade to establish trading posts and colonies in the Eastern coastal cities of the Levant. In particular, the Pisans founded colonies in Antiochia, Acre, Jaffa, Tripoli, Tyre, Latakia, and Accone. They also had other possessions in Jerusalem and Caesarea, plus smaller colonies (with lesser autonomy) in Cairo, Alexandria, and of course Constantinople, where the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus granted them special mooring and trading rights. In all these cities, the Pisans were granted privileges and immunity from taxation, but had to contribute to the defence in case of attack. In the 12th century, the Pisan quarter in the eastern part of Constantinople had grown to 1,000 people. For some years of that century, Pisa was the most prominent merchant and military ally of the Byzantine Empire, overcoming Venice itself.\n\n\n=== 12th century ===\nIn 1113, Pisa and Pope Paschal II set up, together with the count of Barcelona and other contingents from Provence and Italy (Genoese excluded), a war to free the Balearic Islands from the Moors; the queen and the king of Majorca were brought in chains to Tuscany. Though the Almoravides soon reconquered the island, the booty taken helped the Pisans in their magnificent programme of buildings, especially the cathedral, and Pisa gained a role of pre-eminence in the Western Mediterranean.\nIn the following years, the mighty Pisan fleet, led by archbishop Pietro Moriconi, drove away the Saracens after ferocious combats. Though short-lived, this success of Pisa in Spain increased the rivalry with Genoa. Pisa's trade with the Languedoc and Provence (Noli, Savona, Fr\u00e9jus, and Montpellier) were an obstacle to the Genoese interests in cities such as Hy\u00e8res, Fos, Antibes, and Marseille.\nThe war began in 1119 when the Genoese attacked several galleys on their way to the motherland, and lasted until 1133. The two cities fought each other on land and at sea, but hostilities were limited to raids and pirate-like assaults.\nIn June 1135, Bernard of Clairvaux took a leading part in the Council of Pisa, asserting the claims of Pope Innocent II against those of Pope Anacletus II, who had been elected pope in 1130 with Norman support, but was not recognised outside Rome. Innocent II resolved the conflict with Genoa, establishing the sphere of influence of Pisa and Genoa. Pisa could then, unhindered by Genoa, participate in the conflict of Innocent II against king Roger II of Sicily. Amalfi, one of the maritime republics (though already declining under Norman rule), was conquered on August 6, 1136; the Pisans destroyed the ships in the port, assaulted the castles in the surrounding areas, and drove back an army sent by Roger from Aversa. This victory brought Pisa to the peak of its power and to a standing equal to Venice. Two years later, its soldiers sacked Salerno.\n\nIn the following years, Pisa was one of the staunchest supporters of the Ghibelline party. This was much appreciated by Frederick I. He issued in 1162 and 1165 two important documents, with these grants: Apart from the jurisdiction over the Pisan countryside, the Pisans were granted freedom of trade in the whole empire, the coast from Civitavecchia to Portovenere, a half of Palermo, Messina, Salerno and Naples, the whole of Gaeta, Mazara, and Trapani, and a street with houses for its merchants in every city of the Kingdom of Sicily. Some of these grants were later confirmed by Henry VI, Otto IV, and Frederick II. They marked the apex of Pisa's power, but also spurred the resentment of cities such as Lucca, Massa, Volterra, and Florence, which saw their aim to expand towards the sea thwarted. The clash with Lucca also concerned the possession of the castle of Montignoso and mainly the control of the Via Francigena, the main trade route between Rome and France. Last but not least, such a sudden and large increase of power by Pisa could only lead to another war with Genoa.\nGenoa had acquired a largely dominant position in the markets of southern France. The war began presumably in 1165 on the Rh\u00f4ne, when an attack on a convoy, directed to some Pisan trade centres on the river, by the Genoese and their ally, the count of Toulouse, failed. Pisa, though, was allied to Provence. The war continued until 1175 without significant victories. Another point of attrition was Sicily, where both the cities had privileges granted by Henry VI. In 1192, Pisa managed to conquer Messina. This episode was followed by a series of battles culminating in the Genoese conquest of Syracuse in 1204. Later, the trading posts in Sicily were lost when the new Pope Innocent III, though removing the excommunication cast over Pisa by his predecessor Celestine III, allied himself with the Guelph League of Tuscany, led by Florence. Soon, he stipulated a pact with Genoa, too, further weakening the Pisan presence in southern Italy.\nTo counter the Genoese predominance in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, Pisa strengthened its relationship with their Spanish and French traditional bases (Marseille, Narbonne, Barcelona, etc.) and tried to defy the Venetian rule of the Adriatic Sea. In 1180, the two cities agreed to a nonaggression treaty in the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic, but the death of Emperor Manuel Comnenus in Constantinople changed the situation. Soon, attacks on Venetian convoys were made. Pisa signed trade and political pacts with Ancona, Pula, Zara, Split, and Brindisi; in 1195, a Pisan fleet reached Pola to defend its independence from Venice, but the Serenissima managed soon to reconquer the rebel sea town.\n\nOne year later, the two cities signed a peace treaty, which resulted in favourable conditions for Pisa, but in 1199, the Pisans violated it by blockading the port of Brindisi in Apulia. In the following naval battle, they were defeated by the Venetians. The war that followed ended in 1206 with a treaty in which Pisa gave up all its hopes to expand in the Adriatic, though it maintained the trading posts it had established in the area. From that point on, the two cities were united against the rising power of Genoa and sometimes collaborated to increase the trading benefits in Constantinople.\n\n\n=== 13th century ===\nIn 1209 in Lerici, two councils for a final resolution of the rivalry with Genoa were held. A 20-year peace treaty was signed, but when in 1220, the emperor Frederick II confirmed his supremacy over the Tyrrhenian coast from Civitavecchia to Portovenere, the Genoese and Tuscan resentment against Pisa grew again. In the following years, Pisa clashed with Lucca in Garfagnana and was defeated by the Florentines at Castel del Bosco. The strong Ghibelline position of Pisa brought this town diametrically against the Pope, who was in a strong dispute with the Empire, and indeed the pope tried to deprive the town of its dominions in northern Sardinia.\nIn 1238, Pope Gregory IX formed an alliance between Genoa and Venice against the empire, and consequently against Pisa, too. One year later, he excommunicated Frederick II and called for an anti-Empire council to be held in Rome in 1241. On May 3, 1241, a combined fleet of Pisan and Sicilian ships, led by the emperor's son Enzo, attacked a Genoese convoy carrying prelates from northern Italy and France, next to the isle of Giglio (Battle of Giglio), in front of Tuscany; the Genoese lost 25 ships, while about a thousand sailors, two cardinals, and one bishop were taken prisoner. After this outstanding victory, the council in Rome failed, but Pisa was excommunicated. This extreme measure was only removed in 1257. Anyway, the Tuscan city tried to take advantage of the favourable situation to conquer the Corsican city of Aleria and even lay siege to Genoa itself in 1243.\nThe Ligurian republic of Genoa, however, recovered fast from this blow and won back Lerici, conquered by the Pisans some years earlier, in 1256.\nThe great expansion in the Mediterranean and the prominence of the merchant class urged a modification in the city's institutes. The system with consuls was abandoned, and in 1230, the new city rulers named a capitano del popolo (\"people's chieftain\") as civil and military leader. In spite of these reforms, the conquered lands and the city itself were harassed by the rivalry between the two families of Della Gherardesca and Visconti. In 1237 the archbishop and the Emperor Frederick II intervened to reconcile the two rivals, but the strains did not cease. In 1254, the people rebelled and imposed 12 Anziani del Popolo (\"People's Elders\") as their political representatives in the commune. They also supplemented the legislative councils, formed of noblemen, with new People's Councils, composed by the main guilds and by the chiefs of the People's Companies. These had the power to ratify the laws of the Major General Council and the Senate.\n\n\n=== Decline ===\n\nThe decline is said to have  begun on August 6, 1284, when the numerically superior fleet of Pisa, under the command of Albertino Morosini, was defeated by the brilliant tactics of the Genoese fleet, under the command of Benedetto Zaccaria and Oberto Doria, in the dramatic naval Battle of Meloria. This defeat ended the maritime power of Pisa and the town never fully recovered; in 1290, the Genoese destroyed forever the Porto Pisano (Pisa's port), and covered the land with salt. The region around Pisa did not permit the city to recover from the loss of thousands of sailors from the Meloria, while Liguria guaranteed enough sailors to Genoa. Goods, however, continued to be traded, albeit in reduced quantity, but the end came when the Arno started to change course, preventing the galleys from reaching the city's port up the river. The nearby area also likely became infested with malaria. The true end came in 1324, when Sardinia was entirely lost in favour of the Aragonese.\nAlways Ghibelline, Pisa tried to build up its power in the course of the 14th century, and even managed to defeat Florence in the Battle of Montecatini (1315), under the command of Uguccione della Faggiuola. Eventually, however, after a long siege, Pisa was occupied by Florentines in 1405. Florentines corrupted the capitano del popolo (\"people's chieftain\"), Giovanni Gambacorta, who opened by night the city gate of San Marco. Pisa was never conquered by an army. In 1409, Pisa was the seat of a council trying to set the question of the Great Schism. In the 15th century, access to the sea became more difficult, as the port was silting up and was cut off from the sea. When in 1494, Charles VIII of France invaded the Italian states to claim the Kingdom of Naples, Pisa reclaimed its independence as the Second Pisan Republic.\n\nThe new freedom did not last long; 15 years of battles and sieges by the Florentine troops led by Antonio da Filicaja, Averardo Salviati and Niccol\u00f2 Capponi were made, but they never managed to conquer the city. Vitellozzo Vitelli with his brother Paolo were the only ones who actually managed to break the strong defences of Pisa and make a breach in the Stampace bastion in the southern west part of the walls, but he did not enter the city. For that, they were suspected of treachery and Paolo was put to death. However, the resources of Pisa were getting low, and at the end, the city was sold to the Visconti family from Milan and eventually to Florence again. Its role of major port of Tuscany went to Livorno. Pisa acquired a mainly cultural role spurred by the presence of the University of Pisa, created in 1343, and later reinforced by the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (1810) and Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies (1987).\nPisa was the birthplace of the important early physicist Galileo Galilei. It is still the seat of an archbishopric. Besides its educational institutions, it has become a light industrial centre and a railway hub. It suffered repeated destruction during World War II.\nSince the early 1950s, the US Army has maintained Camp Darby just outside Pisa, which is used by many US military personnel as a base for vacations in the area.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nPisa experiences a borderline humid subtropical (Cfa) and Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa), since only a single month receives less than 40 mm (1.6 in) of rain. The city is characterized by cool-mild winters and hot summers. This transitional climate keeps Pisa from enjoying a summer devoid of rain, typical of central and southern Italy, as the summer (the driest season) experiences occasional rain showers. Rainfall peaks in the autumn.\n\n\n== Government ==\n\n\n== Main sights ==\n\nWhile the bell tower of the cathedral, known as \"the leaning Tower of Pisa\", is the most famous image of the city, it is one of many works of art and architecture in the city's Piazza del Duomo, also known, since the 20th century, as Piazza dei Miracoli (Square of Miracles), to the north of the old town center. The Piazza del Duomo also houses the Duomo (the Cathedral), the Baptistry and the Campo Santo (the monumental cemetery). The medieval complex includes the above-mentioned four sacred buildings, the hospital and few palaces. All the complex is kept by the Opera (fabrica ecclesiae) della Primaziale Pisana, an old non profit foundation that operates since the building of the Cathedral (1063) to the maintenance of the sacred buildings. The area is framed by medieval walls kept by municipality administration.\nOther sights include:\n\nKnights' Square (Piazza dei Cavalieri), where the Palazzo della Carovana, with its impressive fa\u00e7ade designed by Giorgio Vasari may be seen. Sited on the square\nSanto Stefano dei Cavalieri, church sited on Piazza dei Cavalieri, and also designed by Vasari. It had originally a single nave; two more were added in the 17th century. It houses a bust by Donatello, and paintings by Vasari, Jacopo Ligozzi, Alessandro Fei, and Pontormo. It also contains spoils from the many naval battles between the Cavalieri (Knights of St. Stephan) and the Turks between the 16th and 18th centuries, including the Turkish battle pennant hoisted from Ali Pacha's flagship at the 1571 Battle of Lepanto.\nSt. Sixtus. This small church, consecrated in 1133, is also close to the Piazza dei Cavalieri. It was used as a seat of the most important notarial deeds of the town, also hosting the Council of Elders. It is today one of the best preserved early Romanesque buildings in town.\nSt. Francis. The church of San Francesco may have been designed by Giovanni di Simone, built after 1276. In 1343 new chapels were added and the church was elevated. It has a single nave and a notable belfry, as well as a 15th-century cloister. It houses works by Jacopo da Empoli, Taddeo Gaddi and Santi di Tito. In the Gherardesca Chapel are buried Ugolino della Gherardesca and his sons.\nSan Frediano. This  church, built by 1061, has a basilica interior with three aisles, with a crucifix from the 12th century. Paintings from the 16th century were added during a restoration, including works by Ventura Salimbeni, Domenico Passignano, Aurelio Lomi, and Rutilio Manetti.\nSan Nicola. This medieval church built by 1097, was enlarged between 1297 and 1313 by the Augustinians, perhaps by the design of Giovanni Pisano. The octagonal belfry is from the second half of the 13th century. The paintings include the Madonna with Child by Francesco Traini (14th century) and St. Nicholas Saving Pisa from the Plague (15th century). Noteworthy are also the wood sculptures by Giovanni and Nino Pisano, and the Annunciation by Francesco di Valdambrino.\nSanta Maria della Spina. A small white marble church alongside the Arno, is attributed to Lupo di Francesco (1230), is another excellent Gothic building.\nSan Paolo a Ripa d'Arno. The church was founded around 952 and enlarged in the mid-12th century along lines similar to those of the cathedral. It is annexed to the Romanesque Chapel of St. Agatha, with an unusual pyramidal cusp or peak.San Pietro in Vinculis. Known as San Pierino, it is an 11th-century church with a crypt and a cosmatesque mosaic on the floor of the main nave. \n\nBorgo Stretto. This medieval borgo or neighborhood contains strolling arcades and the Lungarno, the avenues along the river Arno. It includes the Gothic-Romanesque church of San Michele in Borgo (990). There are at least two other leaning towers in the city, one at the southern end of central Via Santa Maria, the other halfway through the Piagge riverside promenade.\nMedici Palace. The palace was once a possession of the Appiano family, who ruled Pisa in 1392\u20131398. In 1400 the Medici acquired it, and Lorenzo de' Medici sojourned here.\nOrto botanico di Pisa. The botanical garden of the University of Pisa is Europe's oldest university botanical garden.\nPalazzo Reale. The (\"Royal Palace\"), once belonged to the Caetani patrician family. Here Galileo Galilei showed to Grand Duke of Tuscany the planets he had discovered with his telescope. The edifice was erected in 1559 by Baccio Bandinelli for Cosimo I de Medici, and was later enlarged including other palaces. The palace is now a museum.\nPalazzo Gambacorti. This palace is a 14th-century Gothic building, and now houses the offices of the municipality. The interior shows frescoes boasting Pisa's sea victories.\nPalazzo Agostini. The palace is a Gothic building also known as Palazzo dell'Ussero, with its 15th-century fa\u00e7ade and remains of the ancient city walls dating back to before 1155. The name of the building comes from the coffee rooms of Caff\u00e8 dell'Ussero, historic meeting place founded on September 1, 1775.\nMural Tuttomondo. A modern mural, the last public work by Keith Haring, on the rear wall of the convent of the Church of Sant'Antonio, painted in June 1989.\n\n\n=== Museums ===\nMuseo dell'Opera del Duomo: exhibiting among others the original sculptures of Nicola Pisano and Giovanni Pisano and the treasures of the cathedral.\nMuseo delle Sinopie: showing the sinopias from the camposanto, the monumental cemetery.

It houses one of the largest cetacean skeletons collection in Europe.\nPalazzo Blu: temporary exhibitions and cultural activities center, located in the Lungarno, in the heart of the old town, the palace is easy recognizable because it is the only blue building.\nCantiere delle Navi di Pisa - The Pisa's Ancient Ships Archaeological Area: A museum of 10,650 square meters - 3,500 archaeological excavation, 1,700 laboratories and one restoration center -, that visitors can visit with a guided tour.\n\n\n=== Educational institutions ===\nPisa hosts the University of Pisa, especially renowned in the fields of Physics, Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science. The Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna and the Scuola Normale Superiore, the Italian academic \u00e9lite institutions are noted mostly for research and the education of graduate students.\nConstruction of a new leaning tower of glass and steel 57 meters tall, containing offices and apartments was scheduled to start in summer 2004 and take 4 years. It was designed by Dante Oscar Benini and raised criticism.\n\nThe Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa was founded in 1810, by Napoleonic decree, as a branch of the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure of Paris. Recognized as a \"national university\" in 1862, one year after Italian unification, and named during that period as \"Normal School of the Kingdom of Italy\" (Superior Graduate Schools in Italy i.e. Scuola Superiore Universitaria).Located at: Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa \u2013 Piazza dei Cavalieri, 7 \u2013 56126 Pisa (Italia)\n\nThe Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies of Pisa or Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna is a special-statute public university located in Pisa, Italy, emerging from Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa and operating in the field of applied sciences, (Superior Graduate Schools in Italy i.e. Scuola Superiore Universitaria)Located at: Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, P.zza Martiri della Libert\u00e0, 33 \u2013 56127 \u2013 Pisa (Italia)\n\nThe University of Pisa or Universit\u00e0 di Pisa, is one of the oldest universities in Italy. It was formally founded on September 3, 1343 by an edict of Pope Clement VI, although there had been lectures on law in Pisa since the 11th century. The University has Europe's oldest academic botanical garden i.e. Orto botanico di Pisa, founded 1544.Located at: Universit\u00e0 di Pisa \u2013 Lungarno Pacinotti, 43 \u2013 56126 Pisa (Italia)\n\n\n=== Churches ===\nBaptistry\nSan Francesco\nSan Frediano\nSan Giorgio ai Tedeschi\nSan Michele in Borgo\nSan Nicola\nSan Paolo a Ripa d'Arno\nSan Paolo all'Orto\nSan Piero a Grado\nSan Pietro in Vinculis\nSan Sisto\nSan Zeno\nSanta Caterina\nSanta Cristina\nSanta Maria della Spina\nSanto Sepolcro\n\n\n=== Palaces, towers and villas ===\nPalazzo del Collegio Puteano\nPalazzo della Carovana\nPalazzo delle Vedove\nTorre dei Gualandi\nVilla di Corliano\nLeaning Tower of Pisa\n\n\n== Notable people associated with Pisa ==\nFor people born in Pisa, see People from the Province of Pisa; among notable non-natives long resident in the city:\n\n\n== Transport ==\n\n\n=== Travel links ===\nPisa is a one-hour drive from Florence (86 kilometres (53 mi)). One can also get a train directly to Florence from a Central rail station in Pisa (Pisa Centrale). Local buses connect the city of Pisa with all the neighboring cities (come to Pontedera, then take a bus for Volterra, San Miniato, etc.). Taxis come when requested from Pisa International Airport and Central Station.\n\n\n=== Pisamover ===\nPisa has an international airport known as Pisa International Airport located in San Giusto neighborhood in Pisa. The airport has a people mover system, called Pisamover, opened in March 2017, that connects Airport and Pisa central railway station, that is 2 km (1.2 mi) away.  It's based on a driverless \"horizontal funicular\" that travels the distance in 5 minutes, with a 5-minute frequency, having an intermediate stop at parking station San Giusto & Aurelia.\n\n\n=== Buses ===\nUrban lines CPT (Compagnia Pisana Trasporti):\nSuburban lines CPT to/from Pisa:\n\n\n=== Trains ===\nThe city is served by two railway stations available for passengers: Pisa Centrale and Pisa San Rossore.\nPisa Centrale is the main railway station and is located along the Tyrrhenic railway line. It connects Pisa directly with several other important Italian cities such as Rome, Florence, Genoa, Turin, Naples, Livorno, and Grosseto. \nPisa San Rossore links the city with Lucca (20 minutes from Pisa) and Viareggio and is also reachable from Pisa Centrale. It is a minor railway station located near the Leaning Tower zone.\nThere was another station called Pisa Aeroporto situated next to the Airport with services to Pisa Centrale and Florence.

Pisa, currently plays in the Lega Pro (the third highest football division in Italy), and has had a top flight history throughout the 1980s and the 1990s, featuring several world-class players such as Diego Simeone, Christian Vieri and Dunga during this time. The club play at the Arena Garibaldi \u2013 Stadio Romeo Anconetani, opened in 1919 and with a capacity of 25,000.\nShooting was one of the first sports to have their own association in Pisa. The Societ\u00e0 del Tiro a Segno di Pisa was founded on July 9, 1862. In 1885, they acquired their own training field. The shooting range was almost completely destroyed during World War II.\nIn Pisa there was a festival and game fr:Gioco del Ponte (Game of the Bridge) which was celebrated (in some form) in Pisa from perhaps the 1200s down to 1807. From the end of the 1400s the game took the form of a mock battle fought upon Pisa's central bridge (Ponte di Mezzo). The participants wore quilted armor and the only offensive weapon allowed was the targone, a shield-shaped, stout board with precisely specified dimensions. Hitting below the belt was not allowed. Two opposing teams started at opposite ends of the bridge. The object of the two opposing teams was to penetrate, drive back, and disperse the opponents' ranks and to thereby drive them backwards off the bridge. The struggle was limited to forty-five minutes. Victory or defeat was immensely important to the team players and their partisans, but sometimes the game was fought to a draw and both sides celebrated. In 1927 the tradition was revived by college students as an elaborate costume parade. In 1935 Vittorio Emanuele III with the royal family witnessed  the first revival of a modern version of the game, which has been pursued in the 20th and 21st centuries with some interruptions and varying degrees of enthusiasm by Pisans and their civic institutions.\n\n\n== Festivals and cultural events ==\nCapodanno pisano (folklore, March 25)\nGioco del Ponte (folklore)\nLuminara di San Ranieri (folklore June 16)\nMaritime republics regatta (Folklore)\nPremio Nazionale Letterario Pisa\nPisa Book Festival\nMetarock (Rock music festival)\nInternet Festival\nSan Ranieri regatta (Folklore)\nTurn Off Festival (House music festival)\nNessi\u00e1h (Jewish cultural Festival, November)\n\n\n== International relations ==\n\n\n=== Twin towns and sister cities ===\nPisa is twinned with:\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Bibliography ===\nSee also: Bibliography of the history of PisaRenouard, Yves (1969).

        "wiki": "Santo Stefano dei Cavalieri  is a church in central Pisa located on Piazza dei Cavalieri (Knight's Square).Construction began on 17 April 1565 in order to build a church for the Order of Knights of St Stephan, founded by the Grand Duke Cosimo de' Medici to fight Saracen piracy in the Mediterranean.  The project with designs and oversight by Giorgio Vasari and David Fortini was to build a church on the site of an older church called San Sebastiano alle Fabbriche Maggiori, which dated at least to 1074. The new church on the site was consecrated by 21 December 1569.  The facade, in white marble was designed by Don Giovanni de' Medici, illegitimate son of Cosimo I, with the help of Alessandro Pieroni; their designs were chosen over Vasari\u2019s original plan. An inscription commemorates completion during the reign of Ferdinando I de' Medici.\nThe bell-tower, also designed by Vasari, was completed by 1572 by Giovanni Fancelli. The main altar designs were by Pier Francesco Silvani. Many alterations and additions were proposed and made over the next two centuries, including plans by  Gherardo Mechini, Paolo Guidotti,  Ranieri Gherardi, Torp\u00e8 Donati, Alessandro Gherardesca, Florido Galli, Niccol\u00f2 Matas, and Pasquale Poccianti. The final reconstruction in 1859, completed after the suppression of the order, creates the clearer interior systematization of columns we see today.\n\n\n== Interior ==\n\nThe church display numerous trophy banners, captured during naval encounters with Saracen pirates. The font for holy water (1568) was sculpted by Giovanni Fancelli, based on designs by Vasari.\nIn the counterfacade are five monochrome paintings of Stories of St Stefano Pope and Martyr, including one celebrating the entrance of Ferdinando I on 31 March 1588. This grand-duke was to commission the wooden ceiling by Bartolomeo Atticciati (1604).\nThe Ceiling has six paintings on wood depicting episodes historic events in which the military order was active, including the Granting of uniforms by Cosimo I de' Medici by il Cigoli, the Return of the Fleet from the Battle of Lepanto and Sacking of Prevesa by Jacopo Ligozzi, The embarcation at Livorno of Maria de' Medici by Allori, Victory in the Greek Archipelago and Capture of Bona by l'Empoli,\n\nThe polychrome pulpit (1627) was completed by Chiarissimo Fancelli. It contains paintings by the Pisan Aurelio Lomi of Madonna and child with Saints Joseph and Stefano (1593) and a painting of the palace of the Order.\nThe Main altar (1702\u20131709) in the presbytery was designed and sculpted by  Giovanni Battista Foggini with a statue of St Stefano Pope and  allegorical figures of Religion and Faith, and on the bronze throne, a relief with the Decapitation of St Stefano.\nAt the right is a painting by Giorgio Vasari, with the Entombment of St Stefano (1571), while at the right is a Birth of Christ (1564)  by  Bronzino.\nIn the Sacristy is a sculptural group by Foggini of St Stefano and the allegory of Reason and the Trinity (1683), made in occasion of the translation of the body of the saint to this church in 1682.\nThe chapel of the Holy Sacrament was completed in 1837 by Florido Galli.\n\n\n== Organ ==\nThere are three organs in the church, the first from 1571 by the Cortonese organ-maker  Onofrio Zeffirini.  On the left is an organ by the Sienese Azzolino Bernardino della Ciaja reconstructed in 1733. In 1931, Giovanni Tamburini builds a new organ behind the 1733 organ. The modern organ is the only functioning one in the church.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==",

In 1563 the garden was relocated from its original riverside location (now the Medicean Arsenal) to one near the convent of Santa Marta, and in 1591 (under Joseph Goedenhuyze) again moved to its third and current location. From these early times, the garden has contained a gallery of natural objects (now Pisa's Museo di Storia Naturale), a library (now part of the university library), and portraits of its directors throughout the centuries. It also includes one of the earliest iron-framed hothouses built in Italy.\nToday the garden is divided into sections containing the botanical school, gardens, ponds, greenhouses, and various buildings. Major collections include herb gardens and arboreta, as well as the old botany institute, built 1591\u20131595, with a facade ornamented with sea-shells.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of botanical gardens in Italy\n\n\n== External links ==\nUniversity of Pisa website for the Orto botanico di Pisa\n\n\n== References ==\nGarbari F. et al., Giardino dei Semplici.

          "As others have noted, the Botanical gardens are in extremely poor condition. Definitely can't be considered a premier destination. There are, however, 10-12 major trees/groves of great historical interest that might make it worth the 2.50 entrance fee--some like the giant",
          "Peaceful and quiet spot, a few minutes walk from the Piazza dei Miracoli. You can seat and relax there and have a lunch. But the garden itself is in poor condition, badly maintained, with a lot of dead plants. The work needs to be done. The coffee and water, which you can by",
          "We only paid \u20ac1.50, but even that was too much. Even the chlorophytum, which can go months without water, was dying. Sure, it's a nice quiet location but it was sad to see all these dying plants.",
          "Although we weren't too impressed with the garden over all, it was such a treat to get out of the masses of the piazza dei miracoli and into this quiet, pretty and peaceful 16th century garden. I think there were at most six other people during our visit. We bought some cheap",
          "How can they pretend there's any value in this?? It may be the oldest botanical garden in Europe .....but what's for sure - it's the worst. Nobody waters the specimens, so they're all dead and nobody tidies up, so it looks unkempt. They should be prosecuted for misrepresentation!",
          "We loved these gardens and thought them a great place to visit - and incredibly cheap entrance fees too. But I want to organise teams of keen English gardeners to go and give some tlc and water. Wouldn't the average Brit pay for such a privilege - in the oldest university",
          "We were a bit sceptical after reading all the bad reviews but looking at the images uploaded on TA, to us it looked quite inviting. At euro 2.50 the gardens are well worth a visit....yes there are areas of neglect but not that bad, this isn't a commercial money making set-up",
          "A stone's throw from the cathedral and the tower, the gardens are entered from a lane off the Via San Maria and could provide a pleasant green oasis if you tire of stone and history. Entry costs \u20ac2.50 but the gardens are sadly neglected. There are one or two interesting",

          "What a sad place - it could be a delight, and perhaps was so in 1600. The whole garden had a feeling of being unloved, not a romantic decay, just a shortage a gardeners. Fortunately as over 65s admission was free - I'd have been very disappointed if it had cost !",

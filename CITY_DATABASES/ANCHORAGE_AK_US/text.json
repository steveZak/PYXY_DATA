        "wiki": "Chugach State Park covers 495,204 acres (2,004 square kilometers) immediately east of the Anchorage Bowl in south-central Alaska. Though primarily in the Municipality of Anchorage, a small portion of the park north of the Eklutna Lake area in the vicinity of Pioneer Peak lies within the Matanuska-Susitna Borough. Established by legislation signed into law on August 6, 1970, by Alaska Governor Keith Miller, this state park was created to provide recreational opportunities, protect the scenic value of the Chugach Mountains and other geographic features, and ensure the safety of the water supply for Anchorage. The park, managed by Alaska State Parks, is the third-largest state park in the United States, and consists of geographically disparate areas each with different attractions and facilities.  Only Anza-Borrego Desert State Park in California and Wood-Tikchik State Park in western Alaska are larger. Hunting and fishing are permitted in the Chugach under regulations established by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game for game management unit 14c. Target practice is not allowed within the park boundaries.\n\n\n== Eklutna Lake ==\n\nThe Lakeside Trail travels 12.7 miles (20.4 kilometers) along the shores of Eklutna Lake until it reaches the mile-long Eklutna Glacier Trail that leads in short order to the moraines at the foot of the colossal blue ice of Eklutna Glacier. In the summer, travelers go on foot, by mountain bike, ATV or on horseback, past the lake by way of largely flat trail to the glacier. A traverse with three huts maintained by the Mountaineering Club of Alaska begins at the end of the trail and heads over the tops of the Eklutna, Whiteout, Eagle and Raven glaciers, and ends 31 miles (50 kilometers) away at Crow Pass near Girdwood on the opposite side of the park. In wintertime, trail users are able to travel the same route by snowmobile (snowmachine), snowshoes or cross-country skis as permitted by regulation and weather conditions. As most of the trail is an old roadbed, the trail is a popular winter destination for skijoring and dogsledding.  There are two remote campgrounds in the area in addition to a frontcountry campground open during the summer. Two public use cabins are available for rent on the Lakeside Trail. Non-motorized boats, and boats with an electric motor, are allowed on Eklutna Lake. The tallest point in the park, Bashful Peak, towers over the lake at a height of 8,005 feet (2,440 meters). Bush planes are able to land on the far (southern) side of Eklutna Lake at the unpaved Bold Airstrip. North of Eklutna, the southern summit of Pioneer Peak can be reached from Knik River Road via the Pioneer Ridge Trail beginning outside the park boundaries in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough.Visitors to Eklutna Lake have the opportunity to experience a variety of plant life at different elevations. Dense forests, characteristically of white spruce (Picea glauca), paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), dominate the lower elevations. Ferns, mushrooms, and wildflowers such as dwarf dogwood (Cornus canadensis), fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium), and the parasitic northern groundcone (Boschniakia rossica) of the broomrape family cover the forest floor. At higher elevations wildflowers such as mountain avens (Dryas octopetala) and the Alaska state flower, the alpine forget-me-not (Myosotis alpestris), grow in profusion. The alpine milkvetch (Astragalus alpinus), bog wintergreen (Pyrola asarifolia) and wild geranium (Geranium erianthum) predominate on lower slopes, while further up the nootka lupine (Lupinus nootkatensis), coastal paintbrush (Castilleja unalaschcensis), prickly saxifrage (Saxifraga tricuspidata), the poisonous yellow anemone (Anemone richardsonii) and eventually the mosses of the tundra will reward hikers. Berry picking is popular in late summer and early fall. Highbush cranberries (Viburnum edule), lingonberries (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), northern redcurrants (Ribes triste) and bog blueberries (Vaccinium uliginosum) grow along the lower trails. Dwarf blueberries (Vaccinium caepitosum), alpine bearberries (Arctostaphylos alpina) and crowberries (Empetrum nigrum) are found higher up. Correctly identifying berries before consuming them is important as some species are poisonous.\n\n\n== Eagle River ==\n\nA non-profit organization in association with the park operates the Eagle River Nature Center which exhibits interpretive information on wildlife and geological features. The basin of the Eagle River can be accessed by the nearby Albert Loop Trail which passes through three miles (five kilometers) of mixed forests and leads to a river fed by glaciers hidden in the surrounding mountains. At those times in the fall when the park's ursine residents are using the area for their fishing purposes, the trail is closed so as to lessen bear-human interactions. In addition, the Rodak Nature Trail leads to a beaver and salmon viewing deck. From the trail red salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and silver salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) can be seen as they spawn, especially in August. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos ssp.) often feed on salmon in shallow water between the beaver dams. Hundreds of black bears (Ursus americanus) likewise live in the park. Area streams are excellent for birding as well. The American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus) can be seen during the winter months, which birders will also find a successful time to listen for the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) and boreal owl (Aegolius funereus). Visitors can rent yurts and cabins along the Eagle River in order to spend time out exploring the scenery and wildlife in the area. Camping is available at the Eagle River Campground.The Historic Iditarod Trail (or Crow Pass Trail)  also passes by the nature center. This popular trail travels 28 miles (45 kilometers) through the park connecting Eagle River and Girdwood as it traverses the Chugach Mountains. It affords incredible views and wildlife viewing opportunities. Even along the first view miles, hikers often see hoary marmots (Marmota caligata) and Arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii), and occasionally mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) or Dall sheep (Ovis dalli). Hoary marmots live in alpine meadows, often adjacent to boulders or talus. These furry creatures hibernate from mid-September until April or early May. In summer, they can be heard making long whistle warning calls. Mountain goats and their kids and Dall sheep with lambs can be seen feeding on slopes above the trail during the late spring and summer. Although easily mistaken for each other, mountain goats have a fashion edge over sheep\u2014their long leg hairs resemble pantaloons.\n\n\n== Hillside ==\nThe Hillside Trail System lies only 20 minutes east of downtown Anchorage. A privately run shuttle - Flattop Mountain Shuttle -  provides round-trip transportation between downtown and the Glen Alps Trailhead. A wheelchair-accessible walk of a mere quarter mile (0.4 kilometers) from the trailhead leads to a sitting area and viewing deck that overlooks the city and rewards visitors with views of the Cook Inlet and the Alaska Range 80 miles (129 kilometers) in the distance.  The trailhead is likewise the primary access to Flattop Mountain, the most hiked peak in the state. During the winter some trails in the area are prone to avalanches. Hikers are encouraged to inquire about current conditions before beginning travel in the area. The Powerline Pass Trail is a popular location for dogsledding and skijoring.Though moose (Alces alces gigas) may be seen along many of the park's trails, a more predictable and convenient spot is the viewing platform at Glen Alps in fall and early winter. Dozens of moose are often seen below the platform and across the Campbell Creek Valley to the east. Wolves (Canis lupus) and Canadian lynx (Lynx canadensis) also live in the park but are seen less frequently.  The willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus), Alaska's state bird, as well as the rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) and white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura) frequent alpine tundra and subalpine shrub thickets. Meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) by contrast live underground in alpine and tundra habitats. Hikers may hear the chirps of the singing voles (Microtus miurus). During fall, these rodents construct piles of grasses and plants near their burrows.Smaller mammals inhabiting this area include red foxes, porcupines, hares, ground squirrels, ermines, and pikas.\n\n\n== Turnagain Arm ==\n\nThe Seward Highway follows part of the southern edge of the park along Turnagain Arm.  This stretch of highway is listed as a National Scenic Byway and is designated as an All-American Road. Along Seward Highway is park headquarters located at the Potter Section House State Historic Site which once served as an important worker camp for the Alaska Railroad. There are several viewpoints along the Seward Highway. One of the most visited is Beluga Point, at milemarker 110.5, named for the beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) that frequent the area. Another popular viewpoint along the Seward Highway is Windy Corner at milemarker 106 where Dall sheep (Ovis dalli) are often visible just up the hill. The McHugh Creek Day use area features hiking trails and picnic areas. The Bird Creek Campground is located south of Anchorage off the Seward Highway. As with all campgrounds in the park, each camping site boasts a wooded spot for recreation and relaxtion, a fire ring and picnic table, with potable water and latrines nearby. Park volunteers at campgrounds and elsewhere offer assistance and answer visitor questions. Firewood is often available nearby for a small fee. Though dirt bikes are prohibited, the Bird Valley Trail System is the only location in the park open to ATVs all year round.Turnagain Arm boasts the second highest tides in North America after the Bay of Fundy.  These tides, which can reach 40 feet (12 meters), sometimes come in so quickly that they produce a wave known as a bore tide. Adventurous kayakers and surfers have taken to riding the tide as an extreme sport. Hikers should take care not to get stuck in the quicksand-like mudflats that otherwise make up the beaches along Turnagain Arm. The best place to see the Alaskan bore tide is along Seward Highway south of Anchorage, especially at Bird Point (milemarker 96).\n\n\n== Bears ==\nAs a wilderness park within easy driving distance of the largest population center in Alaska, the park has been the site of contacts between bears and humans over the years. Most of the time these encounters end peacefully, but there have been a number of maulings. In 1995 a bear was feeding on a moose kill with its cubs near the McHugh Creek trail when two hikers happened upon them. The sow killed them both. In 2007 a grizzly bear bit a woman at the Eagle River Nature Center. In 2012 a man was mauled while climbing Penguin Peak. In 2014 a brown bear mauled a runner at Bird Point. In 2017 there were two bear attacks in different areas of the park in a matter of days. A brown bear mauled three people at Eagle River and a black bear killed a teenager participating in a trail race at Bird Ridge. The black bear attack was deemed to be a predatory, rather than defensive, attack as the bear refused to leave and circled the corpse when it was located by park rangers.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Alaska state parks\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDivision of Parks and Outdoor Recreation: Chugach State Park\nEagle River Nature Center\nMap of Chugach State Park",

        "wiki": "Anchorage (officially called the Municipality of Anchorage; Dena'ina: Dgheyay Kaq') is a unified home rule municipality in the U.S. state of Alaska, on the West Coast of the United States. With an estimated 288,000 residents in 2019, it is Alaska's most populous city and contains 39.37% of the state's population; among the 50 states, only New York has a higher percentage of residents who live in its most populous city. The Anchorage metropolitan area, which includes Anchorage and the neighboring Matanuska-Susitna Borough, had a population of 396,317 in 2019, accounting for more than half the state's population. At  1,706 square miles (4,420 km2) of land area, the city is the fourth-largest by area in the United States and larger than the smallest state, Rhode Island, which has 1,212 square miles (3,140 km2).Anchorage is in Southcentral Alaska, at the terminus of the Cook Inlet, on a peninsula formed by the Knik Arm to the north and the Turnagain Arm to the south. The city limits span 1,961.1 square miles (5,079.2 km2), encompassing the urban core, a joint military base, several outlying communities and almost all of Chugach State Park.Due to its location, almost equidistant from New York City and Tokyo, Anchorage lies within \u200b9 1\u20442 hours by air of nearly 90% of the industrialized world. For this reason, Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is a common refueling stop for international cargo flights and home to a major FedEx hub, which the company calls a \"critical part\" of its global network of services.Anchorage has won the All-America City Award four times: in 1956, 1965, 1984\u201385, and 2002, from the National Civic League. Kiplinger has named it the United States' most tax-friendly city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRussian presence in south-central Alaska was well-established in the 19th century. In 1867, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward brokered a deal to purchase Alaska from Imperial Russia for $7.2 million, or about two cents an acre ($109.3 million in 2018 dollars). His political rivals lampooned the deal as \"Seward's folly,\" \"Seward's icebox,\" and \"Walrussia.\" In 1888, gold was discovered along Turnagain Arm just south of modern-day Anchorage.\n\nAlaska became an organized incorporated United States territory in 1912. Anchorage, unlike every other large town in Alaska south of the Brooks Range, was neither a fishing nor mining camp. The area surrounding Anchorage lacks significant economic metal minerals. A number of Dena'ina settlements existed along Knik Arm for years. By 1911 the families of J. D. \"Bud\" Whitney and Jim St. Clair lived at the mouth of Ship Creek and were joined there by a young forest ranger, Jack Brown, and his bride, Nellie, in 1912.The city grew from its happenstance choice as the site, in 1914, under the direction of Frederick Mears, of a railroad-construction port for the Alaska Engineering Commission. The area near the mouth of Ship Creek, where the railroad headquarters was located, quickly became a tent city. A townsite was mapped out on higher ground to the south of the tent city, greatly noted in the years since for its order and rigidity compared with other Alaska town sites. In 1915, territorial governor John Franklin Alexander Strong encouraged residents to change the city's name to one that had \"more significance and local associations\". In the summer of that year, residents held a vote to change the city's name; a plurality of residents favored changing the city's name to \"Alaska City.\" However, the territorial government ultimately declined to change the city's name. Anchorage was incorporated on November 23, 1920.Construction of the Alaska Railroad continued until its completion in 1923. The city's economy in the 1920s and 1930s centered on the railroad. Col. Otto F. Ohlson, the Swedish-born general manager of the railroad for nearly two decades, became a symbol of residents' contempt due to the firm control he maintained over the railroad's affairs, which by extension became control over economic and other aspects of life in Alaska.\n\nBetween the 1930s and the 1950s, the city experienced massive growth as air transportation and the military became increasingly important. Aviation operations in Anchorage commenced along the firebreak south of town (today's Delaney Park Strip), which residents also used as a golf course. An increase in air traffic led to clearing of a site directly east of town site boundaries starting in 1929; this became Merrill Field, which served as Anchorage's primary airport during the 1930s and 1940s, until Anchorage International Airport replaced it in 1951. However, Merrill Field still sees a significant amount of general aviation traffic.\nElmendorf Air Force Base and the United States Army's Fort Richardson were constructed in the 1940s, and served as the city's primary economic engine until the 1968 Prudhoe Bay discovery shifted the thrust of the economy toward the oil industry. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process led to the combining of the two bases (along with Kulis Air National Guard Base) to form Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.\n\nThe Good Friday earthquake of March 27, 1964, hit Anchorage hard at a magnitude of 9.2, killing 115 people and causing $116 million in damages ($0.73 billion in 2018 dollars). The earth-shaking event lasted nearly five minutes; most structures that failed remained intact for the first few minutes then failed with repeated flexing. It was the world's second-largest earthquake in recorded history. Because the geology in the city and surrounding suburban area was built on top ground consisting of glacial silt, the prolonged shaking from the earthquake caused soil liquefaction, leading to massive cracks in roadways and collapse of large swaths of land.  One of the most impacted housing areas of Anchorage, the Turnagain neighborhood, saw dozens of homes originally at 250 to 300 feet above sea level sink with the land they sat on down to sea level.  Rebuilding and recovery dominated the remainder of the 1960s.\nIn 1968, ARCO discovered oil in Prudhoe Bay on the Alaska North Slope, and the resulting oil boom spurred further growth in Anchorage. In 1975, the City of Anchorage and the Greater Anchorage Area Borough (which includes Eagle River, Girdwood, Glen Alps, and several other communities) merged into the geographically larger Municipality of Anchorage The city continued to grow in the 1980s, and capital projects and an aggressive beautification campaign took place. During this time Anchorage became known as the \"Green Apple of the Arctic.\"\nSeveral attempts have been made to move Alaska's state capital from Juneau to Anchorage \u2013 or to a site closer to Anchorage. The motivation is straightforward: the \"railbelt\" between Anchorage and Fairbanks contains the majority of the state's population. Robert Atwood, owner of the Anchorage Times and a tireless booster for the city, championed the move. Alaskans rejected attempts to move the capital in 1960 and 1962, but in 1974, as Alaska's center of population moved away from Southeast Alaska and to the railbelt, voters approved the move. Communities such as Fairbanks and much of rural Alaska opposed moving the capital to Anchorage for fear of concentrating more power in the state's largest city. As a result, in 1976 voters approved a plan to build a new capital city near Willow, about 70 miles (110 km) north of Anchorage. In the 1978 election, opponents to the move reacted by campaigning to defeat a nearly $1 billion bond issue to fund construction of the new capitol building and related facilities ($3 billion in 2018 dollars).. Later attempts to move the capital or the legislature to Wasilla, north of Anchorage, also failed. Anchorage has over twice as many state employees as Juneau, and is to a considerable extent the center of state and federal government activity in Alaska.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAnchorage is in Southcentral Alaska. At 61 degrees north, it lies slightly farther north than Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki and Saint Petersburg, but not as far north as Reykjav\u00edk or Murmansk. It is northeast of the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak Island, and Cook Inlet, due north of the Kenai Peninsula, northwest of Prince William Sound and the Alaska Panhandle, and nearly due south of Denali.\nThe city is on a strip of coastal lowland and extends up the lower alpine slopes of the Chugach Mountains. Point Campbell, the westernmost point of Anchorage on the mainland, juts out into Cook Inlet near its northern end, at which point it splits into two arms. To the south is Turnagain Arm, a fjord that has some of the world's highest tides. Knik Arm, another tidal inlet, lies to the west and north. The Chugach Mountains on the east form a boundary to development, but not to the city limits, which encompass part of the wild alpine territory of Chugach State Park.\nThe city's sea coast consists mostly of treacherous mudflats. Newcomers and tourists are warned not to walk in this area because of extreme tidal changes and the very fine glacial silt. Unwary victims have walked onto the solid seeming silt revealed when the tide is out and have become stuck in the mud. The two recorded instances of this occurred in 1961 and 1988.According to the United States Census Bureau, the municipality has an area of 1,961.1 square miles (5,079.2 km2); 1,697.2 square miles (4,395.8 km2) of which is land and 263.9 square miles (683.4 km2) of it is water. The total area is 13.46% water.\nBoroughs and census areas next to the Municipality of Anchorage are Matanuska-Susitna Borough to the north, Kenai Peninsula Borough to the south and Valdez-Cordova Census Area to the east. The Chugach National Forest, a national protected area, extends into the southern part of the municipality, near Girdwood and Portage.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n\nA diverse wildlife population exists within urban Anchorage and the surrounding area. Approximately 250 black bears and 60 grizzly bears live in the area. Bears are regularly sighted within the city. Moose are also a common sight; in the Anchorage Bowl, there is a summer population of approximately 250 moose, increasing to as many as 1,000 during the winter. They are a hazard to drivers, with over 100 moose killed by cars each year. Two people were stomped to death, in 1993 and 1995, in Anchorage. Cross-country skiers and dog mushers using city trails have been charged by moose on numerous occasions; the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has to kill some individual aggressive moose in the city every year. Mountain goats can be commonly sighted along the Seward Highway between Anchorage and Girdwood, and Dall sheep are often viewed quite close to the road at Windy Point. Approximately thirty northern timber wolves reside in the Anchorage area. In 2007 several dogs were killed by timber wolves while on walks with their owners. There are also beaver dams in local creeks and lakes, and sightings of foxes and kits in parking lots close to wooded areas in the spring are common. Along the Seward Highway headed toward Kenai, there are common sightings of beluga whales in the Turnagain Arm. Lynxes are occasionally sighted in Anchorage as well. Within the Municipality there are also a number of streams that host salmon runs. Fishing for salmon at Ship Creek next to downtown is popular in the summer.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAnchorage has a dry-summer subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Dsc) but with strong maritime influences that lead to a relatively moderate climate. Most of its precipitation falls in late summer. Average daytime summer temperatures range from approximately 55 to 78 \u00b0F (13 to 26 \u00b0C); average daytime winter temperatures are about 5 to 30 \u00b0F (\u221215.0 to \u22121.1 \u00b0C). Anchorage has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 101 days. According to local folklore, when a native plant called fireweed goes to seed after a full bloom, the first snowfall of winter is 6 weeks away.Average January low and high temperatures at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) are 11 to 23 \u00b0F (\u221212 to \u22125 \u00b0C) with an average winter snowfall of 75.5 inches (192 cm). The 2011\u20132012 winter had 134.5 in (341.6 cm), which made it the snowiest winter on record, topping the 1954\u20131955 winter with 132.8 in (337.3 cm). The coldest temperature ever recorded at the original weather station at Merrill Field on the East end of 5th Avenue was \u221238 \u00b0F (\u221238.9 \u00b0C) on February 3, 1947.Summers are mild (although cool compared to the contiguous US and even interior Alaska), and it can rain frequently, although not abundantly. Average July low and high temperatures are 52 to 66 \u00b0F (11 to 19 \u00b0C) and the highest reading ever recorded was 90 \u00b0F (32.2 \u00b0C) on July 4, 2019. The average annual precipitation at the airport is 16.63 inches (422 mm). Anchorage's latitude causes summer days to be very long and winter daylight hours to be very short. The city is often cloudy during the winter, which further decreases the amount of sunlight experienced by residents.Due to its proximity to active volcanoes, ash hazards are a significant, though infrequent, occurrence. The most recent notable volcanic activity centered on the multiple eruptions of Mount Redoubt during March\u2013April 2009, resulting in a 25,000-foot (7,600 m) high ash cloud as well as ash accumulation throughout the Cook Inlet region. Previously, the most active recent event was an August 1992 eruption of Mount Spurr, which is 78 miles (126 km) west of the city. The eruption deposited about 3 mm (0.1 in) of volcanic ash on the city. The clean-up of ash resulted in excessive demands for water and caused major problems for the Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility.\nThe average temperature of the sea ranges from 35.8 \u00b0F (2.1 \u00b0C) in February to 53.1 \u00b0F (11.7 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAnchorage first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census. It incorporated that same year. In 1975, it consolidated with its borough.\nAccording to the 2010 census, Anchorage had a population of 291,826 and its racial and ethnic composition was as follows:\nWhite: 66.0% (62.6% non-Hispanic)\nTwo or more races: 8.1%\nAsian: 8.1% (3.3% Filipino, 1.2% Korean, 1.1% Hmong)\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Natives: 7.9% (1.4% I\u00f1upiat, 1.1% Yup'ik, 0.8% Aleut)\nBlack or African American: 5.6%\nOther race: 2.3%\nNative Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders: 2.0% (1.4% Samoan)\nHispanic or Latino (of any race): 7.6% (4.4% Mexican, 1.2% Puerto Rican)\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, the largest national ancestry groups were as follows: 17.3% German, 10.8% Irish, 9.1% English, 6.9% Scandinavian (3.6% Norwegian, 2.2% Swedish, 0.6% Danish) and 5.6% French/French Canadian ancestry.According to the 2010 American Community Survey, approximately 82.3% of residents over the age of five spoke only English at home.

In total, 16.33% (43,010) of Anchorage's population aged five and older spoke a mother language other than English.As of September 7, 2006, 94 languages were spoken by students in the Anchorage School District.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAnchorage's largest economic sectors include transportation, military, municipal, state and federal government, tourism, corporate headquarters (including regional headquarters for multinational corporations) and resource extraction. Large portions of the local economy depend on Anchorage's geographical location and surrounding natural resources. Anchorage's economy traditionally has seen steady growth, though not quite as rapid as many places in the lower 48 states. With the notable exception of a real estate-related crash in the mid-to-late 1980s, which saw the failure of numerous financial institutions, it does not experience as much pain during economic downturns.\nThe Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (TSAIA) is the world's fourth busiest airport for cargo traffic, surpassed only by Memphis, Hong Kong, and Shanghai Pudong. This traffic is strongly linked to Anchorage's location along great circle routes between Asia and the lower 48. In addition, the airport has an abundant supply of jet fuel from in-state refineries in North Pole and Kenai. This jet fuel is transported to the Port of Anchorage, then by rail or pipeline to the airport.\n\nThe Port of Anchorage receives 95 percent of all goods destined for Alaska. Ships from Totem Ocean Trailer Express and Horizon Lines arrive twice weekly from the Port of Tacoma in Washington. Along with handling these activities, the port is a storage facility for jet fuel from Alaskan refineries, which is used at both TSAIA and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER).\nThe existing port was substantially built in the late 1950s and is reaching the end of its useful life. Beginning in 2017, the Port of Anchorage is undertaking an extensive 7-year Anchorage Port Modernization Project to upgrade its aging infrastructure, support larger deeper draft vessels, and future proof the port seismically and environmentally for another 75 years.\nThe United States military used to have two large installations, Elmendorf Air Force Base and Fort Richardson, which originally stemmed from the branching off of the U.S. Air Force from the U.S. Army following World War II. In a cost-cutting effort initiated by the 2005 BRAC proceedings, the bases were combined. JBER was created, which also incorporated Kulis Air National Guard Base near TSAIA. The combination of these three bases employ approximately 8,500 civilian and military personnel. These individuals along with their families comprise approximately ten percent of the local population. During the Cold War, Elmendorf became an important base due to its proximity to the Soviet Union, particularly as a command center for numerous forward air stations established throughout the western reaches of Alaska (most of which have since closed).\n\nWhile Juneau is the official state capital of Alaska, more state employees reside in the Anchorage area. Approximately 6,800 state employees work in Anchorage compared to about 3,800 in Juneau. The State of Alaska purchased the Bank of America Center (which it renamed the Robert B. Atwood Building) to house most of its offices, after several decades of leasing space in the McKay Building (now the McKinley Tower) and later the Frontier Building.\nThe resource sector, mainly petroleum, is arguably Anchorage's most visible industry, with many high rises bearing the logos of large multinationals such as BP and ConocoPhillips. While field operations are centered on the Alaska North Slope and south of Anchorage around Cook Inlet, the majority of offices and administration are found in Anchorage. The headquarters building of ConocoPhillips Alaska, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, is in downtown Anchorage. It is also the tallest building in Alaska. Many companies who provide oilfield support services are likewise headquartered outside of Anchorage but maintain a substantial presence in the city, most notably Arctic Slope Regional Corporation and CH2M Hill.\nFour small airlines, Alaska Central Express, Era Aviation, Hageland Aviation Services, and PenAir, are headquartered in Anchorage. Alaska Airlines (at one point headquartered in Anchorage, but now headquartered in the Seattle area), has major offices and facilities at TSAIA, including the offices of the Alaska Airlines Foundation. Prior to their respective dissolutions, airlines MarkAir, Reeve Aleutian Airways and Wien Air Alaska were also headquartered in Anchorage. The Reeve Building, at the corner of West Sixth Avenue and D Street, was spared the wrecking ball when the city block it sits on was cleared to make way for the Anchorage 5th Avenue Mall, and was incorporated into the mall's structure. In 2013, Forbes named Anchorage among its list of Best Places for Business and Careers.Five Alaska Native regional corporations are based in Anchorage: The Aleut Corporation, Bristol Bay Native Corporation, Calista Corporation, Chugach Alaska Corporation, and Cook Inlet Region, Inc.\nAnchorage does not levy a sales tax. However, it charges a 12% bed tax on hotel stays and an 8% tax on car rentals. Since about 2000, in response to strong revenue and occupancy rates, major hotel developers from the Lower 48 have been building new hotels along C Street from International Airport Road to just north of Tudor Road, with two more to open in 2017, making this half-mile stretch of C Street a new \"hotel row\". From Anchorage people can easily head south to popular fishing locations on the Kenai Peninsula or north to locations such as Denali National Park and Fairbanks.\n\n\n== Arts ==\n\nLocated next to Town Square Park in downtown Anchorage, the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts is a three-part complex that hosts numerous performing arts events each year. The facility can accommodate more than 3,000 persons. In 2000, nearly 245,000 people visited 678 public performances. It is home to eight resident performing arts companies and has featured mega-musicals performed by visiting companies. The center also hosts the International Ice Carving Competition as part of the Fur Rendezvous festival in February.\nThe Anchorage Concert Association brings 20 to 30 events to the community each year, including Broadway shows like Disney's The Lion King, Les Mis\u00e9rables, Mamma Mia!, The Phantom of The Opera, West Side Story, and others. The Sitka Summer Music Festival presents an \"Autumn Classics\" festival of chamber music for two weeks each September on the campus of Alaska Pacific University. Orchestras include the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra and the Anchorage Youth Symphony.\nAnnually in January, the Anchorage Folk Festival takes place at the University of Alaska Anchorage, featuring concerts, dances, and workshops with featured guest artists and over 130 performances by volunteer singers, dancers, musicians, and storytellers.\n\nAlaska Native Heritage Center\nAlaska Museum of Natural History\nAlaska Aviation Heritage Museum\nAnchorage Museum at Rasmuson Center\nOscar Anderson House Museum\nWells Fargo Alaska Heritage Library & MuseumThe city of Anchorage provides three municipal facilities large enough to hold major events such as concerts, trade shows and conventions. Downtown facilities include the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts, William A. Egan Civic & Convention Center and the recently completed Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center, which will be connected via skybridge to form the Anchorage Civic & Convention District. The Sullivan Arena hosts sporting events as well concerts and annual trade shows. \n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nNational attention focuses on Anchorage on the first Saturday of each March, when the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race kicks off with its ceremonial start downtown on Fourth Avenue. Anchorage is also home to the Fur Rendezvous Open World Championship Sled Dog Races, a three-day dog sled sprint event consisting of 3 timed races of 25.5 miles (41.0 km) each. Held each February, the event is part of the annual Fur Rendezvous, a winter sports carnival.\nAnchorage is the home of three teams in the Alaska Baseball League. The Anchorage Bucs and Anchorage Glacier Pilots, which both play at Mulcahy Stadium, and the Chugiak-Eagle River Chinooks based at Lee Jordan Field in Chugiak.Anchorage has no professional sports teams. The most recent to call the city home was the Alaska Aces of the ECHL. The Aces were very successful during their time in Anchorage, claiming three league titles, four conference championships, and eight division championship during their 29-year history (1989\u20132017).  The Aces affiliated with various National Hockey League teams during this time, including the Calgary Flames, Minnesota Wild, and Vancouver Canucks.  Following the 2016\u201317 season, the team ceased operations and were sold to a group in Portland, Maine, where they became the Maine Mariners in the 2018\u201319 season.\nThe University of Alaska Anchorage Seawolves are a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. UAA has Division I teams in gymnastics and hockey, as well as several other Division II teams. UAA sponsors the annual Great Alaska Shootout, an annual NCAA Division I basketball tournament featuring colleges and universities from across the United States along with the UAA team.\nAnchorage is the finish line for the Sadler's Ultra Challenge wheelchair race, and holds the ceremonial start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.\nThere are four rugby clubs, including the Bird Creek Barbarians RFC, Anchorage Thunderbirds, Mat Valley Maulers RFC, and Spenard Green Dragons. The season runs from April through September.\nThe Anchorage Northern Knights gained national attention when they joined the eight-team Eastern Basketball Association in 1977, a league whose nearest competitor was 5,000 miles (8,000 km) from Anchorage. The Knights captured the 1979\u201380 league championship, and featured several players who would play in the NBA, most notably Brad Davis, a future player and broadcaster for the Dallas Mavericks. They competed in the renamed Continental Basketball Association for five seasons until the economic recession ended their run in 1982.\nThe city was the U.S. candidate for hosting the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, but lost to Albertville, France and Lillehammer, Norway respectively. Anchorage is a premier cross-country skiing city, in terms of density of groomed trails within the urban core. There are 105 miles (169 km) of maintained ski trails in the city, some of which reach downtown. The same trail system also provides access to Chugach State Park, a 495,000-acre (200,000 ha) high alpine park. The Tour of Anchorage is an annual 50-kilometer ski race within the city. and is the Host for the 2009 and 2010 US Senior National Cross Country Ski Championship.Anchorage is also home to Alaska's first WFTDA flat track women's roller derby league, the Rage City Rollergirls.The Anchorage Football Stadium is also a noteworthy sports venue.\nThe 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships was played in Anchorage.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\n\n\n=== Parks, gardens, and wildlife refuges ===\nAlaska Native Heritage Center\nThe Alaska Botanical Garden has over 900 species of hardy perennials and 150 native plant species\nAlaska Zoo\nAlaska Wildlife Conservation Center\nAnchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge\nDelaney Park Strip\nKincaid Park\nPoint Woronzof Park\nFlattop Mountain Recreation Area\nWestchester Lagoon/Margaret Eagan Sullivan Park\nNumerous other city parks throughout the borough\n\n\n=== Recreational facilities ===\nArctic Valley Ski Area\nAlyeska Resort\nHilltop Ski Area\nKincaid Park\nTony Knowles Coastal Trail\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\nMoose's Tooth Pub & Pizzeria, a pub and pizzeria ranked 3rd best in the United States\nAnchorage Museum\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nAnchorage is governed by an elected mayor and 11-member assembly, with the assistance of a city manager. These positions are non-partisan (as is the case with all municipal elected offices in Alaska), and thus no candidates officially run under any party banner. All eleven members are elected from districts known as sections. Five of the sections elect two members from designated seats, while the remaining section elects one member. Prior to the 1980 United States Census, the single-member section was the one centered around the northern Anchorage communities of Chugiak and Eagle River. Since that census, the area encompassing Downtown Anchorage and surrounding neighborhoods has served as the city's single-member section. The mayor (along with members of the school board) is elected in a citywide vote. In practice, however, the party affiliation and political ideology of major candidates are usually well known, and is highlighted by local media for the purposes of framing debate. The city's mayor is Ethan Berkowitz, a registered Democrat. Along with 7 sister cities in the SCI program, Anchorage has a cultural exchange program with the former Yugoslavia nation of Montenegro.\nThe Anchorage Assembly gained national publicity following their 2017 municipal election, when two openly gay candidates (Christopher Constant and Felix Rivera) were successfully elected into the eleven-member council \u2013 becoming the first openly gay candidates ever elected into Anchorage public office.Anchorage generally leans toward Republican candidates in both state and presidential elections. However, since the establishment of the municipality in 1975, there have been two Democratic mayors (Tony Knowles and Mark Begich) who have been elected to two consecutive terms and later to statewide office. Downtown, Girdwood, and much of both the west and east parts of town trend Democratic. However, areas closest to the military bases \u2013 including Eagle River \u2013 and south Anchorage are the most Republican areas of the Municipality. Midtown is relatively moderate by comparison.\nVoting trends show that Downtown Anchorage votes Democratic in large margins, while Spenard, Turnagain/Inlet View, and University/Airport Heights are relatively moderate and swing in elections. The remaining Anchorage area votes Republican. In 2018, Anchorage began conducting municipal elections by mail (as directed by the assembly in 2015) and had the highest voter turnout in the city's history.Anchorage-Eagle River sends 16 representatives (as of 2018 9 Republicans and 7 Democrats) to the 40-member Alaska House of Representatives and eight senators (5 Republicans and 3 Democrats) to the 20-member Senate. When seats from the neighboring Mat-Su Borough are added, more than half of the Alaska state legislature comes from the Anchorage metropolitan area. This is often used as an argument in favor of moving the state capital from Juneau to a location in the Anchorage area.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nWith a reported strength of 383 sworn officers, the Anchorage Police Department is the largest police department in the state, serving an area of 159 square miles with a population of 300,950. Until 2016, Alaska State Troopers provided policing for the southern regions of Anchorage along Turnagain Arm. After their withdrawal, Girdwood contracted with the neighboring city of Whittier for its policing, and the following year APD provided contract policing to other Turnagain Arm communities. The Fire & EMS Operations Division of the Anchorage Fire Department (AFD) includes thirteen fire stations with over 300 personnel covering three rotating 24-hour shifts. Additionally, there are volunteer fire departments in Girdwood and Chugiak and fire departments on Elmendorf Air Force Base and Fort Richardson, as well as the Airport Police and Fire Department.\nIn 2010, Anchorage reported 837.7 violent crimes per 100,000 population and 3,518.0 property crimes per 100,000 population (see table). Anchorage's crime rate, both for violent and property crimes, is higher than for Alaska as a whole or for the U.S. as a whole. When compared with U.S. cities of similar size, Anchorage has a slightly higher rate of violent crime and a slightly lower rate of property crime. Anchorage, and Alaska in general, have very high rates of sexual assault in comparison with the rest of the country, with Anchorage's annual rate of forcible rapes over three times as high as for the U.S. as a whole. In 2010, the rate of rape for Anchorage was 90.9 per 100,000 population, while the U.S. rate was 27.5 per 100,000 population. Alaska Natives are victimized at a much higher rate than their representation in the population.The Anchorage Community Survey, a public survey conducted in 2004\u20132005 by the Justice Center at University of Alaska Anchorage, found that overall, Anchorage residents are fairly satisfied with the performance of the Anchorage Police Department. Most survey respondents perceived the justice system to be \"somewhat effective\" or \"very effective\" at apprehending and prosecuting criminal suspects, bringing about just outcomes, and reducing crime.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nPublic education in Anchorage, Eagle River, Chugiak, Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force Base is managed by the Anchorage School District, the 87th largest district in the United States, with nearly 50,000 students attending 98 schools. There are also a number of choices in private education, including both religious and non-denominational schools.\nAnchorage has four higher-education facilities that offer bachelor's or master's degrees: the University of Alaska Anchorage, Alaska Pacific University, Charter College, and the Anchorage campus of Texas-based Wayland Baptist University. The University of Alaska Fairbanks also has a small Center for Distance Education downtown. Other continuing education facilities in Anchorage include the Grainger Leadership Institute, Nine Star Enterprises, CLE International, Nana Worksafe, and PackBear DBA Barr & Co.\nNinety percent of Anchorage's adults have high-school diplomas, 65 percent have attended one to three years of college, and 17 percent hold advanced degrees.Anchorage has the most ethnically diverse schools in the United States, including the three most diverse high schools, the three most diverse middle schools, and the 19 most diverse elementary schools. Even the least diverse schools in Anchorage rank in the top 1% nationally.The Chugach School District operates neighborhood schools in Valdez\u2013Cordova Census Area, Alaska, as well as the supplementary Voyage to Excellence Residential School in Anchorage; its board office is in Anchorage. The Aleutian Region School District, which operates schools in areas of the Aleutian Islands, has its district administrative offices in Anchorage.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nAnchorage's leading newspaper is the Anchorage Daily News, a citywide daily newspaper. Other newspapers include the Alaska Star, serving primarily Chugiak and Eagle River, the Anchorage Press, a free weekly covering mainly cultural topics, and The Northern Light, the student newspaper of the University of Alaska Anchorage. Anchorage's major network television affiliates are KTUU 2 (NBC), KTBY 4 (Fox), KYES 5 (MyNetworkTV), KAKM 7 (PBS), KTVA 11 (CBS), KYUR 13 (ABC/CW), and KDMD 33 (Ion/Telemundo). Anchorage is one hour behind the Pacific Time Zone, and receives the same network feed as the West Coast. Weekday primetime runs from 7 to 10 pm. Effectively, programs are viewed at the same local hour as those in the Central Time Zone. The city's only cable television provider is General Communication, Inc. (GCI). However, Dish Network and DirecTV offer satellite television service in Anchorage and the surrounding area; and uses East Coast feeds.\nThere are many radio stations in Anchorage; see List of radio stations in Alaska for more information.\n\n\n== Health and utilities ==\n\nProvidence Alaska Medical Center on Providence Drive in Anchorage is the largest hospital in Alaska and is part of Providence Health & Services in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California. It features the state's most comprehensive range of services. Providence Health System has a history of serving Alaska, beginning when the Sisters of Providence of Montreal first brought health care to Nome in 1902. As the territory grew during the following decades, so did efforts to provide care. Hospitals were opened in Fairbanks in 1910 and Anchorage in 1937.\nAlaska Regional Hospital on DeBarr Road opened in 1958 as Anchorage Presbyterian Hospital, downtown at 825 L Street. This predecessor to Alaska Regional was a joint venture between local physicians and the Presbyterian Church. In 1976 the hospital moved to its present location on DeBarr Road, and is now a 254-bed licensed and accredited facility. Alaska Regional has expanded services and in 1994, Alaska Regional joined with HCA, one of the nation's largest healthcare providers.\nAlaska Native Medical Center on Tudor Road provides medical care and therapeutic health care to Alaska natives \u2013 229 tribes \u2013 at the Anchorage site and at 15 satellite facilities throughout the state. ANMC specialists also travel to clinics in the bush to provide care. The 150-bed hospital is also a teaching center for the University of Washington's regional medical education program. ANMC houses an office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and Southcentral Foundation jointly own and manage ANMC.\nThe Municipal Light & Power (ML&P) and Chugach Electric Association provide electricity to the city. A municipally owned utility since 1932, ML&P supplies electric power to more than 30,000 residential and commercial customers in the Anchorage area. Chugach Electric Association is a not-for-profit, member-owned cooperative that was formed in 1948.\nMost homes have natural gas-fueled heat. ENSTAR Natural Gas Company is the sole provider for Anchorage, servicing some 90-percent of the city's population.\nThe Municipality of Anchorage owns and operates the Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility, serving some 55,000 customer accounts with water from Eklutna Lake, which is mainly meltwater from Eklutna Glacier. Anchorage Municipal Solid Waste Services and Anchorage Refuse conduct trash removal in the city depending on location.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Major Highways ===\n AK-1\n AK-3In everyday discourse, Alaskans do not use numerical route designations, preferring instead the named designations\u2014in this case the Seward Highway and the Glenn Highway.\n\n\n==== Highway to Highway ====\n\nOn and off since the 1960s, the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities, in coordination with the Federal Highway Administration and the Municipality of Anchorage (or the lineal predecessors of those entities), have been exploring the concept of a roadway connecting the endpoints of the Seward and Glenn highways. The project is called \"Highway to Highway\", and the most recent concept for this project is that of a \"trenched\" freeway through the heart of Anchorage.\nHighway to Highway was included in the 2005 Long Range Transportation Plan, and would cost at least $575 million ($726 million in 2018 dollars). \u2013 by far the largest urban infrastructure project in Alaska's history.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nAnchorage has a bus system called People Mover, with a hub in downtown Anchorage and satellite hubs at Dimond Center and Muldoon Mall. The People Mover provides carpool organization services. The public paratransit service known as AnchorRides provides point-to-point accessible transportation services to seniors and those who experience disabilities.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe Alaska Railroad offers year-round freight service along the length of its rail system between Seward (the southern terminus of the system), Fairbanks (the northern terminus of the system), and Whittier (a deep water, ice-free port). Daily passenger service is available during summer (May 15 \u2013 September 15), but is reduced to one round-trip per week between Anchorage and Fairbanks during the winter. Passenger terminals exist at Talkeetna, Denali National Park, Fairbanks, and several other locations. These communities are also served by bus line from Anchorage. The Ship Creek Shuttle connects downtown with the Ship Creek area, including stops at the Alaska Railroad depot.\nAnchorage also is conducting a feasibility study on a commuter rail and light rail system. For the commuter rail system, Anchorage would use existing Alaska Railroad tracks to provide service to Whittier, Palmer, Seward, Wasilla, and Eagle River.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\n\nThe Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, 6 miles (9.7 km) south of downtown Anchorage, is the airline hub for the state, served by many national and international airlines, including Seattle-based Alaska Airlines as well as many intrastate airlines and charter air services. The airport is the primary international air freight gateway in the nation. By weight, five percent of the value of all United States international air cargo moved through Anchorage in 2008. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, it was briefly the busiest airport in the United States due to sustained volume of cargo flights through Alaska while passenger travel sharply decreased in other American airports. Next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is Lake Hood Seaplane Base, the largest Seaplane Base in the world. Merrill Field, a general aviation airport on the edge of downtown, was the 87th-busiest airport in the nation in 2010. There are also ten smaller private (mostly Department of Transportation) general aviation airports within the city limits.\nList of airports in the Municipality of Anchorage\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nAnchorage has seven sister cities.\n Chitose, Japan\n Darwin, Australia\n Harbin, China\n Incheon, South Korea\n Magadan, Russia\n Troms\u00f8, Norway\n Whitby, United Kingdom\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAnchorage Fire Department\nAnchorage by singer Michelle Shocked.\nList of aerospace museums\nList of tallest buildings in Anchorage\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Anchorage, Alaska\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPreston Jones.

          "This museum is truly a gem in Anchorage! Take your kids! The native peoples display from the Smithsonian is detailed and very well done. So much to look at and appreciate. My children (2, 5 & 10) enjoyed brief browsing but I could have spent hours! The art gallery had lovely",

          "We went to the market being held at the museum and found it frankly unimpressive, but we took the day to go around the museum and see the new expansions at the museum. That was awesome - lots of interactive options and some truly magnificent pieces.",
          "I am really grateful for having stopped at the museum. I received a AAA discount on admission. Discounts are also available for military as well. This museum is a place of fascination and you can\u2019t help but walk away with a genuine appreciation for the amazing people of",

          "About 4 levels of exhibits (one closed off due to the earthquake damage)> some of the exhibits you can interact with, some are educational about the environment, the indigenous people> some give you a new take on that which is under your very nose.",
          "Big museum and it was walking distance from shops and major departmental store. Worth dropping by for a visit to know more about the natives.",
          "As stated previously, the most interesting exhibits were closed due to ongoing repair of damage caused by the earthquake in 11/18. The rest of the exhibits were limited. Sydney Laurence's landscapes were beautiful. The Museum of the North in Fairbanks is a much better investment",
          "This museum is larger than it would appear outside. I advise starting from the top floor and working your way doesn't. There's a kids area, science, planetarium, game room, coffee stand. It was a great first stop on our trip in Anchorage. Plus bonus, the views of the mountains",
          "Since major exhibits were closed due to damage from earthquake in November 2018 the visit was a disappointment. The exhibits on polar bear and walrus were ads for global warming\u2014little information on the animals themselves. The exhibit in Gertrude Svarny (?) was very good and",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. I found the exhibits very balanced in terms of presentation. There is a beautiful gallery up top showcasing young indigenous artists, there is an extensive gallery about the history of Alaska, and the art collection is extensive. A beautiful",
          "If you are used to the mega museums of New York City, you may not be as impressed, but it is an excellent slice of Alaskan history and art. Great interactive exhibits and everything is well documented. Where else are you going to find flaming pink feather polar bear along with",

          "I said \u201cinsightful \u201c because there were many areas of the museum that had really good local NAI artists and village specific presentations of their culture and heritage. What was disappointing were the areas of the museum that were closed due to the 7.2 earthquake that did",
          "I\u2019ve gone to readings there and even read some of my own work at one of the events at the museum. The place has really upgraded itself considerably.

          "What a wonderful experience going floor to floor to appreciate the many exhibits. We were lucky enough to see the display by the Smithsonean on Alaskan tribes and their may wares, clothes and ways. I could spend hours and hours there! We were also lucky to be there for a",
          "Walked in last night to check out the post expansion. What a disappointment. So, there are unique features, the imaginarium still rocks, the museum of the north is good, and the planetarium is still a great feature. Anchorage is striving to make itself a great place for",
          "We are not that big on museums, but this one is great for children. There is a lot hands-on activities. Kids don't even realize how much they are learning. I, as an adult, enjoyed it too.",

          "Lower level is children\u2019s science & hands on. Upper level is Alaskan heritage & I felt like I was in the Smithsonian. I enjoyed it- kids not do much. Until I pointed out that seal intestine provided the waterproof property for many indigenous jackets. Computer simulations were",

          "I had a long layover and went here not knowing too much about it. I wandered and viewed everything I could in 3 hours. I wish I had several more hours to visit.It was way bigger then I ever imagined and overwhelming with high end displays. Truly a treat! Lots of effort and time",
          "I have traveled to over 70 countries and almost all the US states in the last 50 years and this museum is a stunner. The day started out wet so we went to the Anchorage Museum. This was our third trip to Anchorage and we had already seen all the outdoor stuff, some more than",

          "I thought this would be a mildly interesting museum, worth no more than an hour of my time. And when I looked at the pop art renditions of Alaskan archeology and anthropology \u2014 the first exhibit upon entering, I guessed a half hour would do. But hang in there. The exhibits get",
          "This museum is such an amazing place, full of Alaskan history. There are currently 3 floors for people to explore, a snack section to purchase items from, a restaurant and a gift shop. The bathrooms are unusual to me. The faucet is the water faucet and the air dispenser to dry",
          "There is so much to see, and a couple of galleries were not filled that day. I started with viewing a display of dinosaur fossils with drawings and explanations of 'family trees' of prehistoric creatures; I moved to a very large collection of First People artifacts such as",

          "An outstanding museum that combines beautiful art, the history of the native Alaskans and the and the rapid expansion into our 49th state. I highly recommend the Smithsonian exhibit for a look into the lives of the native people. The gift shop offers beautiful handmade jewelry",

          "The Anchorage Museum did not exist when I was last in the city in the early 1980s. It is a museum that the city and the entire state--no, the entire country--should be proud of. It is in the same class with any of the Smithsonian museums. And the Alaska Native artifacts exhibit",
          "The Museum provides access to history, art, and the science of Alaska--- unusual because it provides a comprehensive view of this amazing state. I spent four hours there!",
          "I had heard great things about this museum\u2019s native exhibits and I was not disappointed! What I was surprised to experience however, was the historical exhibits detailing many aspects of Alaska life for Americans in WW2 as well as how more modern events are changing how Alaskans",

          "I've been to Anchorage so many times and never visited the museum! What a mistake!! It is easy to get from floor to floor, and the exhibits are well thought out, with a nice flow from one to another. Time was limited, but will visit the next time in Anchorage",
          "There was so much to see here, we wished we\u2019d had more time. There was an exhibit on native tribes that was incredibly well done, done in a collaboration with the Smithsonian. The restaurant was good, too. Allow plenty of time!",
          "We spent almost an entire day here and there was so much to see! We ate lunch in the cafeteria and the service and food were great! We also went to the planetarium to see a show about the Northern Lights and it was well done. Definitely worth a visit if you have the time",
          "Visited this museum twice, in 2013 and this month. Normally, once at a museum is enough. To me, highlight exhibit at this museum is the Native Alaskans exhibit borrowed from the Smithsonian Museum. Fascinating artifacts and videos.",
          "The museum had a temporary, but very enjoyable exhibit of nationally known artists (including Georgia O'Keefe) but the best part was extensive exhibits on the culture of the native tribes in Alaska. Showing how the tribes differed while sharing some characteristics. Nice",
          "The museum hosts a mix of art and static displays of wildlife. Up close and well showcased exhibits of Alaska treasures.",
          "We visited the museum, basically killing time before picking up our son from the airport. We spent 2 hours, but could easily have stayed another hour. The displays are tastefully laid out and chock full of information. The jewel of the museum was the 3rd floor Smithsonian",
          "I live in a large city that has many museums. The Anchorage Museum is a good size museum, with lots of great Native Alaskan heritage and information. Not too keen on the political art displays, but that\u2019s always up for interpretation. Great discover area for kids of all ages.",

          "The best way to kill a few hours until return trip home. The museum architecture was beautiful as well the interior. The displays about the native Alaskans were so interesting.",
          "especuialy when compared to the museums in Juneau and Fairbanks..more concerned with making a political statement than telling the story..ugh!",
          "This is a really cool museum. I learned about the geographical and cultural importance of Alaska before, and after becoming a state. There\u2019s cool art in here too. I highly recommend placing this on your Alaska to-do list. Is it worth $18? Yes, absolutely. You can spend all day",
          "The best part of this was the Smithsonian exhibit lent to them for display. The history of Alaska exhibit was only from about just before the Alaska purchase to the present. It had nothing about the Bering land bridge and the migration of people.",
          "This was a fun way to spend a morning. We paid extra to see the planetarium show about Sounds. We were the only ones in the whole planetarium, but the young lady running that activity made it so much fun for us, even through there wasn't a huge crowd. There are lots of",
          "I was not expecting this! The Art was a spectacular mix of ancient Alaskan cultures and modernity. There were galleries where my jaw dropped in amazement. We only had time for a few hours but a careful examination of the contents and presentation could take all day! The wide",

          "We attended the museum on the last (rainy) day of a fabulous Alaskan vacation. It was the perfect capstone to an immersion into the natural, historical, and cultural beauty of our fascinating 49th state. I'm from Chicago, home of many world-class museums, and I was impressed how",
          "There are 4 floors of exhibits to see here and it's best to start at the top and for your way down. It's Art, Natural History, Native History, Local History and more. Highly Recommend it!!",
          "Really well thought out museum making lots of info and art really accessible. Occupied a rainy afternoon really well. Especially good on the history of the Inuits and Alaska. 18 dollars per adult but encouraged by the rain felt this was worth it.",

          "This is a large museum and you\u2019ll probably want several hours to visit. If you can only stay a little while, head over to the Alaska exhibit, which is one of the best immersive experiential museums I\u2019ve seen. You\u2019ll learn about Alaska from a lot of different points of views and",
          "There is more than just a little something for everyone at this excellent museum. Culture, history, art, & science for children (but our young adult family members loved the science area). We wish we gave ourselves more time. I also recommend purchasing the Director's edited",

          "In July 2018, we went for a second visit to this museum. We went to revisit a particular exhibit we had seen a few years ago. Alas, that exhibit was gone but the replacement was just as interesting. The museum offers a variety of exhibits, e.g., natural history, native",
          "I am very proud of this museum and I always bring our guests here. The Alaska Native exhibit on the 2nd floor should not be missed. Exhibits on the third floor continue to change. The new wing on the second floor (down a hallway) is beautiful and the display of Alaska painters",
          "Two top floors had temporary exhibits that were nice but the real treat is on the second floor where each tribe\u2019s art and traditions are nicely displayed. They are sponsored by the Smithsonian and the professional touch is very evident.",
          "I grew up in NY surrounded by museums. This one combines heart, soul, education, & experience. We spent an easy 3 hours here & saw everything. The range of exhibits was most surprising. This is a must!",
          "Nice museum with lots of things to do and see. Had only one hour and checked out the Discovery center. Impressive.",
          "If you are looking for Alaska heritage go to the 2nd floor or go to the Wells Fargo museum. If you want to visit an art gallery this is very nice. We were looking for the heritage portion and were not really interested in a gallery.",
          "The museum is a \"gem\" for a city the size of Anchorage. The focus is on locally focused art. Be certain to visit the Smithsonian exhibit to learn much about the Alaska Native heritage. The new East Wing is fabulous. Also, their cafe has wonderful food and coffee is great.",

          "It\u2019s a four story museum with many interactive/hands on exhibits. They have areas for kids to craft, as well as tanks with super cool sea life. The entire second floor is designated to Inuit history, which was phenomenal! They do offer student and military discount, which helps.",
          "We arrived a bit late to the museum and had only a little over an hour to explore it, but we loved the main exhibit on native culture and tribes. It helped shape our experience and understanding of the rest of our road trip to Alaska.",

          "Visual tour of the natives of Alaska looking at what they produced, used, wore etc The museum collection makes it live. We had a group tour with a guide. I felt it was too much into minutiae. I also feel that basic history should be accurate. (The wrong year for the Alaska",
          "We spent over 3 hours there, and for me it was a bit too little... As a guide recommended us, we started from the top floor and went down. This mean, we started from contemporary art (I LOVE) and we finished with archeological findings. I appreciated a lot all the modern",
          "So many examples of art, culture and how the people of this great state live and lived it is breathtaking.",
          "We came to the Museum because it was our Bus departing point for travelling north to Denali. I glad we had time to visit the Museum and although it was short I was very impressed with exhibition layout and standard. There is also a very good Restaurant and Gift shop, which have",
          "Riding through, I didn't have a lot of time and chose this one museum. Street parked and then realized they have under ground parking at five dollars? I thought the Museum was a little high priced at twenty dollars. They did have free lockers which was nice. I was pleasantly",
          "I have been to many museums and this may be one of the best. It was like an art/natural history/science museum all rolled in one. Good food/coffee/museum store.",
          "Lots of native clothing on display. Some of the adults were having as much fun as the kids in the hands on area where they were making giant bubbles that you could pull over your head for a few seconds. A lot of art on display.",
          "We really liked this museum, a lot. We were told to start on the 4th floor and come down, which we did, finding surprises on every floor. Native Alaskan artifacts in great display, natural history, a hands-on area for kids, and a variety of fascinating art. All of it was",
          "We spent and afternoon at the Anchorage Museum. I\u2019m giving it 3 starts because it has 4 floors and half of the floors (4th and 3rd) are art rather than history or museum displays. The 2nd floor has all the Alaskan and native museum displays. It is awesome! The 1st floor",
          "I usually find museums to be somewhat interesting, but never anything that exciting. Definitely not how I felt about the Anchorage Museum! This place is fantastic and worth spending a few hours in for sure! It is packed with beautiful displays, tons of information, and lots",
          "Visited this Museum, as the one we actually wanted to see (Science & Nature) was closed. More art gallery than museum. Did have nice displays of the various indigenous groups, but apart from that a bit boring and appeared more suited to adults and history buffs rather than",
          "We really enjoyed this museum even though it is quite small. We collect contemporary indigenous art and the small Smithsonian collection was excellent. The Muse cafe is also great for lunch.",
          "We were in Anchorage for a day in June and had some time prior to traveling the Alaska Railroad to Denali. The museum had been recommended to my wife and I by a friend so we decided to go and we were not disappointed. It provides a great introduction to Alaska, it's history,",
          "Very well done and well displayed. Art floors are superb, Smithsonian research floor outstanding. Good summary of state history as well.",
          "We took a guided tour of the collection of artifacts on loan from the Smithsonian. It is an excellent collection of clothes, foot wear, masks, weapons, and much more from different native tribes. In addition to this exhibition the mu seaum also has a permanent collection of art",
          "This is a very large museum. While most of the first floor contains child-friendly exhibits, the native cultural exhibits on the second floor were by far the most interesting part of the museum to me. There is much to see here - even a planetarium (which I did not go to).",
          "Modern spacious building with a great mix of modern art and exhibits from the native cultures of Alaska.",

          "This was an excellent location to view art and culture.  I was especially impressed by the Native Alaskan cultural displays.   The displays had excellent and detailed information available to tell you what you were viewing.",
          "If you are not into museums skip it. You will save money \ud83d\ude42",
          "Informational and lots to see.",
          "Fascinating! There were many sections to walk around. \n\nHowever, the people at the front desk will tell you to start at the top and work your way downstairs, but if you\u2019re NOT from Alaska, I would do the opposite. While I was there the top \u2026",
          "The lights on the 2nd floor were so dim, it was hard to see and read the displays. \nIt was very cool seeing all the artifacts. The layout wasn't wasn't very intuitive, though. Didn't see all the different tribes until we looked through all \u2026",
          "Really love the newest expansion and direction the museum is going, taking on a more modern and diverse artistic approach. Easy to spend more time on site, enjoying coffee in the atrium in between viewing all the great new installations. Best new central creative social hub.",
          "Its a pretty good museum. I really like their exhibits on the history of Alaska and Natives. It's pretty interesting. The couple times I've visited they always had something different than the last. It still is pretty exciting to visit every time!",
          "Super smaller museum with a surprisingly impressive Arctic section and tons of exciting displays",
          "Fantastic museum, world class!",
          "It's very well done but several of the interactive/hands on exhibits were broken the day we visited. Wide range of displays for all ages and interests.",
          "Excellent overall. Worth a visit but plan on at least 2-4hrs. Great rainy day activity.",
          "A great start to our trip. We learned a lot about the Inuit from the art and displays and they had a great 'science' area. We loved the historical exhibits as well. Its a part of Alaska that you don't get to hear about living on mainland \u2026",
          "Provided meaningful insight about Alaska.",
          "I actually liked it more than I had expected. Reached here around closing time but that hour spent was well worth it.",
          "Absolutely love the new wing. It is a beautiful museum and they always have interesting changing exhibits. The Imaginarium is wonderful for kids. Exhibit openings and dinner downtown make for a fantastic evening out.",
          "A new look and many new exhibits!\n\nThe Anchorage Museum is a great place to spend the afternoon.  Parking is either street or a distant parking garage.  There is a large outdoor area with grass, trees, and benches.  A bus stop is also right \u2026",
          "This was a great place to come learn about some of Alaska's history. There was a great section for kids too. My inner child couldn't be restrained and had fun with some of the activities. I would definitely want to bring my kids back here given the chance.",
          "I was very impressed with the museum.  It displayed the history of the the State of Alaska and Anchorage in educational and colorful ways. Loved the 3 hours I spent there.",
          "Exhibit on Russia and Alaska was phenomenal - I hope it becomes permanent! Really well curated and laid out museum. Perfect way to spend a few hours. ",
          "We had only 1 hour so hard to judge the whole museum. We concentrated on the 2nd floor after a brief visit to the 3rd mostly art but not my favorite!\nThe service floor had many TV with self running shows that are ok, not sure if they are \u2026",
          "Amazing place!! You can spend 2-5 h easily... Modernized and audio-visual a lots of Screens,movies and pics as well as interactive place ,not just a boring museum :) Was a pleasure to explore it :) ",
          "Fun place for the kids, we parents enjoyed our visit also. The Planetarium has a wide variety of shows that change from week to week. The Spark lab has tons if hands on experiments and projects for the kids and the Discovery center has a \u2026",
          "Best thing I saw downtown. Loved the russia exhibit. A lot of the space was closed for renovations summer 2017. I wish the ticket had been discounted. Don't get tricked paying for their parking. Cheaper is only 2 blocks away",
          "Excellent for all ages, it\u2019s a mix of children\u2019s museums, science museums, and art museums. Had a great time with the kids for many hours!",
          "Nice variety of art.  Less history than expected but a pleasant visit.",
          "A+. This museum is a must do in Anchorage. I was beyond impressed by the well crafted, beautifully designed, expansive space they have here. \n\nTruly a joy to walk through and experience during my time in Alaska. Will be back for sure!",
          "The museum itself was great.  Very good value and had exhibits that focused mainly early state history, Russia, and the Native Americans that live here.  The cafe left to be desired, I tried to eat there, but after waiting 10 minutes for a \u2026",
          "This museum had a little bit of everything and it looks to be getting a major expansion.  The upper floors had beautiful collections of native art, and artifacts, and an interesting display on life in the more remote parts of the state. \u2026",
          "Great place to visit even if you did not think there even was a museum in Alaska. I went to the Lego event in May 2014. I enjoyed it quite frankly. However i expected more in that",
          "Impressive museum that exceeded expectations of what you'd find in Anchorage. Smithsonian-run with friendly staff and topical displays. I enjoyed learning about Alaska's historical connections to Russia.",
          "Enjoyable. Too much to go through in a day. I'd recommend the Native Heritage Museum over the exhibit on native culture here. Lots of artwork. I did enjoy the I am Inuit exhibit. ",
          "Fantastic exhibition. Great for kids. Also great coffee",
          "The Smithsonian floor was great, and I could happily spend days there. Personally I would skip the upper floors because the \"art\" is of the\"I hope they didn't waste a lot of money on that\" persuasion. Actually, there is a lovely view of the mountains from the 4th floor, so you might go up for that.",
          "All your visit needs is a trip to our AK Museum of History",
          "Super museum depicting Alaskan & native heritage! Lots of great exhibits and interesting art work.",
          "We had an excellent time at this museum.  I learned a lot about how Alaska became a U.S. state, and it was well presented.  Many museums jam-pack you in, but this museum was airy and not claustrophobic. Large elevators that opened their \u2026",
          "Loved the Lunch on the lawn concert.  Good times \ud83d\ude0e",
          "Good for a half hour at best. One floor of artifacts which were pretty good but the rest was a few stale pictures and films. You can find as much online in about 15minutes.",
          "As a travel agent:\nYou are always told \"Do not touch it\" IF you break it -you pay for it. Well at this Center you are encouraged to \nTouch it. That's right...a museum that allows you to play! Make a giant bubble or feel a tornado.Of course \u2026",
          "Just went through the Anchorage Museum and what a disappointment.  This place is terrible.  Worst museum I have ever been in.  I have more items in my house than they have in this entire museum  ! Terrible.  Just terrible.",
          "Went in on a Sunday because it was snowing and couldn't do much around town. Back in Chicago we have world class museums and I was impressed by this museum! Honestly, I thought the museum would be very dry but I was surprised by the \u2026",
          "Very very sad. It was very disappointing, it used to be a place of wonder and enjoyment, now it has wrong history facts and is very ''goth'' lots of black walls and very dim lighting. I suggest they remodel it again so we can actually go there and enjoy it.",
          "I like listening to stories. Looking at art and displays. Slow time/ real time was perfect start place.",
          "Great museum. All you want to know about Alaska, the inuit culture and the historical ties to Russia. Also a great science museum for kids and adults in the ground floor.",
          "Love this museum. Great for kids too",
          "F#@$ing closed on Mondays.  I suppose i should have checked that out rather than spend $12 on parking across the road. There's a lot of vagrants out front. Don't let them deter you. Even if it is freaking Monday.   Stupid Monday",
          "A world class museum. Really. \n\nWe went with the kids and they loved all the hands on stuff - not just for little ones but up to high teens. The story of Alaska was also very well done and the native peoples exhibit was stunning. \n\nModern and beautiful building with a calm atmosphere \n\nReturnable 25c lockers for the win. ",
          "Very interesting! Visited it in April 2016 and still have great memories! Highly recommended",
          "Great museum! modern, informative and interactive for children and adults!",
          "Great museum. Could spend hours there. Have a great kids play area and a cafe for food. ",
          "If you only have one day in Anchorage, make sure you put this on your list! The museum is state of the art, and there are plenty of interactive exhibits for children (and adults, too).",
          "Amazing museum, especially for the price! Highly recommend going, especially to check out Alaska Native history curated by the Smithsonian I believe (At least that is what I saw on the wall).",
          "Although we primarily visit the imaginarium, their other exhibits never disappoint.   In the past the human body exhibits, the Lego exhibits, and the Alaskana displays are top notch.",
          "One stop place for complete Alaska history",
          "First fridays at the museum are the best",
          "Must see when in anchorage.",
          "The new remodelisation of the museum is AMAZING!! Well done. The exhibits are even better.",
          "It\u2019s easy to spend some time here, there is a wide variety things you can do.",
          "Best museum I've ever been to. The amount of information is astonishing. You have to use the technology to really access everything.",
          "Great place to discover Alaska",
          "2 Hours is never enough time to visit. My kids love the Discovery Centre area and even the adults get to learn some things too",
          "A++, 10/10 wood visit again. \n\"Pop Culture\" exhibit is fantastic.",
          "Nice restaurant inside with good menu choices.",
          "I visited the museum as an educator last week, and was sadly disappointed in the change. In the past I have been delighted with the offerings for children, the varied and interesting exhibits and activities. Now it is bare, dark and  so lacking.",
          "Waste of $15. 3rd floor had a few interesting items. Many photos and some Indian clothing. Undergoing renovations in summer of 2017 so some areas are closed.",
          "Beautiful exhibits! The Smithsonian Arctic Studies Center has amazing artifacts and displays -- out of the park!",
          "Overall nice museum. I especially liked the children's area.",
          "It has so many items displayed and things to do, you should plan a 2 day visit. It's one of my favorite museums.",
          "Excellent place.  Just ducked in to get out of the rain stayed five hours.",
          "So I rate this 4 instead of 5 because it caters to an older crowd, and more specifically, one that is interested in the great history of Alaska.  The museum hosts a small collection of alsakan history items, such as the cessation decree and \u2026",
          "I love taking my grandkids there for a day of fun!  They vary in ages from 8-24 years old.  We all have a grand time!  I purchased a grandparent annual membership so I could take them more often.  WOW, it has paid off because we can eat \u2026",
          "Great for kids in a variety of ages.",
          "Not all site what to expect.  Half of the exhibitions are closed for refurbing. The entire 3rd floor is closed as well.  I imagine in the spring this world be more interesting",
          "Very nice enjoyable",
          "Great museum",
          "My boys and I love this museum. We are members and enjoy spending going once a month or more.  Of course they love \"The Imaginarium\" and \"The Planetarium\" love seeing them smile!",
          "Pretty freaking cool! Staff super friendly and insightful. ",
          "Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of exhibits at this museum. I would recommend this as a great \"1st attraction\" for visiting out of towners. Wealth of knowledge on all things Alaska. ",
          "I really enjoyed this museum. A great way to spend an afternoon. The art was really cool, made cooler if you takw the time to read the placques. Staff was friendly. ",
          "Absolutely beautiful!! I could spend hours here.",
          "Like the new exhibit except for the mask with the razor blades which needs it.  Seemed like security was following me around on a free day made me not even want to be there on a wells fargo day. Still havent received my certificate of \u2026",
          "Affordable and a great place to spend a Saturday. My parents and I liked it. ",
          "Me and my friend Vivain went here for a light show. I enjoyed what they had to offer but it was too quiet. I felt like I was yelling when I talked. If you want people and action go during tourist season. If you want a quiet calm setting go in the spring when no ones there.",
          "Love this place!  There's the imaginarium and a kids area (5 and under...I  think). My girls  (ages 2&4) love it here!",
          "It is a nice place to visit if r from out of town ",

          "Wow really nice museum.",
          "What an excellent way to spend a day!  AM truly has something for everyone; it combines art, history, science and industry, military, and children's museums to become the Megazord of museums.  This was one of my first stops on an accidental \u2026",

          "Nice exhibitions. Great experience.",
          "OH Wow this place was a dump. First you get robbed with parking without the museum validating your ticket, that's 18 bucks right there. Then the people working there are ultra rude college students who think there too good to work at a \u2026",

      "name": "Alaska Zoo",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The Alaska Zoo is a zoo in Anchorage, Alaska, located on 25 acres (10 ha) of the Anchorage Hillside. It is a popular attraction in Alaska, with nearly 200,000 visitors per year.The zoo is currently home to more than 100 birds and mammals representing some 50 species. The zoo has the widest variety of animals native to the state of Alaska as well as some exotics such as Amur tigers, Bactrian camels, and yaks.\nIn addition to viewing, the zoo specializes in education, research, wildlife conservation, and animal rehabilitation; many of the animals currently in the zoo were found orphaned or injured.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1966, Anchorage grocer Jack Snyder won a contest offering a prize of \"$3,000 or a baby elephant\". He chose the elephant, a female Asian elephant named Annabelle. Annabelle was initially kept at the Diamond H Horse Ranch, located in the Hillside area of Anchorage and owned by Sammye Seawell, which had the only heated stalls available.With Annabelle's increasing popularity, Seawell formed a non-profit corporation to build a place \"where the public could visit animals and learn about them.\" It was incorporated on March 28, 1968, as the Alaska Children's Zoo, which opened in 1969 with Annabelle and other donated animals. The zoo was located on land adjacent to Seawell's ranch. The zoo's name was changed to Alaska Zoo in June 1980.In 1983, a female African elephant named Maggie arrived at the Alaska Zoo as a companion for Annabelle.The zoo attracted some attention, even outside Alaska, in 1994 when Binky, then one of the zoo's polar bears, injured several visitors who entered his enclosure, famously pacing with an Australian woman's shoe dangling from his mouth (the current polar bear exhibit is human-proof).\nIn 1997, Annabelle died, leaving her companion, Maggie alone. In 2004, in spite of mounting criticism, Alaska Zoo officials decided to keep Maggie in Alaska for at least three more years, rather than sending her to an elephant sanctuary in a warmer climate, where she could also socialize with other elephants. As of June 6, 2007, she was moved to the PAWS sanctuary in California.\n\n\n== Notable animals ==\n\n\n=== Annabelle (1964\u20131997), an Asian elephant ===\nAnnabelle, an Asian elephant, was born in India in 1964. In 1966, in a Chiffon Tissue contest sponsored by Crown Zellerbach, she was offered as an alternative prize between \"$3,000 or a baby elephant\". The prize-winner, Anchorage grocer Jack Snyder, chose the elephant. Annabelle was initially kept at the Diamond H Horse Ranch, located in the Hillside area of Anchorage and owned by Sammye Seawell, which had the only heated stalls available. Annabelle was one of the first animals when the zoo was founded as the Alaska Children's Zoo in 1969, along with several orphaned and injured animals in need of homes, including a black bear, seal, Arctic fox, and petting zoo goats.Annabelle died of complications of a foot infection on December 15, 1997.\n\n\n=== Binky (1975\u20131995), a polar bear ===\n\n\n=== Maggie (1983\u2013 ), an African elephant ===\nMaggie, an African elephant, came to the Alaska Zoo in 1983 as a companion for Annabelle.  Maggie originated in Zimbabwe, Africa, where her herd had been culled \u2013 selectively destroyed to reduce numbers \u2013 leaving her in need of a home.

          "We were a group of friends and family (adults and teens) and really enjoyed the zoo. This is a great way to see many Alaskan animals and a few non-Alaskan ones too. It is likely the only way most people will see a polar bear! You will need a map as the layout an signage isn't",
          "Brown, Black and Polar Bears! No Grizzlys but wide variety of animals and birds including a beautiful Bald Eagle. All seem to be well taken care of and workers show true passion. Due to Covid-19 petting zoo and cafeteria were closed.",
          "If you aren't familiar with their mission, you'll think that this is a sometimes run-down looking, small zoo. But when you think about how they're taking in animals that are in need of care, then you view it a different light. We now make an annual year-end donation to support",
          "We visited the Zoo on a 4 degree day - visiting Anchorage from Reno - great experience contrasting a northern zoo with a southern zoo. it was a memorable visit and well worth it.",
          "It\u2019s a totally outside zoo. It\u2019s neat to see the animals in their natural habitat. The snow rain whatever, is more comfortable for the animals but definitely less comfortable for humans. The little kids really really enjoyed it. The adults liked it.",
          "This outdoor little zoo was cold and would have been daunting if I had not dressed for the weather. If you do, or attend in the summer, it\u2019s adorable! Lots of interesting cold climate animals. Takes at least an hour to see everything. Timing and weather depends on each animals\u2019",
          "Convenient to get to using Uber, we had a nice time here visiting the arctic animals of Alaska. The polar bear is essential viewing as are the otters and moose. The zoo is in a pleasant forest environment. A family-friendly attraction worth going to.",
          "We arrived at 5 pm. Ticket price was $10/per person. It was negative 3 degrees outside and I asked the lady at the ticket counter where we could find hot chocolate or something warm. She directed us to the cafe (on the other side of the zoo). We zipped through the first half",
          "We loved touring the zoo here. The animals have large areas to explore and all look great. It's a must see in Anchorage!",
          "When I travel to different cities I always like to go to the zoo. Lots of times there are different animals that I have not seen before. This zoo was lots of fun and it was not crowded. The snow fell the night before so there was a fresh layer of snow on the animals and all over",
          "It was midway through my week in Anchorage and I wasn't able to see any wildlife so I thought I'd just put in a cheat code and see it all in one spot. The Alaska Zoo is deceptively large. When I first went through the gate, I thought, \"Oh boy, this is it? This is all there",
          "I had a hard time convincing my sister to go to this zoo. She's from San Diego and any zoo on the planet is going to pale in comparison to the zoo there. But we had a good time and enjoyed the laid back atmosphere of the place. Some of the animals needed bigger compounds but",
          "Very nice large zoo. Many animals and picture ops. There is a gift shop and picnic area too. There were many types of birds, musk ox, reindeer, bears, polar bears and more. Its a great day for fun.",
          "This is a wonderful place to allow your inner child to emerge. We were thrilled at all the animals and I fell in love with the polar bears. If you have an extra day this is well worth your time.",
          "This small zoo is in a nice, park-like setting. It features mainly animals that can be found in Alaska or other northern areas, with a few(such as camels) from elsewhere. It appears that the zoo tries really hard, but appears to suffer from lack of funding(It's non-profit, I",
          "Being a zookeeper whom works at a zoo accredited by CAZA visiting this zoo in particular I was pleasantly surprised. Zookeepers that go on vacation, visit other zoos (riveting). We had the privilege of a behind the scenes tour and were very impressed and excited about training",
          "After touring parts of Alaska and seeing many animals in the wild from afar, we just loved going to this small zoo to see the animals up close. All the animals were active (not too hot like in many zoos in the \"lower 48\"). We saw polar, black and brown bears, moose, caribou,",
          "Had some free time in Anchorage. Decided to go check out the zoo. Mistake! Really sad. Very few animals held in horrible captivity.",
          "We opted for a private zoo tour as my sons wish was to see a polar beer while in Alaska (we don\u2019t have polar bears in zoos anywhere on the east coast). Chance took us around the zoo (starting with a back stage view of the polar bears). What an incredible tour. He is so",
          "A delightful place to spend a couple of hours with or without small children in tow. Anchorage Zoo's collection focuses on Arctic and Alaskan wildlife -- moose, muskox, polar bears, eagles, elk, coyotes, Dall sheep. While we saw many animals in the wild, this was the only place",
          "I love to visit zoo's when I travel. This zoo was clean and had beautiful grounds. The fact that they take in injured and orphaned animals for rehabilitation is wonderful! I got a ton of terrific pictures. So many in fact I haven't even had a chance to review all of them yet.",
          "We had some time to kill before heading to the airport so spent a nice couple hours here. It is a small zoo so not a huge number of animals but enough. We liked that each of the animals had a history listed as to where they came from - a number of them were rescued and couldn\u2019t",
          "It is a small zoo but the location is quite good. My friend and I spent a long time there but we didn't end up seeing many animals (a complaint that other visitors had too): two brown bears, three owls, one fox and three wolves. The wolves and the fox seemed very skinny. I think",
          "I love zoos, and this zoo readily admits that it is more of rehabilitation facility rather than just a place to show off an extensive collection of animals. Most are all native to the area that were injured or orphaned in some way. A nice walkabout in a wooded area trail",
          "For a zoo you expect to see animals But these were willing to be in the front of the pens and very nice to be able to really see them",
          "My family and I had just arrived in Anchorage and needed to waste some time before we could get into our air BnB. So after breakfast we decided to go to the zoo! AND WE WERE SO GLAD WE DID! We just happen to get there right as the gates were opening! And boy did we get a",
          "Mixed feelings on this zoo. It seemed most of the animals are there as they were abandoned or found hurt and unable to return to the wild. Which is good as the alternative would be death. Zoos do make me sad...seeing animals locked up and not large areas to roam. None of the",
          "I love wild life but sometimes it is really nice to see the animals up close you have been watching in the wild. The reindeer was awesome.",
          "We were hesitating on going here based on the reviews we read. But, it did not disappoint! We were able to see some of the neat animals of Alaska. It is a small zoo but well taken care of. I think the reviews have been unfair as many may be comparing it to the larger zoos in",
          "We purchased the 2 hour tour with admission and enjoyed our visit. There was only one other person on the tour with us so we really received a lot of info from the tour guide. We went behind the enclosures of several animals to learn more about them. As with all wildlife, even",
          "My wife and I enjoyed our visit at this medium size Zoo. The gravel paths were in good shape and we had a pleasant walk visiting the animals. The Polar Bear exhibit was our favorite and one of the Zoo attendants was feeding Mr. Pickles, the Porcupine, and he put on a show for",
          "There didn't seem to be any animal that was 'happy'. It was a sad place to visit with many of the cages unoccuppied(?), or animals were hidden. I wouldn't advise a visti as it is messy and uninteresting.",
          "I was really disappointed in this zoo. The animals are caged in small areas. Made it easy for people to see them, but terrible for the animals. The alpaca was by itself. They are hard animals and need a buddy. Plus it had not been shorn in probably at least 2 years, maybe more",
          "I love animals, I love zoos, some of the great zoos I went to are here in the US, you can learn so much about the place from the Zoo. Alaska Zoo was so bad, I traveled through Alaska for 19 days, we saw bears and moose and caribou and all kinds of wild life out on the roads, we",
          "We have visited this zoo on several trips and like to take friends there. They had an elephant back in 1979, but now focus on animals from higher altitudes and latitudes. This includes snow leopards, Siberian tigers, brown bears, and polar bears. The exhibits are generously",
          "My husband and I visited the zoo because we thought it would be an easy day out as I use a wheelchair.It Wasn't! All the paths are gravel which is thick in some places and some steep slopes .It Isn't wheelchair friendly and my husband had trouble pushing me so that in some",
          "We really enjoyed our time here. It\u2019s a nice small zoo with very pleasant trails and exhibits. Well worth a couple of hours.",
          "Fun Zoo, was able to catch a shuttle from the visitor's center. Good workout walking around, we were there on July 5th so was a little hot. Animals had sprinklers, was fun to see the moose.",
          "Had a wonderful time visiting this zoo, saw great animals and did the behind the scenes tour which is well worth it, animals seem in good health and had big spaces and were behaving naturally.",
          "My husband and I had a couple of hours before our flight and decided to check out the Alaska Zoo. it was well worth the entrance fee to view the animals in a beautiful park like setting.",
          "Try to go in the morning. When we went animals had eaten and were sleepy. It was nice because you can\u2019t guarantee seeing nature animals in the wild.",
          "Kids loved it. Took a few hours with small children. There was multiple closed exhibits but most of the main attractions were present.",
          "While this place won't be confused with the San Diego or even Los Angeles Zoo, it is a pretty cool little zoo that has pretty much all the major Alaskan animals: Bears, including a polar bear, reindeer, foxes, lynx, musk ox, bald eagles, otters, etc. It's nice to see that almost",
          "Had been in Alaska for a few weeks and had not seen any of the usual animals that you would expect to see - bears, moose, etc. Best solution was to head out to the Alaska Zoo and tick all of the boxes. The zoo is fairly compact and two hours should be plenty of time to get",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed the zoo. It is one of the places that takes in injured animals and ones who would not survive without intervention. Also, the exhibits are set up with a more natural look and feel, so they do provide places for the animals to hide if they need. It\u2019s so much",
          "we saw the zoo on day 1 . it was a nice 2 hour stroll which worked well for us as we were very tired after a long flight which arrived at midnight with a 3 hour time zone difference. it is a nice zoo, nothing spectacular. the bears (polar and grizzly) , tiger and snow leopard",
          "The cool thing about this zoo is that it hosts native Alaskan animals, but there were in pretty small cages. You can take a free shuttle from downtown to the zoo but it only picks back up about every hour, so you need to time your exit to the shuttle correctly (and hope there",
          "After spending 2 weeks in Alaska we had yet to see a bear so off to Alaska Zoo we go. The Bears were there and did not disappoint...excellent large enclosure held 3 brown bears (Grizzlies) that were active and entertaining as they interacted and one stood on hind legs to reach",
          "We went to the Alaska Zoo on the last day of our two-week visit to the state. We mostly wanted to see the polar bear, but he was hiding too well. We did see lots of other animals though, including yaks, musk oxen, wolverines, grizzlies, and more. I thought the admission price",
          "The animals are in this zoo because they can no longer be in the wild due to injuries, orphaned etc. This is a lovely place shaded by beautiful trees and well manicured gravel pathways. It is accessible to everyone and was a great way to spend the afternoon.",
          "Alaska Zoo is one of the must things to do in Anchorage, Alaska with its coziness, layout, quality and quantity of animal exhibits. It is one of the top zoos that I have ever visited throughout my lifetime.",
          "Alaskan-style zoo! See Alaska's animals while walking through the woods on graveled trails with ADA access/strollers. Has playground for kids. Plenty of shade, benches for resting, and gift shop.",
          "We visited the Alaska Zoo at the finish of a 7-day Alaska train tour. The last part of the train trip was up in Denali National Park and wow! did we get some great shots of various wildlife in their native habitat. So, visiting the zoo was a bit anti-climatic after seeing",
          "Small zoo, good assortment of animals. Some did not come out to play. Enjoyed seeing the snow leopard and seeing a Dall sheep up close. Was surprised at the whimpy cry of the bald eagle! And heard the odd mating call of a raven. Learned that 2 hump camels are cold weather",
          "We went expecting to see everything listed - naively. So we missed the polar bears after 2 attempts but a couple who got onto the shuttle behind us said they had just come out. Not many photo opportunities due to wire. We did see brown & black eagles, Golden & Bald Eagles,",
          "I\u2019m not really big on zoos. Being in Alaska for over a week spending time in the back country we saw plenty of Animals in the wild. My personal opinion is the zoo is good for small children. If your into photography leave your camera at home. You\u2019ll do just as good with a",
          "We (a combination of older adults, younger adults, and one teenager) visited the zoo during the afternoon, and all really enjoyed it. The exhibits are clean and well-maintained, and the animal viewing is close. Highlights were the tigers, the coyotes howling in response to",
          "Visited the Alaska Zoo on June 12, 2019, Wednesday. Saw 3 musk oxes, 2 polar bears, 3 brown bears, a black bear, a moose, a bald eagle, a snow leopard, a tiger, a mountain goat, a porcupine, a bactrian camel, an alpalca, a red fox, 2 cayotes, and others. Seeing these animals up",
          "We went today around 6pm and it was empty, which was great for us (family of 6). It is a small zoo but very nice. I recommend you check it out!",
          "We took a fantastic cruise to Alaska last week. We continued with a land portion which consisted of 4 hours on train and 7 hours of buses go to and from Denali. We also took a 4 hour bus ride into Denali. In all we saw maybe 4 moose and a snow shoed hare. Today at the zoo we",
          "I enjoyed my stroll around this quaint zoo. Although not large its easy to do in a short time frame it did have all the local wildlife so a chance to see all these animals.",
          "Went to the AK Zoo this week with my son. We both had a blast as we both love the zoo. It was our first time seeing Cran-bear-ry. We were able to watch her swim as it was a very warm day in Anchorage. There\u2019s a newborn two week old baby moose at the infirmary getting used to",
          "Given a choice, I would rather have donated and gone to the Native Heritage Centre instead. The enclosures were rather small and many exhibits were alone and I came away feeling a bit depressed.",
          "Great place to meet the local wildlife. Nearly all animals are rescue / unable to return to wild. Free shuttle to zoo was great - Sandra made it enjoyable",
          "My son absolutely enjoyed with with my family and a friend as a late night adventure before closing. Most of the animals were sleep or hiding but we still read the information and snap a couple photos of some that were visible and awake. This zoo is the perfect size for little",
          "We visited this zoo because we had a coupon for a buy one get one free admission prior to embarking on our cruise. We were pleasantly surprised by this zoo. It is small. In fact we walked the whole thing and saw all the animals in about 1.5 hours. It truly was cool to see",
          "It was a very nice and clean zoo. I guess we got there too early so most of the animals were still sleeping.. Great weather and coffee though.",
          "The Alaska Zoo is top notch! I visit zoos all around the world, and this is still one of my favorites!",
          "I was so glad to see all of the animals and to know they work with snow leopard trust. The animals were in good weight and had enrichment toys. I hope they continue their work to help animals that cant live free in the wild.",
          "The zoo is great for a walk around. It\u2019s pretty small but plenty of activity with the little ones. The zoo also offers story time and play time - Tues / Thurs - although check for exact details with the zoo. The annual membership is definitely worth it if you live in town and",
          "My kids love the zoo! Moose, caribou, bears, dall sheep, goats, cats, wolves and then some. Very affordable and it's not PACKED like other zoo's! We come here multiple times a year!",
          "This zoo isn't horribly big but it does have all the animals we don't see often, especially in my state. I loved seeing real polar bears, red foxes, and a snow leopard! It was great to see those animals in person.",
          "We walked through the whole zoo in under 2 hours. It holds mostly wildlife from Alaska not all around the world. Nice place for a family with kids. Small and simple",
          "I'm from St. Louis where we have an award-winning zoo. So, I write this review with a bias. There is a good selection of animals. Several exhibits were closed in March. The paths are not marked, except for the Polar Bear. The map didn't help us at all. I have a hard time walking",
          "Not physically the largest zoo we have seen, but very likely the most amazing collection of animals. All of Alaska\u2019s and Canada\u2019s bears, wolves, and moose, plus tigers and various yaks from Central Asia, and Snow Leopards!! One of the rarest animals on earth, and they have two!",
          "We appreciated that the animals were rescue animals. An ok zoo appreciated that was Alaska animals. Most animals did have lots of room to stretch their legs. Don't expect a large zoo but is also less walking.",
          "I am a life long Alaskan, but have never been to the zoo until recently after having a kid of my own. I was so sad pretty much the entire time we were exploring the zoo. All of the enclosures are extremely small and the animals dont look too happy. My son watched a seal swim I",
          "Nice zoo, easy to get around, great selection of animals to have a look at. And beautiful little coffee shop",
          "The zoo is probably better under normal circumstances. We visited when there was a lot of renovation going on. Still a fun place to take our grandson.",
          "It is not a big zoo, but it is still very interesting. From my hotel in Anchorage, I got a Grab and was there in a short time. Alaska is well known for the wild life. It is exciting to see the moose, caribou (reindeer), Sitka black-tailed deer, eagles and other animals, from the",
          "I was not impressed, and I felt like the animal enclosures are too small and bare. There is nothing great here...... it\u2019s a small place that houses animals with the least amount of design in my opinion.",
          "I have never seen a moose in real life! Or a wolverine! I had no idea porcupines were so big! This is a really cool zoo where the animals are highly visible. The only disappointment was that the polar bear was completely sacked out the entire time we were there. ;)",
          "We always visit zoos when we travel. So off we went and it was not well laid out as you did a lot of back tracking. But it was a different type of zoo as this has mostly abandoned or injured animals that it has taken in that cannot be released back into the wild. Kudos to them!!",
          "Some animals loved it some were hiding. The polar bear and a brown bear were outside just chilling, offers were crazy as usual and a seal was giving everyone a smooch through the window. Glad that there was a small shop with coffee and not chocolate because we were set and cold.",
          "This was an absolutely wonderful way to have downtime in the city. Flowers are beautiful. Walkway easy -",
          "Me and my friend went to the zoo to see the native Alaskan animals, the zoo itself is very small in size in comparison with other zoos that we saw in another countries, we felt that it is not organized well and unclean, it was smelly, the number of animals were small.",
          "The Alaska zoo is in a wooded setting. It is very navigable and has a nice collection of animals. The zookeeper staff were enthusiastic and knowledgeable. It\u2019s very close to the Glen Alps trail heads so a visit to the hiking trails and scenic view can be combined with a trip to",
          "Great place to see many animals that cannot be released to the wild. Beautiful setting. Only problem was that I took a cab there and Uber back to my hotel. Would have been much cheaper to rent a car.",
          "If we had seen lots of wildlife in the \u201cwild\u201d, we probably would have skipped the zoo. But, we were yet to see any. So, at the zoo we saw bears \u2013 polar, brown, and black, wolverines, moose, wolves, doll sheep, mountain goats, and lots of other animals.",
          "My wife and I had 2 hours to kill before a flight home, and decided to make a quick stop at the zoo. I was surprised at the how good this little zoo was. It was an easy visit while in Anchorage. Animals were great and the displays were well done. It's a great 2-hour stop.",
          "Me and my husband visited on our honeymoon. It was a place I was very much looking forwards to visiting. They are a brilliant range of animals and you can get really close to them. The Zoo feels really unique, small and cosy, yet big enough for these amazing animals. We enjoyed",
          "Enjoyed our last day in Anchorage by going to the zoo which had all kinds of frisky animals that you could get close up to ,my grandchildren would love it here",
          "While the Alaska Zoo is in the far SE of the city it is worth the effort to get there. Most of the animals are native to the state and have been rescued and rehabilitated. The settings in which they are housed are as large, and natural as possible with in a wooded landscape. In",
          "If you have never seen a caribou, a yak, or a musk ox, this is the place for you. We weren\u2019t going to leave Alaska without seeing at least one moose. The zoo allowed us that luxury, and from a more than respectful distance! Also on hand: a bald eagle, several great grey owls, an",
          "I was not very impressed with this zoo. The enclosures seemed far too small for the animals. The polar bear was having its enclosure enlarged but the bears didn\u2019t have much room, nor did the tigers. Hopefully they will extend theirs too. It is quite a small zoo so we got",
          "A small zoo with great dedication to their animals, most of the animals here have been injured at some point and cannot be returned to the wild although they do rehabilitate animals when possible. It is a pleasant and informative way to spend 2-3 hours and they offer a free",
          "This small zoo displays animals who are native to Alaska and who are also rescues that are not able to be released into the wild. This is the first zoo where we saw moose. There is a small plaque describing the story of each animal.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised to see ALL the animals in such good condition and not pacing up and down in their cages",
          "We needed to kill a few hours in anchorage before our flight, and this zoo fit the bill perfectly. Free shuttle runs at least once an hour from near the cruise hotels (corner F and 4th) during tourist season (to mid Sept - check zoo website for details and timetable). Its",
          "Well laid out zoo, particularly as it survives as basically a non-profit with reliance on donations. Good showcase of Alaska's unique animal species.",
          "Although on the small side, this little zoo not only had a good selection of native Alaskan animals, they were mostly animals that couldn\u2019t be released into the wild for one reason or another. It was clean and the animal had space and were well cared for.",
          "This zoo really needs a bit of love. The setting is lovely but some of the displays are very boring and basic. It is good to go for a visit if you haven\u2019t seen some of the Alaskan animals in the wild yet I was very disappointed in the bear\u2019s enclosure - it was barren, trees in",
          "Very nice zoo. Most of the animals here have been rescued and cannot be put back into the wild. Very commendable.",
          "We opted to visit the zoo mostly because we had some time to kill and the shuttle was free. Glad we took the time to go since the variety of animals was unique. I would recommend this as an options to anyone traveling with children as the displays are easily accessible and",
          "My wife and I enjoy going to zoos and aquariums and we usually make a point of visiting them wherever we travel. The Alaska zoo specializes in cold weather animals and especially animals that are native to Alaska. In addition. A large percentage of the animals have suffered",
          "I\u2019ve visited the zoo twice on my travels to Alaska and loved it both times. The staff is always friendly, and the little snack shop has the best brownies. My 18 month old niece loved the seal that kisses the glass and the ravens squawking :-)",
          "Although this zoo is small there are sufficient exhibits to keep you interested for a couple of hours. As with any other zoo you are at the mercy of pot luck as to whether the particular animal you want to see is visible. We saw about 90% of the exhibits which we thought was",
          "Living in Anchorage we have a chance to go to the zoo often. Many of the animals are rescue animals - not all. The animals at the zoo are cold weather animals and many indigenous to Alaska. Although someone posted that the zoo is not accessible but I saw people in wheelchairs",
          "I took my disabled adult son to the zoo today, thinking about all the reviews and how worthwhile a trip people said it was. Anyone using a wheelchair should know there are steep slopes, stairs, and the paths are loose gravel. There are no signs in the parking lot where we",
          "This zoo was amazing. It went way beyond my expectations. It was like hiking in a forest of trees and seeing different animals along the way. Although not every single animal was out, most of them were. I'd definitely make it a point to come here.",
          "We used the Zoo's free shuttle from the Anchorage Log Cabin Visitor's Center (located at 4th & F street downtown) to go to the zoo. Admission prices are great, and the animals are adorable! They even had a petting zoo and information sessions about various animals where we",
          "We went to see the zoo in an afternoon. As might be expected most of the animals were having their afternoon naps. However, between 3 and 4 pm they started moving around because they were being fed. I was particularly interested in the written histories of the individual",
          "This is also a rehab centre so we sure did applaud the great work of the staff. We especially enjoyed the young rescued fox being trained by the young lady (staff). I would like to have had more opportunity to sit and rest or observe the animals as a great deal of walking is",
          "Very good zoo for cold climate animals. Bears, tigers, musk ox, otters, seals, moose and much more in well laid out exhibits.",
          "The Alaska Zoo is not very big, but they have some nice exhibits, including some great bears. Guaranteed BEAR sighting here, LOL!! Also, lynx, coyote, polar bear, birds, and more. Coffee shop available.",
          "My friend and I spend a very happy afternoon exploring the Alaska Zoo. We paid a bit extra so we could do the \"behind the scenes tour\" with a very enthusiastic intern, and it was money well spent. I really appreciated how much she knew about each animal and it was nice to see",
          "This is a small zoo, but its a great way to see some of the Alaskan animals up close. My son loved watching the bears and the wolves. it only takes about an hour or an hour and a half to go through the zoo, but we enjoyed the walk and the beauty of the area its built in. The",
          "Free shuttle accommodated a foldable wheelchair to get us from downtown visitor center to this small Zoo. Scheduled guided tour, at extra expense, was worth the personal touch and behind-the-scenes access to animal exhibits. Our Volunteer Docent Kelsey clearly had built",
          "Sue was our guide and she was very knowledgeable about the animals and really loves her job. She knows all the animals by name. Highlight was when Jim, the tiger keeper, gave the two tigers their afternoon snack and we got to watch from the opposite side of a chain link fence.",
          "This zoo is good. We came here on a morning where we didn\u2019t have anything planned and needed to waste a little bit of time. Plenty of animals to see and it makes for a good little walk. You can get close to the exhibits which is nice. So if you are looking for something to do",
          "Saw native animals which was nice, small zoo but well laid out. We've done it twice in 3 years and still enjoyed it.",
          "I don't mean to be harsh but this zoo was the saddest zoo I've been to. Granted I live and have lived in areas with some of the best zoos so I may be a little spoiled. However, this was a nice zoo in that they are focused on helping injured animals and you can see some of",
          "I\u2019m not a big fan of zoos but apparently this one takes in injured animals who will be unlikely to survive in the wild, and on some of the exhibits it tells you where and how they were found before being rescued. It has a great variety of Alaskan wildlife and is a good",
          "Alaska Zoo in in the fashion of older zoo types with animals in enclosures and cages. They are in the middle of creating more open space enclosures in line with more modern styles of zoos. That said all of the animals looked in good health and were obviously well cared for as",
          "Visited the Alaska Zoo with my family and young grandson. I always have mixed feelings about animals in captivity but I believe a lot of these are rescued/injured animals. The zoo is set amongst native trees and has a network of gentle paths around the grounds. There is a good",
          "We enjoyed our quick trip, the kids had been looking for moose on the train to Anchorage but didn't realize how big the animal they were looking for were! We also enjoyed learning about the grizzlies and seeing them up close. Wolves were cool to see too.",
          "The typical Alaska animals: moose, caribou, brown, polar and black bears, wolf, musk ox, seals and otters were viewable, as well as non-Alaskan animals: camels, yak and tigers. It is a small zoo but relatively inexpensive and worth a visit.",
          "A great variety of Alaskan / North American / Arctic wildlife. Grizzly bear, black bear and polar bear exhibits are really good. Clear view of the animals and big viewing area so it wasn\u2019t crowded. Not possible to get good photos of a lot of the animals due to enclosure type,",
          "I have been to the zoo in both winter and summer and enjoy it every season. On a hot summer day you won\u2019t see as many animals but still fun to walk through the paths and enjoy the day.",
          "A nice morning outing with a cute sign a long for our pre schooler. The enclosures are well kept and good sight lines for the animals. The sea otter and polar bears were my favourites",
          "Best place to see all Alaska birds and animals (though only in enclosed areas), a shuttle from the Visitor Center makes the visit very easy.",
          "We had a great time at this rescue zoo. We did the Discovery Tour which is a behind the scenes look at the animals. Perfect way to spend a couple of hours, the animals are beautiful. Drew was our guide and he was great, the baby cubs will win your heart. It's a wonderful work",
          "It is a small, but lovely zoo where you can get acquainted with the Alaskan wildlife and learn more about it. They also do an excellent job at rescuing orphan animals.",
          "It is possible to see bears, mooses, musk ox and other alaskan animals. It is a small zoo, so you can spend there few hours. There is a free shuttle bus to/from the zoo to the city.",
          "It\u2019s small but nice to visit. It has old fashioned cages but they have some beautiful animals. Staff in the gift shop was very friendly.",
          "This small zoo in Anchorage is awesome! We have visited zoos all over the country and this is in our top 5 of favorites. The animals are easily accessible and visible. We saw several zoo keepers tending to the animals while we were there. The animals seem to be very well",
          "My wife and I were visiting Alaska with two teen age granddaughters. I had put together a book of information on things to do in the Anchorage area. They both selected a visit to the Alaska Zoo. It did not disappoint. The first great thing was the free shuttle bus from",
          "Pandas are not completely glassed in and the noise in there is unbearable for us and the pandas. Disgraceful",
          "This zoo exceeded my expectations. It is not the commercialized zoo like we have in California. Built in groves of native trees. Feels like you are just walking through the forest. And has a great collection of animals that were very visible including snow leopards and",
          "We went to the zoo from 5-7 pm. It was wonderful! We felt like we were the only people there. Felt like it was our own piece of heaven. It is a tiny zoo but so worth the visit. All of the animals are there for a reason. Each animal has an info plaque that tells how they",
          "For the most part, this little zoo has many Alaskan animals with a sprinkling of animals from other areas. Quaint and charming. Clean with a great gift shop and snack shop.",
          "Visited the zoo with three tween/teen kids, but I was the one that had the best time! We paid extra for the discovery tour and had Taylor give us a two-hour walk about and behind the scenes look at the zoo. She was very knowledgeable about the animals and the zoo itself. The",
          "Nice zoo. They specializing in rescued Alaskan animals. Best way to see wildlife safely in Alaska. Otters, bears & cubs, moose, awesome wolfves, & that Alaskan main stay, the 2 humped camel!!",
          "Very disappointed. It is small. So I for young children. It's ok. But animals not in their natural habitat. Seemed dirty. Would never go to this zoo again",
          "Such a nice, quiet zoo. A lot of greenery as opposed to concrete. Their approach to house endangered , injured and orphaned animals is a tremendous idea. We saw some beautiful animals, the Siberian tiger among the most magnificent. The bears were being watered with a hose",
          "Loved our visit to Alaska Zoo. Being from another country where we don't have most of these animals, there was a great range for us to see. Very excited to see grey wolves walking just feet away, a polar bear, and a cute brown bear. Animals all looked very well cared for, and",
          "On a rainy day not good for climbing my husband and I stopped at the zoo. I had no expectations but was pleasantly surprised. They had lots of animals and it was a nice place. The bears, snow leopard, and wolves were my fav. We stopped at the coffee house at the back and got",
          "Recently visited. Not a large zoo. Several animals to see. Could use more weed eating. Not alot of commercial sale items in zoo. Allow about 1.5 hours to see it all",
          "We enjoyed walking the shady paths through the zoo. With the entire Alaskan Wilderness as a zoo, it almost seems redundant to have the small Zoo to showcase some of their animals. However, if you have never seen a moose in the wild, or been to one of the musk ox farms, you will",
          "Great place to ease into vacation & time difference. Peaceful, nice walking trails & FRESH AIR. Friendly staff & kept up well. Love watching the bears (Polar & Browns). Otters are fun to watch & the wolf pack howling is exciting. The swans are nice to watch with their little",
          "What a wonderfully laid out zoo. We loved how you are up and close to all of the animals. We were in love with the black and brown bears who were very active. If you have free time take the free bus there. The price to get in is $12-15. It is worth a few hours of your time.",
          "Very nice for a small zoo. There are most of the native animals represented. We were there on a drizzly morning so there was not a lot of activity going on, however most of the animals were out and waiting to be fed. It takes about an hour to see the entire zoo, so it is not",
          "We spent about 3 hours going through this wonderful, small zoo. Was larger than we'd expected from what locals had told us. Sea otters were wonderfully amusing and easy to view from both the top & underwater. Bears, moose, wolves, swans, caribou, camel, lynx, tigers, various",
          "Have you ever seen a musk ox? You will at this zoo! If you are in Anchorage, you should visit this zoo!!",
          "Local wildlife have been saved and cared for at this facility. Fee shuttle from the information centre that runs hourly. You can see so many animals that are not common to other zoos around the world, moose, porcupines, wolves, coyote, grisly bears, brown bear cubs, caribou",
          "The Minnesota Zoo where I come from is huge in comparison but we were pleasantly surprised by how up close we could be to the animals in the Alaska Zoo. It was pretty clean and the animals were quite amazing. If you have a few hours to kill this would definitely be the place",
          "Mislabeled cages, missing animals and unclear signage made this easily the worst part of our Alaska trip. Even the gift shop and sneak bar were lacking.",
          "Firstly- free shuttle from anchorage centre- fab!! It\u2019s a bout a 15 min drive. It\u2019s not overly big but I think it\u2019s priced well to accommodate that. Different types of bears, lovely walk round under woodland so nice and shaded on a hot day. Coffee shop is pretty small but enough",
          "If you have ever been to a zoo before, this will not impress you. It takes about 90 minutes to walk through. We only saw one employee. We did not witness any feedings or zoo keeper talks.",
          "We visited the Zoo on June 13, 2018. This zoo specializes in more of your cold weather animals, so it's a good place to see what you may have missed on wildlife tours. The zoo was neat and viewing was easy. The polar bear didn't want to cooperate. it was intent on sleeping",
          "We stopped here because we had a few hours to burn before our flight home. My daughter also wanted to see the lynx exhibit. It\u2019s a smaller zoo, and at first thought it was a little runned down. As I read the animals\u2019 histories, I learned that these are primarily orphaned or",
          "Not the biggest or best zoo I have seen but well worth a stop. You will see more native wildlife here than you probably will on your own in the state. A very nice walking layout and well maintained.",
          "Give at least 2 hours to see it all. you're welcomed by seeing the polar bears first, awesome! the walking paths are in a natural setting but easy to go thru. We were able to see animals in a more natural setting that we cant see at other zoos. Really enjoyed it.",
          "The Alaska Zoo showcases animals native to Alaska. Very good for tourists, or to bring the young ones for a couple hours down time.",
          "This is a very small zoo. I really liked that the majority of the animals were what you could actually see in the wild. The polar bear was my favorite but he was napping when we saw him. The swans had their babies with them and we spent a lot of time there. This is worth a",
          "I felt like I was walking through an enchanted forest the entire time we were there. It was like taking a gorgeous hike and seeing a ton of animals without running the risk of a dangerous encounter. We were able to see every animal.",
          "This is a small zoo, yet well designed and very responsive to animal life. It\u2019s nothin comparing to the Bronx or to San Diego zoos, mr favorites; however, it\u2019s impressive the animal it features and the easy way to experience it. I was impressed with size of animal facilities and",
          "The animals were sleeping and were not very active. The moose hid far away from the path. A closer encounter would have been preferred. The tigers were the best part. I was very excited to see the polar bear but it also was sleeping. Don\u2019t visit the zoo in the morning.",
          "Zoo was really nice. Many exhibits were empty or closed. But we still enjoy our visit to zoo. We learned a lot and got some nice pics of the animals.",
          "This is a good size zoo with an excellent assortment of animals. It has only one small, uninspired eatery; so plan ahead. The layout is less than ideal and you wonder if you are missing sections. You end up backtracking a bit to make sure you saw everything. The limited",
          "It was very sad to see the condition of the Animals at this zoo. They are in very bad shape. From the Camels, Bears, Bald Eagles, Caribou, we were shocked at what we were looking at. The Bears exhibit was horrible... Just dirt and nothing else for the three bears staying there.",
          "This was not worth it at all. So boring. Most the animals were sleeping. Not worth the money. Much better to go to Alaska wildlife conservation center",
          "Did I mention that this zoo is quite small? Other reviewers have mentioned this and they are correct. Is it too small? I don\u2019t think so, but don\u2019t expect your visit to consume a day or even half a day. A couple of hours works nicely for a thorough, leisurely stroll through the",
          "We had a great time. The zoo isn't large but it packs a lot into the space. The layout rewired a bit of backtracking but it wasn't too bad. I really enjoyed how some of the exhibits really allow you to see the animals up close. I wish I could have seen the moose a little bit",
          "Great smaller sized local zoo with several indigenous Alaskan animals. When I first arrived in AK the zoo drama was getting rid of Maggie the elephant and she has since been relocated outside to another location. More recently the AK zoo lost it\u2019s polar bear Ahpun. Very sad",
          "I have been to a lot of zoos around the world and this one needs some love and care. They have some really cool animals but their homes are not well maintained, especially the bears. They had no trees, grass, water or toys to play with. The entire zoo was over run with weeds.",
          "We took the free shuttle from the downtown visitors enter to the zoo and were surprised how many animals were on exhibit! We were able to see many Alaskan animals such as Polar bear; brown bears, bald eagle; moose; seals; mountain Lions, Nd wolves etc The zoo is on the small",
          "Whether you visit in the winter or summer, this is a lovely place to spend a few hours in great company - the rescued animals they keep. You can check the feeding hours for some animals, but unfortunately they feed the polar bear before and after they close the zoo, so you won\u2019t",
          "Nice place to go instead of sitting in my hotel room. They have nice selection of animals all the kids around were having a great time.",
          "My 14 year old daughter and I had a few hours to spend on our last day in Alaska before catching an afternoon flight out of Anchorage. I saw a sign for the Alaska Zoo and we decided to go check it out. It was April and temperatures were in the low 40's. All of the exhibits",
          "The Anchorage Zoo started out very small -- as a place to 'board' an elephant a guy won in a raffle. Dimond Horse Stables was the logical place to send the elephant, amid the horses. Gradually, it grew and grew, and it became a believable zoo, with Alaskan animals, restaurant,",
          "Smaller than most zoos- but there is a sign that says that it\u2019s mostly Alaska and arctic animals. I am glad that injured and sick animals are well taken care of there. Glad we went. I finally saw a bear!",
          "Great variety of animals reasonably priced. It was a great afternoon. Would definitely recommend. As a tourist. More signs needed to find location.",
          "This is one of those, you expect one thing and get another type of places. It's a zoo. Expect that and you will have what you are looking for. It has animals you don't get to witness in the lower 48. The animals draw the local animals to it so you get to see more than what is in",
          "Great size for wearing out small children but not overdoing it. Animals are close enough kids can actually see them and get excited. Surprised by many of the animals there. Thoroughly enjoyed it",
          "Nice Zoo with all of the native animals. The polar bears were under construction but otherwise everything was tip top.",
          "The trails are nice, price range was fare, we enjoyed the observatory spent a few hours walking around.",
          "My family loved the polar bear, baby cub bears playing, and all the wonderful animals. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable. Also the hot chocolate was simply yummy on such a cold day.",
          "Alaska is more than twice the size of Texas, yet it doesn't even have 1 million people living in it. As a result, \"major\" things in terms of entertainment and attractions don't really exist in Alaska. We have one very small indoor waterpark and several small shopping malls in",
          "I was in the zoo in March, so some of the animals were off exhibit. Even so the zoo's trails curved and ambled so it wasn't easy to tell where you'd already been, which made it seem a bit larger than it really was. They do a good job of getting many animals into a small area,",
          "Highlight of our trip! Lots of animals you don\u2019t see in just any zoo. Very cool to walk around and see all of the different animals and learn about where they came from. Highlight was seeing the Kodiak bears and learning more about them from the zoo staff. Definitely a must do",
          "We stopped here for about an hour and half during the afternoon and had a good time. We saw plenty of animals, some were not out though. The paths were easy to follow and it was packed with snow which was a cool element. The cost was reasonable, less than some larger zoos. It",
          "I went to Alaska Zoo on March 9 while staying in Anchorage as I thought in case I don't see these animals in the wild I can see them here and at the Conservation Centre. Alaska Zoo is also about conservation and assisting wild animals in need. I am from Australia and this zoo,",
          "If you have at an hour to hour and a half to burn, you have to come by. They have a pretty good assortment of wildlife and seeing them in this zoo is a decent choice. Seeing them in the wild would be preferred, yet not always possible. At least they have some animals here on",
          "It is a great Zoo but small compare to other Zoo. Great to see everything you might want to see about Alaska and its wild animals. It will add that wild side you want to encounter and safe.",
          "Great place to get close to Alaskan wildlife and they also have tigers. Great place to take pictures",
          "This zoo actually started because a local prizewinner won an elephant and needed a home for it. Well, the elephant (\"Annabelle\") is long gone, and now there are almost exclusively Alaskan animals on display, and most of them had been orphaned or were found wounded. The funnest",
          "The Anchorage zoo is a gem hidden on the edge of the city. Visitors are so close to the animals you can practically touch them. If you are expecting San Diego or Los Angeles zoos you will be disappointed. Some of the exhibits are state of the art but most are very functional.",
          "Vans from the zoo are dispatched to the city center to take visitors to the zoo, about 35 minutes away. The drivers really build up the attraction but it falls way short of the hype. Look for discount tickets if you have a need to go. You really don't need more than an hour",
          "I've been here many times with my mom and brother and niece and nephews but with my hunny and her granddaughters it was their first time here and they had a blast I'm planning on going here again",
          "Going to the zoo in the dark was a novelty. The Christmas lights were fun, but many of the animals were tucked away for the night. Highlight was seeing the wolves so close and talking for a while to the wolves\u2019 caretaker. Paid $8 a person for entry. Would not have been worth",
          "This is a fairly compact zoo that shows animals from northern climates. The cost is commensurate with the effort to keep the animals well-fed and taken care of. My kids love going here and we usually go several times a year, especially to see rescue animals in the summertime.",
          "Great family place to spend a couple of hours outdoors. We really enjoyed the snow leopards, moose, and caribou. Exhibits are clean and maintained. Great gift shop for those must have souvenirs to commemorate the visit! Friendly staff. Free shuttle round trip from down",
          "This place is a real asset for Anchorage. Our kids get family passes so our grandchildren get a real education the right way.",
          "Really enjoyed our visit there, took some friends visiting from lower 48 who enjoyed too. Well-kept grounds, very informative tour.",
          "We only had a little bit of time to kill and I wanted to enjoy the outside weather, so someone at Bass Pro recommended the zoo! very cute little outdoor zoo with plenty of twists and turns to see cool different animals Ive never seen!",
          "It is winter here in Alaska, but even at 1 degree on a sunny, bright day you can beat the crowds and enjoy the Anchorage Zoo. Be sure to don your warmest layers, hat, mittons and boots. There is no more peaceful time to see the assortment of animals alert and active. The trails",
          "This is a nice zoo with most of the animals you would see in Alaska. A great place to bring your children and grandchildren. It could be updated some but overall a nice place to visit while in Anchorage.",
          "It was a wonderful day to go to the zoo, the animals were awake and we enjoyed the leisure walk thru the exhibits.",
          "We went to the zoo twice this year. They are busy upgrading some of the exhibits, but they are taking good care of the animals. These animals are all in the zoo as they were orphaned or injured and this gives them a safe place to be.",
          "Pretty small zoo, but enough to look at to keep you occupied for an hour or two. Was really neat that a lot of the animals are rescues and are native to Alaska. I really enjoyed my stop there",
          "We LOVED the Alaska Zoo....so sweet, small and filled with local animals, many rescues. The staff in the gift shop was wicked friendly too!! What a great little spot. I bet its beautiful in the winter with all the lights they have strung everywhere!!",
          "This zoo is a medium sized, somewhat confusing maze of trails, but we managed to see all of the animals, and we were not disappointed. We watched and listened to a group of wolves howling. We watched the grizzlies eating. We watched the dall sheep eat up close. We saw many",
          "Visited to while away a few hours before my flight home. I went in the morning, arriving about 10 a.m., which proved to be a good time to see many animals being active -- and vocal. The bear cubs in the wild animal orphanage area were engaged in active play. The older cubs",
          "The zoo is small in comparison to other zoos that I've visited. But, it had a good selection of wildlife.",
          "Anchorage Zoo is about 15 minutes out of town but there is a free bus service from the town centre about every half hour. The animals are interesting and include black and brown bears, wolverines, eagles, Musk Ox, camels, caribou etc. There is also a Tiger enclosure but when",
          "A nice walk a lot of walking for me& a coffee shop. A Polar Bear who kinda just lays around. Beautiful lynx got to see them& the Wolf Exhibit. Very nice not really good for handicapped a little hard to walk. Locals there with young Children a nice day out for the family.",
          "This was more like the old places you would see by the side of the road with animals caged. All the exhibits were small & poorly kept up. Someone should close this place & send the animals to zoo's that are more prepared for animals. I live in SC & we have a fantastic zoo. Hurt",
          "It is not very big but it is good for kids and if you just want to walk. The wolves starting howling as we were at the bears. We been there a couple of times.",
          "Frequent Free shuttle is offered between visitor centre in Anchorage and the zoo. You could see animals like moose, bison, brown bears, black bears, fox, many kinds of birds, etc. We spent around 2.5 hours exploring the park and could almost visit all the animals. Suggest going",
          "Enjoyed this zoo and seeing animals unique to the area. It was interesting to see the signs explaining how each of the animals ended up there at the zoo-- they do a nice job of caring for the animals and providing an opportunity for tourists to get a closer view than they might",
          "Really glad we visited this beautiful zoo with its many and varied animals My concern was the size of the enclosures particularly for the bears I like that most of the animals are rescued and applaud the zoo for that Free shuttle from Anchorage",
          "Unlike the large zoos you see in the lower 48 this zoo is small and all rescued animals. You get to see animals native to Alaska along with some that are native to the same type of weather. There is a free shuttle from downtown Anchorage that will take you to and from the zoo.",
          "The zoo has a decent collection and polar bears one is awesome. Kids liked it . Exhibits are well detailed. Good to spend 2 hrs at least and watch the wildlife . Very educational",
          "Poor environment for animals. Wired toys, dirty and unfriendly. I can tell their sadness from their disappointed face. Only took 15 mins in the zoo...too sad.",
          "This is one of the nicest zoos I've ever been to. There wasn't one animal hiding. We were able to see them all. Every animal looked very well cared for and quite content. The caribou were right up at the fence and just an amazing sight to see. Perfect for everyone.",
          "The Alaska Zoo is unlike any zoo I've ever been too. It is more like a walk in the woods with animals around.",
          "Really fun to take the kids to burn off some energy. They can run free through fenced in trails and look at all the animals. My favorite are the wolves.",
          "Unfortunately the zoo was a little tired and small. There were no real 'Wow' moments with the animals seeming tired and some exhibiting repetitive behaviours. The local conservation center offers a much more pleasing experience.",
          "We did a private tour with Zoo Director Patrick Lampi. You can book them through the website. I am so glad we went ahead and spent the extra money to get the tour we learned so much and had a great time. Lots of special stories and seeing the \"behind the scenes\" of the zoo.",
          "Lots to see. If you went on the Trolley tour, they will hand out a coupon book and then visiting the Zoo, you will receive a free bag of popcorn!! It could have been cleaner, they get donations to keep up with the maintenance.",
          "First of all - It's Alaska so don't expect to see exotic species \ud83d\ude1c Second - It's fairly small ZOO and even smallest children should be fine. Two hours including union break for cup of hot coffee & chocolate. You will find there nice pathways and local animals - obviously.",
          "Its a great small little place in Anchorage and will need 1 mile of walking to cover all the animals We saw fox, tigers, polar bear, seals, bald eagle, mountain goat, dall sheep, moose , bear , cub bear, 2 humpback camel, coyote, yak and many more ! Few of them were sleeping ,",
          "The Alaska Zoo is an amazing little zoo with great little habitat enclosures for their animals. They had a great assortment of native and non-native animals to view along with educational information and tours. Our favorite was the orphan area where we saw baby bears, otters.",
          "Visited the zoo at about 4pm so was quite quiet. Easy to walk around and all the animals look healthy. At the time, there were three orphaned black and brown bears which had to be rescued from the community.Obviously there is a strong community spirit in the zoo. Very",
          "Easy to find. Lots of parking. Tigers and wolves are my favorite. Lots of native animals. Good way to spend a few hours outside. Holiday lights are a nice addition during the winter months.",
          "Used the free downtown shuttle to get to the zoo during a cruise stop. Paid $28.00 for admission & the Discovery Tour. Well worth the money spent. This zoo is small but special. Most, but not all of the animals there are injured, abandoned or orphaned. Most of the exhibits",
          "This is a nice zoo. We saw all the animals The gray wolves got all excited when the zoo keepers walked by. They have two elusive moose, three baby bears, etc is worth going. Allow three hrs to see it fast. The enclosures should be bigger. Worth going in case you don't get to",
          "The Alaska zoo is a gem. The exhibits are well done and it is layed out well. We really liked the raised viewing platforms. Only zoo we have been to that had a full wolf pack and it was fascinating to watch them interact. Great collection of alaskan wildlife.",
          "Used to the San Diego Zoo, we expected to be disappointed. Surprisingly, this zoo is a great half-day walk through shaded paths with minimal crowds, replete with local animals. There's a free shuttle that leaves every hour from the Visitor Center downtown, and admission is $15",
          "Great place to take kids, they'll love it. I had so much fun imagine the little child. I decided to take guided tour and worth any dime, I could be close to bears, wow. Zoo offers shuttle bus from Downtown, good option to go if you are around Anchorage downtown.",
          "I have visited many different zoos in many different states but this is one of the best. There are not tons of animals or pay to feed the... but the animals here look genuinely happy. They have plenty of room and seem very well taken care of. Didn't have the typical zoo feel",
          "A wonderful little place. We saw so many different animals than at a typical zoo. Very wooded, nice walking trails throughout.",
          "Visited the zoo with my adult son and elderly father. The zoo admission price was reasonable and there were a variety of animals to see. The walk was just right for my father and if needed, there are places to stop and rest. We were able to see most of the animals with a good",
          "As the zoo is out of Anchorage I was delighted to know a free shuttle runs on a regular basis. I was lucky enough to get advised in Anchorage that they have a discovery tour, costs more but well worth it as you have a guide for 2 hours who guides you around the zoo with",
          "A nice zoo with plenty of local animals including two polar bears!The zoo takes in orphaned animals and seems to work well on a conservation level worth a visit!",
          "Just love going to this zoo. Clean. Interesting animals for a small zoo. Perfect for kids as it's easy to walk and not so big they get tired. Also easy for older folks.",
          "Not a large zoo, but very walk able. Nice selection of native animals, although a few were difficult to see. If going over meal time note that there is no food at the visitors center where you enter, and very limited food at one place inside the zoo itself, and you are not",
          "Very interesting, lovely animals, mainly local species, guite a lot of them, pleasant walk through the garden, good for a half day visit.",
          "I loved this zoo. The animals were native to Alaska. I really enjoyed our visit. I would recommend this zoo.",
          "They need better signage we passed it and had to turn around but it was a very nice way to spend the afternoon.",
          "Free Shuttle Bus is available at the visitor\u2019s center. Though there were a variety of animals available to visit, I was disappointed because their enclosures were just not photographer friendly though I attempted anyway. According to our helpful hotel staff person, Dan, the time",
          "The effort of the zoo in keeping injured animals from the wild is well respected. A good collection of the different animals found in Alaska, The 7 bears cubs were particularly active. It was unfortunate that the polar bear exhibition was closed.",
          "This is a smallish zoo with exhibits of mostly indigenous animals who have been rescued or donated. The individual information was especially interesting. The polar bear was amazing! My husband was in a wheelchair and it was difficult to maneuver at times, but still an",
          "This was a pleasant surprise on our visit to Anchorage. The zoo focuses on the wildlife of Alaska and the cold north country. So if you want to see wolves and bears and foxes and other animals up close, that would be a good orientation. I was surprised, for example, just how",
          "My family enjoyed the Zoo. We had some time before our flight left so we spent the day seeing some sights in Anchorage. They had lots of animals, that if you didn't get an opportunity to see in the wild, will be here for you to see. This is not some kind of state of the art",
          "Let me say that we loved loved loved our first trip to Alaska. Alaska is no doubt a hidden jewel and one of the most beautiful places we have ever seen. Let me also say that we love going to the zoo. Many of our travels have included a trip to the local zoo, wherever we might",
          "This is a great attraction right in the heart of Anchorage. I loved the tigers and polar bears the most. Mt kids had a blast.",
          "We visited the Alaska Zoo with a 13 year old who wanted to see real polar bears. She got her wish, along with lots of other cold climate animals. The Amur or Siberian Tiger was another active highlight. While the zoo layout is a bit confusing, the moderate pice is quite",
          "Nice place to spend a couple of hours. Free tram from the Tourist Information Office on 4th Avenue. Good selection of animals with many from the Arctic Region. The zoo takes in injured and orphaned animals and rehabilitates them. Plenty of helpful zoo personnel.",
          "Visited for a couple hours. The zoo was pretty decent, and had a good variety of animals. I liked reading the fun facts about the various animals, so I appreciated the signs at each animal station. They also had a coffee shop, which we enjoyed some treats and just sitting and",
          "This was a very nice zoo. Lots of animals that are appropriate for the climate. Our boys enjoyed the visit thoroughly. Got a nice walk in going from one side to the other :)",
          "The Alaska Zoo isn't a zoo like San Diego, or The Minnesota Zoo or The National Zoo, this is more an animal conservation and education center about Alaska mammals and non-sea birds. Although, they also participate in Snow Leopard conservation efforts and have a pair of them and",
          "Just went to the zoo with extended family with teens and toddlers. We all had a great time. Zoo is set up to look like you are out in the woods. Lots of natural overgrowth but not in your face, no cement just gravel walkways. Plenty of places to sit and rest if needed. Animals",
          "I am sure the staff make every effort to care for the animals in their care. The pens were extremely small and not very enriching for their inhabitants",
          "It had been 8 years since my last trip to Alaska and visiting the zoo. I was very impressed with the upgrades and improvements for the animal enclosures. I missed the elephant, but was glad to hear she had been moved to a warmer climate.",
          "This small zoo offers local Alaskan animals (and more). My kids, who are 12 and 5, loved the exhibits. This is not the San Diego zoo, keep your expectations in check. We enjoyed the experience for a couple of hours.",
          "They do diffent zoo experiences, be careful, they do not listen to what you want, they dont think outside there box, nor do they came your only there for the day, even though you've explained what you want to see, the do behind the sevens with certain animals, but messed me",
          "I generally don't like zoos but in recent years have been impressed by the change in emphasis from entertaining visitors to species welfare and preservation. Alaska zoo is quite small and whilst some of the enclosures were really well designed (call sheep and mountain goats) I",
          "Small outside zoo with animals fenced around you, but there are wire enclosures and fenced in so you can't get pictures without wires in them. Seems it was really poorly designed, even their new platform was built up high and they still put a rail just above it so you can't take",
          "Nice zoo, not to big, not to small. I enjoyed seeing the animals closer up with a barrier. Entry fee is not a lot either.",
          "The Anchorage zoo has a nice selection of Alaskan animals, and an unanticipated number of camels and tigers. We arrived at opening time and the grounds were still quiet and uncrowded. There were many moms with their children later in the morning. Wish we could have stayed",
          "We really enjoyed our trip to the zoo. it is a lot better than our zoo at home. Beautiful grounds! there is a free shuttle from downtown that is easy and the driver was very friendly. It was fun seeing the animals get fed just before lunch.",
          "This zoo is definitely small, takes about 1-2 hours to see everything. However, it gives you a great view and education on native Alaskan animals! Our 7 year old son loved it!!! Really is a great way to see Alaskan animals in a safe environment!",
          "It is a smaller zoo that is great for small kids. It is easy to make it around the whole Oo before small kids get bored or tired. There are some pretty steep hills, but everything is wheelchair and stroller accessible. We arrived mid morning and almost every single animal was up",
          "The property is very well kept and lots of useful information on plaques. Nice gift shop. Friendly people. The bald eagle posed for us.",
          "I was reluctant to go the zoo because I felt like that once I've been to one zoo, I've been to them all. This was quite surprising to see some of the animals that I didn't get to see when my family and I went to Denali but had to leave early due to an illness. The zoo is larger",
          "We are from Tennessee and what I liked about the zoo was the different type of animals you can't see in some southern zoo locations. Good times had by all",
          "It was great to see all the Alaskan Wilderness Animals Especially good for us as it gave us a chance to view these animals as we were unable on this trip to spend time to see them in the wild.",
          "Hadn't heard the best things about this place, but decided to go anyway. Very glad we did!! It was lovely. Loose gravel paths, all the enclosures seem like they just popped up a fence in the middle of the forest, they left all the natural foliage. I felt like i was much",
          "Located two miles off the main Highway 1 (head south). The zoo is a \"private\" corporation and not associated with the city or state. Admission is $15/adult (see their web site for more information, they have a military discount for active, reserve and veterans). The prize",
          "They had some animals. For a zoo in the lower 48 this is a small zoo. Very very hard to get pictures with your phone. Too many psyical obsticals in the way. Lay out leaves room to improve it forces you to back track to leave not a smooth transition through the facility. Zoo",
          "My dad and I visited the Alaska Zoo on our last day in Anchorage. It was fun to see the display of local wildlife, plus a few species that are not so local. This was not like other zoos I have been to. Being from western Canada, I have most of the same animals at home, but it",
          "Stopped here on our last day to satisfy my mom since we didn't see any wild bears during the trip. So we got to see the zoos brown bears, black bears and polar bear. I was quite surprised at how nice of a zoo this is. You get to see all the animals up close and personal. Most",
          "I'll admit that we didn't go to Alaska expecting to visit a zoo. We live in Denver which has a great zoo and had recently visited San Diego which has another outstanding zoo. However, on a day we'd planned a nice morning hike we awoke to a cool, cloudy drizzle and opted to skip",
          "I can say i've visited Alaska Zoo. The animals were incredible. My favorite was baby Musk Ox. The bears we awesome, the only few i've seen my 2 weeks in AK. I wish you could get a bit closer to the animals though. Overall, it was pretty awesome.",
          "I love zoos all over the states. This is no different. It is clean and there are no problems viewing the many animals. Signs everywhere explaining everything. Kids had a great time!",
          "The zoo is nice to walk around, even on a warm day, as there were plenty of shade trees. It's a great activity with small children for 1/2 day. It's not a big zoo, but has interesting animals and feels more personal than a big zoo. We enjoyed it with our 2-year-old grandson.",
          "This zoo is about as large as expected for a town the size as anchorage but still has an amazing selection of Alaskan wildlife.",
          "The Alaska Zoo was very reasonable priced, very clean and had many different animals. This place is for all ages and I believe you will like it for something to see.",
          "We are from Texas and needed to kill some time before our flight out so decided to walk around the zoo. It was a really good zoo. I love the setting of being in the middle of the woods with natural paths. Great selection of animals. We enjoyed our day...the brown bears were my",
          "We went with our five year old son. We took the free shuttle from outside the Anchorage visitor information, which was a good service with a friendly driver. The zoo is about 15 minutes out of town. The nice thing about the zoo is that the paths were not wide concrete paths.",
          "Catch the free shuttle bus in front of the Info Centre in downtown, which arrives every hourly to the zoo. Zoo is not large, most probably you can cover everything in about 2 hours. Most of animals are either been injured and rescue from the wild, or have been abandoned by their",
          "We love to take our toddler here. She enjoys playing in the dirt and the freedom of exploring on her own.",
          "Lots of native Alaskan animals and a petting zoo. They had bears, wolves, moose, caribou, seals, otters, porcupine, eagles, snow leopards, musk oxen, camels, yaks, to name a few.",
          "Pretty ok place for a zoo, lots of rescue animals. Pens were clean and loads of room to roam! Take some food with you as very minimal. Shuttles from and to Anchorage and from memory free or like $5. Beautiful tigers roaming free, polar bears snow leopards huge moose and yak too",
          "The zoo was a perfect size for someone with limited mobility or a baby in a stroller. Yes it is small but it allows room for kids to run and really experience the zoo.",
          "Let me start off by saying I ma lucky and have been spoilt by seeing some of the best zoos (e.g. Singapore, Sydney etc). This zoo is very very tired and in need of a major overhaul. Even some of the animals look sad. Some of the enclosures look very unkept. Having said that,",
          "A great little zoo with unique Alaskan animals. Great for kids, and you can usually find discounts on Groupon or The Northern Lights coupon book.",
          "Whenever we travel, we gravitate towards animal related activities, including visiting any nearby zoos or aquariums. We visited the Alaska Zoo as a quick side trip & were not disappointed. Being San Diego natives, we are used to the enormity of the San Diego Zoo and Safari Park,",
          "This is a small but well laid out zoo. The animals are all in natural habitats - not locked in cages. When I was there the snow was still pretty thick so the grounds were a little slippery but beautiful. Absolutely worth a visit!",
          "Visited the zoo right on feeding time, animals were engaging, wolves howling and even tho most of the bears were hibernating the polar bears and brown bears were out and frolicking. Good way to see the Alaskan animals",
          "Cute little Zoo with some nice animals and good spots to watch but nothing very special compared to other zoos around the world. To be fair, it was winter it was quiet, which was nice in one way and a little sleepy in another... The bears were cool !",
          "My son and I came her and we're surprised to find out it was kids day. There was a decent crowned and everyone seemed respectful of others. When I bought our tickets I didn't receive a map of the zoo layout so we just walked and found everything ourselves. What I noticed as",
          "This is a small zoo with a big heart. They help animals that are native to Alaska and have been orphaned or injured. Everyone was very nice and the animals are well taken care.",
          "I love this zoo, seeing all the animals is very nice, open year round and lots of activities for kids, I volunteer here and its a grat time everytime",
          "This zoo is not like any you've been to before. There are Eagles, and Goats, and Bears, and Wolves, and Tigers!",
          "We were fortunate enough to acquire ourselves a behind the scenes tour of the Great Alaska Zoo just outside Anchorage.Even though it was cold we had previously been told to dress appropriately ,so glad we did .The tourer was awesome with the first stop at the Polar bear",
          "The animals are unusually active at night. Admission is reasonable. Some snacks provided. Dress warmly. Not a lot of relief from the cold. Walking paths are spacious, not always well lit.",
          "The zoo is somewhat small but it is the northern most zoo so you have to check it out. The tiger keeper took the time to talk to us which you don't get at every zoo. Dress warm though as most of the animals are outside.",
          "I'm fairly spoiled when it comes to zoo's. I lived in Fort Worth and had the zoo there to visit. Doesn't get better than that. This zoo however offers a different feel, with no real path through it you kind of wrap back and fourth around the exhibits. Don't worry, Back track a",
          "Great for a day out. Quite cheap for tickets and lots to see. Animals are well kept and cared for. It's all outside though so make sure to go on a good day or wear lots and lots of layers!",
          "You can get round in an hour and you can get up close to the animals. I liked the wolverines who seemed a bit stir-crazy and the wolves do howl.",
          "Small zoo, mostly Alaska animals. the neat thing is they take in orphaned native animals and raise them and try and release them back into the wild if they can. Don't go here expecting to see elephants or the like it's to cold most of the year for those kinds of animals.",
          "From a sheer number of animals to variety, this zoo is pretty well stacked. Had a great view of brown bears growling at each other. The polar bears enjoyed a nice bath. Lots of moose/elk/etc. Only minor disappointment was the lack of many authentic souvenirs (there were some,",
          "Walkable in an hour or so. Good collection of cold weather animals that you can get close to on the pathways. Wonderful Zoo Run each year for children.",
          "This zoo is lacking when compared to other zoos. Kids like it and it can be educational. Worth taking the kids for a family day out. Don't expect to be wowed.",
          "A camel was the last animal I expected to see in Alaska, but it was a great surprise. Each trail lead to a new experience and lots of photo opportunities. It's a large enough place to not get bored and not too overwhelming for someone out of shape. They have a very place to get",
          "We love going here in the winter at night as it is beautiful. It is pretty inexpensive and there are lots of animals to see.",
          "Had a very nice time. Most of the animals out. Just a nice walk. Zoo very well kept. The polar bear was just amazing. Never seen one before. Recommend this zoo.so happy it was open in the winter.",
          "It was interesting to see the animals close up and to read the information about them. Some of them we had not seen anywhere else. I also appreciated the fact that many of these animals have been rescued and now have a safe place to be. However, the enclosures left a lot to be",
          "We came here on our last day in Alaska since the zoo was close to our RV return location. The exhibits are well done - best features are the variety of animals and the plaques explaining each animal's situation. It is wonderful knowing that some of these animals who could never",
          "The Alaska Zoo can be seen in just a few hours, but is worth a trip for the local animals. See polar bears, seals, moose, wolves, porcupine, eagles, musk ox, etc up close. The exhibits are set along paths in the woods. It's a completely different experience than a big crowded",
          "Children love going here to see and learn about animals. Probably great place for tourists to learn about animals in Alaska, where some can be rarely seen nor able to take photos of.",
          "I'm a big fan of zoos. I visit them wherever I go. It's been a long time since I've been to this zoo, so when we went recently, it was larger and better than I had remembered. It's a nice, enjoyable walk, lots of animals to see, and a great way to spend a couple of hours",
          "In the summer, this is an awesome place to bring young kids. It has a wide range of 'Alaskan' animals, including moose, musk ox, and polar bears. Because of the climate, it's limited on certain animals (no elephants). Parking is convenient, friendly staff.",
          "Lots of different animals, birds, etc. But sadly, no elephants. Wolves are very vocal with you when you make wolf sounds",
          "In all fairness, I might have given this attraction a 5 if it wasn't for the intense heat that day. Yes, intense heat in Alaska!!! The animals are all kept in large, realistic habitats. Therefore, there's a lot of walking through very confusing paths. The one thing that upset me",
          "Small little zoo. But they do have fair species or animals on exhibit. If you have seen the wildlife in Alaksa, I think you can give this a miss. The reason we drop by because we didn't came across any wild moose in Fairbanks or Anchorage. But the moose displayed here is",
          "The Zoo has only outdoor northern animals, but has excellent signage about each, and one experience unique to my zoo visits: watching staff walk the wolves on leashes.",
          "While it was nice to see some of the animals that eluded me in my outdoor adventures (and probably much safer) I was surprised to see the size - and lack thereof - of many of the enclosures, and I honestly left feeling rather sad. It was certainly educational, and the animals",
          "The zoo is small, and that would have been fine, but the animals need larger enclosures. Most of them were pacing back and forth and were not content in their spaces. Looked like they had lighting up that would make it beautiful when dark. Might be worth going when it is dark",
          "We like this zoo because it's Alaska animals. There's none of the \"normal zoo animals\" like giraffes, elephants, etc, but there are animals specific to Alaska hat other zoos don't have: musk ox, wolverine, moose, Lynx, etc. there's also a petting zoo inside the zoo for no",
          "We rented a car very inexpensively, and drove out from the hotel (About 20-25 min drive from Captain Cook hotel downtown Anchorage) You can do the zoo in an hour if you power through! Great morning activity before your noon tour picks you up Great for kids, they have good",
          "it's is truely an alaska zoo. the zoo is not loaded with a lot of different animal, only animals that are unique to alaska. it was like noah's ark of alaska. at each habitat it had the story on how the zoo acquired the animals. which a lot are animal that where abandon by their",
          "A good variety of animals, particularly as we want d to see bears, brown and black, polar bears (Kanu k from Australia was a big surprise ) moose, elk etc ect Worth a visit if you have the time",
          "A thoroughly pleasant and well laid out zoo focused on North American fauna. However, do not try to be friendly with the musk oxen. They are most definitely NOT interested.",
          "We had a great day at the zoo, the enclosures for the most part were very nice, the trails throughout the zoo were comfortable for walking. The gift shop is nice and the young lady working there was very helpful.",
          "It appears they are trying hard here to make a difference for these animals, and I do appreciate the effort. Zoos are about educating and giving animals a second chance at life. There are some unique creatures here that one might not see at a lower 48 zoo. It is an interesting",
          "Great zoo mostly featuring Alaskan wildlife and mostly to their credit housing rescued animals. It was great to visit in the rain. Few others there. Alaskan animals do their stuff in the rain. (Regrettably, Trip Advisor won't let me access all of my photos on my mobile app).",
          "Compared to other sites in Anchorage we considered the Alaska zoo to be good value. The zoo is small enough that you are actually quite close to the animals so you can see them easily. Mostly animals native to Alaska",
          "Was pleasently surprised to see lot of animals many of them local to Alaska in the Zoo. Family enjoyed it. Best part, we can cover the Zoo in 2/3 hours and there is free shuttle between Downtown and Zoo. Do not miss it if you have kids.",
          "We are visiting from Nashville - our zoo is large and spread out. The zoo was smaller but lots of neat Alaska animals and they r close up and very active!! We loved the Wolverines- we have never seen them before",
          "Great simple zoo, with Alaska animals and a few extra's. Always a favorite to go to several times a year. Must see when in town.",
          "This is a wonderful museum for all ages. It is small but contains a lot of native animals of AK. This sometimes is the only chance to see a moose, reindeer,wolves and more up close. The walkways are easy with not too many hills and they have golf carts for rent. We enjoyed it!",
          "The layout of the zoo can get a little confusing but overall this zoo is fantastic. I recommend visiting in September when the leaves are changing. The gravel path and boardwalks make it feel like a hike through the woods rather than a zoo. It was surreal with the color of the",
          "We went on a drizzly day and it was great! Felt like we had the zoo to ourselves! !! Great size for little ones to be able to run and see the animals. They also have the animals so that you can see them from any age and there are a lot of different sides you can see them from.",
          "Loved this place. We were able to see Alaskian animals as well as a few exotic animals. Learned a few new things about the caribou. Enjoyed watching a trainer feed a porcupine.",
          "The zoo is small and perfect! My kids had a blast! The souvenir shop was great too! It was the best to hear the wolves howl together! Something we will always remember!",
          "This is a small zoo but has a great collection of animals. Unfortunately the type of animals require large fencing, which makes photography difficult. Although, we did spend some time photographing the brown bears from the raised platform which was great. We were not provided",
          "This zoo is great for kids. It's small and very easy to see in just a couple hours or less; I love that you don't have to worry about planning your whole day around it because it's easy to fit into your schedule. I feel like there is a good variety of animals for the size of",
          "Not a very large attraction, but had a great variety of quality animals & attractions. Not too many places u can see a polar bear up close & all the sea otters/seals were so cute. Also love zoo lights in the winter. Very creative!!",
          "This is a zoo that takes great care to help and support the animals keep there. The staff really knows what they are doing. You can see a wide range of animals including the painting of their elephant friend. If you are short on time and want to see Alaska animals in action,",
          "I came away being reminded why I don't like zoos. Some of enclosures were inadequate for animals. I did like being able to see the bears close up that we had seen in wild at a distance. The wolves howling was great. Small zoo, easy to see everything within an hour or two.",
          "We had a great afternoon at the Alaska Zoo - it's probably one of my favorite zoos! While it was raining most of our time there, the zoo itself was built so that it wasn't really a problem - very shaded with enough structures to get out of the rain. The animals were very active",
          "It was nice to see all the rescues....only disappointment was the animal I came to see...a moose! He was so far from view he was difficult to see!",
          "This is a decent zoo, but you are in Alaska! You can see many of these animals outside of the zoo. Not a bad place for young kids, but if you are traveling to Alaska as a tourist there are other places to see animals which are better than the Alaska Zoo.",
          "There is a nice variety of Alaskan wildlife and paths are easy to walk. Great place for children of all ages!",
          "Went to Zoo since weather was nice and needed a side trip after fishing trip was canceled due to river flooding. Clean, small zoo.",
          "I was very saddened to see the animals in less than acceptable enclosures. The black bears were pacing up and down, smelling at every dry stick or branch, hoping for some berries. The poor polar bear had to endure a very small enclosure with only a rock setting and water, when",
          "As an animal lover I am a hesitant about visiting zoos but we didn't have any transport to go to the Conservation Centre and the zoo offered a shuttle. We really wanted to see some the Alaskan animals like caribou and moose. I was pleasantly surprised to find a beautifully",
          "A must visit if you have kids or if you are visiting Alaska and you have not seen much wildlife. Lots of parking and reasonable rates. The amazing to have a zoo this far North.",
          "The zoo is not beautiful, but there are cool animals. Very few options for lunch. I guess driving an hour to Alaska Conservation Center is a much better option!!!!",
          "It does not look much at the fist glance but it turns out to be one of the best zoos ever. In fact, half a way between a zoo and a national park. We planned to be there for a couple of hours and stayed three. Just one piece of advice: do not put your money in the Souvenir Photo",
          "Visited the zoo while in anchorage. Was a good visit.Saw animals we missed during the Tundra Wilderness tour at Denali! Although drizzling most of the animals were up and about!",
          "We got to the zoo in a rainy day, was a great low impact, informative and interesting visit. Most of the exhibits are open, some of them are not in the best shape, yet they are not bad state. Food choices at the cafeteria are ok, not great, but essentially good. In general was a",
          "The word zoo automatically turns off many people. I would encourage you to not be one of them. This is a small zoo located in the woods, or the natural environment of most of the animals which, if not specifically Alaskan, are from arctic areas. The majority of the Alaskan",
          "I live in North Carolina and we have a great zoo that I have found hard for others to live up to. The Alaska Zoo was not the NC Zoo but it was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. The Brown Bear exhibit was my favorite.",
          "What I love about this zoo, is you feel you are walking in a forest. It is all on trails, and the animals are mostly injured who would not survive in the wild. It is a must for families viisitng anchorage. It is a beautiful place.",
          "Went and visited the zoo. It's a very exciting feel for seeing anything from a Bengal tiger to a brown bear. It's worth checking out if you are in town. We chose this particular excursion because we have young child (a 4 year old). Yes, the zoo is small, but the grounds are",
          "Kind of sped through this one, but I'm glad we came. The animals are all well fed, don't look sad and malnourished. A great opportunity to see brown bears, leopards, wolves, and birds. Lots of families and kids. There's a petting zoo we didn't get to see, I'm sure it's fun as",
          "Since today was our last day in Alaska we decided to visit the Alaska Zoo. It was a good day 64 degrees. We arrived at the zoo around 11 am. Admission was reasonably priced. There were many animals to visit. We were a little confused by the map and missed some animals so had",
          "Perfect place to spend 2-3 hours. The environment is beautiful. Lush wilderness setting and the animals are beautiful",
          "Glad got free bus enjoyed the place got to see quite a few animals Need places here you can put camera so it does not focus on the wire They do not reply to phone calls",
          "We enjoyed the zoo very much. We spent an afternoon there and saw a very interesting mixture of Alaskan animals. A highlight was the wolves who started a chorus of howling while we were there. It was very funny and capped off a fun day.",
          "So this review is a little biased because I love zoos. However, I absolutely LOVE this zoo because most of their animals are rescues or injured, so they are actually getting a second life here. Some of the animals' living quarters should be a little bigger, in my opinion, but",
          "This was our last stop in Alska to satisfy our needs of seeing live animals. Went at a raining and cold early morning, didn't see many animals but finally saw two bears. Slightly far away from city center. Friendly service, the gift shop is good for kids.",
          "Zoos normally aren't my thing but I spent 3 and a half weeks in Alaska scouring the place looking for wildlife and missed a few animals I really wanted to see. My favourite enclosure were the wolves as they all looked super healthy and happy. Some of the enclosures looked",
          "Did not like the zoo at all. A lot of the animals looked very sad and a lot of the enclosures were in bad shape. The poor polar bear barely had room to turn around. Very upsetting and had to leave. I guess I'm used to zoos with better standards.",
          "Only takes 2 hours to see. Highlights were seals, polar bears, snow leopard (tail is amazing), and grey wolves. There were 5 wolves laying around until my 7 kids all lined up and started howling. Then one wolf started howling and immediately the rest stood up and started",
          "My family really enjoyed the Alaska zoo! Nice walking trails, great animal exhibits, beautiful grounds. Saw many native Alaskan animals. Lovely way to spend several hours!",
          "We did not see moose or bears in the wild so had to go here to see them, plus we wanted to see the musk ox and other native animals. We enjoyed our visit but were frustrated by the poor map provided (as were others while we were there). Neat that most animals were not in",
          "Our family (2 adults and 4 school age kids) spent a couple of mid-day hours here on a cool and cloudy August weekday. The zoo is a good place to see local wildlife (bears, wolves, moose, musk ox, dall sheep, etc) and a few exotic beasts (I think the kids liked the yaks the",
          "Easy to walk around in. Not many 'cages,' thankfully, so it had more of an open feel. There's a little cafe/store in the middle of the zoo that is a good place to stop if you're cold from the rain and need some hot chocolate! There's a tiny petting zoo area kind of off to one",
          "A good overall representation of local wildlife, but a large number of pictures spoilt by cage wires. Wheelchair accessible but on gravel paths with slight uphill incline",
          "The zoo is awesome. Polar bears, grizzly bears, Eagles, musk ox- the list goes on - all up close and photo perfect. My grandson has a goat there named Lauren - he visits her regularly and she knows who he is and comes down to the gate to meet him. Put the Anchorage Zoo on",
          "Small but nice zoo in a wilderness setting. Local wildlife to include moose, bears, polar bear, eagles also had some tigers and a petting zoo. Wear shoes with good traction.",
          "The zoo doesn't take very long to walk through, but it does have some really cool animals, many of whom were rescued and are unable to be returned to the wild because of injury. Good place to take the kids - they have a petting zoo and sights from a polar bear and moose to",
          "Many of the animals show stress from being in small enclosures. I felt better when I read that they try to keep the animals less than 2 years but then I noticed most of them had been there for years. I understand small zoo but I don't understand little better than a cage for the",
          "Stopped here on the way to the airport to return home. This was a great way to spend a few hours before an evening flight home...my grandsons were able to run around a bit, get one last looke at moose, bear, wolverine, coyote and many other of their favorite animals....enjoyed",
          "I visited this zoo as a small child and loved it. My children ADORED this zoo. We had a wonderful time looking at all of the animals. There are many different types of animals here that my children have never seen before so it was a special trip.",
          "You will see a lot of animals including ones that are not the norm for Alaska. Very natural surroundings. Ox, bear, dull sheep, mtn. goats, sea life just to name a few. We took our time and saw everything and it was a more than a half of a day thing to do, and we didn't have",
          "The zoo is very clean and affordable.Lots to see,very clean and maintained.The zoo had a petting area,,however it closed at 1 so we were not able to participate in that.Grand daughter was disappointed.With that being said,we still really enjoyed our visit!",
          "Great zoo to see Alaskan animals . There is a camel . Small zoo compared to ones in the \"lower 48\" but a nice zoo. Staff friendly .",
          "So much wildlife to see. The zoo do a great job of rehabilitating sick and injured birds and animals.",
          "I grew up going to this Zoo....(actually more half zoo half rescue) EVEN cooler! so I had experienced it mainly in the summer. This past December I went during the Zoo Lights...and it was so awesome! They have lights everywhere, the animals are still very active and the place is",
          "Good way to spend 2-3 hours. Had two kids (6 & 7) with us and they loved the various animals that were here. Many animals were natice animals to Alaska, like foxes, deer, cariboo, moose, porcupines, and polar bears. there were of course some not as native, like camels, but the",
          "First of all, you can get there with a free hourly shuttle from the Anchorage tourism office. The entrance fee was a bit much for me, but if you plan to stay longer than we did, it is worth the money. I went with a stroller and had some difficulty at some places but overall",
          "Almost all of the animals are indigenous to Alaska. Great place to let the kids visit. The cost is a little expensive, but no more than other zoos - it is not cheap to feed animals and care for them I would imagine. Still with as much fun as our little boy had seeing all the",
          "This is a very unique zoo where the animals and wildlife are close to their natural habitat as possible with spacious areas to navigate around. It is close to Anchorage with free shuttle and reasonably priced.",
          "The Anchorage Zoo is small and family friendly. We enjoy taking our Grandson's every summer. Last year we were delighted to see a baby seal just born the day we visited. The Alaskan wildlife is always a top viewing stop too! There is a lovely exhibit for the Siberian Tigers. For",
          "We visited Alaska Zoo in a heavy rainy day. We took a free shuttle bus from and to the zoo from Anchorage downtown Visitor Center. Travel time about 30 minutes each way. We loved to see the polar bear, brown bears and black bears in the zoo since we couldn't see them in",
          "This is not a large zoo but it is like walking through the woods and viewing the Tigers, polar Bears, Brown and Black Bear along with many other animals that really make this place special.",
          "The wife and I were driving by and thought it would be interesting to see what the Alaska Zoo had to offer. They had so much more than we anticipated! There were bears and moose, musk ox and camels, all sorts of great exhibits! The highlight was probably the wolves... when we",
          "We purchased the behind the scenes tour for $28, which included the admission of $12 per person. Marie our zoo volunteer was amazing. We were only 4 feet from the tigers and wolves, well, and a fence. She shared all the animals names, where they came from and the stories behind",
          "We enjoyed this relatively small zoo that was easy to navigate, with a surprisingly wide array of animals in very nice habitats. Thoroughly enjoyed this and would recommend the stop if you have a couple of hours.",
          "Took our granddaughter from Oregon to see the animals. When she comes to Alaska she asks to check out the new animals. It was a positive experience.",
          "A zoo like no other. The surroundings are gorgeous the animals are all visible. A true Alaskan experience. When in the anchorage area a must do.",
          "We live near a huge zoo, so big that it's hard to even walk the entire zoo. Therefore we enjoyed visiting the Alaska zoo where we could walk the entire zoo easily. The animals are all easy to see and there is ample shade. The zoo is a good value and my kids enjoyed it. We",
          "Definitely a waste of our time after our Alaskan cruise. Small run down zoo with animals in cages and not worth the visit. There are better modern open concept zoos in other countries which are way better (animals are kept in natural surroundings and there are no cages around",
          "Do not go here! Price is a few dollars more than website. There is hardly any animals we went in the afternoon and the few animals were hiding out and you could barely see them. The grass needed to cut. Needs a renovation!",
          "After reading numerous reviews on this zoo, I wasn't certain if we were going to love it. However, it was one of the coolest zoos I've seen as far as landscape goes. The designers basically carved living spaces for the animals out of the already existing plants and trees.",
          "Rode free non-stop shuttle from downtown Anchorage visitor center to Alaska Zoo. Took 20-25 minutes. Due to number of people waiting to return, took taxi back for $30. Shuttle trips are one hour apart, so if you have a scheduled activity after the zoo visit, be prepared to seek",
          "The Alaska Zoo in Anchorage is not that big, but the animals have lots of natural space and appear very happy. We were serenated with a howling concert by the five wolfs, yawned at by the impressive Amour (Siberian) Tigers and watched the polar bears jump into the pool after",
          "I enjoyed the zoo. The layout of the zoo follows the \"lay of the land.\" The paths wind around to use the space in a way that best benefits the animals and the humans viewing them. I loved how each animal had an explanation of how the animal came to be at the zoo. Many of the",
          "I am a zoo freak and this one really rates. Huge enclosures, natural setting. Loved all the raptors. Nice snack bar.",
          "We came to Anchorage via a cruise ship in late June. We chose this particular excursion because we have young children (a 1 year old and a 4 year old). Yes, the zoo is small, but the grounds are spectacular and well kept. The animals are well taken care of and one can see the",
          "We had a wonderful time and took the guided tour. The guide was very informative and shared lots of fun things about each of the animals. Many of the animals were sleepy as it was a very warm day. Would definitely recommend.",
          "So I came in on the shuttle from Anchorage. The shuttle was VERY convenient and free of charge (I did tip the driver though). The zoo itself was just \"okay\" in my opinion. I went around 11:00 am and apparently this was nap time for ALL of the animals with the exception of the",
          "We had a fabulous time. I highly recommend doing the discovery walking tour. Our docent was a intern at the zoo. She told us all about all the fun things she has been doing and all the animals she has got to interact with while giving us very interesting facts about all the",
          "We visited the zoo in July 2016. The free shuttle took us to the zoo and back. We spend nearly 40 min in the zoo. The zoo is very small and is ok for a family outing for small children from the local area. It is $15 for an adult Visit the zoo if you are looking for a place",
          "We had a great time at the zoo. We saw many different animals. Tigers, wolfs, musk ox's, Camels etc. The park is very clean and you walk to all the animals so here comfortable shoes.",
          "I enjoyed my last day in Anchorage visiting the Alaska Zoo. I wasn't lucky to see a bear or a bold eagle during my vacation trip throughout Alaska, but at the zoo I was able to admire these amazing animals. I spent hours appreciating each and every animal at the zoo, this is a",
          "I really like the fact that the zoo closes at 9:00pm in the summer. We really loved the natural feel of it. It's beautiful with trees, flowers, and a stream instead of a bunch of sidewalks and pavement. It's fun watching the animals that we don't get to see often as we live in",
          "We went on a Sunday afternoon after church what a treat to have him; I think that I had more fun with him then going the expressions on his little face was just priceless. The Alaska Zoo isn't your typical zoo it is more of wide open space natural habitat for the animals. It",
          "The zoo is small to medium sized (it took my friend and I thirty minutes to walk the whole thing). Compared to other zoo's I've been to it's a little disappointing; there was no reptile house or primates area. However you are able to get closer to the animals here than you can",
          "They have a nice collection of native animals set in a park like setting.The organization of the exihibits is a little confusing, but their map is helpful. Free bus from downtown makes it easy to get to.",
          "The zoo isn't huge by any standards but it's unique because you're walking through a forest vs. the traditional sidewalk, overly designed caged areas. It feels more natural and the animals are specific to Alaska which is really cool for out of state visitors.",
          "This is a small zoo with a gift shop & concession stand. Outside of the animal cages was overgrown. It was past needing mowed, it was very tall. Nice gift shop and concessions. 2 hours max needed for the stop.",
          "Went and visited the zoo. It's been years since I last visited it in 2002 and it still maintains a very exciting feel for seeing anything from a Bengal tiger to a brown bear. It's worth checking out if you are in town.",
          "I like zoos that really incorporate the natural environment into the exhibits of the animals. Not a huge zoo and not a lot of animals, but they seemed like they had plenty of enrichment and large enclosures, so very cool. It was rainy when I visited, but there are plenty of",
          "We stopped at the Zoo on our way into Anchorage because it was too early to check into our hotel. I'm glad we stopped as we saw much closer views of some of the wildlife than we were able to see in Denali. Many of the animals housed at the zoo are \"rescues\" - animals that were",
          "I was up visiting my grandkids and although they have been to the zoo here many times they wanted me to go with them. I expected it to be like the many other zoo's I have visited but I was pleasantly surprised. You won't forget that you are in Alaska as you walk through and view",
          "Zoo good for children under 10 years old. A small zoo, but that is not why they only got a \"very good\". They need some communication signs, , like the lower lot is for RV's and bus sign we never saw until we left. The top car lot is big and looks newly paved as part of the new",
          "I'm not really a zoo person but I really enjoyed my time at the Alaska Zoo. Their are a lot of animals to see and it's very clean. Many guides are available if you need help and the staff is friendly.",
          "This is the best little zoo I have visited in a long time!!! The animals are amazing, healthy and feed well!!! Well worth the time!!",
          "This is not the San Diego Zoo which I use to have a season pass too when I lived there... it is small. It is not the Palm Beach Zoo which I have also had a pass too... it is modest and does not have beautiful exhibits (and large monetary support). But it is a nice, little zoo",
          "Good way to see live animals that never seem to be out in the wild as advertised everywhere in Alaska. Some cages are too small there are a lot of birds and owls. Why they have camels is a MN mystery!",
          "I realize that many folks come here with a jaded view on zoos. Some expect maltreatment of animals or big, big, big (think San Diego, for example.) I've seen a fair number of zoos around the world, and zoos are not my preferred thing to do anywhere. However, I enjoyed the",
          "I have been going to the Alaska Zoo most of my life. I have seen the enclosures grow, animals change and usually get to see something new every time I go. I went again today with my 19 year-old step-daughter as a first timer and she had a good time. We got to see the foxes and",
          "Though the zoo is small and very well maintained, we were expecting some more animals. Just a few and most were sleeping. However is a nice place for walking and relaxing.",
          "Well-priced admission fees, only took us about 3hrs to look around, plenty of wildlife central to this part of the world, ate at cafe - reasonable prices. Good signage for navigation and also to relate about the animals there, Gift shop too.",
          "A short shuttle ride out of the Anchorage city limits, the Alaska Zoo was a great way to spend the afternoon checking out some of the native animals.",
          "A good variety of well cared animals in a natural environment. Had a great time, it took us like three hours too see it all. Go in confortable shoes and enjoy.",
          "The zoo has a very relaxed and welcoming atmosphere! It is all outdoors. There are many animals that are native to Alaska there and many that are not. It is a fun time for anyone : ) There is a lot of walking so I would wear good walking shoes and it usually takes us a couple of",
          "1st visit to the Zoo,the grandkids enjoy it. There is plenty to see. The only problem was make sure you have walking shoes on, you are in nature just remember that when you are walking. Tree stumps, roots & incline sloops not hills(lol). There also need to be more restrooms",
          "Yes we all want to see Moose, Bear and other indigenous animals. So....go to the Zoo. It's small and you will be surprised at the number of indigenous animals that you can see. A couple hours will do it and you will, at least, have seen some of the \"wild\" that you may not see",
          "Wonderful Zoo, fun for all ages. Well kept critters seem to have lots of space to enjoy. Good stop for tourists to get a chance to see some Alaska wildlife.",
          "We took the kids here because we usually visit the zoo of any major city we travel to, and this was not going to be the exception. It's average at best. There is nothing about this zoo that makes it a must see. We visited in mid-June, early afternoon. It is possible to see",
          "Being from Ohio, we have access to several great zoos with a variety of animals. The Alask Zoo is limited in the animals represented; however, the focus on local animals in a \"wild\" setting was very good. My dad and I spent around 2 hours exploring the zoo. All the animals",
          "My husband and I went to the Alaska Zoo on a weekend we were spending in Anchorage. It's was nice, but it's on the smaller side. Don't plan to spend the whole day there.. like you would if you went to the Portland, Oregon zoo... You will see all the animals here with in a few",
          "We visited to see the animals of Alaska and we were disappointed. The standard of the exhibits and the conditions for the animals was very sad. The maintenance of the whole zoo is in great need of help. Either the state and federal governments contribute some serious money to",
          "was nice zoo, more animals than I expected but many sleeping.. tho I busted my knee as small rock paths..so beware",
          "This zoo is run down with poorly kept animals in small enclosures. I truly felt so upset by the conditions the animals were kept in. There were large Eagles in small cages which would barely enable them to open their wings let alone fly at all. The zoo was full of tall weeds and",
          "I took my niece here for story time on Wednesday morning with her mom. This is geared toward younger children where they read a couple stories, then have one of the zoo workers take the group to the pen of the animal that was discussed that day. It's a nice quiet activity",
          "We unexpectedly visited the zoo today. We were visiting the visitors center and saw the free zoo shuttle. We had hours to fill before heading to the airport so we decided to hop on and go. We were pleasantly surprised with the variety of animals and habitats. It was well",
          "Lots of different animal but some of the enclosures look very bare, especially the brown bears. other however are very good",
          "This was included in our itinerary and although it was rainy, we enjoyed it. Not far from downtown, about a 20 minute ride. It wad rainy while we were there, so it wasn't busy. Some of the animals didn't come out of their dens at first, but on a second walk around, the polar",
          "We didn't know what to expect, but the kids really wanted to go. This is a very well laid out zoo with a lot to offer. We mostly wanted to see the bears and they did not disappoint. The Kodiak bear is a character and one of the Polar bears is so huge, I could hardly believe my",
          "We've been to a lot of zoos as well as seeing animals on safari. The layout of the zoo was a bit confusing and in many instances, the viewing was poor. Nonetheless, we saw many kids in the zoo who seemed to enjoy it so if you go with small children, they'll probably like it.",
          "My mom and I (both adults) went to the zoo yesterday because I wanted to see the animals that we don't have in New Orleans. Our zoo in New Orleans is amazing, but cannot offer awesome animals like Polar Bears, etc for obvious reasons. I had never see a Polar bear before! Or",
          "My son loved this saw 7 bears in about 20 minutes and you can to and it was not busy and we enjoyed this immensely",
          "The zoo is an excellent preservatory of animals. They have kept the animals in a very healthy manner. We took a \"behind the scenes tour\" and saw the animals much closer in their habitat. The guides and naturalist have a very personal touch with the animals which is great to see.",
          "This zoo was a great gem for a great price! There was a great variety of animals and there was a lot of attention and care spent on making the animals comfortable and giving them plenty of room.",
          "We visited at 5 pm in June. Asked whether the animals are likely to be awake. \"Of course\", we were told. The polar bear, brown bear, black bear, tigers and snow leopard (among others) were all asleep. Big disappointment.",
          "There is a free shuttle to the Zoo. It take about 40 minutes to get there from the center on Anchorage. The animal are mainly is small cages - and do not look happy. There are some that have bigger spaces - but most are in small cages.",
          "For $15/adult and 2 hours, this zoo is worth a visit by visitors who lack opportunities to visit Alaska's backcountry. Here, you will see, up close, the three types of bears, as well as eagles, dall sheep, and other iconic Alaskan animals (and a few surprises, like a Siberian",
          "Great little zoo well worth two to three hours. Free hourly shuttle from downtown log cabin visitors center. I suggest the discovery tour. Not much more than general admission and an intern leads a small group around and goes backstage on two of the exhibits. Polar bears are",
          "There is a free shuttle from the visitors center downtown to the zoo. The zoo has a good collection of animals that tend to live in the colder climates. Areas are large and natural for each type. We like zoos and would rate this a 9 out of 10.",
          "The shuttle from downtown was a bit frustrating. There is no defined line and we had waiting for awhile and when the shuttle came people pushed and shoved and then it was full and the only option was to wait another hour for another one! The Zoo itself was nice. After waiting",
          "Looking for a fun kid activity while in Anchorage, the Alaska Zoo was perfect. Saw animals we don't usually see in the lower 48, nice size so that everything can be seen in a few hours, perfect for our 3 year old grandson. Really appreciated the free shuttle to and from the",
          "I wanted to love this place, But I just couldn't. I have been to zoos all over the United States. The exhibits in this zoo have small habitats, too crowded together. The signs and lay out were a little confusing. Way too much wire, net and chain link in the habitats. I know",
          "We visited late afternoon and it takes about 2-2.5 hours. The zoo has mostly native to their region. The zoo rescues animals from the wild and the newest attraction was a baby bear but he wasn't out when we visited. The main attraction for me was the polar bears. The zoo is",
          "They have so many different animals. I am used to my zoo back at home in SC but this zoo just tops it off! Definitely worth checking out and the staff are very friendly. The gift shop was cheap, and I thought it would be expensive!! Got a tshirt for 10$.",
          "The Alaska Zoo was a fun way to get out of the house with the kiddos while visiting in Alaska. The zoo isn't very big and there aren't a ton of animals but the enclosures allowed easy viewing. Great outdoor adventure for families with small children and a few free hours.",
          "We really enjoyed seeing all the different animals. Our favorite part was ready all the different stories about the various different animals! We'd go again!",
          "We loved the zoo! I was hestitant to go because I read some mixed reviews but we were glad we went. It's not your typical zoo with exotic animals, they focus on local animals that wouldn't make it in the wild on their own. The whole zoo has a very rustic feel to it, the walkways",
          "This was our second visit to the Alaska Zoo. Our first was awful because all the animals looked miserable and lifeless. Thankfully, that was not the case this time! My kids (ages 12 and 8) loved it and the animals were very active. It was a great thing to do on a beautiful day!",
          "This is a small, but interesting zoo that features animals and birds native to Alaska. Most of the animals were easy to spot.",
          "The Zoo is quite nice and enjoyable. For what I read before, I thought that is was going to be really small, but it took us 3 hours to see it completely.",
          "The Alaska Zoo is less like a zoo and more like a wilderness park with animals. Nestled atop a hillside with the mountain backdrop it is quite relaxing. There are lots of rescue animals here. meander through the tree lined paths, howl with the wolves, and squauk like the ravens.",
          "I love the zoo, I have seen better but its a great little zoo. My favorite is the polar bear. The price is great, no real food, they have a small cafeteria with a few snacks. Must use the map, or you will miss some of the hidden attractions.",
          "My 10 year old son and I really enjoyed visiting the Zoo. The staff was friendly and the area while zig, zaggy was still pretty easy to find your way back. We loved seeing the animals so up close and the only recommendation I would have is to put up signs when an animal is not",
          "I like polar bears. The last time I was there the polar bears were so passed out that they almost looked dead, but it was cold enough that we could see their breath. There really isn't much to the zoo, but there are some animals that are pretty unusual.",
          "I really enjoyed the wide verity of animals the zoo had. I loved reading the stories on how they obtained the animals. It looked like they were getting ready to have a pretty large expansion.",
          "We have been to many zoos and this is one of the best. The animals are so relaxed and well taken care of, and most all of them were rescued. It is a very large zoo and many of the animals are native to Alaska and cold regions, the information is enjoyable and amazing to read.",
          "The zoo was magical with the lights show of different animals and sport activities. Many of the animals were active at night. The most impressive was a pack of wolves howling at the moon!",
          "Kids love it, lots of paths, safe and there is a stopping spot for refreshments. We have been there with Grandchildren winter and summer",
          "I've been to few zoos in the lower 48...as well as in Canada. This zoo was by far the best one I've been to. The animals are clearly well cared for...as well as the property. There is no litter on the premise, and the paths around the zoo are very well maintained. Although it",
          "I went here with a family group not knowing what to expect. It is not a particularly large zoo but was unique in that it's collection consisted of species which were native to Alaska and other similar climate regions in other parts of the world. The informational signage is",
          "You wouldn't think that Anchorage would have a zoo for long before the animals froze to death but apparently they make it through. A nice collection of native and exotic species. Adventuresome trails lead to the various exhibits. These are unpaved and even though there are",
          "It's a small zoo but has lots of interesting animals from Alaska and around the world. Hard to walk around if you're disabled, the paths were full of ruts and muddy with puddles. Friendly staff and informative, nice place to spend an afternoon or evening in the summertime when",
          "Nice zoo, especially for being where it's at. A good selection of \"Alaska\" animals. Takes a couple hours to see. Nice thing to do with the kids, they give an Alaska resident discount as well. Nice little sandwich/coffee shop as well. Weekends can get busy but we went during",
          "Not a huge zoo, but a very pretty one. Most of the animals there are rescues, injured or acquired because they needed care and cannot be released into the wild. Somehow it makes this zoo feel so much more like a real sanctuary. The story, as I understand it, about the elephant",
          "I had such an enjoyable visit to the zoo with my two cousins (6 and 8) and my Aunt. The zoo is an older style so the enclosures aren't huge, so there are really good views of the animals. They have really neat orphan pens where they take in different animals that have been",
          "What a sweet zoo, I love the variety of animals they seem to be clean and well cared for. Nice snack bar would have liked to have a bigger choice of food to choose from. Liked they had stuff for kids. I love seeing them laugh, my kids are grown, so seeing families with their",
          "My kids loved it but it isn't a very large zoo. Compared to other zoos I've been to this did not have a lot of big animals. The bear and tiger exhibits were cool. Lots of hills for the walk so be prepared.",
          "This was a cute little zoo. I have never seen a polar bear and they have 2. I didnt get to see the bear to good bc they had a worker calling it over to the other side of the cage. But overall a cute little zoo.",
          "Growing up here my family always donated to the zoo. They've redone a lot of it and it looks great. Absolutely the wolf enclosure is the best. The redone eagle enclosure is cool too.",

          "It cost a good amount if money and there is hardly any animals. It took maybe an hour to take my niece who is 7 and my nephew who is 10 around to every open exhibit it was definitely better before covid. Now it's a little disappointing",
          "Great place!  Kids had a great time here!  Plenty to see and do.  The facilities are very clean and well kept.  It seems like the animals are well cared for.  It wasn't over crowded.  Very nice atmosphere.",
          "We like the zoo enough that we got an annual membership despite living an hour away. We enjoy seeing the bigger animals there,  but there are quite the selection! Moose, caribou, yak, deer, grizzly bear, polar bear, black bear, musk ox, \u2026",

          "Anchorage, Ak zoo is a great place to take the family and enjoy the day. Lots of animals to see. My favorite being the tigers but all animals are awesome to see. My advice would be to get there earlier in the day to enjoy and take your time cause the zoo does close at 4pm daily.",
          "The Alaska Zoo is so much fun! There are many unique animals here that you can't see in other zoos and lots of fun \"extras\" too. It is a year-round favorite, especially in wintertime for zoo lights!",

          "I went to their night exhibit a couple days after the start of a new year. They had charming light/LED decorations (shaped like animals) throughout the zoo, and they had a surprising amount of active night animals. There were a few indoor \u2026",
          "Supet fun experience given the current climate, snacks available. Open restrooms, and creature talks are going on!",
          "It's quite small but they pack alot in that small place. The bear section was great and I could watch those otters all day long. I think overtime as more people visit Anchorage this zoo will grow into something even more spectacular than it is now. This is a must see attraction when visiting Alaska.",

I've been going here for YEARS and still have trouble finding the cafe...",
          "They were amazing. The wolf keeper was so amazing. He made sure my husband had his dream come true. Keep up the good work. Love you guys.",
          "Really beautiful zoo that is well spaced out. You get to walk through gorgeous landscape to each enclosure. Each animal was some sort of rescue and had something permitting it from being released back into the wild, but still it makes you somewhat sad to see them enclosed in cages. Beautiful facility though!",
          "Enjoyed our trip to the zoo this week. It was our first time and even though it is not real big it is a great zoo! Loved seeing the polar bears, snow leopard and musk ox.  Not something we can see in Texas. Nice layout with plenty of shade. Nice gift shop and coffee house.",
          "Small but nice zoo. Mostly local animals, well kept enclosures with great viewing angles",

I ran into the zoo keeper along the way who shares stories of the animals.  Stories of how the zoo got each resident was posted near the pens.",

          "Love the zoo!  They have some great animals and take good care of them.  Some cages are empty, which is a good thing for the animals :)",
          "Very nice zoo with lots of really nice exhibits and plenty of animals to enjoy!  Actually now one of my favorite zoos!  We actually visited later in the day, so it wasn't very busy and it was a cooler day so many of the animals were out front and center.  I hope to return someday when I make it back to Alaska someday.",
          "We went here yesterday for our sons first birthday and we all loved it. I adore that it is a rescue/rehab zoo and they have informational plaques that tell you the story of each of the inhabitants. Great prices and amazing people!",
          "Been coming to the Alaska Zoo to view the polar bears since 2002, went to the seminar about the declining beluga whale population in cook inlet on 11/13/2019, super informational with great speakers. Highly recommend the wildlife Wednesday series",
          "What a fun small zoo! We visited on the 50th anniversary when it was half price, and the staff were doing lots of scheduled visits in the pens with the animals. The staff was great at answering all of our questions while working with the \u2026",

          "Went for zoo lights. Was very impressed with the displays and attention to detail",
          "It was a little spendy for walking through the park in an hour with a toddler. It was a nice walk and there were some fun animals and it was nice the zoo was empty. We did go when it was snowing though",
          "Honestly when I first went I thought it was going to be kind of lame but this zoo actually has a really nice layout. I do wish they had a little more animals to show but for the size of the city it makes sense. Will definitely go again",
          "Very nice zoo. Exhibits are laid out with trees between them, giving it a very wooded atmosphere. A great selection of animals on exhibit.",
          "We got lucky, all animals were out and up close.",
          "Bueatiful holiday lighting throughout the Zoo. Snow leopards seemed to enjoy the cold",
          "Our 6 year old had a great time. We liked the wilderness feel of the zoo. The coffee shop was a great resting point and the gift shop had a nice variety of items to choose from. Overall, we spent about 3 hours there and saw everything in the zoo.",
          "Not a huge Zoo. Nothing new is Zoo. For what they have is really clean. Animal seem well cared for. Definitely not over the top. Give yourself about an hour maybe an hour and a half.",
          "Kid friendly.",
          "A really fun way to spend a few hours. Small, but they have a great selection of animals, most of them native to Alaska. Favorites are the seals, bears and owls. Not too expensive, and definitely worth the 15 bucks.",
          "Not physically the largest zoo we have seen, but very likely the most amazing collection of animals. All of Alaska\u2019s and Canada\u2019s bears, wolves, and moose, plus tigers and various yaks from Central Asia, and Snow Leopards!! One of the \u2026",

          "There were very few animals to see.",
          "Best zoo I\u2019ve ever been to! Much more nature-y and not your typical concrete sidewalks and manicured lawns kind of zoo. Many unique animals.",
          "Family friendly zoo. The natural enclosures create very relaxed vibe. Coffee shop yielded tasty treats and warm beverages .\nYum!",
          "Fun and the right price. The polar bear decided to not grace us with his presence but all the other animals were out and about. Cutest baby seal ever!",
          "I don't get to see moose, wolves, reindeer, and muskox back in the lower 48. So, for me, it was a great experience. It was cold and raining when we went, so there was no one else there but us. The grizzly bears are huge.",
          "Absolutely beautiful! The animals looked cared for, the staff was friendly and had a good knowledge of the animals.",
          "We have been to a number of zoo and it is aways fun to see \"local\" animals.  The bison and black bear gave a nice show",
          "Nice zoo! There are a lot of animals there. I enjoyed the trip.",
          "Loved this zoo! We got to see feeding time with the brown bears which was amazing! Animals seem very well taken care of and their enclosures are extremely nice!",
          "I thought the zoo was okay.  My biggest complaint was some of the pens were quite small and there was no sun relief.  It was warm the day we were there and some of the animals, with heavy coats of fur, had no protection from the sun's heat. \u2026",
          "Nice little zoo! Staff was very friendly! Very cool to see animals you cant see at other zoo's like polar bears, eagles, Grizzlies, ox, doll sheep!",
          "The only zoo in Anchorage. Easiest place to guarantee you will see many of the wonderful arctic and sub arctic animals that make Alaska famous.",
          "Animals were beautiful, hard to catch them all awake though",
          "To start this review positively the animals look healthy, and the Polar Bear Exhibit is being updated.\n\n  This being Alaska's only zoo, I figure it would have more government assistance and funding.\n\n \u2022 Online lists only 18 species of \u2026",
          "We love this zoo",
          "I\u2019ve never been here but I look forward to going once they lift their ridiculous mask enforcement rule",
          "A great way to see the animals of Alaska in one place and minimize your carbon footprint",
          "Had my daughter's birthday at the zoo. The kids and adults really enjoyed the experience. The special close up encounter with Nik (grey wolf) was pretty awesome \ud83d\ude42 Definitely a good place to take kids to.",
          "Good zoo. Since animals of exhibit and it want labeled. I hear it it's better in the mornings and at feeding time",
          "Great place to take the kids and spend a day. There is always something unique and the animals are amazing. The snow leopards are beautiful and are a true rarity to see.",
          "This is a very nice small zoo. I like that many of the paths are not paved (like say, the San Diego or St. Louis zoos). The paths are natural material and it makes it feel like you're walking through a forest full of beautiful and interesting animals. The zoo has a very nice gift shop too.",
          "Love the zoo lights and we come to Anchorage specifically for it annually. Plus hearing wolves howl back at kiddos is an experience",
          "Love the zoo! I am local but enjoy taking the kids frequently as we see different things each time.",
          "Love the zoo, we've been there for company events, Boo at the Zoo for Halloween, regular trips and even did our wedding there, very affordable, the only negative was they didn't keep very good track that we paid for everything and contacted \u2026",
          "So great, I heard it used to be bigger. Sorry I missed that, but amazing now",
          "Very Awesome! I was so happy to see the polar bears together finally! Watching the Grizzlies was amazing. Very clean, very kid friendly, and they take AMAZING care of their animals.",
          "Well taken care of animals with lots to see. Loved it that it has a write up on each animal they have.",
          "Love how this zoo is primarily indigenous animals.  The animals that are not indigenous, are all from the same temperate zone, so it is very considerate and thought out.",
          "Love animals",
          "The animals looked cared for, that's the only plus.The handicap acess is deplorable, dont even consider it as an option unless you have a 4x4 wheelchair, 98% of the zoo walkways are pea gravel. Even parents with strollers struggle going up hill. Really safe because it's one of the most beautiful settings for a zoo of its size.",
          "Wonderful, educational zoo with a beautiful wooded trail and lots of animals! Such great memories here!",
          "We did the zoo keeper for a day and it was amazing. We got to make diets for some of the animals and feed a handful! Of course, we had to um clean up after them too. But these up close encounters I will remember for the rest of my life!",
          "A great animal sanctuary that makes good use of the natural terrain.",
          "Llamas, musk ox, camels, wolves, snow leopards, tigers, bears, owls, porcupines and hawks are a few of the amazing animals residing at the Alaska Zoo in Anchorage.   All northern clime animals, so don't expect to see a penguin nor a monkey. \u2026",
          "Great place to spend a day. Fun day for all. Go to the 12:30 discovery tour, well worth the extra money.",
          "I loved this zoo I wish their were more animals though and was handicap friendly it's not paved and because of that wheelchairs and dirt don't really work out that great but it was very beautiful and I did enjoy the animal's I did see though",
          "Decent zoo, small selection. I was disappointed with the petting zoo specifically, perhaps a different worker should be running the petting zoo, one that is kid friendly. The lady was very rude about every little thing the kids did, they didn't get to pet a single animal because of it.",
          "One of the best location in the town to go with family and enjoy your time. I really like this place. Will surely revisit here.!!",
          "It has been a long time since I've been there. Loved seeing all the animals. It sure changed. Love, love.",
          "This is worth the visit while visiting Anchorage. It's a wonderful place with friendly staff that really do care about the animal guest they are hosting.",
          "All zoos get 5 stars from me. Instead of a walk in the park, take a stroll in the zoo! Grab a coffee midway and get some gifts too!",
          "My kids enjoyed their time here so much. We went later in the evening but unfortunately it was still to hot for the polar bears . We still had an awesome experience with the other animals",
          "The nachos were gross. But seeing the brown bear up close was so cool. And the wolves..",
          "Great day to spend time relaxing! Watched a black bear soaking up the sun",
          "Loved the zoo today! One of the tigers was a walking right along the bottom fence line, my grandbabies enjoyed seeing it close up!",
          "So much to look at. Beautiful paths to see animals. It feels like you are in the forest . A must see when in the area.",
          "Great zoo which include some really unique animals that are exclusive to that part of the world. However it needs to be maintained alot better which could be due to the lack of funding from the government since I only saw  2 or 3 workers \u2026",
          "Love the animals! They are so always happy to great people. The workers are so helpful and help with people with disabilities.",
          "Not your average zoo and that's what keeps the animals happy! A delightful stroll along the gravel trails, under a rustling canopy of leaves! No elephants or other large, southern hemisphere animals. Here you'll experience wolves, owls, \u2026",
          "The zoo itself is nice and has low admission costs. Unfortunately many of the animal exhibits were concerningly small, especially ones like the brown bear and harbor seals.\n\nI am not sure how well the zoo can provide for the needs of their animals in such constrained habitats.",
          "So scenic in the snow. Me and my girlfriend had the zoo practically to ourselves and it was great. The Christmas lights put up everywhere didn't hurt either. Check on the polar bear a few times because he tried hiding from us but the otters \u2026",
          "Didn't get to see very many animals. Might have been a timing thing. Such a lovely place and walk through that I didn't mind much.",
          "Small but that's ok. The zoo does not receive any public funding. Most of the animals there are rescues but a few have been snatched. Overall it was a good visit.",
          "Great zoo to explore. Wonderful exhibit's, though could use some better amenities as far as food goes. Just a small coffee shop with minimal snacks.",
          "Great zoo. The paddocks are cool and you get closer to the animals than any zoo I've ever been too. Good collection of animals. The wolves are the best! And Cranberry of course.",
          "Good place to spend in Anchorage! Is cost effective.",
          "Lots of sleeping critters but still a nice walk. They need to redo the map. It was super confusing.",
          "Love the zoo! Discovery tour is the way to go. A little more expensive but you get the guided tour behind the scenes and it's so cool!",
          "So thankful I was able to go before the polar bear passed, loved getting to see all the creatures! The owls were my favorite!",
          "Great place to visit in Anchorage for variety of animals from Alaska and other parts of the world. Tiger display was good.",
          "Not well managed. Animals are not in good conditions. So sad to see them to be unhappy. Only highlight is a free squirrel busy gathering pine cone for the winter, which is the only lovely thing in the whole zoo.",
          "Lots of great sights, cool animals, they look healthy, the zoo was clean. Staff were all busy educating individuals. There were about three school groups doing all sorts of neat stuff. I'd totally reccomend it.",
          "I saw lot of animal neglect and poor living condition. Especially bears and birds. They don't deserve caging. It was sad to see bald eagle cooped up in such small area. And three grizzlies in a small confined area. Coyote has no business in \u2026",
          "The Zoo Lights are fantastic! Nice job folks!",
          "Pretty disappointing zoo. Not clean. Limited educational panels. I can only guess that they suffer from lack of proper funding.",
          "Great place to check out. Staff was friendly and zoo was clean. The lady at the gift shop at the end was very helpful too.",
          "One of my favorite place in town to take visitors, because the animals are great, the mission of the zoo is an important one, and the walking paths around the zoo are enjoyable all on their own!",
          "Great time at company party, held at Alaska Zoo.",
          "This place is a maze in a good way. My daughter loved getting lost on the paths to different animals. We spent 2 hours here and didnt see everything. Great place to take toddlers to kill an afternoon.",
          "Loved our experience here. Got to witness feeding time and make the coyotes and wolves howl which was great. Also, Mr pickles the porcupine never disappoints with all his personality. Staff were very friendly and animals were out to play",
          "We had a great visit. The only thing missing was a polar bear but we saw everything else.",
          "Difficult to find animals using the map and signage. Lots of walking.  Animals looked well cared for. We did have fun",
          "Still an amazing place to visit. I haven't been in 10 years but took my neice today and had as much fun as ever. The wolf enclosure is amazing. My niece wanted to \"start a howl\" while all the wolves were asleep. Not only did she wake them up, but they all came to see her. Always worth a trip and if you've never been, you simply must.",
          "Love that the zoo is exactly like I remember as a kid .. in the middle of the forest surrounded by animals. Love me some ools",
          "Had a great time. Highly recommend the Discovery Tours. Well worth the $28 (includes admission).",
          "Love it but need lits of help",
          "The tiger experience is amazing!",
          "They know what will survive here.  Friendly staff, good food on snack bar, priced fair; food and admission.  Had raindeer dog, good and spicy.",
          "Alaska Zoo is a great place to take the family for an afternoon outing.  It usually takes our family about two hours to see all of the animals.  We bought an annual membership since we're a pretty large crew.\n\n(Admittedly, we were spoiled years ago by the Saint Louis Zoo; I still can't believe that place has free admission.)",
          "Always love visiting the zoo and really enjoy all their special events! Yesterday at a birthday party behind the scenes event, I dropped my cellphone. The staff tried to find it for me, but no luck. This morning my husband and I went back \u2026",
          "It would be a disappointment if you have visited the San Diego zoo but for what it is it's very nice",
          "A mixed experience. The young lady in the ticket booth seemed to want to be anywhere else other than there. Our first animal exhibit was the seals which couldn't really be seen under water because of the massive build-up of algae on the \u2026",
          "Delicious homemade burgers with special sauce and homemade french fries. Love this old time restaurant!",
          "Many of the enclosures had no animals in them. The place seems like it needs more funding.",
          "Nice small zoo. Very kid oriented. Can walk the whole zoo and not be exhausted. Saw many people struggling with strollers on the gravel trails.",
          "Wonderful animal. Saw goldeneye and dunkey",
          "Small easy to navigate. Enjoyed seeing all of the animals. Only need a couple of hours to see everything.",
          "Staff gives great care. Not the biggest but has the Alaskan animals and others. Enjoy!",
          "Nice place, I like the fact it's open all year round",
          "Best zoo in Alaska. Maybe the only one but still a lot of fun.",
          "Loved it here. They're open all year. The coffee/sandwich shop is lovely. I got to see the musk ox in person on a day when the farms would not have been open so I was very happy with my visit. The other animals are mostly rescues or trades \u2026",
          "For the price this is one of the coolest zoos I have ever been at.",
          "I plan to bring my daughter here. I think she will love the animals!",
          "Great place for kids .. u can walk through everything in 1hour and 30 minutes",
          "In the heat of the day no animals were out to see them. Smart enough to stay in their shaded areas.",
          "Worth a visit, loved Falcon, Tiger , Eagle and many other animals in the zoo. \nDon\u2019t miss tiger talk happens usually around 1PM (this happened when we visited in May) \nAvg time to complete the zoo is around 3 hours.\nBest time to go: 11 AM \nCheck out more pictures on my Instagram profile #iamphotophile17",
          "It is an amazing zoo that is like walking through the woods and enjoying the animals as we approach their home.",
          "It's a relatively small zoo.  But it was fun.",
          "Always fun to see local and exotic animals up close",
          "Love to spend my time here and see all the animals and scenery. They also have a lot of pokemon go stops which is super cool.",
          "Nice place.  well kept and good for kids to come and learn about animals. Wish the coffee shop hours matched zoo hours",
          "Fun to see in winter with no crowds, but definitely missed seeing the bears. They offer a lot of great programs for locals and the staff were friendly. Wish there were more spots to warm up during the walk, but otherwise a lot of fun!",
          "Nice calm zoo with lovely trails winding through the woods from one enclosure to the next.",
          "Enjoyed watching the new baby seal was so enjoyable! Thank you for being a responsible zoo that takes in local orphaned animals.",
          "Such a fun place with many of the most awesome animals from all around Alaska in one spot!",
          "Always good to see the zoo.",
          "I really wanted to like this zoo. The problem is the animals all look so sad being caged that it's hard to have a good time. The brown bears just sat there moping.",
          "We saw almost all the animals they have. It is very walkable and the babies made it there coolest zoo visit ever.",
          "Nice little zoo, but the special behind the scenes tour was $28! Too expensive for very little knowledge you gain. Just walk it yourself.",
          "I would love to see the poparbear feeding. Seen the back of them going back in. It was a real nice zoo.",
          "It's a great set up. They give homes to animals from all over the world. Most have been rescued and would have died. It is a must way to spend the day. And so very affordable",
          "Love all zoos this one has Christmas entertainment",
          "Enjoyed my time there, all the animals look well cared for and I especially loved the Off Exhibit.",
          "Zoo was nice. But better views of the animals were had at the Alaska Wildlife Preserve.",
          "Love the Musk ox. He showed his attitude... Lol!",
          "Great time with family and kids. Thank you!",
          "This is an awesome place to visit.  I loved seeing all of the animals in their natural habitats",
          "Great zoo alot of animals. Alot of animals were sleep when we went through. Zookeeper taught us about the porcupine.",
          "It was nice!  The trails were a little difficult since I am in a wheelchair but totally understandable for the environment.",
          "Great zoo. Small but easy to see all the animals. Enjoyed our time.",
          "We went to the Christmas zoo lights the night of the big earthquake, it was awesome that they were open when just about everything else was closed. The lights were really cute and it was really cool to see all the nocturnal animals being \u2026",
          "Had a great time with my family. Took just a little over an hour to walk around the park but it was priced appropriately.",
          "Bigger than it looks. It was great to see the different animals",
          "The staff was so eager to answer my kids questions and make sure they enjoyed the animals and learned something",
          "Really nice facility and the animals were active with the cooler weather!",
          "The Alaska Zoo is a nice size for such a small City and state.  It is well worth the price to stop in and support their efforts.  Strollers with small wheels are difficult to manage on the gravel paths.  Wagons work find and large tire \u2026",
          "The staff was very helpful, professional, and knowledgeable. The two women working at the petting zoo were willing to assist with questions from my eleven year old brother. Another female worker was able to answer all of the groups \u2026",
          "Its ways fun for the family to go to the zoo. My mom took me and my sister almost every week when we were kids.",
          "Nice zoo , very clean, animals seemed well cared for. The animals seemed very old...especially the wolves",
          "Supper nice place other than the animals were all depressed and sleeping",
          "Really nice zoo showcasing mostly Alaskan Native animals.  Walking is mostly dirt trails with mildly changing elevations",
          "Fun trip for the family. Plan for about two hours with kids, two adults could probably do the whole zoo in about an hour and fifteen.",
          "It's a nice place with the animals in their natural habitat. It is worth the price of admission.",
          "First time in Alaska and we wanted to make sure we made a stop at the zoo. So much fun seeing animals at the zoo we don't usually get to see down in Texas. I got an awesome, frame-worthy pic of the wolves. We were also lucky to see the \u2026",
          "4.5 out of 5. Just got done seeing the zoo lights. Great time and awesome animals. They have all the Alaskan animals, only reason it gets 4.5 and not 5 is because the AWCC is 40 min away and has almost just as many animals but is more of an Alaskan experience.",
          "We really enjoyed the view while visiting town.",
          "Im in a group visiting from florida and we wanted a nice experience to see the animals that was kid friendly. The prices are not bad, especially for a big zoo. We made our trek to see every animal. Only the red fox stayed hidden from us. \u2026",
          "Small, yet filled with local species in great environments.",
          "Such a small and cute place. Im very pleased seeing deers! It was very fun ^-^)\u2661",
          "Nice zoo but a lot of the exhibits were empty",
          "I love the zoo. I love this zoo.",
          "Great place to check out. Cool animals to see up close and the staff was super nice. Has an awesome gift shop that will make you wish you had an extra bag to bring stuff home.",
          "Best place to see all the animals of the tundra in one place.",
          "Nice staff, very willing to share their knowledge. A great place to visit no matter what your age.",
          "The animals were well taken care of and looked healthy. A great place to take the family and walk around.",
          "A great place to visit and its right in Anchorage! Thr coffee shop makes great lattes, the zoo is well kept and has a great variety of exhibits. Dont miss the river otters!",
          "Let me start off by saying the zoo it self was a great experience for me, my family and family friends. BUT, what ruined my ENTIRE day after exiting the zoo was the gift shops employee Sam, not sure if that even her name but, thats what she \u2026",
          "Nice, clean, gives a good feel of local wildlife. \nPaths are rocky and steep in some places. It is easier to have a jogging or trail stroller or pack little ones. It was lots of fun for my 4yr old. Enjoyed the information stations.",
          "Our experience at the Alaska Zoo was one of vivid and beautiful memories with family. We'll never forget the beautiful environment, where these gorgeous and splendid animals were kept immersed in nature. With a plethora of sights to see, we \u2026",
          "Small and just right for a few hours of walking around...most animals were out wondering around....",
          "Loved it. I would like to go back in 2 years",
          "Polar bear was not there. Watched bald eagle, snow panther very closely. The brown bears don\u2019t live in very good condition. They looked bored.",
          "Have seen better zoos. It wasn't bad.",
          "this is tough for me. i think i'm growing less fond of zoos these days. i found myself fairly depressed while walking the grounds as i noticed the very small, dirty enclosures, with most of the animals huddled in the corners of their \u2026",
          "Every time we are in town a trip to the zoo is a must. Very sad to hear about the loss of the polar bears.",
          "Decent for Alaska. Small. But my kids had a good time finished within a hour.",
          "This is a great place for kids to walk around and get rid of that winter energy. Animals well cared for. Clean and friendly. Christmas lights are fun too.",
          "I love that you get a true Alaskan experience from this zoo... It's wooded and gravel instead of cement everywhere.",
          "I love the seals \u2764",
          "Neat, clean, easy access and animals are well cared for!!",
          "Always amazing with the animals. The bears are the best to watch!",
          "Bad timing in winter snow and cold to be outside so much",
          "So I\u2019ll be the first to admit I am not a big zoo person but i really enjoyed the Alaska Zoo.  All of the animals looked happy and well taken care of.",
          "It was Great. Staff answered a bunch of questions. Watched the bears be fed. So fun.",
          "With 14, 3-5 grade it was fun. I think the animals just decided to ignore my kids. LOL",
          "Super fun day.  Cranberry the polar bear is beautiful.  Tigere qnd wolves and coyotes were up and about.  Out guided tour was awesome and very informative!",
          "Very nice little zoo. Many animals were off exhibit but I expected that as it's still winter. The animals still out were very active.",
          "Kind of small, but the kids had fun",
          "Small zoo that I still spent 3 hours looking at. Wonderful value for the $15 admission if you\u2019re looking for things to do in Anchorage.",
          "We loved all the animals !!  Especially the baby bears and baby moose that came to the zoo as rescues !!",
          "There are a lot of good exhibits of animals that are native to the far north. The walk from one exhibit to the next is very enjoyable. The forest setting feels natural to what you are here to enjoy. I do wish that there were more detailed \u2026",
          "I loved seeing the variety of animals but they were all very hot and hardly any shade for them was available. Tight confinement not enough mobility.",
          "A nice zoo with a fair amount of exhibits.",
          "Very nice but very short walked the whole zoo in an hour",
          "Cute little zoo",
          "I really enjoy this zoo. It\u2019s small and easy to navigate, affordable, has a cute gift shop and coffee/snack shop, and the people have always been really friendly. I love that they built a little playground for the little ones! I would say that my kids enjoy this activity for about 1.5-2hrs.",
          "It had a food and a gift shop and so many animals there was a squral or chickmunk in a tree outside for some reason really werid but fun thank you",
          "Small zoo, but very nice. Takes about 3 hours if you take your time.",
          "Loved it!!! Awesome experience!!\nWe got to see Arctic animals.\nWe loved seeing the huge brown bears.\nWe watched the river otters play, and the\nPolar bear was amazing.\nThe bull moose had huge antlers.\nWe would highly recommend going!!\nThe slushies are so wonderful!!",
          "just hoping they are already on their way making improvements on the brown bear cage because blah blah blah... just see it for yourself... but, everything else was just fine, although the animals look sad...",
          "Really nice visit today! There were curators at the moose, the fox, flying squirrels answered all our questions and more \ud83d\ude01",
          "Fantastic space offered at a reasonable rate at the Gateway Complex.  I have rented the facility 6 or so times now.  Worked with a few different events coordinators. Everything has always worked out great.",
          "Love the animals! All of the animals are rescues and the staff is super friendly!",
          "Adorable little zoo. Majority of animals are indigenous to alaska, but a plenty of outliers. Took us approximately 2 hours to see everything at a moderate pace. Admission is reasonable  with a cute coffee shop and gift store. There is a \u2026",
          "Iij t was awesome seeing all the animals",
          "Awesome experience! One of my kids wanted to see a moose while we were in Alaska.  The zoo offered that and so much more.  Great day at the zoo but wear walking shoes",
          "In Love",
          "Surprisingly great zoo for being in Alaska. My girlfriend and I had a great time. If you find yourself in Anchorage it's worth the visit and ten bucks.",
          "Get to see many iconic Alaskan wildlife",
          "Exhibits are poorly signed and don't appear to be upto date.\nPower washing during open hours\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd28",
          "Beautiful zoo! Staff is friendly and a cute gift shop.",
          "Beautiful place.  Well organized, maintained, and a thoroughly enjoyable place to spend the day. See Alaska's animals up close.",
          "Some nice exhibits but signs are in short supply. Not easy to find things at times",
          "It's a nice little zoo in the woods",
          "The place looks overgrown, along with bored looking animals. Overpriced for what you actually saw. Not convinced they even have half of what they say they do. Waste of time, I hope the animals are getting taken better care of than it seems",
          "First time going there got some good pics.",
          "Kids loved it. Animals look well cared for. Clean",
          "Great spot to see Alaska's critters plus a few \"out of state\" visitors. An easy one hour walk can pretty much cover the grounds or a little longer if you're escorting the kids. Well worth a look",
          "Animals are up close and personal when out! Gotta love those seals\ud83d\ude04 Amazing Zoolights for the whole family during the holiday season \u2764\ufe0f",
          "My son absolutely loved it!",
          "A small zoo but worth the time spent to visit.",
          "Nice zoo exhibits were well kept and natural surroundings",
          "Wonderful zoo that cares for the animals and makes them comfortable",
          "We love to see all natures creatures but just wish they had a lot more room to roam.   It's kinda sad to see them in such small enclosures for them.",
          "Good place to take the kids . But a little pricey for how little bit of animals they do have at this zoo.",
          "Had a great day with my son and his fellow bear Cubs. (Scouts)  always a fun educational way to spend the day.",
          "The zoo is a lot of fun to me and I love animals. The zoo is small and easy to walk around winter or summer. The animals are all Alaskan except the camels, lamas, yaks and the tigers. However they were all rescued from the wild and it is a \u2026",
          "Small zoo with multiple construction projects going. A couple of new bear Cubs which were adorable playing outside. Not a great day to go probably since most are Arctic species and it was too hot for them! The snow leopards were down close to the gravel trying to chill off which was quite cool since they were so close.",
          "Always improving the experience for the visitor and the habitat for the Animals.\nExcellent place to go with friends and family, but also to go by yourself.  You can find quiet places here to sit and think, not always easy to find in this city.",
          "This is one of my most favorite zoos, and we visit zoos everywhere we go. They focus on animals from Alaska, and you get to walk around in a nice wooded area.",
          "The tiger and polar bear where nice to see",
          "An embarrassment of a zoo....multiple exhibits off display and only animals visible are musk ox, bald eagle, and otter. Noisy, small, poorly maintained.....don't waste your time.",
          "Great small town zoo! Great place to see the animals of Alaska without going into the bush. It is very well maintained and has exceptionally friendly staff. I go here every time I visit anchorage and thoroughly enjoy every visit.",
          "Small zoo, layed out well for space it has. Seeing a wolverine was pretty cool. Black bears weren't out of hibernation yet but brown bears were enjoying the sun",
          "Clean, easy layout, clear paths for wheelchairs and strollers",
          "A good place to see exotic and alaskan animals. They have a great gift shop and petting zoo for their goat population. It's a great place to bring your family if they have never seen these types of animals.",
          "It is very nice small zoo and dirt paths so mind your shoes.",
          "Great zoo, quiet and the kid loves it.",
          "They have a lot of different animals. It is spread out.  I actually missed a bounch  of exhibits and didn't realize it until we had left. Their gift shop is nice and clean. It is a great place to come and relax or bring children.  It is good for groups or solo.",
          "A great place to see a lot of wildlife that lives in our great state that you probably would never see outside the zoo.",
          "Awesome place to let the kids see animals! The sea otter was my boys favorite! He was swimming back and forth in the window while the ran back and forth with him\ud83d\ude0e",
          "Loved the zoo. Great pictures of the animals. Loved that the walk around as it was very natural. Easy to see all th animals within 1.5 hrs if you have tight time schedule.",
          "A little sleepy, but it was a nice walk, and more animals were active than I anticipated.",
          "Not really worth the time. Barely saw any animals either they were sleeping or not even visible",
          "The worse zoo we have ever seen. The weeds are so grown you can not see the animals. The animals pens are not maintained like they should be. This zoo should be shut down until they find someone that LOVES animals and take their job to \u2026",
          "We had a great time at this zoo. We went on a weekday and it wasn't too crowded. They have a wide variety of animals and open enclosures. We watched the wolverines and coyotes run around and play. The wolves also gave us a howling a acapella to enjoy.",
          "Very nice zoo. Clean and the animals seemed very well taken care for. And first time visiting was nice to see different animals as compared to the one I live near.",
          "Always good for a cute date",
          "Really amazing zoo for its size with all sorts of things for kids to runs and do.  Lots of hills so be ready for some exercise.  Fun place to get out and escape the hustle and bustle of town.  Gift shop and snack bar inside, as well as ample parking.",
          "A good place to take the kids to see the animals and learn about them",
          "Very clean, people at petting zoo were very nice",
          "We love this quaint zoo. It's as great few hours spent with animals that I feel we get to know because of how often we go!",
          "Great exhibits \nUnreliable transportation poor food selection drop a star",
          "The polar bear was the best!!! Loved all the informational signs too.",

          "All the animals were super active.",
          "Great local zoo to view bears and wolves.  The wolves always catch my eye and the exhibit is built nicely to view them pretty closely.",

          "Zoo lights were so nicely done! We so enjoyed our evening",
          "SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION\n\nFor 6 years, Cranbeary and Lee have lived together at the Denver Zoo, and by the looks of it, the two have gotten quite close. Unfortunately, the two are about to ripped apart \u2014 and even worse, the two are destined \u2026",
          "Incrediblely fun i reccomend for a date or a family day out \u2661\u2661 the animals are well taken care of and the docile friendly attitudes reflect it the show offs \u2661\u2661\u2661",
          "We enjoyed the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center more than the zoo since it seemed like the animals had a bit more space and a bit more natural of an environment, but I respect that the zoo seems like it's mostly animals that were rescued; they frequently have signs posted with the origin stories of their animals.",
          "Such a nice place to visit with the family! Animals are all easy to view and the grounds are kept very clean. The pathways are gravel so any strollers or wheelchairs should be aware.",
          "Can't wait to see this zoo in different seasons! Even though it was snowing and cold, and my mobility scooter got stuck a few times... I got to see Alaskan animals and birds in a great atmosphere. We bought season passes and we are visiting \u2026",
          "Loved it! Got to see very different animals. The animals were all well taken care of. The zoo had a nice picnic area with a small play area for the kids. It has a nice cozy coffee shop as well. The food selection was good. I loved the hot cocoa \u263a\ufe0f ",
          "I felt bad for these animals...",
          "I was here for a Warehouse 49 event and had a great time. The venue was clean and spacious. I didn't go into the zoo on this trip but when I have in the past it was a great experience! Large enclosures (for a small zoo) and friendly, \u2026",
          "A great way to see animals safely.",
          "Nice place. Check out this Zoo!",
          "We love the zoo here because well there is no other one in Alaska. I'm really happy they put in a little park for the kids near the pavilion so there is a covered place to eat nearby the bathrooms.",
          "Great little zoo for little kids. The perfect amount for little ones to walk around and see all Alaska and the Arctic have to offer. Prices are reasonable as well. Check out the annual pass for a great deal.",
          "My partner and I visited the zoo today and we both felt really sad for many of the animals. Although physically they are in good condition, they were bored, pacing tracks around enclosures and sad eyes. Why not charge a higher admission and \u2026",
          "Brought all 8 of my grandchildren along with my daughters mil. She also brought a slew of adults and 3 more of her grands.  We had a great day walking around and this was a SuperHero event so the kids enjoyed pictures with those also",
          "Lots of fun for children, some creatures may be off exhibit but still plenty to see. We went around noon and found many animals were napping so there was not much excitement factor but we all enjoyed ourselves. It took about 1.5 to 2 hours \u2026",
          "Fun little place to stop by.  Seals were cute!",
          "Alaska,s animals up close =) Great family outing \u2661",
          "Had a great time here, but if you or someone you want to bring has accessibility issues this may not work. Some paths are way to steep or rough and almost all enclosures require you to walk up at least a few steps.",
          "We had a good time at the zoo, but the petting zoo was closed. Entrance prices are reasonable but there are no exotic animals. The exception was the Siberian tiger but it was sleeping so far away we couldn't even take a picture of it. Polar \u2026",
          "My family loves this place. Beautiful place to spend in the summer and winter. My daughter loves going back often, especially for their perfectly salted popcorn.",
          "I had really good time in here. It was fun watching Alfa  and also beer .",
          "Nice zoo good price",
          "Gotta go in summer. Gotta go especially Italy in winter.  The extra bucks for a tour is worth more than you expect.",
          "Best zoo I have ever visited. The variety of animals there is amazing and most are there for their own safety. Beautiful setting, great staff and free shuttle from downtown Anchorage.",
          "It was a nice relaxing visit. The exhibits were clean and the animals seemed happy, and I didn't get any poop flung at me!",
          "Nice to see some animals, unfortunately the petting zoo was closed.  With the cold weather several off exhibit signs.. which is good the animals are being cared for. \nWe will try again this summer.",
          "Great place to see Alaska's animals. Nice wooded setting without tons of concrete everywhere like other zoos. We got great photos.",
          "Really nice to visit once atleast",
          "Great place to view all the Alaskan animals. Easily spend half a day there. Do the behind the scenes tour for an awesome experience.",
          "Loved the brown bears, they put on a show by themselves. Dissapointed in the polar bears though.",
          "As animal lovers, the zoo was a must!  It is quite small; but, the best part is they cater to the local animals, so we were able to see, photograph and learn about most of the Alaska wild!!  It is quite small; but, has the best layout for viewing, it that the enclosures are accessible from all sides!",
          "Small zoo with outdated accommodation for the animals.   Most of the viewing for visitors  are through wired  fences.  They also put children's  toy's in there with the animals.  The whole experience you get is very unnatural.",
          "Very good place, alaskan animals only..its ok to enjoy time with kids..",
          "Nice local zoo. Many of the animal exhibits are outdated and cramped. Trails though the zoo could use better signage.",
          "Not too shabby; staff was great, facilities were clean, animals were well cared for, just a small zoo",
          "It's a Zoo and it is a good place for exercise it's not too terribly expensive and they give you a discount for being an Alaskan",
          "We loved going here year after year",
          "It was pleasant but cold, we are in Alaska after all! I wish the walkways were heated, we would have stayed longer!",
          "A good portion of the exhibits were empty and overgrown so it was really hard to see some of the animals that were in there habitats",
          "A very nice zoo with a nice selection of animals in natural looking surroundings. There is even a free shuttle provided from downtown Anchorage!  Highly recommend if in Anchorage.",
          "We had a great time at this zoo. The price was reasonable and the even though the animals were in large cages/areas, we were able to see most of the animals up close and personal.",
          "Great place to take the family!!!  Small but enough to occupy the kids for a bit!!",
          "Nice small zoo.  Needs some TLC done around the zoo.",
          "They do not have wheelchairs available or for rent.  They suggest you order a golf cart T least a week in advance.",
          "Always a wonderful place to visit!",
          "It's pretty small as zoo's go, and a visit can last you a few years, but I remember really liking it as a kid and on field trips, so I'd say it's pretty good for that.",
          "Great small zoo! Nearly all of the animals are rescues--abandoned cubs, healed injuries, or maladies from birth. If you are not from Alaska, there is no better place to see all of the wild arctic animals you have hoped to see. The prices are reasonable and the behind-the-scenes tour is unbelievably detailed and in-depth.",
          "It's very nice and well kept.",
          "It is a beautiful place but number of animals is so limited. Maybe because of season but only half of the cages where filled",
          "Small zoo easy to navigate with ample parking. I love to see animals in their natural habitats, but the animals at the Alaska Zoo were housed in enclosures that were small or didn't have enough behavioral enrichment. I did get to see a musk ox for the first time, and I was excited about that.",
          "Love it!!! Good zoo.  Many animals like Black Bears, Grizzle Bears, Moose and others. Great facilities, really beautiful.",
          "The animals were in beautiful condition and easy to see.",
          "You wanna see Alaska Animals? You wanna take your kids out for a few hours? Gotta kill some time and want to do something that won't leave you bored, come here. It's neat to see animals you don't usually see in zoos. If you felt you've \u2026",
          "Wasn't really impressed with the selection of animals or their habitat.",
          "Very sad place. Old fashioned zoo.",
          "We love the Alaska Zoo and get the annual family pass. Our 3 year old son especially loves running the trails. Super happy they added a playground for young children.",
          "Fun when it\u2019s not cold!! And zoolites are entertainment",
          "Great zoo. I was able to see all the animals which can be a rare thing in a zoo. The animals seemed happy.",

          "Fun place for families.",
          "Enjoyed walking around on a sunny day-. Alot of the animals could not be seen & a few exhibits closed for remodel.   Liked the layout.  Seen it, done it kind of zoo.",
          "Small enclosure and sad looking animals",
          "Always have a good time bringing the kids",
          "Great! I live in Alaska and still haven't gotten tired of seeing the zoo. Went during feeding time, a first, which was awesome!",
          "The animals were almost all asleep and frankly looked a bit sad. Maybe it was the warm weather. The setting is pretty though.",
          "I really enjoyed my visit- we went during the Zoo Lights (where they hang Christmas lights up in the park and you can walk around at night) and it was really cool to see the nocturnal animals in action- the tigers were out (pacing as they \u2026",
          "We had a great time, each exhibit had great informational signs and the animals are well taken care of. Admission prices were great, military discount is available.",
          "Great zoo! Many animals you don\u2019t see everyday but... there are moose and animals you do see everyday which is understandable for tourists. On the other hand the otters and swans swimming places aren\u2019t big or super clean and the polar bears \u2026",
          "It's not a very good zoo. Ok for kids however.",
          "Nice little zoo enjoyed it alot",
          "The Alaska Zoo is one of Anchorage's not so well hidden treasures. If you have the opportunity to go around 2:00pm - 3:00 pm I've had the most luck at that time seeing the animals feeding.",
          "Really nice lay out of the place with lots of interesting animals to see. Some of the areas - outside the viewing windows of the seals and the dining area near the playgrd need more maintenance tho as these appeared to be not so clean.",
          "A wonderful night of Zoo Lights.  Great displays and family fun.",
          "Friendly place that is educational and a great rehabilitation center for injured animals. Reasonable pricing.\nMap was a bit confusing though.\nEnclosures offer various viewing angles.\nThey offer personal tours and interactions with certain \u2026",
          "Great zoo. Excellent for children. Rescue and conservation are important missions here, and with all northern animals, it is open all year.",
          "It was our 1st experience w/sum of of our famz from out of state.  We didn't see no polar bears nd it was too pricey but not worth it!!!",
          "We go back again and again. Fun place to take grandchildren.",
          "All the Animals were very active today. Wolves and kids were all howling!!",
          "very nice sanctuary type zoo",
          "I love taking my family to zoos and enjoying the presence of the animals.",
          "We visit each time were in Anchorage. It is not as large as other zoos but I love how up and personal you can get with animals. They focus more on Alaskan and northern animals   .  Well worth the stop.",
          "Great place to teach kids. Members night with the Christmas lights was awesome.",
          "A fun place to visit with kids :) very well made n spaced out :) found it a lil expensive for $30 pp.",
          "Had a wonderful time with family",
          "Best little zoo!",
          "Nice pleasant place for family. Beautiful arctic animals. Well worth the visit",
          "Staff was amazing but the animals were in tiny cages and looked sad.",
          "The zoo is interesting, it is in a natural setting and most of the animals have been rescued or born in captivity.  It's fun to see them up close.",
          "Overall ok experience.  The zoo is not big, and lots of animals are taken off the exhibit when we were there.  However, they did a good job getting animals that are injured and taking care of them.  My favorite was to see the moose in \u2026",
          "The zoo had interesting animals. The coffee shop was experience was less than desirable. An expansion of the serving and paying area would be very welcome.",
          "Nice zoo very clean with good variety of animals with some very well thought out viewing areas. Price for entry was very reasonable a very nice way to spend the day if in the area.",
          "I love our zoo.  It's smaller and more simple than others I've been to, but I think it's authentically Alaskan while throwing in a couple of surprises (like Amur tigers for one example).  It is setup in a way that you feel like you're \u2026",
          "Been here before in the summer. Great activity to bring little ones on nice days. Tonight (2018 Black Friday) we attended the opening of Zoo Lights. Fun event where various Christmas lights are displayed through the zoo as you visit with \u2026",
          "Lots of fun stuff for kids!",
          "Not bad, kinda small",
          "Bear in the zoo is still great",
          "Staff is friendly and facility is clean. Unfortunately it appears the Alpaca has hoof rot. Hopefully, the staff is aware and taking measures to fix. For a non government funded zoo it was very nice. Wish some animals had more space but budget limitations are to blame.",
          "This place is awesome! So many animals, it ranges from A-Z! It was such a pleasure here! Of course one of the best zoo\u2019s.",
          "Lots of cool animals to see.",
          "We enjoyed our day there not a very big Zoo perfect and enjoy to see the Alaskan animals enjoy highly recommended",
          "Been coming here since I was a kid. The animals are all native to the climate and are either orphaned or rescued. It's all outside in the woods so gravel paths extend all around. Paths are all wheelchair accessible.",
          "Not too many animals in the zoo.",
          "Enjoyed the zoo",
          "Was fun for me and the kids, nice walk.  beautiful animals; The Tigers were my favorite",
          "The zoo is a nice place to go. It's small but with a lot of amazing animals.\nBut the cages look small too and the polar bear seemed very alone to me...",
          "Some exhibits gave animals plenty of room,   but others seemed cramped.",
          "Nice place for family with young children",
          "Too many empty cages. Over grown. You took the Snow Leopard from Abq. My home . just jokes",
          "had fun taking my daughter there she was so stoked on all the animals we saw there",
          "Great place to see some of Alaska's native wildlife in a great setting. Wander along through forested paths to animal enclosures.",
          "I miss BINKY \ud83d\ude2b",
          "Definitely fun!",
          "This zoo is a medium sized, somewhat confusing maze of trails, but we managed to see all of the animals, and we were not disappointed. We watched and listened to a group of wolves howling. We watched the grizzlies eating. We watched the \u2026",
          "Company Christmas party. The zoo is an excellent place for a party.",
          "most of the animals that I saw at the zoo came to the zoo injured and where not bred in captivity. I loved that. I also witnessed the connection these animals have with there caretakers. A falcon was sad to see its caretaker leave after \u2026",
          "Animals looked miserable and it was overrun with trees, bushes, and weeds. Won't be returning.",
          "My favorite part is the information on exhibits that tell where the animals came from and why.",
          "Ok place. Not well kept",
          "Graet place",
          "Great place for kids and adults to visit. Not that large but has all you need for part of a day to see the animals.  Snow leaopard, Grizzly bears, tigers, and a polar bear.",
          "Always a great place to visit for Alaskans or visitors. I have an annual pass and go often with my son. Lots of rescued animals and sometimes they are baby bears.",
          "Fun to go see animals",
          "Beautiful zoo all the animals and grounds were very good. A very good visit . Highly recommend",
          "Small intimate zoo",
          "Great atmosphere and the animals look happy. My kids loved this place and ran around having a blast! It is surprising large and I think we missed some stuff! Plus they have a free shuttle from downtown and back!! ",
          "Great collection of Arctic animals. Zoo lights in winter a real sight to see.",
          "Go here. Gorgeous and fun with admission pretty cheap! Best thing ever. I highly highly reccomend it!!",
          "Always a fun family time!!!",
          "Awesome Zoo came all the way from New Mexico thank goodness for places like this they've saved quite a few animals you get to see animals you've never seen before",
          "Poor animals. They are wild animals, but they have to stay in small cages. Through their eyes, I found the deepest lonely.",
          "Good city zoo.",
          "Brought my mother in law from Hawaii. Was a great experience.. not so fun to push a stroller though. Pack your baby!",
          "Beautiful facility,  perfect for kids and adults:)",
          "There is a large variety of animals, and has a very well set-up, although there are many animals that aren't able to be there, but there's plenty for you to enjoy. Also I recommend to go during the winter, because the animals are more active so they can stay warm, and it won't be as busy.",
          "The staff is great and the zoo itself takes in animals who were injured to the point that they would die in the wild so they take care of them... But it is also pretty boring, if you have been there once then you have seen everything, they don't do a lot if there isn't an event being hosted so timing is everything.",
          "Fun for the whole family @",
          "A great way to spend the day.",
          "Loved this zoo! Went during mid-February and there wasn\u2019t a soul in the place! It was absolutely awesome. Got to see the beautiful tigers they had - I do worry that the animals aren\u2019t cared for extremely well but they seemed to be okay.",
          "It was so-so. The Arctic Fox's area was nothing but high grass and bushes...actually some of the exhibits were like this. It was good enough for the kids but my daughter was disappointed a couple of times due to the animals being hidden.",
          "Sorry it was very depressing. You have better experience in the wild.",
          "All these animals are rescues which I think is so cool. The exhibits are a little ran down but it was a nice little zoo.",
          "Small zoo, quite rundown and small enclosures for animals... I wouldn't waste my money on it if I knew before hand, hopefully they get some more funding to improve and keep helping the animals.",
          "Depressive animals\nThe animals have really small cages. Especially the birds, wild cats and bears.",
          "Staff were not friendly,zoo needs tic and lots of it.",
          "It's not as large as some of the zoo's in the lower 48, but it's set up for a nice 2 hour walk. It was also clean and organized well.",
          "Not the zoo it used to be. So many empty areas.",
          "Great zoo! The animals were very active as it was overcast! The howling wolves were eerily cool! We spent about an hour and a half there with a 10, 8, and 4 year old. Would recommend.",
          "Small but very cool zoo! Wide assortment of creatures! Cute food and coffee shop! Playground for the little ones! Also they go all out for several holidays... Halloween is really cool! ",
          "Second time visiting, had a great time both visits. \nDefinitely a must stop if you're planning a visit to Alaska.",
          "I enjoy the improvements being made, miss the bee exhibit though.",
          "Great for families, very natural looking, they really love the animals and focus on public education as well as animal rescue!",
          "Lovely walk among bears, camels, eagles, wolverine, tigers, musk ox, seals, moose and more. Great way to spend a sunny afternoon.",
          "I like the zoo. I think I was expecting a bit more, but it was still good.",
          "Simple but nice zoo.  They could use more signage to exhibits and exit. A bit hard to follow their map. We enjoyed our time there though.",
          "This zoo is different than most in the lower 48 in that it's smaller and seems to have a different focus.  We we lived in Phoenix we used to go to the Phoenix Zoo which is nice however I prefer The Alaska Zoo because the walk is so much \u2026",
          "It is so beautiful and it was really fun .. its  Definitely worth it.. \ud83d\ude0a",
          "Very nice place.  Good for families to use as a park with an annual membership.",
          "The Alaska Zoo is awesome. It's a great place to take the kids for some outdoor exercise, and they love the animals, many of which will interact with you if you're there at the right time  of day. They have many weekly and summer programs \u2026",
          "Nice zoo, close to airport. Great way to spend the afternoon before we flew out.",
          "Liked that all the animals are native to the environment and many were rescued. However, many enclosures were difficult to see animals in. The map was confusing as were the signs along the path. Seemed to need some updating.",
          "We had an enjoyable time here, but there was no one around to answer questions or stand by the popular exhibits offering information.  Budget cuts maybe?",
          "Some of the exhibits (e.g. tigers) were great with plenty of room for the animals to roam. The little ones were engaged with the petting zoo.",
          "I visited right after Christmas & it was beautifully decorated.  So clean.  All animals are rescues who can no longer live in the wild, and are indigenous to the area.  I learned so much!  A treasure!",
          "Not a lot has changed since I was kid going here over 20 years ago. Most of the same animals and a lot of them are local animals to the region. Small compared to other city zoo's. It is worth checking out but not a place you would pay to go in again and again.",
          "If you go there expecting a big city zoo, you will be disappointed. If you go interested in Alaskan and Arctic animals and willing to walk in a wooded setting, you should have a good day.  You might even learn from the interpretative signs. \u2026",
          "First of all the place is deserted. The animals are miserable and hungry. I did not see maintenance staff or anyone tending to the animals. It is poorly funded and there are a lot of animals that are lonely in a cage. There are a lot of \u2026",
          "I went in October and it was pretty dead, not to many ppl and it was pretty small. I'll bring my daughter when she's old enough to appreciate it.",
          "Great tourist location and fun for all ages, but could use some renovations as many exhibits are either scheduled only or out of order.",
          "It was very cold and not alot to see. Most animals where out of sight?? Xould not even get a warm cup coffee.",
          "Had A lot of fun with the kids, the exhibits are well kept and they do tend to move animals around to accomodate them while they remodel so some signs may differ from whats in the exhibit. Kids all had a great time, also bring your own food and play at their kids park next to the picnic tables.",
          "The zoo is relatively small, but features amazing animals.  Take the time to read the story of the animals that are in the zoo, they are pretty impressive.",
          "Would have got 5 stars had I seen a polar bear. And if the brown bears had a better enclosure. Other than that it's nice zoo.",
          "The place was really nice but most of the animals were asleep.",
          "Hardly any animals waste of time and money",
          "What animals I saw looked not well and I need of help",
          "Perfect size, quiet, beautiful animals.",
          "Fun day at zoo",
          "I really liked this zoo, more than most I've been to. It was a nice last stop on our last day in Alaska, but compared to all the epic adventures and scenery we experienced, including native animals in the wild, it felt a bit tame by \u2026",
          "I went here when I was a little kid. I took my wife and son today and had a excellent time. Beautiful grounds and animals. Added quite a few things since I was there about 15 years ago. ",
          "Get to see all the critters up close",
          "Great time, loved it ,especially brown bears exhibit, trainer was very informative.",
          "Good sober fun at the zoo",
          "Fun zoo with a nice gift shop.",
          "The zoo is little, but feels cozy. I lover all the flower baskets in the summer! They have story time for the little ones. Fun thing to do with kids.",
          "One of my favorite places. You can feel the heart of the Alaskan spirit here. Local volunteers helping to rehabilitate Alaskan wildlife. Love this place.",
          "Winter twice in one month very fun place to go",
          "Definite place to stop by if you're visiting.",
          "They really could use paved paths",
          "Great hidden treasure! Close-up, personal views of the animals.",
          "I was there with my daughter and granddaughter. Granddaughter ran in the five to six age group. Was a great day.",
          "Plenty of mammals and birds, but be aware there aren't reptiles or amphibians. Totally worth $15 admission. Great trip for both kids and adults! ",
          "Nice selection of animals. Good coffee shop with reasonable prices...and Irish creme to boot!",
          "Interesting animals, but looking a bit 'tired'.",
          "Very clean and well maintained! The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. The animals seem to sleep in the middle of the afternoon though, so I will have to try going sometime earlier in the day when next I visit. My daughter's favorites are the seals and the petting zoo!",
          "Wife was at the zoo last week walking down the sloped pathway when she slipped on the P gravel.  She fell on her back and injured it. She is still experiencing pain.  Pea gravel on a sloped trail? Are you kidding me! You might as well pave \u2026",
          "What awesome zoo for everyone all kinds of animals even \ud83d\udc2b camels",
          "Would have been better if we had been able to see the polar bear. But besides that it was a good little zoo.",
          "I feel like I wasted my time and money. Most of the animals weren't out and it was the middle of a nice day...",
          "Amazing animals, friendly staff. Great zoo to visit.",
          "Wished could have seen the Polar bear who was asleep for over two hours. Sighting of the other animals was a wonderful experience",
          "The Zoo lights are awesome. Beautiful to experience!!!",
          "Great place for family or a relaxed activity with friends!",
          "Good place to bring kids, not many animals. Facilities are basic",
          "Very nice Zoo.",
          "If I had never been to another zoo any place else I would likely think it was a great zoo. But it's really small, there isn't a lot of animals and the enclosures are on the smaller side.\n\nBut they do have some pretty cool animals like a \u2026",
          "I like the layout like your in the woods taking a walk.",
          "A nice place for a walk\nNot so much a fantastic zoo as it is very limited but if you have 2-3 hours for a walk it is a pretty good time."

      "name": "Earthquake Park",
      "text": {
        "wiki": "The 1964 Alaskan earthquake, also known as the Great Alaskan earthquake and Good Friday earthquake, occurred at 5:36 PM AKST on Good Friday, March 27. Across south-central Alaska, ground fissures, collapsing structures, and tsunamis resulting from the earthquake caused about 131 deaths.Lasting four minutes and thirty-eight seconds, the magnitude 9.2 megathrust earthquake remains the most powerful earthquake recorded in North American history, and the second most powerful earthquake recorded in world history. Six hundred miles (970 km) of fault ruptured at once and moved up to 60 ft (18 m), releasing about 500 years of stress buildup. Soil liquefaction, fissures, landslides, and other ground failures caused major structural damage in several communities and much damage to property. Anchorage sustained great destruction or damage to many inadequately earthquake-engineered houses, buildings, and infrastructure (paved streets, sidewalks, water and sewer mains, electrical systems, and other man-made equipment), particularly in the several landslide zones along Knik Arm. Two hundred miles (320 km) southwest, some areas near Kodiak were permanently raised by 30 feet (9 m). Southeast of Anchorage, areas around the head of Turnagain Arm near Girdwood and Portage dropped as much as 8 feet (2.4 m), requiring reconstruction and fill to raise the Seward Highway above the new high tide mark.\nIn Prince William Sound, Port Valdez suffered a massive underwater landslide, resulting in the deaths of 32 people between the collapse of the Valdez city harbor and docks, and inside the ship that was docked there at the time. Nearby, a 27-foot (8.2 m) tsunami destroyed the village of Chenega, killing 23 of the 68 people who lived there; survivors out-ran the wave, climbing to high ground. Post-quake tsunamis severely affected Whittier, Seward, Kodiak, and other Alaskan communities, as well as people and property in British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California. Tsunamis also caused damage in Hawaii and Japan. Evidence of motion directly related to the earthquake was also reported from Florida and Texas.\n\n\n== Geology ==\nOn March 27, 1964, at 5:36 p.m. AKST (3:36 a.m. UTC), a fault between the Pacific and North American plates ruptured near College Fjord in Prince William Sound. The epicenter of the earthquake was 12.4 mi (20 km) north of Prince William Sound, 78 miles (125 km) east of Anchorage and 40 miles (64 km) west of Valdez. The focus occurred at a depth of approximately 15.5 mi (25 km). Ocean floor shifts created large tsunamis (up to 220 feet (67 m) in height), which resulted in many of the deaths and much of the property damage. Large rockslides were also caused, resulting in great property damage. Vertical displacement of up to 38 feet (11.5 m) occurred, affecting an area of 100,000 square miles (260,000 km2) within Alaska.\nStudies of ground motion have led to a peak ground acceleration estimate of 0.14\u20130.18 g.The Alaska earthquake was a subduction zone (megathrust) earthquake, caused by an oceanic plate sinking under a continental plate. The fault responsible was the Aleutian Megathrust, a reverse fault caused by a compressional force. This caused much of the uneven ground which is the result of ground shifted to the opposite elevation. \n\n\n== Tsunamis ==\n\nTwo types of tsunamis were produced by this subduction zone earthquake. There was a tectonic tsunami produced in addition to about 20 smaller and local tsunamis. These smaller tsunamis were produced by submarine and subaerial landslides and were responsible for the majority of the tsunami damage. Tsunami waves were noted in over 20 countries, including Peru, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Japan, Mexico, and in the continent of Antarctica. The largest tsunami wave was recorded in Shoup Bay, Alaska, with a height of about 220 ft (67 m).\n\n\n== Death toll, damage, and casualties ==\n\nAs a result of the earthquake, 131 people are believed to have died: Nine died as a result of the earthquake itself, 122 died from the subsequent tsunami in places all around the world, five died from the tsunami in Oregon, and 12 died from the tsunami in Crescent City, California.The quake was a reported XI on the modified Mercalli Intensity scale \"indicating major structural damage, and ground fissures and failures\". Property damage was estimated at about $116 million ($0.73 billion in 2018 dollars). It is likely that the toll would have been much higher had the quake not occurred after 5 PM on Good Friday.\n\n\n=== Anchorage area ===\nMost damage occurred in Anchorage, 75 mi (120 km) northwest of the epicenter. Anchorage was not hit by tsunamis, but downtown Anchorage was heavily damaged, and parts of the city built on sandy bluffs overlying \"Bootlegger Cove clay\" near Cook Inlet, most notably the Turnagain neighborhood, suffered landslide damage. The neighborhood lost 75 houses in the landslide, and the destroyed area has since been turned into Earthquake Park. The Government Hill school suffered from the Government Hill landslide, leaving it in two jagged, broken pieces. Land overlooking the Ship Creek valley near the Alaska Railroad yards also slid, destroying many acres of buildings and city blocks in downtown Anchorage. Most other areas of the city were only moderately damaged. The 60-foot (18 m) concrete control tower at Anchorage International Airport was not engineered to withstand earthquake activity and collapsed, killing William George Taylor, the Federal Aviation Agency air traffic controller on duty in the tower cab at the time the earthquake began.One house on W. 10th Avenue suffered peripheral damage, but only one block away the recently completed (and still unoccupied) Four Seasons Building on Ninth Avenue collapsed completely, with the concrete elevator shafts sticking up out of the rubble like a seesaw.\nThe hamlets of Girdwood and Portage, located 30 and 40 mi (48 and 64 km) southeast of central Anchorage on the Turnagain Arm, were destroyed by subsidence and subsequent tidal action. Girdwood was relocated inland and Portage was abandoned. About 20 miles (32 km) of the Seward Highway sank below the high-water mark of Turnagain Arm; the highway and its bridges were raised and rebuilt in 1964\u201366.\n\n\n=== Elsewhere in Alaska ===\n\nMost coastal towns in the Prince William Sound, Kenai Peninsula, and Kodiak Island areas, especially the major ports of Seward, Whittier and Kodiak were heavily damaged by a combination of seismic activity, subsidence, post-quake tsunamis and/or earthquake-caused fires. Valdez with  32 dead was not totally destroyed, but after three years, the town relocated to higher ground four miles (6.4 km) west of its original site. Some Alaska Native villages, including Chenega and Afognak, were destroyed or damaged. The earthquake caused the Cold-War era ballistic missile detection radar of Clear Air Force Station to go offline for six minutes, the only unscheduled interruption in its operational history. Near Cordova, the Million Dollar Bridge crossing the Copper River also suffered damage, with Span #4 slipping off its pylon and collapsing. The community of Girdwood was also confined to the southern side of the Seward Highway when water rushed into Turnagain Arm and flooded or destroyed any buildings left standing to the north of the highway. Only the ground immediately along the highway and that on the north side of the road dropped, prompting geologists to speculate that Girdwood may rest upon an ancient cliff face, now covered by countless thousands of years of sediment and glacial deposits.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nA 4.5 ft (1.4 m) wave reached Prince Rupert, British Columbia, just south of the Alaska Panhandle, about three hours after the earthquake. The tsunami then reached Tofino, on the exposed west coast of Vancouver Island, and traveled up a fjord to hit Port Alberni twice, washing away 55 homes and damaging 375 others. The towns of Hot Springs Cove, Zeballos, and Amai also saw damage. The damage in British Columbia was estimated at CA$10 million ($81 million in 2018 Canadian dollars or $76 million in 2019 US dollars).\n\n\n=== Elsewhere ===\n\nTwelve people were killed by the tsunami in or near Crescent City, California, while four children were killed on the Oregon coast at Beverly Beach State Park. Other coastal towns in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Hawaii were damaged. Minor damage to boats occurred as far south as Los Angeles. Effects of the earthquake were even noted as far east as Freeport, Texas, where tide gauges recorded waves similar to seismic surface waves. Seiches were detected in wells in countries around the world, including England, Namibia, and Australia.\n\n\n== Aftershocks ==\nThere were hundreds of aftershocks in the first weeks following the main shock. In the first day alone, eleven major aftershocks were recorded with a magnitude greater than 6.0. Nine more struck over the next three weeks. In all, thousands of aftershocks occurred in the months following the quake, and smaller aftershocks continued to strike the region for more than a year.\n\n\n== Recovery efforts ==\nAlaska had never experienced a major disaster in a highly populated area before, and had very limited resources for dealing with the effects of such an event. In Anchorage, at the urging of geologist Lidia Selkregg, the City of Anchorage and the Alaska State Housing Authority appointed a team of 40 scientists, including geologists, soil scientists, and engineers, to assess the damage done by the earthquake to the city. The team, called the Engineering and Geological Evaluation Group, was headed by Dr. Ruth A. M. Schmidt, a geology professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage. The team of scientists came into conflict with local developers and downtown business owners who wanted to immediately rebuild; the scientists wanted to identify future dangers to ensure that rebuilt infrastructure would be safe. The team produced a report on May 8, 1964, just a little more than a month after the earthquake.The United States military, which has a large active presence in Alaska, also stepped in to assist within moments of the end of the quake. The U.S. Army rapidly re-established communications with the lower 48 states, deployed troops to assist the citizens of Anchorage, and dispatched a convoy to Valdez. On the advice of military and civilian leaders, President Lyndon B. Johnson declared all of Alaska a major disaster area the day after the quake. The U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard deployed ships to isolated coastal communities to assist with immediate needs. Bad weather and poor visibility hampered air rescue and observation efforts the day after the quake, but on Sunday the 29th the situation improved and rescue helicopters and observation aircraft were deployed. A military airlift immediately began shipping relief supplies to Alaska, eventually delivering 2,570,000 pounds (1,170,000 kg) of food and other supplies.In the longer term, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led the effort to rebuild roads, clear debris, and establish new townsites for communities that had been completely destroyed, at a cost of $110 million. The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center was formed as a direct response to the disaster. Federal disaster relief funds paid for reconstruction as well as financially supporting the devastated infrastructure of Alaska's government, spending hundreds of millions of dollars that helped keep Alaska financially solvent until the discovery of massive oil deposits at Prudhoe Bay. At the order of the U.S. Defense Department, the Alaska National Guard founded the Alaska Division of Emergency Services to respond to any future disasters.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Specific ===\n\n\n=== General ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Face of Disaster: The Great Alaska Earthquake \u2013 US Office of Civil Defense\n1964 Good Friday Great Alaskan Earthquake \u2013 University of Arizona, Department of Geosciences\n1964 Great Alaska Earthquake \u2013 United States Geological Survey\nThe Effects of the March 28, 1964 Alaska Tsunami in British Columbia, Canada \u2013 George Pararas-Carayannis\nThe Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964 \u2013 Alaska Earthquake Information Center\nThe short film ALASKAN EARTHQUAKE (1966) is available for free download at the Internet Archive\nAnchorage, AK Good Friday Earthquake, Mar 1964 \u2013 GenDisasters.com\nTsunami Anniversary \u2013 Oregon Field Guide\nFifty Years Since the Great Alaska Earthquake: The Role of First Responders in Catastrophic Disaster Planning \u2013 113th United States Congress\nTsunami Forecast Model Animation: Alaska 1964 \u2013 Pacific Tsunami Warning Center\nThe International Seismological Centre has a bibliography and/or authoritative data for this event.",

          "We did not get to enjoy the beautiful views here as it was foggy and rainy. That said, we were still glad to have made this stop and learned about the 1964 earthquake and how it impacted the state. There are plenty of places to explore if you have the time. If you don't, spend",
          "Mainly its a park with several bike/walking paths. If you like geology and, or, history, this will be a real treat.seeing how a massive earthquake can change the land.",
          "We made the visit to Earthquake Park to learn more about the most recent earthquake. Not a lot to see but a lot to read about with good illustrations on boards along the walkways.",
          "The evidence of the 64' quake is somewhat overgrown by the rebirth of the forest, but that is interesting in and of itself. To get the most out of a visit be sure to take the interpretive trail that winds through the interior of the park. This trail is an offshoot of the",
          "Blue hour, day, or night its the best place to see DT Anchorage. Plus on a clear day ya can see Denali",
          "A reasonable hike and a very interesting sight given the severity of the earthquake in 1964. The drop in the landscape is dramatic.",
          "We visited Earthquake Park after an Alaskan cruise. We had several hours in Anchorage before our flight and this was one of the places we wanted to see. There was a major earthquake in 1964 and at this park you can see where the landscape was changed. There are several large",
          "You don't really grasp how devastating the 1964 earthquake was until you see how dramatically the land dropped off. A walk through this park really gives you a feel for how powerful a force was unleashed upon Anchorage.",
          "It is a peaceful place to visit and to read all the information available on boards explain what happened and when.",
          "Enjoyed a walk along the path and learning a bit about the history from the informational stations. Not really highly recommended, though. Could just be me but it was a basic walk near the water.",
          "Earthquake park had a nice story behind it. The information provided at the park regarding the earthquake was very good and interesting, its a nice spot and good place to take pictures.",
          "This was a stop on my trolley tour. I didn\u2019t walk through the park but it looked very interesting. Our tour guide gave a first hand account of the event, very educational.",
          "The displays tell the amazing story of the earthquake, but your own eyes can observe the landscape and see how it was changed in an instant. Now, the park is right on the water with bikers, runners...and bears, in our case. A very pretty place to visit...and educational to",
          "Nice paved trail (accessible) with signs along the walk, at the end is an interesting display about the huge 1964 earthquake and tsunami that followed. Imagine a 40 ft wave that's covered in oil and on FIRE! swooshing into town.",
          "This was a very educational experience. Not only did you get the exercise of walking the trails, you learned by reading the posted plaques a long your journey.",
          "Good place to visit. Self-guided tour explaining the earthquake that took place. It shows it's affect on surrounding areas including Seward. It is a short, 5 minute walk to the view the informational markers. You can actually view how far the ground shifted. It is located",
          "This is a well signaled trail that remembers the devastating earthquake. It's very close to the airport and is possible to arrive with bus from Anchorage. No animals when we visited it",
          "Great place to see at least from far, Denali park. Hopefully I can be there soon. Awesome place to go",
          "We cycled along the Tony Knowles bike path and came across this Park. It gave a good explanation of the eatherquake that occured in 1964 in situ. You could see the impact of that event all around you and the story boards in the park explained earthquakes and this one very well.",
          "We enjoyed a nice little walk along some of the trails and found it most interesting. The narratives and signs, along with the untouched terrain since the quake, provided a good education to how devastating the record quake really was.",
          "We did not \"tour\" this park, but went through on a city tour where they explained the earthquake and the devestation. Neat place to stop in and see.",
          "Before my wife and finished our vacation in Anchorage I wanted to see the harbor. Earthquake Park gives a excellent view point and a nice informative walk. The area has some other parking spots and a bike path. You are also on a ring road outside the Airport which a lot of",
          "We drove to this area and reviewed the historical markers. It was interesting but I would not go out of your way to see it. The hiking around the area was nice and the bike riding as well.",
          "We visited the park twice, once as part of a bus tour that stopped and let us get off at the viewpoint of Cook Inlet and Anchorage in the background, and again at a different point on the trolley tour where we did not get off. The viewpoint was definitely worth visiting, but we",
          "This is a filler if you run out of things to do. I thought it would be just more educational about the earthquake of the 60's. If you have any other place to go try that first.",
          "This excellent site truly helps one to understand the nature of and devastation by earthquakes. Plenty of parking and nice trails to reach the center. Do not miss it when in Anchorage.",
          "It was kind of neat to visit but not very spectacular. I actually thought the devastation shown would be severe.",
          "The park is well maintained and adequately explains the earthquake that happened in this area. The paths are wide and very suitable for biking and walking. It was an easy walk. Noticed bike repair station on the path which was a great addition.",
          "This park may seem unassuming at first glance, but there's a lot to learn about earthquakes in general, particularly the 1964 earthquake that hit Alaska. You can still see the way the quake changed the landscape. The park also has informative signage and photos which show how",
          "Only the remanents of 2 houses peek up above the soil. Quite something to see the strength that earthquake he\u2019d.",
          "You can see the mud flats when the tide is out and there's silage along the way telling you about the place. But, all in all, its a walking, jogging, bike path. Pets are welcome, just keep them on their leash. Parking is free.",
          "We stopped by to see how the terrain changed with the earthquake in 1963. Nice pabed walking trails and a view of the ocean. Interactive signage. It is heavily wooded and we experienced several misquitos. We met a cyclist who had just seen a moose but we did not see it",
          "On July 17, 2019 we rented our car and drove to Earthquake Park. We went to the 2nd parking area, the one where a side road from the post office comes to Northern Lights Blvd. We could not see Denali because of the smoke from the fires, but our view of downtown Anchorage was",
          "Wow! Our tour guide told us all about the 9.2 magnitude earthquake in 1964 and today, there is still evidence of the earthquake where the plates collided and the land buckled as the ground is warped and you can see where parts have collapsed.",
          "Short walking tour to see the effects from an earthquake. In 1964, a record setting earthquake struck Anchorage Alaska This cause the ground to drop which is the park today.",
          "The trail is mostly paved to the signed areas explaining about the imoact of the quake which i found interesting. There are some trails for hikers looking for a more difficult hike.",
          "Learning experience. Affords several nice walks through the forest and to a river. Educational. Shows the effects from a major earthquake.",
          "A nice stop to see some beautiful scenery. Could have probably seen Denali if is was not for the smoke from the wildfires south of Anchorage. We did see whales! Woot!! There seems to be biking/hiking trails throughout the area and the trails are very nice.",
          "I read about the big earthquake that hit Alaska in the 60's. We had just flown in to Anchorage and wanted to stretch our legs after the long flight. We found the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail and saw that it was 3.3 miles from our starting point to Earthquake Park. We stared off",
          "I recommend a walk through Earthquake Park - it's very lush and dark, and one of the strangest forests I've ever walked through. Bring lots of bug repellent.",
          "Lovely park for visitors and residents; biking/hiking trails for all. We went to see the exhibit on what happened in the 1964 earthquake; a major chunk of real estate (with homes) fell into the cook inlet; very Tragic! Nice foliage along the way to the view of the water! To",
          "Neat place to see what Mother Nature can do to change the world. 1964 earthquake and the power is demonstrated at this area. Had to believe that in 4 minutes the earth shifted as it did",
          "We arrived very early in the morning and very quiet. Walked to exhibit from parking lot. Amazing what can happen in an instant! Informative displays.",
          "This park is absolutely beautiful. It was greatly damaged during the tragic 1964 earthquake. The tundra across the street was also very interesting. The trees there are the only ones that grow on permafrost.",
          "This is a really interesting, historical hike! Plan to spend just an hour or two there--unless you walk in through the Coastal Trail from town. One word of advice, bring bug spray! The mosquitoes are relentless :)",
          "I go to or through Earthquake park nearly every week on the coastal trail. The jumbled terrain is interesting and is the result of the 64' earthquake shaking the loose sand and clay downslope (and taking houses and cars with it). There is an interpretive trail at the bottom of",
          "Nice park area located on the Anchorage trail system and Tony Knowles Coastal trail. Great views of downtown Anchorage, Sleeping Lady, Cook Inlet and aircraft heading in and out of Anchorage.",
          "This park was recommended by an Alaskan local. She said the view from along the path looked across the water at downtown Anchorage. It didn't disappoint! I was there when the waters were calm, and the city with the mountains behind it reflected in the water. There is a first",
          "Went here to try to see some moose without any luck. But there are beautiful views along the road on both sides.",
          "Time had healed the earth and this area is now a park. It would be goodness if there were a series of photos starting with the day of the earthquake and then yearly photos showing how it has changed.",
          "The views from the park are great and it is a quick and nice excursion if you are in Anchorage. Go to the end of the road and stand at the end of the heavy cargo planes runway and watch huge planes go right over your head while taking nice views of Anchorage skyline.",
          "I was first here honoring victims in 1971 when there were few trees, and upturned earth and debris as far as the eye could see. Lest we forget, children died here in 1964, and their wee, innocent bodies are still entombed in this earth. Respect - Reverence - Remembrance",
          "It is worth the time to see the damage a major earthquake did to the the area. It reminds us of the power of this earth.",
          "This trail is great for a nice, quiet walk. During the summer, one can bike for mikes. The views are awesome and those who enjoy taking off the runway.",
          "The irony is that if nature didn't destroy the train yard and tanking port, then Seward would have ended up with such a nice open view! Yes the RV campground that is there now not so nice to look at, but you wouldn't have been able to walk a lot the beach there if the earthquake",
          "Appreciated the information and the walk but watch out for bicycles. They have the right of way not the pedestrian!",
          "Stopped in here while on a city tour and got to walk through the trails to go see the remnants of the destruction from the 1964 earthquake. It was pretty amazing to see how much was changed by the quake and how the towns have been rebuilt afterwards. I would recommend stopping",
          "We had a little bit of time prior to flying out of Anchorage and decided to see the park to walk since we would be sitting a lot in a few hours. It was a nice day, the trails are paved and it explains about one of the largest earthquakes of North America which occurred in 1964.",
          "This park was recommended to us by more than one person saying it offered a good view of downtown Anchorage across Cook\u2019s Inlet while providing the best opportunity to possibly see moose up close and personal. Sadly, we didn\u2019t see any in the eavily wooded area. Good walking",
          "Our last day in Anchorage brought us here to walk the trail. Half way into the hike we spotted 2 moose out by the water. As we got closer on trail they left the water and walked right in front of us so that was really cool!!!!! It was a nice hike with a good view of the city.",
          "Earthquake Park mixes two of my favorite things - history and walking. I heard about this park during a tour and decided to check it out myself. The park allows for self-guided touring with history placards along the way, and is also intertwined with Tony Knowles Coastal Trail.",
          "I parked at the easternmost lot off of the main road (Northern Lights Blvd, I think). That is where the storyboards are which briefly explain the impact of the 1964 quake on the area. I walked about 2 miles west to Point Woronzof, then back to my starting point and kept on",
          "This forest is beautiful with many interpretive boards to explain what happened in the huge 1964 9.2 earthquake. It is also very tranquil and a good place for a walk.",
          "We arrive September 16 and be part of September 29 and in all that time we never saw Dinali because of the clouds. Walking to the viewpoint I saw at least half to 3/4 of it above the cloud line on September 27 it was good to see something because of all the rainy weather here.",
          "This gives a good overview of what went on during the 1964 earthquake, the second highest quake in recorded history.",
          "We saw a video about this before we visited. Might not be that interesting without that context, but it's really quite a story. We hear a lot about people who lose their homes from natural disaster but these people lost their homes and their land.",
          "We went there on the trolley tour. Very interesting and amazing site to see. The ride there was very informative and interesting.",
          "We took a nice walk in the park near sunset. There weren't many people about, but the weather was gorgeous. Because of high ratings, we were all thinking there would be more information or a trail that led you to vistas that illustrated the effects of the 1964 quake. Alas,",
          "Hired a bike for 3 hours and followed the coastal route from town to the outer airfield. On this easy bike ride was keen to see earthquake park as read about it on trip advisor. At first stopped in this park not sure if it was the park, yes it was but a lot smaller than I",
          "This is a beautiful park with a variety of trail choices depending on your time, interest and ability. Walkers, joggers and bikers share the same path. I expected more information/photos/stories about the earthquake - A little more of a museum feel. You can find some information",
          "We visited Earthquake Park as part of a city tour and glad that we were able to stop for a while. The park is a visual reminder of the force of an earthquake in that you can see and walk through the area devastated by the 1964 earthquake.",
          "I expected to see a few remnants of earthquake damage and placards explaining what happened. There were plenty of placards, but no visible damage from a quake that was more than 50 years ago. It was really just a pleasant walk in the woods with placards in a few places",
          "5 miles from downtown Anchorage on the coastal trail (wish city put some milestones or the distance markers). You have to look to your right while walking away from downtown.A small sign is that all that gives you the clue where you are. 1964 earthquake have reshaped the ground",
          "Fascinating to see. Worth a quick stop, which we did on both the trolley and by biking around, where we saw some more details of the park. It was impressive really seeing the damage caused by the quake of 1969.",
          "What I saw of this park was very beautiful. It had lots of trees. I'd take a look at it. This is where the big earthquake in 1964 took place.",
          "I'm a local and I always feel bad about seeing a trolley full of tourists going over there to take a picture of a giant gray concrete block in the middle of a tiny park. It's a rip off but I'm surprised to see so many positive reviews, I guess I'm being pessimistic. I suggust",
          "As soon as we got there, we were ushered back by another tourist... there immediately on the pathway by the main car park, was a mum moose with young twins... obviously very beautiful but equally very dangerous... we held back and observed them for over an hour in and out of the",
          "A small Exhibit at a park tells the story of the 1964 great earthquake that hit Anchorage and the surrounding areas and the Tsunami that followed. Nice place to hike.",
          "We took the 1 hour trolley bus tour of Anchorage (which was excellent BTW) and came back to Earthquake Park to take a short hike. It us a peaceful bucolic location in the heart of Anchorage that was the site of the largest loss of life for Anchorage in the Good Friday Quake of",
          "I enjoyed walking on the paved trails while my daughters loved the dirt trails off them. This was our first encounter with a magpie, we don\u2019t have them in Virginia Beach. I guess they are common here like robins are at home.",
          "We were walking on the coastal bike trail so stopped by earthquake park enroute. It was simple - a few sign boards and limited view of water. I would not make a special trip here but if you are passing by stop for a moment.",
          "Nothing much to see. Don\u2019t waste your time. The park is nice for local people, but very little shows about the earthquake.",
          "One needs to get more information about the earthquake in order to realize/understand the magnitude of the damage caused in '64. Personally expected more at the site but at least there were a few information boards.",
          "Nice park near the airport with signage describing the earthquake, and with partially obstructed view of the bay. It is a short walk from parking to the interpretive displays. Bring your insect repellant!",
          "Great park to see and do some walking without being in the wilderness. Lovely park for both tourists and locals",
          "Use some imagination or visit an earthquake exhibition before visiting eart quake park. There's walking tracks and beautiful trees, but the earthquake has long gone and not much evidence left.",
          "This isn't worth a visit. There are a few boards with interesting information on the earthquake, but not particularly imaginative in presentation. Frankly, one could have gleaned much of the information from the internet -- the park doesn't add much.",
          "Nice quick stop, There is a short interpretive trail with illustraions. At one time apparently you could see the physical effects on the landscape of the 9.0 magnitude earthquake from the early 1960's. However, the trees have grown back and recovered, so mostly you have to rely",
          "We almost didn\u2019t stop here because we didn\u2019t think there would be much to see. We couldn\u2019t have been more wrong! It\u2019s a short, level, paved path to the actual park from the parking lot where there are 4-5 signs telling the story of the earthquake with beautiful water views.",
          "We stopped at the park during our tandem bike ride of the Coastal Trail. Was glad to learn the history and see what happened with the big earthquake.",
          "We enjoyed a picnic dinner of sloppy joe here. The weather was poor so we did not see beluga whales or much of any view. There are many biking and hiking trails around. Parking is extremely limited and frustrating.",
          "Take a short walk on an asphalt trail to a display about the 9.2 earthquake that took out lots of Anchorage ocean front land. The display explains what happened and how far the tsunami went and it's devastation in Alaska and the Pacific coast. There are paved trails for walking",
          "See the results of the 1964 earthquake firsthand. Great access by bike. Nice short hiking trails and great views. Enjoyed this quick, fun stop. Can be done in as short as 15 minutes. Recommend 60-90 minutes.",
          "Earthquake park shows how the 1964 earthquake changed the Anchorage area. This was a 9.2 earthquake that caused massive damage.,",
          "We stopped by Earthquake Park on a recent visit to Anchorage. They were doing some maintenance so a few of the trails were off limit but the views are amazing.",
          "I thought this was worth the time to visit and wish we had had a little more time to get off the bus to visit. It was interesting to see the damage the earthquake had done to the land and imagine how it affected Anchorage.",
          "Nice place for a family walk-- paved easy trails. The park commemorates the devastating earthquake of 1964-- one of the Earths largest ever recorded, and a major disaster for the city. Its on the site of a huge scarp failure, but the site is largely covered by vegetation that",
          "I thought I heard there was in interpretive site here. I expected to see leftover damage from the earthquake. Like a preserved sidewalk or something. It is basically this statue. There is a good view of downtown from here if you hike down.",
          "A deep forest overlooking the waters of Anchorage. Clear trails with information on the 1964 Anchorage Earthquake. Not too crowded and not far from downtown. However, be prepared with mosquito repellant in the summer!",
          "It was interesting to see where the land fell into the sea after the 1964 earthquake. Lots of mosquitoes and do not go walking around without bug spray. The park is worth maybe 15 or 20 minutes of your time.",
          "We just had a quick stop here on our Trolley tour. However, it was fascinating to see the impact of the great earthquake on this city - both here and at other locations. Our Trolley driver (Donna McCarrey) had a wealth of information and our Holland America bus driver was also",
          "Beautiful forested area but with all there trees we could not see the change in elevation from the earthquake.",
          "Rumble, rumble, crash, boom bah! Incredible site that commentates the 1964 earthquake. Great place to walk and wander. Watch out for the moose!",
          "We loved walking here and riding our fat-tire bikes! It's a beautiful trail that leads to other trails!",
          "We had not been here since 1991 so the place had really changed. Very beautiful and scenic. Very tourist friendly.",
          "Park was well marked with informative signs, but the views of the bay were lacking. It was fun to wander off trail and get a closeup view of the plants in the area.",
          "We appreciated this park, and would recommend it to other visitors. Demonstrates the extent of the damage generated by 1964 earthquake.",
          "This has very cool history of the 1964 earthquake but is July the mosquitoes can be monstrous! It is along the Costal Trailway.",
          "Although this was interesting, it was not earthshaking. Remember bug spray to walk through the park, they were eager to bite and everywhere.",
          "This park depicts what happened during a very strong earthquake about fifty (50) years ago. There are signs throughout the park, and the parking lot is sufficient and free. Further west of the park, you are afforded some great views of the Anchorage skyline. The coastal track is",
          "We enjoyed getting to know the history behind this awful event -- especially since we were going to Valdez and Seward later on our trip.",
          "Not worth a separate trip. Good for a stop on the bikes. Nice little history and pictures of the destruction of the earthquake.",
          "There's nothing spectacular about this park like so much of the scenery in Alaska but it is an interesting area to view where the land fell off into the sea during the 1964 earthquake. There is a good parking lot, trails and interpretive signs telling the story. You can see",
          "Where else can you see the meeting place of two plates and see how the topography of the land changes after an earthquake? I am sure there are other places, but this was really cool. Beware of mosquitoes! There are so many, so be prepared to fend them off somehow or get bit!",
          "Would love to come back and spend time exploring the park. So interesting and so much history. Our tour guide gave so many details about the earthquake. Unfortnuatly we did not get to get off the bus-just a brief stop.",
          "This park gives you a sense of the devastation caused by the Good Friday earthquake in 1964. The topography changes rather dramatically as you get to the park. After visiting the park, you get a sense of the destruction brought by the earthquake and how much rebuilding took",
          "Interesting displays and nice walking trails. No bathrooms in the vicinity!! If you are not walking the trails this park will take only 30 minutes of your time.",
          "Not much of a park. Rather just a stop along the coastal trail near the airport. Will say that the parking area has one of the best views of downtown Anchorages skyline. Sunset views are great.",
          "We were familiar with the big earthquake of 1964, but this park did a great job of showing how drastic the destruction was. Right on the trail, it was the perfect place to take a break.",
          "We stopped here very briefly while on the City trolley ride. Our guide did tell us what exactly happened on that 1964 Good Friday earthquake. I would have loved to have explored this region more. If you have a car while in Anchorage, do go here..",
          "We briefly stopped here, but there are plenty of paths to walk/run along if you wish a longer stay. Pretty scenery, and good informational signs.",
          "This site is a good place to stop if you want to read about the Good Friday earthquake of 1964. It free and a small walk to get to the information signs but has lots of trails if you want a longer walk",
          "Earthquake Park commemorates and interprets the devastating March 27th, 1964, 9.2 magnitude, Good Friday Quake, which lasted over 4 minutes and is one of the most powerful earthquakes to ever to hit North America. Located just north of the airport, we stopped here for a short",
          "Lots of interpretive signs that tell the story of this site - an entire \"village\" was destroyed during the 1964 earthquake. Easy to navigate - part of the Coastal Trail.",
          "We enjoyed this park very much, lots of great walking trails and the history of the earthquake was very interesting",
          "We went on a clear day in hopes of a good view of Denali and the surrounding peaks. The paved paths were nice and the few areas with informational signage were good, but not great. We walked through the main memorial area and down to the overlook and did find the path to be",
          "park is the location of some homes that were destroyed in the famous Alaska earthquake. you can see where the ground where the homes were located dropped 25 feet from their original location. if you deiced to walk in the park, there are \"trails\" that are nothing but little paths",
          "We stopped here on the trolley tour and our guide gave us a very comprehensive overview of the earthquake and subsequent history. Very interesting and educational.",
          "great history lesson, well maintained, enjoyed the view, took a break from biking whole trail, good resting place!",
          "We stopped here one afternoon in March and had no trouble finding a parking spot. Great views of downtown Anchorage, mountains and water. The area seemed a little small but we didn't have a lot of time to explore. Very easy to find, not too far from town.",
          "Earthquake park is special - absolutely stunning views and some truly unique history. But it\u2019s also very popular with locals and tourists alike, not to mention the millions of mosquitoes.",
          "Didn't have a chance to walk the trails as it was pretty cold, but the scenery from that area was excellent. There are some signboards etc about the area but we went with a tour so the information was provided by the guide.",
          "Had no problem parking but as soon as we got out we were attacked by mosquitoes. We kept walking & slapping them which made it uncomfortable to read any of the signage and learn the history of the the earthquake. Lots of bikers but didn't explore much as we were getting eaten",
          "This is a step back in history to the 1964 earthquake that took place on Good Friday. The land was completley change. In some areas dropping 30 + feet. The soil became liquid faction in the quake , homes were swallowed and dropped off into the coastline. The park is loaded",
          "Multiple trails some leading to the Cook inlet. Interesting information about the great earthquake on signs all around the park, Great place to bring family",
          "Had no idea of this terrible event before I went to Anchorage. The view of earth\u2019s power revealed on this nice quick walk was absolutely staggering. An easy 30 minute must do in Anchorage.",
          "We had just been to the earthquake museum with our tour guide from Alaska's Finest Tours. We were able to walk though it. A must see.",
          "The best way to reach it is on the non-motorized trail along Cook Inlet a few miles from downtown. The interpretive signs document the devastating Good Friday earthquake causing the entire shoreline to drop drastically.",
          "If my own personal experience is of any value, this is a great example of an attraction that visitors visit and local people don't. I have been living (for parts of the year) here in Anchorage for over two decades dating back to 1994. This was my first ever visit to Earthquake",
          "Stop by if you are close but don\u2019t make a special effort to see it. Tiny loop with interesting billboards.",
          "I have been coming here since the 1980's. Back then there was still lots of evidence of the destruction from the 1964 earthquake. Mother nature has taken over and not so dramatic anymore. the bike trail is great but you could start on it almost anywhere and get the same",
          "I found this trail connected to the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail. It is suitable for walking, or hardcore mountain biking. A regular bike will NOT work on this trail, as the earthquake radically disturbed the earth, and it is VERY uneven. VERY back-to-nature here.",
          "This park is along the Anchorage Coastal Trail, so if you ride bikes, it is worth taking a break there, and reading the plaques about the earthquake on Good Friday in 1964.",
          "This park was a virtual classroom studying the earthquake of 1964 when Alaska experienced the worst quake in its history. The city established a park at the site, noting the historical facts with pictures and plaques on the site. A great spot to learn about this natural disaster",
          "Nice side trip with many trails and informative signs. You could make it into a short or a long visit.",
          "The walk path was easy and had amazing views. Do take the time to enjoy the natural side of Anchorage.",
          "wow, the history of this is mind boggling! Great little hike too. I got lots of pictures, it's crazy to think an earthquake did this!",
          "Informative signs about earthquake of 1964. Great trails. A lot of bike and foot traffic on the nice day. Other reviews referenced bugs. I can see how they could be really bad there. Not many on Labor Day but it is so late in the season and was about 55 degrees for a high that",
          "Hard to believe this all happen. Can read all about it as you walk to the coast. Need to trim a few shrubs and trees so you can see the water.",
          "Really enjoyed this unique park with many panels that explain the extent of the damage. As well you'll learn about flora and fauna of the region.",
          "As a history buff and geology enthusiast I enjoyed very much the easy walk here The gig saw earth patterns seen here are very impressive The costal views are also very nice Many locals enjoy jogging and cycling here This should be the no1 outdoor activity of anchorage",
          "This will give you an idea what took place during the earthquake in 1984. It is a nice easy walk for the family.",
          "We saw this as part of our Trolley Tour and were amazed at the results of the big earthquake there. Definitely worth seeing.",
          "Interesting to read the history and it's a community park... Nice and all - along the coastal trail, but not a destination.",
          "We did not have a lot of time to look around but the educational signage was very informative. When you see how large of an area just disappeared it is amazing what the earth can do.",
          "This park shows an area effected by the 1969 Alaskan great earthquake. The park has nice walking trails and informative presentation boards giving the history and effects of this earthquake.",
          "Only had a few minutes to view the damage and the area from the trolley tour of Anchorage. Lots of facts, but this is not a hop on/hop off trolley tour.",
          "The earthquake striking this area in 1964 had profound effects that are still noticed today. This walk offer a little more information on that event.",
          "This park is right on the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail, and it is worth stopping at. Through markers, signs, and even sculpture, it gives a person an idea of how devastating the 1964 earthquake that hit Anchorage, Seward and Valdez was. I was just a kid at the time so I don't",
          "Earthquake Park is the perfect place for a walk or bike ride. This park is on the Knik Arm and the views are just spectacular!",
          "Located on an inlet, Earthquake Park is both beautiful and a sobering reminder of the damage done in 1964 when a 9.2 earthquake hit Anchorage.",
          "We were here in late June. It's on the way to Point Woronzof Overlook (definitely worth a visit), so we decided to stop and experience a thickly wooded area of Anchorage (Kincaid Park is another option), in the hopes of seeing some moose. Instead all we saw were mosquitoes!",
          "This is an interesting place from a historical standpoint, but otherwise not much here besides a pleasant walk in the woods. At one time the land was clear of trees and you could see how the land was heaved by the earthquake. However, now with all the growth, the devastation",
          "You can take a long hike if you want or just a short overview. Definitely could be buggy. We were there on an overcast cooler day and still had mosquitoes.",
          "Had been told about this park from a friend. We found it to be very informative about the events of that day. It was a rainy day so we only walked a short distance. The mosquitoes were really bad so we did not stay long. Did not see a moose but did learn a little history.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed this park..it connects with the Coastal Trail so plenty of water views. I even met a young male moose along the way.",
          "Went here to learn more about the 64 earthquake and was quite pleased. A simple and eloquent description of the power of nature. To stand on the spot where the land fell into the sea. Btw watch out for the skeeters. Nice bike trail in the area.",
          "Walked to this park to look for moose. Didn't see any moose, but we got mobbed by lots of mosquitoes! We didn't stay long there because we were being eaten by mosquitoes.",
          "Just before we went to the airport, ten minutes away, we decided to stop here. We walked for about three mminutes and were met by a lot of mosquitoes. Since we had been cruising and land touring for 12 days and had not met up much with mosquitoes, we decided that our last hour",
          "Although a half century has dulled the rawness of this park - set in what was once one of Anchorage's finest the neighborhoods - it still remains a calm oasis in the Anchorage bustle that will always remind the visitor that everything man creates can be undone instantaneously by",
          "There wasn't much to see or experience except for the signage that gives some of the history of the earthquake. It was interesting to see and an opportunity to get out and stretch your legs.",
          "I understand that it has been over 50 years but I expected more. The static display were good but limited. The art was interesting in the wooded area. You really had to look closely to see the impact of the earthquake.:",
          "We didn't plan on stopping here, but the name was intriguing. There's a reasonable parking lot at the entrance to the park - several trails make their way through here (including the Tony Knowles trail.) There's a monument to the disaster of the earthquake with a number of",
          "Nice stop at the earthquake park to see more about the large earth quake that hit in 1964. One of two major natural disasters to hit Alaska within first ten years of becoming the 49th State. It was a nice stop, bit a little buggy-so put on the mosquito spray, but did not take",
          "This easily accessible park gives an idea of what happened in 1964 when the earthquake hit on Good Friday. Looking over the edge down to the wounded and irregular earth below is an eerie site knowing that remains of homes are buried there. There is also a good view of Turnagain",
          "The story behind Earthquake Park is interesting (I won't spoil it here), and the view of downtown Anchorage is incredible. It is hike-able from downtown Anchorage, A local friend who shoots moose pictures for a local real estate calendar says its a reliable place for urban moose",
          "A beautiful park that hides a sad story so worth the time to go and read about what happened during the 1964 earthquake. just watch out for the mosquitos if visiting during summer",
          "Interesting exhibit about the 1964 Earthquake. Beautiful walking area. From the park, it is a bit difficult to appreciate the full impact of the earthquake, as the trees and vegetation were in full bloom when we visited. Also...don't forget your mosquito repellent if visiting",
          "It was neat to see the undulations caused by the quake, but didn't see any appeal beyond that. Maybe I missed something?",
          "Great to visit if in Anchorage. Walking trail and informational posters to read of the amazing changes and results of the devastating earthquake that changed so much of Alaska's coastal cities, Enjoyable, peaceful and great views.",
          "The story is frightening. To think a whole section of town could be swallowed up in 5 minutes is unbelievable. Can still see the remaining trench. Lucky so few lives were lost. Park is a nice tribute.",
          "We always joke about California breaking off into the sea at the next big earth quake, well here it really happened! In 1964 a chunk of Anchorage slid in the icy waters of the Cook inlet. This park has several placards showing the seismic history of Alaska and this event in",
          "If it weren't for an incredible invasion by insects (the worst we experienced in 2 weeks in Alaska and Canada), we would have given this site a higher rating. It was still an interesting place for a brief visit.",
          "This would have been nice for a sunny day here...not so much for a cold rainy day. Lots of history and very interesting.",
          "Interesting facts, beautiful walking and biking trails. Wear mosquito spray, you will get eaten alive if not!",
          "Great coastal views of the anchorage area. If you have a bicycle or are into hiking then you may want to consider the park (and no, the chances of running into a bear is not very high). You can also pack a lunch and wander along the trail. Depending on the season, you may want",
          "Great views of the water, however the mosquito population outnumbers humans by about a million to one. We managed to stay about 5 minutes and left.",
          "We enjoyed making a quick stop at this park on our way along the Coastal trail. It was cool to see the the cliff and land that dropped off because of the earthquake. There were a ton of mosquitos and not a lot of information, so I would not recommend making a visit just for",
          "We went after a rain, so there were a TON of mosquitos!!! the park is very pretty though, very woodsy. It is shared as a bike path, so I think you can rent bikes somewhere nearby. I also ran threw part of this for the Mayor's half marathon. I was a little disappointed at the",
          "The short walk to the water offers a great view of the Anchorage Skyline. It was a little confusing at first for which direction to go...better directional signs would have been nice. We went the wrong way at one point and found ourselves back at the beginning. The park is a",
          "A wonderful place to get an idea of what the 1964 earthquake really did to this area. Beautiful area, good informative signage, easy walk. Great way to spend an hour or so and relax.",
          "We enjoyed learning about the earthquake in addition to a nice stroll on the well paved paths. However, there were a ton on mosquitos, so we turned around earlier than we would have liked.",
          "We stopped here along the Tony Knowles Coastal trail. It's interesting to read all about the 1964 earthquake. It's a nice place to walk around and learn.",
          "Earthquake Park is easy to get to and well worth it. Free parking and paved trails. Great views of downtown Anchorage right from the trails. Good place to run or bring children. We saw a guy riding a unicycle on the trail. Many informative signs about the earthquake. Picnic",
          "Looking for someplace to get a bit of exercise while on vacation, we decided to head to Earthquake Park. The park is free, have plenty of walking and even provides signs with the history of area and the 1964 earthquake. It overlooks Cooks Inlet.",
          "Take about an hour to walk around the park and read the information boards, or if you have a bicycle, you can ride the Coastal Track. Very pretty view. Incredible to imagine how much land disappeared in the 1964 earthquake! Be sure to wear insect repellent in the summer, swarms",
          "This is a free and fascinating place - very close to the airport, where several people died because of a massive (9+) 1964 earthquake. Lots of trails to explore. You can bike, taxi or drive here. It is not walking distance from downtown.",
          "We stopped here because I had read that the park offered good sunset views of Denali. I don't know if we were in the wrong spot, or if it was just bad information, but the foliage was too thick to get a good view from anywhere. However, we were pretty awed as we read about the",
          "Earthquake Park was an eye opener for us about how much damage occurred. The earth drop-off right there is real remarkable.",
          "Great views of the mountains, just a relaxing touristy place to see. Lots of people walking their dogs along the paths. I did see some daring people go down along the water. The walk going down to the water is steep, would be afraid of the walk back.",
          "The history is sobering. The views amazing. Going through the slide area gives you a real feel of how emotional the earthquake was.",
          "The impact of this earthquake reaches outside of Anchorage. It is important to visit this site first to get the history and understand the significance of the point in time for the state. Easy push for strollers. Wheelchair accessible a good portion of the trail.",
          "I had last visited here 30 years ago. The trees have grown up, so it's a bit harder to see the big upheavals of soil, but they are still there. There are easy walking trails through the area and some interesting signage to read. It's hard to imagine the widespread devastation",
          "We met friends here to walk the coastal trail and loved the views! The paths are paved and the scenery is beautiful. We visited just as the snow was melting so I can't wait to go back in the summer when it's green and the water is flowing.",
          "My wife and I enjoying running in Earthquake Park in Anchorage. This Park connects to the Tony Knolls Coastal Trail. Plenty of wildlife abounds in this Park. Good cross-country skiing in the Winter too.",
          "Anchorage's Earthquake Park is located near the airport and adjacent to Cook's Inlet. It includes interpretive displays about the earthquake that hit the city in 1964. At the site of the park,an entire neighborhood slid into the ocean. The park also provides a good viewing area",
          "Need a place to walk, let the children run and still provide an educational opportunity? This is it! This gem of a park is a must see! You will leave amazed!",
          "One of the main attractions of this park is that it shows clear evidence the major earthquake that occurred in 1964. There is a literal dropoff of land in which a forest is growing at different level than the rest of the forest. Very weird indeed.",
          "This is a wonderful park - you can walk or bike pretty far and see beautiful views and wildlife (or stay close and see beautiful views and wildlife)!",
          "This \"park\" was created during the 1964 Earthquake. An event that changed Anchorage (and Alaska) forever. The landscape is all natural - Mother nature did her best to kick out the humans...she nearly succeeded.",

          "Most of the trees have grown up, but it is still possible to walk down the trail and see some of the sloughed off land from the 1964 earthquake. The park is adjacent to the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail which hooks up to downtown Anchorage and Kincaid Park. There are panels",

          "I loved the descriptions written on the paths that are in Earthquake Park. Thank you for explaining the happening that happened.",
          "We went here to check out the park and to eat lunch. We walked down a paved path to an open area along the waterfront. They have a few tables so eating food is pretty easy. I believe the area is connected to other parts of the city via a trail system. They had some nice",

          "What a great exhibit!!! I loved the history, the science and the information. Such an important piece of culture.",
          "It's hard to believe this park is down the st. from almost anywhere in Anchorage. The trails are paved & easy to ride or walk on. If your up to it you can walk down to the beach. We ended up gng through the frisbee golf course. Fortunately our detour led us to a moose and a",

          "I don't know what we were expecting to see......maybe a huge hole in the ground..... We walked the trail and looked at the water. It's nice but I wouldn't go out of my way. The better part for the kids was seeing the planes take off at the airport runway across the street.",
          "Although not a park in the accepted sense of the word, it is very interesting. Shows the waves made by the landslide after the earthquake 1964 (one of the biggest ever recorded). There are information signage around the walkways explaining what went on. An easy short walk around",

          "We had heard about this park from our motel person and had to visit it. Quite a story. This location was once home to a lot of people in 1964 and then a 9.2 earthquake struck, (this was on Good Friday) and this community slid right down into The Cook Inlet. And the pictures of",

          "A a child, I remember the 1964 earthquake, but never realized the impact until I visited this park. Yes, you can read about it in wiki but until you see the lasting damage you can't fully appreciate it. The interpretive S teach you about the quake itself and the subsequent",
          "The Tony Knowles Coastal Trail is a wonderful treasure. Earthquake Park is one part of the Trail. People were walking and bicycling the day we were there. Earthquake Park was formed by a landslide when the 1964 Earthquake changed the area. Bootlegger Cove Clay is under the top",
          "Main reason to see this is because of its historical value. The site is the location of 75 homes destroyed by the 1964 9.2 Richter Scale earthquake. They do have a few interpretative signs. Otherwise, not much there.",
          "A nice park that took us by surprise as it is reasonably big and would take a long walk or ride to experience it. Unfortunately it was raining and we could not experience this park.",
          "A short walk with lots of information about the 1964 Earthquake. And it is free! Good to visit on your first visit to Alaska.",
          "We actually visited Earthquake Park twice. The first on the trolley tour, where we heard about what we could from the trolley, but we couldn't look around on our own. The second time we drove here on our own. There were informative displays to learn about the tragic and",
          "I was disappointed in visiting Earthquake Park after nearly 40 years. While the information signs were certainly well explained, the view was severely restricted by the underbrush that had been allowed to grow. Accordingly, you could hardly see Knik Inlet. You could NOT see",
          "After walking the coastal trail from Downtown Anchorage, I was expecting much more than a few trails through the woods with a few plaques while avoiding joggers and being on the lookout for moose.",
          "Everyone in the family loved walking along this trail. It's a beautiful way to experience Alaska. I'd recommend it for anyone!",
          "Seeing the dramatic effects of an earthquake on our planet is fascinating; enjoying the fruits of creative humans after the fact is a brilliant bonus.",
          "We were amazed at the massive change in the terrain that occurred after the 1964, 9.5-earthquake. Our trolley stopped at this park and our driver explained that the terrain that was approximately 17 - 30 feets below us, used to be level with the area on which the trolley was",
          "This is such an awesome historical place to visit and great for learning more about the Earthquake of 1964 that struck Alaska. It is also good for hiking and bicycling .",
          "We visited Earthquake Park while hiking the Tony Knowles trail. The park area was informative and the back trail was beautiful.",
          "It is amazing how much the land dropped and you can actually see waves in terrain as a result of their massive earth quake.",
          "This park has a huge car park and is located about a three minute walk from there. It is quite small but has loads of information on boards about the 1964 earthquake. There are plenty seats If you want to sit but smothering yourself in insect repellant is a must as it is",
          "There is a parking area here and short paved trail that leads to a concrete plaza on the shore of Cook Inlet where there are educational displays about the devastating earthquake that occurred in 1964. A separate, unpaved interpretative trail leads through the area where the",
          "You can learn everything about the effect of the 1964 Earthquake from the web without experiencing the hungry mosquitoes. If you must venture here, suggest covering yourself from head to toe with clothes. If you do get bitten, rub hand sanitizer on the bitten area to prevent",
          "This would be fine if you just wanted to walk or bike, but there is really nothing to see except a few sign boards telling about the earthquake. Maybe we missed something, but it's pretty much a maze of paved trails - watch out for speeding bicyclists.",
          "We took a nice bike ride along the Inlet & stopped at Earthquake Park. It's been a few years, so the information to remind us of the destruction during the earthquake was helpful. There is a paved pathway for walkers, joggers, & bikers that is worth it!",
          "Never having lived through a major earthquake, actually seeing the degree to which this great earthquake changed the topography of this entire area has left me with a lasting impression of the awesome power of nature on our planet.",
          "This park is in Anchorage right on the Tony Knowles Coastal Bike path. You can also drive right up to it near the Anchorage airport. A very pleasand place right on the coast with a few reminders of how devastating the 1964 Earthquake was to the area.",
          "We enjoy reading all of the signs that described the events of this earthquake. It was very interesting a well marked. Also, it was free!",
          "This park offers a great history lesson. It's amazing how the quake created so many drops in the terrain. In late spring and summer, you'll need to be prepared for some serious, large mosquitos! During my brief time there, I saw many visitors and what looked like a bike tour",
          "One does not visit AK/Anchorage without hearing a lot about the 1964 Earthquake. This park allows a visitor to visually understand the magnitude effect this quake had on Anchorage. It is one of the stops on the Anchorage History Tour Trolley. Our driver gave wonderful",
          "This park is a nice place to walkaline and learn. There are signs in the park that explain why the park looks the way it does today.",
          "Come here if you have a decent layover and want to get out in nature. Earthquake Park has great trails and educational plaques on the history of the 64 earthquake. In addition, you will see some great views of downtown anchorage from across the inlet. Only downfall is the",
          "We stopped briefly on this trip for a final view on Anchorage. Nice walking trails with occasional moose sightings. A very good opportunity to see what the earthquake did to the land (although more grown over 50yrs later so if you don't read the signs, you won't realize the",
          "You can learn a lot about the Earthquake of 1964 at this site and enjoy a leisurely stroll among the flora and fauna of the area.",
          "We didn't have long here and to be honest our main aim was to see Denali (which was very cool). That said I really enjoyed reading and considering this parks history and changes. On such a gorgeous day this area was busy with people on foot and cycling. Definitely recommend a",
          "Amazed at how much the earth moved during the earthquake, undulating hills. Plenty of parking and walking tracks available. Wish I could have stopped to investigate.",
          "A great trail, next to airport, along sea inlet. Very cool do it yourself bike fixing station. We picked a non rainy time of day to walk trail.",
          "You will pass this place on the Tony Knowles trail. the signs tell the story and the park gives it the sort of feeling what it must have been like. its a good stop on the trail to take it all in.",
          "Earthquake Park is interesting to explore, read the signs about the 1964 Earthquake, and has nice paths to walk around in the forest and nature. The only thing that spoiled our peacefulness on this visit were all the planes flying overhead, noisy and so close.",
          "Like so many of Anchorage's parks, Earthquake Park is an idyllic setting to enjoy the quiet and peacefulness. Such a contrast to the catastrophic events of 1964. There is some good informational signage - not too much to bore you, just enough to spark your interest and make you",
          "A first hand look at the power of nature - the effects of the great earthquake - now a tranquil setting with beautiful views, and a mouse along the side of the road. Great for a hike or bike ride.",
          "This area of Anchorage was one of the most impacted areas by the 1964 earthquake. The panels do a nice job of explaining what took place, but they MUST be read. Without reading the panels, you would be just taking a walk in the park without realizing the major changes that",
          "The park was very cute and relatively clean, but very noisy. The planes are constantly flying (and VERY closely)! They have a \"slide trail\" that meanders up and down through the woods to highlight the effect of the 1964 Good Friday Earthquake. They have some informative signs.",
          "There is little evidence of the earthquake'so impact other than the information boards set along the route. Hardly surprising as the earthquake was in 1964. The walk around the tree lined path is a pleasant walk but wear mosquito protection. Along the inlets and tree covered",
          "This is a pretty park, but I was hoping for a bit more information on the 1964 earthquake in it. But if you want to stroll, nice place.",
          "The 1964 earthquake is difficult to comprehend just standing in a peaceful park. Obviously the trees and bushes have recovered so it was difficult to grasp the drops. It is a lovely setting, but our expectation was for a little bit more information on the event.",
          "It is difficult to see what the earthquake of 1964 did the the earth, the plants have regrown and is now covering up much of the changes. There is much to read and learn about the 1964 quake. Beautiful park lots of visitor made paths. Use bug spray, LOTS of mosquitoes.",
          "Really brings home the power of an earthquake. Seeing the sunken land and how they have preserved it is amazing. Knowing this quake ran right down 4th downtown is really inspiring to the resilience of a people. Take the trolley tour. So much information.",
          "This is a historical park from the 1964 earthquake. You can see the I-beams that are twisted out a shape. It's at the area where the subdivision was engulfed by the earth or slid into the inlet. You can see the upheaval of the earth. There are plaques that chronicle the",
          "It was very interesting to see the results of the huge earthquake in 64 but when we followed the coastal trail, I was disappointed - not enough views of the ocean - rather mundane.",
          "We drove to this point on the Coastal Trail. Walking from the parking lot past an area in the woods that was much lower gave a good idea of how far the land dropped during the quake. The panels present the earthquake story clearly.",
          "We really enjoyed seeing what we could from the car. However, even with mosquito repellant, we couldn't venture too far into the park without being driven back to the car by the mosquitos. They just enveloped us. If we'd been able to visit at another time of day - or possibly",
          "Made the effort to visit the park, but it was not what was expected, just several trails and small information displays.",
          "Nice quiet place to have lunch just watch for being bitten. Plenty of people walking, cycling away from the usual touristy things. Take a bit of History in.",
          "This is an interesting little park. It talks about the Earthquake of 1964, shows pictures and gives details. My husband found this fascinating since he remembers it! It's easy to find and pretty. Great trails for walking or biking. No bugs in May so that's nice. No",
          "Right next to the Tony Bowles Trail. Several large signs presented the history of the 1964 earthquake. Enjoyed it.",
          "Not really the parks fault. But we didnt make it a half a mile before my hubby was bit a ton. We left because the spray was at the hotel.",
          "Aloha we rented a tandem bike and rode through the park, was alot of fun, would suggest if you have to go to the bathroom go before you go there...saw Moose! The historical account of the 1964 earthquake, was Chicken Skin to read about... Mahalo,",
          "During our Trolley trip...we saw this park which was affected by the major earth quake in 1964 on Good Friday..",
          "If you plan on biking or walking the length of the Tony Knowles, Earthquake park is at approximately 2-mile. There is a little paved area with several signs that can inform you about the earthquake of 1964 and it's affects on the nearby terrain. This is not a park to take your",
          "The park itself is nothing too special, but it's absolutely worth a visit to be able to learn about the 1964 Earthquake. The signs are informative and I came away with a much better understanding about this historic and tragic event in Alaskan history.",
          "This is outside and gives you a dramatic vision of how the earthquake changed the geology of the Anchorage area.",
          "This is a GREAT park for riding bikes or walking the trails. There are lots of informational stations that tell you the history of the 1964 Anchorage Earthquake there. They made this park so that you can see the drastic result of the quake and how it split the earth so",
          "I have no recollection of the massive earthquake that hit Alaska and the tsunami that followed it but a visit to Earthquake Park got me up to speed on the history of this area, the damage that was done, and gave me an insight into the number of earthquakes or tremors that hot",
          "Beautiful walk through forest and along the inlet. Lots of very interesting educational info on the area, wildlife, and the earthquake! Definitely worth a look!",
          "I love going to earthquake park. i used to roller blade along the bike trail. or just sitting and watching people out having a relaxing walk.",
          "Really interesting. So much information about the 1964 quake. You can see the mudflats and read all about the event and effects. Beautiful views, you can catch the trails from Earthquake park. Extremely interesting and beautiful.",
          "A nice little park with interpretive signs to tell the story of the nature in the park and a monument to those lost in the earthquake of 1964. Worth a quick stop for a history lesson and beautiful scenery!",
          "This is a cool place to visit - nice walking/biking path. Good history about the 1964 Earthquake. The price is right (free).",
          "Trail was icy so we were only able to stop at the parking areas. There were several parking areas each with a different aspect of the park. The area was very well maintained. There were several bikers out. Can only imagine how crowded this area must get in the summer. I",
          "Very interesting, never knew about this. Bring mosquito spray if your going in the summer! Very nice park, with information about the quake at every turn. Also a great place to go for a run, or walk your pet!",
          "Learn about how a huge earthquake in 1964 devastated coastal Alaska including Anchorage. Really fascinating. My only complaint is the signs are a bit worn making some hard to read.",
          "This is park of a nice walking trail with the added benefit of a history lesson as you go. The park is built where several houses slipped into the ocean during the Great Earthquake of 1964. Reading about the event as you walk the place where a great deal of damage occurred and",
          "We only had a few hours in Anchorage on the final leg of our Alaska vacation, and we had already walked around and driven through downtown Anchorage on the earlier part of our trip. So, we decided to take a cab ride to Earthquake Park, as it was listed as a point of interest.",
          "Folage has grown over destruction Drunks, vagrants camping around park create an unsafe, environment. Boring for a visit. There are nice walks in Anchorage. The Earthquake paths are not.",
          "It's a little hard for me to do a review of Earthquake Park, because I lived just down the road from it for so many years. It's not just a park for me; it's a tomb. There are a number of people buried there who were lost when their homes were engulfed in the liquefied mud.",
          "I always came here while on break when working at the airport so it is nice to go here whenever I am back down in Anchorage. There is usually some sort of wildlife to see, like moose, so keep a heads up. Good views of the inlet and Anchorage as well as sleeping lady and the rest",
          "We visited this trail both times that we have been in Anchorage. It is a great walking trail if you only have a short time in Anchorage. It is very near the airport and probably would be a cheap taxi ride if you were staying near the airport. It can be windy on this path so plan",
          "This park is out Northern Lights, toward the airport. From the vantage points provided, with short trail between, you can see the city of Anchorage and the curve of the beach at Cook Inlet. You can also see steel beams bent like noodles from the '64 earthquake. You can also see",
          "Nice trail system, easy to find- multi use- accessible year round. Many stop and go places to enter- great views of city, water and mountains- many restaurants and coffe shops within walking distance Great for a moon lit walk",
          "I loved bringing my daughter to picnic, watch the planes come and go and go for walks. Loved the view and love the Point!",
          "Very easy to get to. By car and bike. The park was very clean and I've learned a lot by visiting it.",
          "Takes at least 6\" of snow to groom them up to cross-country ski trails, but it's nice. Commemorative plaque here from the Great Alaska Earthquake of 1964. They turned a lot of the areas damaged by the earthquake into this park.",
          "Very nice memorial park with such a sad history. Went on the shuttle bus. It was a nice drive through suburbia.",
          "This is an interpretive trail made in Earthquake Park that have signs throughout the park that explain the damage done by the 1964 earthquake. You walk though the less that 2 mile round trip trail and read the signs as you go. It is very interesting to see the affects of the",

          "Good walking tour of part of the area of Anchorage devastated by the Great 64 Earthquake. Great pictures and explanations too.",
          "We had a guide show and tell us about the day of the major earthquake. It is really amazing to see the force that Mother Nature has and what it can change within mere seconds. By leaving this place as is we are given a respect for future design so that we can minimize the",
          "This is a popular place for locals. You can watch the sunset from the comfort of your car, or be adventurous and walk down to the beach. There is free parking, but sometimes the parking lot can be very crowded.",
          "I live in Wellington, New Zealand, right on a couple of fault lines and overdue for our big one. A couple of years ago our Christchurch was all but destroyed, so it is always very sobering when I'm reminded that I'm a tourist in a big earthquake area.....and I think why the hell",
          "My husband had seen something about Earthquake Park, and we had time to kill after we first arrived in Alaska. The weather was cloudy, misty and cool, so it seemed an Ok place to visit for a short look-see. It turned out to be extremely interesting - not necessarily a short",
          "We forget the still existing threat of the shifting Tutonic Plates. Best understood when we look at the past.",
          "The park is small--a pleasant stroll. It is hard to get a feel for the 1964 earthquake now, as trees have grown in, and the maps of the devastation which are posted only help if you were here then, and if you were, you don't need the reminder. Minor vandalism mars some of the",
          "As a history buff and educator, I am drawn to natre's areas of significance. While Earthquake Park may seem simplistic and not off-the-scale like the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, it offers the relatively recent geologic perspective of the aftermath of a severe earthquake, that",
          "The only place in Alaska that I have observed trash on the ground. Nothing special about the area we were in, its just a city park.",
          "There is not much too see besides some signage board explaining the history and effects of the earthquake. Not really worth going unless you have nothing else to do. Some interesting facts and information but nevertheless nothing to see.",
          "Interesting little piece of history, would probably have been fun to hike some of the trails (but it was pouring rain). Lots of information regarding the 1964 earthquake.",
          "Very sort walk to the park on a paved path. It really puts the effects of the 1964 earthquake into perspective. There are many placard signs that tells the story of the earthquake and the destruction it caused in the Anchorage and surrounding areas.",
          "Located on the spot where a huge landslide occured during the big earthquake of 1964. Lots of information on the earthquake. Nice walk, does not take a lot of time. Great view on the Anchorage skyline.",
          "I imagine this was quite powerful when first built but trees and shrubs have grown so high that you cannot get a sense of the tragedy. There is a small monument, a storyboard, and a walking/bicycle trail that winds through the woods. The town should clear an area, build a",
          "This park is right next to the airport so there is really no reason not to go. There is some good information about the effects of the 1964 earthquake on Anchorage. It also connects to the Coastal trail.",
          "This really is just a trail for walking with not much of a view. Mosquitos galore so take but spray!",
          "Visited this while riding the coastal trail. Very interesting information about a significant event in Anchorage, of which I was unaware until now.",
          "Lots of fun hiking around all the trails / biking trails. we took a couple of hours to just wander along the trails",
          "We expected much more from this place. It is a cute park for walking, biking, but not very informative or educational if you are curious about the 1964 earthquake",
          "Great history to this park. Very nicely done trail system with very informative signage and displays along the way. Views of the Inlet are incredible and the peacefulness of the park is very relaxing.",
          "this park was a pleasant stop before we headed to airport. Interpretive signs told a little about 1964 earthquake. The park was fragrant with roses. It could be improved with new signs and many more pictures of the earthquake damage.",
          "We stopped on the way to the airport.... I got some great shots of a Moose & her calf, just grazing and some Canadian geese. The views of downtown skyline were lovely.",
          "This is my childhood haunt. Rolling hills (not wheelchair accessible) are all jumbled together because the 1964 Earthquake juggled the earth as if it were part of a circus clown act. When Mother Nature was finished with her performance, she let the pieces fall as they may.",
          "If you have some time to kill and would like to take a nice stroll, this is an interesting place to visit. But be sure to take some OFF as the bugs are intense during the summer because of the wooded area. It's about a 15min walk from the parking lot to the main area of the",
          "Throughout my trip to Alaska, I have seen the amazing, noble, resiliency of Alaskans in recovering from the destruction of this awful earthquake - from restoring a collapsed building to re-establishing a whole town to the effects on sea life. There are plaques in this park with",

          "After the big earthquake of 1964, this was a site to see . .. it looked like the surface of the moon, with gray mounds/hills winding around this 'back 40' acres. It was scary, sentimental, unique. However, natural growth of greenery has covered it over, and now it looks like",
          "The beauty of this park is seeing the NATURAL changes to the environment as a result of the earthquake. A lot of reviewers are disappointed because they didn't know much about the quake and/or area to appreciate the significance of the park. Do your research before traveling and",
          "Not sure what the fuss is all about. Markers talk about the quake and there is some fine views of the turnaround mud flats. Some small birds and animals and mosquitoes you need a shot gun to stop. The park hosts part of the coastal bike trail and that is worth riding. In my",
          "I should have researched this more before going. I expected some remnants of the destruction from the 64 quake or something that would give me a perspective of how things changed, The first sign explained that this was an interpretive exhibit and that's when I started to worry.",
          "Learn about the 1964 earthquake that hit Alaska. The short trail leads to the cook inlet and offers some nice views of Anchorage and Denali on clear days. Lots of mosquitoes in the area. Visit can take from less than 10 min to much longer if you take your time to read all",
          "Earthquake Park is part of the Costal trail. The park starts at the parking lot and goes along a paved trail till it reaches the Coastal Trail with an overlook. There are lots of information boards that tell you all about the 1964 Earthquake. Stop and read them and contemplate",
          "We hiked here straight from the airport. It was nice but be warned...the largest mosquitoes in the world live in this park. They are like small hummingbirds and will swarm you. From here walk the Tony Knowles Coastal trail.",
          "Very interesting area devastated by the 1964 mega earthquake.. An eye opening experience to see the results. The area is well grown over by trees, now. Watch for local moose.. The trees show evidence of moose horn rubs.. Don't mess with the moose.. They win every fight..",

          "In 2000 I was chased by a moose cow guarding her calf who happened to cross the trail in front of me in Earthquake Park Anchorage Alaska on a mountain bike participating in a bi-athlon; long before the days of GoPro. I wished I had a camera with me. That moose wanted to stomp",

          "Took a cab here from downtown. A little disappointed in how little detail there was about the earthquake that happened in 1964. Learned more about the event and aftermath from the Salmonberry tours. Beyond the memorial, it appears to be a park with walking/biking trails. Didn't",
          "This was a marked attraction on the map, but it looks like it hasn't been refreshed in a long while. The signs are fading and there is graffiti on some of them, its also easy to miss the entrance to the parking area, and not much to see after the 5 min walk to the \"park\" which",

          "After spending most of the day in planes and airports, we wanted to stretch our legs for a while before heading to our B&B for the evening. While this park wasn't overly exciting, it was interesting to learn about the earthquake and the trials were nice enough for walking on.",
          "We stopped here for about 20 minutes to learn about the earthquake. It was well worth the short stop. Guess we got lucky, we did not have a mosquito issue at all.",
          "Not much to see here, basically a local city park. I happened onto a much better earthquake exhibit at the Rasmuson Park museum in downtown Anchorage.",
          "It is heavily promoted, but in actual fact it is a big disappointment. The place is a mosquito haven and the exhibit is basically a side walk with a stone slab as a memorial. We were terribly disappointed in this attraction and don't recommend it.",
          "When we first arrived to Anchorage, the news reported cars being broken into at Earthquake Park, which is accessed by several parking lots. So lock your car, hide your valuables in your trunk and select from several trails to walk on. When we first approached Northern Lights",
          "Glad we went here... We had a great view of McKinley on the day we were there! We didn't get to see it while we were in Denali, so we were happy to have at least seen it while we were in Alaska. The signs are interesting to read and it is amazing to be in a place that had such a",

          "We went to see some remnants of the earthquake, but it was very hard to really see anything. There were too many mosquitoes in the park.",
          "This park is very interesting to see and read about the history and has beautiful views of the area. It is probably better to visit if you take a some time and go for a bike ride through the park instead of walking through it. There are lots and lots of mosquitos! Big ones!",
          "Visited the park and read the history of the 1964 earthquake that changed the landscape of Anchorage. Went for a stroll on one of the paths. Too bad we did not have our bikes as this park would have been fun to explore on two wheels.",

          "There are 2 trails take the one farthest to the left. Very informative. When we reached the dead end of trail we saw water and bits of sunset. We hiked down the very unstable ground soil to get to the inlet. Beautiful views but be careful hiking down. When you get down to",

          "Earthquake park is kinda so-so for anything earthquake related. Really it's just another park with shoreline and trees and trails. The real attractions here are just to the west along Point Worenzof. Parking along the road just off the end of the runway is a great place to see",

          "Very informative and aweinspiring. Nice place to walk or bike and enjoy the summer in ANC. Plus you can stop and read the signs and learn about geopgraphy and history of the Earthquake. Worth the time.",
          "We did a bike ride on the Tony Knowles trail and visited Earthquake park. It was interesting but small. If we had just gone out to see Earthquake park I would have been a bit disappointed, but with the trail it was great.",
          "The trails are nice, there's a cool historical presentation about the earthquake of 1964, and the bluff offers amazing views of downtown Anchorage, the port and the mud flats. Jets pass directly overhead from the nearby airport, which is thrilling for kids. Drive out to the end",

          "First off, this is not a park with a lot of exhibits if you want that go downtown and see the free earthquake exhibition at the alaska museum. Still, it is a beautiful park and there are a lot of remnants of city streets with faded yellow lines out amongst the trees.",

        "wiki": "Kincaid Park is a 1,516.78-acre (6.1382 km2) municipal park in Anchorage, Alaska, located at 9401 W. Raspberry Road.  The park is bounded on the south by Turnagain Arm, on the west by Knik Arm, and on the north by Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport.  Noted for Nordic skiing trails, in snowless months the park is frequented by runners, bikers, hikers, archers, dog-trainers, motocross users, disc golfers, soccer teams, and rollerskiers. Other winter activities include snowshoeing, sledding and biathlon (many trees were cut in the spring of 2006 for the biathlon range). The park was created in 1978 and in 1978 expanded to include the location of a deactivated former Nike missile site. The park continues to evolve with changing demands of local residents.  In 2009, a full 18 \"hole\" disc golf course that meanders through the wooded Mize loop area was completed.  In 2010, several new soccer fields were completed and open for use in the area near the chalet.  In 2012, a single artificial turf soccer field with stadium seating was completed just south of the chalet.  Cook Inlet, Fire Island with its wind turbines, and Mount Susitna are visible from most hilltops in the park.  On a clear day, Denali can also be seen from the park.\nThe park gates are open seven days a week from 10:00am until 10:00pm.  The chalet is open seven days a week from 12:00pm until 8:30pm with holiday and Sunday hours of noon until 5pm.  The chalet has three rooms that can be rented to the public for weddings, birthdays, baby showers and other special events. The Annex and different areas of the park may also be rented by the public.The park is mostly forested, with birch, cottonwood, and spruce.  Wildlife includes moose, lynx, bear, fox, eagles, porcupines, owls, and many others, with moose being the most commonly seen.\nLittle Campbell Lake offers ice-fishing in winter, boating and fishing in the summer.  No camping or fires are allowed anywhere within the park.\nIn the southwest corner of Kincaid Park, by the Jodhpur road entrance, there is a motocross park and beside it a huge sand dune created by the winds that sweep in from Turnagain Arm periodically.The Tony Knowles Coastal Trail connects Kincaid Park to downtown Anchorage and provides excellent biking or skiing. Within the park there are approximately 60 kilometers of cross country ski trails, which are also used by hikers and bikers in the summer, and about 27 kilometers of new single track biking trails.\nKincaid Park and Point Woronzof Park (191.7 acres) offer the best semi-wilderness experiences closest to West and Downtown Anchorage.\n\n\n== References ==",

          "Get your walk on and ride on at this park. I checked it off my Alaska VACAY bucket list. Short 2 hour walk through the park, but it was well worth the hike. You won't need all that much water, as it is covered overhead pretty good. I went on a dry surface day, but can image that",

          "It was a nice sunny August 16th, so we decided to explore a bit of Kincaid Park with hopes of sighting a moose. We parked by the Chalet and walked across a soccer field and then wandered along some trails (which are not well marked and there doesn't seem to be a detailed trail",

          "Kincaid Park is a venue for many activities. We went for an evening walk with the dog down to the beach. Kincaid has many moose wandering around and a few bear sightings have been made recently. It is always a good idea to make a noise while walking through the bush as bears",

          "The park is nice, but we went to get on the coastal trail (this is the southern terminus). We walked for 35 minutes downhill and never got to the \"coastal\" part. Finally we veered off and went down to Kincaid Beach for 10 minutes. It was a real battle going uphill to where we",
          "I visited Kincaid Park with a substantial expectation to see an abundance of wildlife. Unfortunately, I never saw any wildlife whatsoever. Other people nearby advised me that they witnessed moose and bears, but I never saw any of these creatures. There are many trails throughout",
          "Hired FAT BIKES from a very friendly stall at the car park situated at the end of Raspberry Road. Shared trails for walkers and bikers. My dream would be to Nordic Ski these trails in winter, but I am only on a summer holiday - too short. Came across a black bear munching on the",

          "We slept 2 nights in Kincaid Park. It was ideal for our ultimate frisbee tournament. Plenty of parking both near the Chalet and the lower lot. A disc golf course loops around the soccer fields. It looked popular, but we didn't play. A moose was seen daily walking around",
          "This is a huge park that has a lot of trails, but is not a place to go unless you are wanting to hike. I did learn that the site used to be the home of some air defense missles, so that was kind of interesting. If you are out of things to do, then a visit is worthwhile, but",
          "We went on a few trails around the park and found it quite diverse and even saw moose right off one of the walking paths!",

          "My wife and I like to walk or bike the trails through Kincaid Park. It's right inside the city and yet you enter a totally different world. The dense vegetation and silence of the wilderness is right there. There are resident moose and occasional brown or black bears along",
          "We went on a little hike to the beach and it was awesome. A little bit cold because it was the beginning of June, but we can't control nature. Will be returning next summer for the great views and maybe a quiet picnic.",

          "We rode bikes from the starting point up by Westchester Lagoon almost to the end of Kincaid Park. The last few miles is heavily wooded. A passing cyclist told us a bear and cubs had been reported around marker 7.5 at the picnic tables. If we hadn't had bear spray, we probably",
          "Our last day in Anchorage we decided to go to Kincaid Park. There is something for everyone here, we went for a walk on the paved trail and some on the unpaved. We saw many walkers, runners, and bicyclists, along with seeing two different wedding parties. We were just about",

          "Visited this park last month for the first time looking for a non-road path for running or biking. This was a super option. Scenic views, forest views, and well maintained path. I accessed it from the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail extending it for quite a distance. Re-visited",
          "Seen an amazing views of the airplanes coming in. We enjoyed the quiet drive through kincaid park. We did not hike due to my grandfathers mobility.",
          "This was my 2nd stop and first significant walk in Alaska . I had came here expecting to see Moose . I didn't the first visit in the afternoon . I was successful the 2nd time in the morning . I saw a cow and her calf and three other cows . I came back on day three and saw",
          "We went twice trying to see some moose but both time we were not lucky. No moose! Still, it is a pretty park with a lot of trails and wonderful views. A great place to walk and enjoy the outdoor, next door to the airport, so easy to visit just before dropping off your car",
          "I didn't know that the park was an army base in the cold war, you can still find two missile silos inside. The park is huge and there are plenty of things to do but I did notice that not all dog owners train them to be nice but to be defense dogs, the thing is that if you have",
          "After dinner we drove to Kincaid Park. This is a large park with many soccer fields, a disc golf course, a biking trail, and hiking trails. We walked around. There is plenty of parking.On the way out of the park around 8:00 pm, we saw mama moose and her 2 babies munching on the",

          "We went for a late night drive just before the park closed and found a lot of moose. Was one of the highlights of our few days in Anchorage.",
          "This is one of the best places to see moose in Anchorage. Despite being right next to the airport, there is an abundance of wildlife. We were so lucky we didn\u2019t even have to get out of our car to see a moose calf and its mother. We drove into the park a little ways and they were",

          "Kincaid Park is my favorite place to go in town. It's close enough to town, but far enough to get away from everything. It has hiking, disc golf, access to the Coastal Trail and snowshoeing in the winter. The park is teeming with wildlife and has so much to offer.",
          "Hiked for a good three hours around here and also rode a little bit. Found it very hard to know where I was and the lack of trail signs was frustrating. Didn't see any moose but enjoyed the meander...when I could work out where in the park I was!",
          "An afternoon walk through the Kincaid Park is highly recommended. The place is full of exotic flowers and wilderness. Did not see any wild animals though. Do see our photos ( attached) of the flowers. Beats walking down the malls any time.",

          "Took a quick hike from the Chalet to and along the coastal trail, hoping to see a moose and were not disappointed! Encountered a moose & her two young ones casually eating along the trail. Although our trek in the park was very limited, it appears to have lots of great trails.",
          "We stopped here and enjoyed walking the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail here. It was a beautiful clear day, and the terrain is so pretty around the park with all of varieties of berries.",
          "Extensive off road trails are a delight. Not as many views of the Cook Inlet as I had hoped. The trailside moose with velvet antlers was a big surprise and plus.",

          "This park is fantastic. They have a Disc Golf course and a bike trail that loops around to the Coastal trail. I saw 26 moose all along the trail my last journey down it. Great place to be one with nature and hang a hammock. They also have tons of athletic fields for group play",
          "We visited the park on our first day in Anchorage. We got some advise from a woman working at the center to try the Mize Loop trail. She walked me down to the start of the trail since it wasn't easily seen from the parking lot. The trail occasionally has moose near the back",
          "Rented bike from Mario or Reo?? Downtown and took a bus to raspberry road where the driver informed me of the way to the park. I was a bit frightened because there was lots of trees And wildlife . Great spot to take pictures of the ocean and moose. Will try my luck tomorrow on",

          "We spent over a week in Alaska and we hadn't seen a Moose yet (we spent a lot of time on the water, I'm not sure Moose spend time in the salt water). My wife and I did two trips to the park. I walked off of the Coastal Trail thinking that would give me the best chance to see a",
          "We stopped here at the end of the day after climbing Flattop Mountain. The kids wanted to see a moose and the water. While they did find a moose, we never got to the water, mostly because of ignorance of the park layout. There were also moose to be seen along the road on our way",

          "The road to the park has a trail that people living close use so they are not on the road. The park has not enough parking space. Go on a soccer night with a wedding at the top venue and you park on the road. There are hidden lakes with dirt roads that are almost NON passable",
          "So amazingly beautiful just can't put it into words. Can't wrap your brain around the massive mountains and rivers.",
          "This park is too big to chose which trail to do. We really wanted to see animals, especially a moose and we actually saw one driving away from the park after our 3 mile hike. It would have been to speak someone before choosing our hike. Great park though!",
          "A very interesting park with lots of trails giving different views both coastal and forest. Very diversified sporting facilities and dogs welcome.",
          "We visited Kincaid twice. Once on bikes, once to hike. There are so many hiking trails, it was kind of confusing. The girl in the office told me to take a picture of the map on the wall to refer to...a little unusual but then the color coded map was in color instead of a poor",

          "After hoping all week to see a moose, we tried this after reading reviews about moose sightings in the park. Within minutes of driving into the park, 2 moose walked across the road right in front of us! We didn't have time to try the trails, just wandered a bit and left happy",
          "OK, so when we first stepped on this trail and heard the deafening noise of the motor cross park which is right outside the park, I thought the hike would be awful. Also the beginning of the main trail was very trashy........but, get away into the woods and it is amazing how the",

          "Beautiful park! Running through it made the half marathon that much more fun and awesome for getting a chance to experience nature here. The scenery was amazing. We were told that we would definitely see a moose; however, I smelled them, stepped in their poop....but sadly no",

          "It was beautiful day and we had an afternoon before our flight home. We found the park and a lovely walk on some of the numerous trails. In summer there are for trails hikers, bikers and people walking their dogs. In winter there are many ski trails just for skiers.",
          "Beautiful place to get out for a nice walk and to just be outside! Once it starts to get green I'm sure it'll be even more lovely! Excited to go back and check it out in the summer! (: I think a picnic would be fun to do as well!",
          "I've visited Kincaid park multiple times throughout this winter. There are many amazing day hikes all around the park. You can get closer to the water or higher elevations. I would recommend looking ahead to see if there are any events, a few times there were large events that",
          "Kincaid park is worth a visit. Mostly paves trails. Well maintained and gorgeous. Free to see and the views are amazing. We saw a moose right on the trail, but be careful they are wild and should not be approached. Amazing and beautiful.",
          "We enjoyed our afternoon hiking the trails in Kincaid Park, despite being kind of a dreary day! We even saw a moose on one of the trails--very cool! Lots of trails of varying difficulty for every level of hiker.",
          "This park is huge and has tons of trails. Hiking, walking, running, biking (including single-track), and other outdoor activities are all available.",
          "All kinds of outdoor activity, can be very busy on weekends but your feet will move you along to a quieter place. I would like to try the skiing here as well.",
          "It looked like a fabulous park with lots of great places to hike. However, we picked the wrong time of year and could only look wistfully at the trails we had hoped to hike as they were way too icy for our hiking boots.",
          "Needed to get out of the house for breath of fresh air and thought of Kincaid Park. Have not been there for quite some time and it has grown up quite a bit. From where we left, the rain was coming down but we could see the sun over the inlet so our hopes were high. When we",
          "I was taken to Kincaid park on a photography excursion in late November, so i was there for the scenery. But when i got there i was astounded by the abundance of groomed ski trails crossing the road and weaving throughout the woods. As an avid cross-country skier (traditional)",
          "Tucked at the end of a peninsula, Kincaid Park has a magnificent view of the bay and the surrounding mountains. We were there on a clear winter day and the views were gorgeous. Kincaid Chalet is well appointed to handle events as well.",
          "I know this park better than most. I live a few miles from here and roller-blade during the summer and fall. Moose, occasional fox and rarely a bear will be seen on the trails. The park is great for family events or bigger community events. Their is a restroom that is clean.",
          "A great place for sightseeing, hiking, relaxing, and enjoying the beautiful Alaskan weather. A must see!",

          "Huge park, great views, hiking, swimming pool, sports fields and more... and do be aware that there is a large moose population here in the park. They are used to people but males can be dangerous in the rut (mating season) and never get between a cow (female) and her calf.",

          "Wonderful all year round, with lit free XC trails (classic and skate) and wonderful soft easy-on-the-joints running trails the rest of the year, spectacular views, amazing wildlife (watch out for bull moose in Sept/Oct during the rut...they will chase ANYTHING!) LOVE Kincaid",
          "What a gem! Like the Tony Knowles trail, i think everyone who is in Anchorage should visit this park. We drive in and walk around here. Sometimes just to walk around the fields with our dog. Sometimes its the long walk around to Tony Knowles trail by the airport. Enjoy the",
          "I had some time to kill and decided to go wandering. I drove into the park and felt transported back in time. Very lush vegetation and side trails made this place an explorer's paradise.",

          "This is one of the stops for the winter snowmobile trails and in summer, which is when I was there, it was a beautiful spot to chill. The small pond/lake is good for swimming, canoeing, or just to sit along the shores and enjoy a picnic.",
          "I was impressed with this park. It had many cross-country ski trails which are used as hiking trails when there is no snow. There were also trails for mountain bikes. The trails were wide and in good condition. The scenery was nice. The park was clean and well-maintained.",
          "Absolutely breath-taking and definitely worth the trip. If you can get there in the fall, when the leaves are turning it is amazing.",

          "Very large park. Beautiful. Just make sure you know where you are going and where you parked\u2026.we got lost trying to get back to the car! On a positive note\u2026We saw 4 Moose, Be aware though as we were told a biker was recently mauled by a grizzly there.",
          "A large park with lots of winding paths, suitable for walking or bike rides. This is also the place to see moose as they are corralled by the airport fence. The park's proximity to the airport is not a problem. It is a beautiful area and it would be easy to spend a whole day",
          "This was one of the highlights of our trip! We came upon a HUGE bull moose on the side of the trail. Thankfully we were far enough away not to bother him and he was fine with us being on the trail. It was pouring down rain, which was a bummer, but the trails around the park",

          "Lots of hills, this is a great park to hike during non-skiing months. It looks like it will be pretty awesome to ski when there is snow. Lots of people bring their dogs. it is easy to take a variety of trails and have a different experience every time you go. You can apparently",
          "Took a bike ride from Anchorage to Kincaid Park. We were told that is the best place to see moose. During our trip to Alaska, we saw whales, sea lions, dolphins, bald eagles, grizzly bears, and caribou\u2026but no moose. So, off we went on a 10 mile bicycle ride. No moose\u2026moose",

          "This park has lots of trails and takes you down to the ocean. Supposedly there are lots of moose - but the day we were there we didn't run into any. On our way back uphill on the path a biker came by and wondered if we saw the bear - said it crossed the path just behind us -",
          "We went during the day and saw nothing! But we went back near dusk and saw 4 Moose--? Messes? Look for the stopped cars but DO NOT GET OUT, especially if mr moose is nearby",

          "This was our fourth trip to Anchorage and each time we come to Kincaid Park to see moose. This time was the absolutely the most amazing of all! Must say, we only saw a female moose on the first trip to Kincaid this year but on the second drive through, we hit the bonanza---big",
          "Great Park with great trails and an occasional wildlife. We were in the park late in the afternoon on August 17th to walk around for a couple of hours before we headed home from the nearby Ted Stevens Airport. The trails we went on were very easy to traverse and be out in mother",
          "We went to Kincaid specifically for the sand dunes. It was a challenge to find the right place in the park but once there, it was not difficult to find the dunes. If going, use the Jodphur Rd. entrance and it is the one with the motorcross course. The short hike through the",
          "I didnt' see much of the park as it was late in the afternoon - if we'd finished the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail beyond the 8 mile marker we would have got here by bike. Instead we came back via taxi one afternoon to look for moose... and found one! Any park where I can find a",

          "I love this park. Easy drive-through park for those with limited mobility. We went there a few nights at dusk and there was a moose or 2 by the side of the road almost every time. There is a nice trail to the beach, but BRING and WEAR BUG SPRAY - there are mosquitoes and",
          "We had a very pleasant bike ride through the park and beyond. Lovely landscape of trails, forest, and meadows.",

          "For any mountain biking or trail running enthusiasts visiting Anchorage (or XC skiing enthusiasts visiting in the winter), Kincaid should not be missed. In a city of many expansive trail systems, Kincaid is the granddaddy of them all. I grew up in Anchorage, and the 35+ miles",

          "pros: - beautiful place to mountain bike! Cons: - trails were a little wet and slippery after rain - they set up trails for a race on Saturday so some were closed - bummed out that we didn't see any moose! This place is known for wildlife sighting!",
          "More of a wilderness area than a park - great biking and walking trails. Could use some more signage for those of us non-locals. The bicyclists shared the trail well but the sharp curves were a bit frightening for us walkers at times. Really beautiful scenery - could have spent",
          "I spend a ton of time in Kincaid. There is a pretty challenging frisbee golf course with 18 pro and amateur tees with nicely defined cement tees for each. I wish there were more trash cans in the park. There are single track trails as well as lighted loops. The new mountain bike",

          "The chalet is clean and the bathrooms are convenient. If you are roller blading, the hill off the bluff can be pretty hairy and wear out your brake. Their is plenty of room for everybody there. No riff-raff hangs out here, so it is safe and relaxing. Great access to mountain",
          "This park is beautiful and full of trails. The issue is the maps along the path(s) are minimal and not well done. One map will show different maps than others. the paths were very well maintained and we had a great time finding our way back.",

          "My co-worker and frienc joined me on this excursion, mind youin a skirt, lol. We wanted to get to the beach and unbeknownst to us that was a ways away. Up for an adventure we started out on a beautiful trail that twisted & turned for what seemed like forever. Finally we ended up",

          "The coastal trail cannot be beat. You can ride from downtown Anchorage along the coast all the way to Kincaid. I have seen large groups of whales following the beach with the tide. Much more common are the moose encounters. You have to pay attention and use common sense.",

          "If you want to see moose other than going to a zoo, Kincaid Park is a place you want to visit. Go there in early morning or late afternoon. Be careful and keep distance from the moose! They can hurt you as bad as bears or worse per a national park ranger.",

          "Kincaid park was our opportunity to have a close encounter on the Moose kind. We were told that the chance of finding Moose wild in the park was about 90% and we were not disappointed. We were prepared for a 6-7 mile walk and we were lucky enough to see bull Moose at very close",
          "The park is famous for its trail and the flora and fauna. A resting place for seniors and playing place for children. A walk around is worth.",
          "Our B&B proprietor suggested that we visit the park in the evening to see wild moose; she was right. After less than a half hour in the park we happened upon an adolescent and mother moose in a clearing about 100 feet from the road. Great photo opportunity.",

          "We took the Coastal Trail 11 mile bike ride to Kincaid Park and loved what we found. The park is pristine, well-maintained, and user friendly. Was worth the long bike ride for downtown Anchorage. Check out the food vendor at the trail head near the community center.",
          "I did not have enough time to even partially explore this park. I was mainly looking for a vantage point for photos over the water, and so I stuck to the one trail. It was more up and down than someone from the Midwest U.S. is used to, but if I didn't have activity induced",
          "I have ridden trails in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Colorado, and Utah, and Kincaid offered something different and excellent. The trails were tacky and smooth, like Laffy Taffy, and eminently carveable. They are fast with excellent flow and enough hills to make you work. I",

          "We started out to just walk around the lake. Turns out you cannot \"just walk around the lake,\" as we found out. We survived the experience using blind luck, a little woodsmanship and guidance from a local hiker. We did not see any large animals, but did run into a couple fellows",
          "Located southwest of the airport, it is quite wild, even though it is located in the city limits. Saw moose (fairly close) and a brown bear (from a distance). Lots of trails, good maps and trail markers.",

          "Great place to have a small hike/walk around scenic area. Alot of sports events occur here so you get beautiful scenery and wildlife walking around (moose) for just driving there. Plus, I heard there's a few cross country skiing paths through the area when it snows.",
          "The Coastal Trail is a great thing to do, saw huge bull moose just off the trail! We did it on bikes from Copper Whale Inn. However, about 40% of the trail is detoured (Aug 2013) and you spend a lot of time on on a cycle path along a main road which is not at all scenic.",
          "It was a nice little park to ride through and it was near the coastal trail if you wanted to take walks! It was sort of crowded the day we visited because apparently a big group was there for a gathering but it was still nice!",
          "Excellent trails for biking/running, but read the trail maps as it is huge and easy to get lost. Wildlife including bears are in the area, so bring bear spray and BUG spray for the mosquitos.",

          "This place is awesome and our tour guide, Junior was a wealth of information regarding the native Alaskan people and sharing his heritage. We learnt so much.",
          "This is the type of place that you will come to appreciate long after you\u2019ve visited.

          "Easily accessible by car and wheel chair, kid friendly with informative exhibits, presentations and videos. You can buy gifts from local artists. The village itself is well maintained and there are helpful volunteers to answer your questions.",
          "Great place, no reason to take a tour, get the free shuttle from the visitors center. It must be getting to the off season we were there a number of years ago and there were representatives at each of the locations on the grounds around the lake to tell the stories and explain",
          "The live presentations on games, dance, and music were very good. I just wish that the collections were more robust and informative. What they do have is interesting but the collections of artifacts are very limited. Also, it would be very informative if they would add some",
          "Very interesting center focusing on Native American cultures. Be sure to spend time outside walking around and into the various tribe habitats. There are native speakers who explain and answer all questions. Wonderful!!",

          "We spent about three hours learning about Alaska\u2019s natives. What an interesting and very enlightening experience!",

          "Came here to discover more about native culture and was rewarded with dance, music, games and a great display of Inuit housing. Wonderful crafts on show and some for sale. Free shuttle from downtown (the Visitor's Information Centre) is a bonus.",

          "It's kind of funny how people like different things. I had to laugh when I read a review below that said that this was not as good as the Anchorage Museum. And I want to say that we spent a lot more time here than at the Anchorage Museum at Rassmussen (though the Native",

          "What made this a great experience was the fact that local Native Alaskan's were involved in the displays. Where ever we went we met local people who were there to help us understand how the Native Alaskan's thrived and survived by explaining their culture and the way they did",
          "Expensive for what it has to offer. Native songs and dances with narrative of native's life was interesting. Outdoor display is so-so, Indoor display of artifacts was very very limited. If you are pressed on time do bother, go to Anchorage Museum and spend more time there.",
          "Well worth the price. So nice to see young people learning and passing down the traditions of their ancestors. Dance and game demonstrations were a joy to watch. Replica villages accurately reflect native life and traditions. Wheelchair accessible which really helped a member of",

          "I was excited to visit this place, but was disappointed. Too bad too, since it could and should be great. The problem is that the place is staffed by kids who have no interest in talking with the visitors. Out of all the buildings I saw only one had someone who would explain",
          "The two places we were told to see was the Native Heritage Center and the Anchorage Museum. The Museum was good but the Heritage Center was even better. The museum at the Heriatge center is unique. But what was very special was the tour and cultural learning experience of being",
          "I learned so much about the life of the Alaskan first peoples. The replicas of housing and the written descriptions were so informative. The native dancing show was fascinating. Highly recommend!",

          "I was totally impressed with this Center and the people working there. We watched a demonstration of native athletic games performed by a great group of young men. It was informative, entertaining, and thoroughly enjoyable. We also heard about native language and story",

          "We were 3 couples traveling together. We came to Anchorage a bout 1 week before our cruise. This was the perfect start to learning about Alaska. We took a guided tour of the villages to learn how the Eskimos lived. Then we watched the dancers do their native dances. Very well",
          "A must see! Take a few hours to drop by this interesting center. It was fascinating to learn how people lived in various parts of Alaska. You walk into huts that would have been like the real deal. We also bought some great jewelry made out of fossilized walrus bones and met the",

          "While this is a great way to learn and see things especially demonstrations, it is way over priced versus other things to do-only way we saved was that 2 of the 3 guests were residents. It as fun to see-but we would not say to spend the money if you are on a budget.",
          "While the building and display are nice, I do not feel it is worth the price of admission. In Juneau is the state museum and it is only $12 and you could spend hours in there seeing all on display. This facility can be done in less than hour. Plus it is not open year round and",

          "Me and my friend went to this place to see the Alaskan heritage, but unfortunately it was disappointing experience, there was no guides in most of the cottages to explain to us what we see in them and no noticeboard in the cottages to explain the use of the tools and the items",
          "Beautiful museum with an interesting collection. They have replicas of native housing located around the lake and each house has representatives from the tribes explains the lodging and other details. There was a native dance performance while we were there as well as people",
          "I took the trolley from downtown Anchorage to the museum. There are a few artifacts and signs to read inside, but the real gems are the outdoor displays and demonstrations. I recommend a guided tour. The guides tell you about themselves and their tribe before the tour starts.",
          "You absolutely must go here. It is an excellent demonstration of the native groups of Alaska. The student dances and display of events in their Olympics was fantastic! We have been here twice - and spent an entire day - enjoying every minute.",

          "Our guide Dustin was fantastic! He really cares about his Alaskan heritage and is so happy to share his knowledge. The Alaska Native Heritage Center is a great start to your trip as I saw several things along the way and thought oh Dustin told us about that! It is so important",
          "This is an amazing place to learn about the different native Alaskan cultures. We especially enjoyed the athletic demonstrations, truly an impressive display of strength and balance. We also enjoyed the dancers, who told stories with their arm and hand movements. Their feet",

          "I would definitely make it a point to come here just because of the energy outside. In the back they have a lake surrounded by forest and log cabins. Feeling the energy in that area and in the log cabins was well worth the visit. There were also some interesting educational",

          "It was a rainy day but that did not stop us from enjoying our visit to the heritage center. We spent about 2 1/2 hours at the center watching and learning about the dances, songs and a game before taking the tour around the very small lake to see and learn about the different",

          "Nature beauty of Alaska is well-known! There is a extreme hard-work of native Alaskan to extend the human civilization in this part of the world. If you really want to know more about the native life-style, hard-ship and humbleness of Alaskan communities, please take some time",
          "We didn\u2019t have enough time, and there is so much to see and learn at the Heritage Center. Despite rain, we went through the outdoor villages, met student guides, and scraped the surface of Alaskan Native housing customs. The architecture takes into consideration keeping bears",
          "This is a wonderful expirience in Aolasskan Native History and of the culture of the many tribes in Alaska. Take time to view the exhibits and to talk to those available at the museum.",
          "This is not like any regular museum; this was an experience, and we wish we had more time to explore. We saw a tribal dance and had a meet n greet with some of the native Alaskans. Very touching that the young natives shared their life story with us and answered our questions.",
          "Very disapointing visit to Alaska Native Herritage Center in Alaska. They don't have much to offer, but they would like to sell you various items made by locals. I left after 10-15 minutes, and I will not visit the center again.",
          "We found this very interesting. The people explained everything very well. It was a wonderful experience",
          "I went to this place for a specific event after hours (the conference gala dinner). Though it was a little far from the center of Anchorage, it is worth the visit. You can know a little of the rich culture of Alaska and the native tribes. There are indoor activities in the main",
          "My friend and myself had a great time viewing all the different clothing, homes, food and dance that the Alaskan people show us about their heritage. Really exciting news about the Real Alaska and not what we read in our History Books. It was exciting, learned allot, and got to",
          "Stage presentation was good and interesting. End of August a lot of the dancers had gone back to school but it was still worth it. Native historical perspective. Outside gardens with dwellings were really neat - broken up by regions of Alaska. Movie was OK - informative but",
          "The Alaska Native Heritage Center shows us how the native Alaskans housing has changed to adapt to not only weather but migrations of the native people as they moved to hunt and fish and feed their people in this Wilderness Wonderland.",
          "It would be best to check out the schedule of events and timing for the free ride back to the city if you visit. There is a bus to take you to and from. I rode back to town for free since I had purchased an admission to the center. Things moved a bit slow in the show that I",
          "We had a bit of time to kill before flying home from Anchorage. The Heritage Center offers a hotel shuttle which makes it convenient to visit. We found the displays interesting and they had activities going on during the visit in the visitors center. I wouldn't say this was",
          "We enjoyed our visit: demonstrations, interactive showcases and living history in terms of native housing. A visit here is a must if you're interested in tribal migration and living explanations. High recommendation.",
          "As we came here at the end of the season some of the exhibits were closed. However the weather was great so we were able to see a lot outside. We also watched some of the dancing. There are complimentary shuttle buses which pick up from the middle of town and bring you here",
          "While in Anchorage this past July 2017. For 2 week land / sea tour. Had the opportunity to visit the Alaska heritage center as one of excursions. As we arrived at the center we were amazed of the information available. From demonstrations on native games, music and art. The",

          "We attended a conference outing including food and Alaska Native dance performances. Displays give an excellent introduction to the different Alaska Native communities, philosophy and history.",
          "We enjoyed the program here and workers were very friendly and helpful. We had caught a cab to get there and found out by employees that there was a free shuttle which we enjoyed having. There was a tip container but gladly paid that rather than a cab.",
          "This center does an excellent job depicting the 11 different cultures that have lived in Alaska for the past few centuries. There are examples of the domiciles the natives created to live in a harsh climate. Each of these was manned by someone who could explain how the home",
          "This was a great place to go to learn about the Native Alaskan culture. The grounds had great attractions that took you through the native Alaskan peoples experiences. Willy Topkok, one of the native Alaskans story tellers was very friendly and informative. We didn't stay to",
          "Movie presentation of Native Competitive Games was very enlightening and interesting. There were other movies as well; however, we only saw the one. Fall was encroaching so the tourist crowds were absent. The various native groups' living structures were well presented;",
          "We heartily agree with what so many other reviewers have said. The ANHC is an excellent place to learn about the various cultures that inhabit Alaska. We visited there in June three years ago, and wanted to go again as it is simply not possible to absorb all that is available",
          "It was well worth the FREE shuttle to view the displays and the performances (games, dances, drumming, etc). The bonus is that you can try out the drums and high kick game at the end!",
          "One of the extraordinary aspects of Alaska is how they honor their native people. I learned more about the major tribes of Alaska in a few weeks than I have about the native tribes of the lower 48 in 66 years . This Center allows you to see how these people lived. You can",
          "This cultural center and museum is dedicated to sharing, perpetuating and preserving the Alaskan native cultures, languages and values through celebration and education (lifted from the institution's mission statement). It offers interpretive programs (we watched some young",

          "We visited the Alaska Native Heritage Center recently as part of a 2 week trip to Alaska. It was a very good introduction to native Alaska history. Most of the exhibit is an outdoor recreation of an Alaskan Native village. This was very good. Inside we saw examples of native",
          "My wife and I went there while we were visiting Anchorage. We listened to the stories that were told either verbally or through song and dance. Our knowledge of the native Alaskan culture was very limited when we arrived. The information shared with us only whetted our appetite",
          "We didn't know what to expect at this museum but we hoped to learn something about Alaska's native people. The guided tour of Native dwellings was the highlight for us. Andrew, our guide, gave us a fine overview of how Native peoples survived the cruel Alaskan winters. We left",
          "A must-see museum in Anchorage! The displays were engaging and informative. We took a guided tour of the village examples outside. We loved this tour! Our guide was good at explaining the different tribes. We then watched the Native Games. This was also quite amazing! We",
          "The clothing, crafts,birch bark canoe displays were fantastic! And watching & listeing to the music and dancers was very entertaining & captivating. I would love to return to the museum again!!The dancers were not only entertaining but great at explainig what each movement &",
          "No visit to Alaska is complete without a visit to the Alaska Native Heritage Center. There you will be treated to an Alaskan Native Games demonstration, Native singing and dance, and traditional storytelling. Be sure to take a stroll around a scenic lake where you will visit",
          "Highly anticipated our visit but we were both disappointed or perhaps saddened? The talk was fantastic and we really got a sense of life in a village and the people therein. The singing was good but went on for too long. Seeing the buildings outside was interesting, but",
          "We did get a tour of the variety of homes that the different Alaskan tribes use. There were artisans working on site. Great dioramas and exhibits explaining cultures. Dancing and story telling. And the Salmon burger was excellent - from the cafe! Don't miss this place.",
          "Our visit here howled understand a kit more about the various cultures of Alaska, their homes and why they were built the way they were and the community. The sports and dance demonstrations were great learning tools. This is a stop for every visit because you learn more each",
          "Took the bus from the Anchorage Museum, having bought admission to the Native Heritage Center as part of our admission to the museum. Well worth it. We saw a presentation of native dance and music in the auditorium, then meandered through the exhibits of native history and",
          "This is a must see if you visit Anchorage. The people, and the tour of the facility are first rate. We really learned a lot about the culture of the native Alaskan people groups. Don't miss it!",
          "The natives definitely make this place awesome. So humble and inspiring. Love hearing their stories and seeing how much pride and joy they have in their culture. Loved the music and dancing. The village house were so super cool to explore. Great place to visit!",
          "This was the highlight of our stat in Anchorage. The staff was very knowledgeable and friendly, the presentations on Native games and traditional dances were amazing, and I loved being able to walk around and see all of the different tribal villages. They cater to the public",
          "I was impressed. They were playing native games when we got there but the people we were with didn't want to stay. Living in the villages I am always admiring of how different tribes live and have lived throughout history. Alaska resident price is different than visitor so I",
          "I recently visited the Alaska Native Heritage Center which is located ten miles from downtown Anchorage. It was easy to get to as there was a shuttle bus from outside the tourist office in downtown Anchorage. Inside the building there was the Hall of Cultures, a theatre and a",
          "We visited in August of 2017 and was hoping for more detailed information on the various nations of Alaska but most was very repetitive between the movie, displays, and the live presentations.",
          "It is better to go to other museums first to learn a little bit more about the native peoples. Then go to this Museum so that you can understand in more detail. Best part of this Museum was interacting with some of the native people from the different groupings. Particularly",
          "It takes several hours to get through the presentations on stage and walking tour. They don't give out good info so many did not know there was a walking tour through the 'villages'",
          "There is such rich heritage in Alaska. But the heritage center does not do it justice. First, the price for entry was exorbitant. We were two adults who had a buy one get one free coupon, and the third person was an Alaska resident. Yet the receipt said 3 adult @ 24.95 =",
          "You get to know about few things - Alaska dance ( 45 minutes of same dance 10 times) - 6 different villages of how people lived actually ... THis was fun ! - games they play every year with balance and hands/legs. THis place needs 2-3 hours and given the time we spend, is not",
          "This was a fascinating stop. You need to take the time to listen to the stories and not just take a quick walk through. We watched a demonstration on music and dance. A gentleman in one of the buildings had the most interesting stories to tell about his life on an island just",
          "The native that sing, dance, and play the instrument do a fantastic job. The shuttle driver was very informative. The exhibit was ok. But we have to tour on our own the different houses. Would not go back",
          "This was one of our first stops on our Alaska trip and a great way to start the trip off on the right foot. I love to start trips with local history and culture; I feel it really enriches my experiences. We spent most of our time outside exploring the different housing replicas",

          "A strange title I know but this site is all about maintaining the culture of the indigenous people of Alaska. I spent time finding out about the various dwellings, dances and \u2018games\u2019 that were traditional to the people. In all cases, the sessions were narrated by locals who",
          "Got to see dance and songs performed live. Lots of great educational things to look at. The walk is great around the pond with homes that they lived in!",
          "The exhibits are very interesting and the tour of the outdoor exhibits explaining the different cultural groups was so good. Our tour guide, Austin, was very knowledgeable.",
          "In my view this is a place \"must go\". Learned a lot of history about people living in the far north of Alaska variety of tribes, their everyday lives, cultures, hunting etc. I enjoyed few hours spent there. Storytelling was great. Exhibition was very nice.",
          "Fascinating history and culture. The dance are very native and represent this ancestral culture. A very good moment to share with family",
          "We were very pleased with the visit--all areas were staffed by actual Alaska natives (village tours, presentations, vendors), and it covered the various peoples concisely, but giving a good sense of all of them. Find out how to kill a troublesome polar pear near your village",
          "We were looking for something to see for a few hours and the Visitors Center in town recommended the Heritage Centre. It is about 25 minutes via the free shuttle bus from town and $25 per head (unless you are seniors \ud83d\ude00). There are various craft and art stalls to look at as well",
          "It was a beautiful day to walk around outside. Beautiful arts & crafts made by native Alaskans.A must see!",
          "Another great place. Learnt alot. The weather was lousy but it was still a great place to go. Proper arts and crafts on sale but quite expensive. Your money goes back to the centre and to the people selling their wares. Recommend it.",
          "Visited the Alaska Native Heritage Center with my elderly father. It was difficult to locate since my phone GPS stopped working. Once we arrived, the building was beautiful and well maintained. The exhibit area is still under construction, but here were lots of Native regalia",
          "We finally had a Sunny Day in Anchorage so we decided to head over to the Alaska Native Heritage Center. What a pleasant surprise, parking is free, senior entry admission was $21.15 each this is not a bad price for what you get to view and experience. Good way to spend the",
          "The Native Heritage Center is a must-do on your next visit to Anchorage! The Heritage Center is more of an interpretive experience than a museum, although there is a central building which houses some artifacts as well as Native art pieces (it also house a great little cafe and",
          "I visited the Alaska Native Heritage Center with my family, including my two young grandsons, ages 3 and 5. We walked through the outdoor exhibits of six different tribal homes and learned about the life of each tribe, how they lived, hunted, how they made clothing, and so on.",
          "The reasonably priced combo ticket took us to the ANHC. A shuttle from the Anchorage Museum gets you there in about 15 minutes. There are native Alaskans working on their crafts inside the building. There are other craft items sold outside. Programs are scheduled throughout the",
          "We visited the center for a couple hours with our tour group. We had a good visit. We found the inside displays worth a short visit, but felt the highlights were the performances and outdoor area. We watched demonstrations on native games and dancing. We also toured the outdoor",

          "Our visit to the Heritage Center gave us a feel for the real Alaska people and their lives. The village walk through of living places was a great glimpse of tribal life. We especially enjoyed the games exhibits, storytelling and dances. All were well done and made us feel",
          "This is a must see in Anchorage and a very good way to START our Alaskan experience. The museum is very thorough with history, cultures and present day life of the native Alaskan tribes. We arrived at opening and sat right down to a live presentation explaining the various",

          "I thought it was really worth the visit. They have live events, competition, story-telling going all the time.",
          "We enjoyed the storyteller and dancers. The outside exhibit was closed temporarily due to what we soon found out was Code B. Two bears cubs were being chased off with airhorns by facility staff. The storyteller had to wait in order to watch them run by. All of the buildings",
          "This is a park-like setting with replicas of native homes and communal structures that you can walk through. When I visited, there were teenagers inside some of the buildings to explain the significance of some of the objects on display and to answer questions. It was fun",
          "This was the highlight of our trip to Anchorage. Everyone wants to see moose and bears and you hear a lot about the Gold Rush and early American settlers. This museum explains the 5 regions of indigenous people and how they lived and survived in this harsh climate. If you",
          "If there is ever a place to learn about the Alaskan Natives and their way of life --- this is it! During the summer, the Heritage Ctr is open for tourists. Amazingly the staff is predominately composed of high school students. The high school is located just across the street.",
          "Part of exploring Alaska is getting to know its indigenous people who have lived there for thousands of years. The Heritage Center provides a wonderful overview by the people from the communities across the State. You can see how they have lived, the games they play and played,",
          "Pretty short to visit the entire thing (1h) If you're really passionate about the native culture, then it's filled with people who can answer your questions. If you're just curious it can be awkward to have so many natives ask you if you have questions. 25 bucks for cultural",
          "We were with a tour group and while we were there, we listened to a native Alaskan talk about his life when he was young. It was so interesting that we stayed and listened longer than we had planned to. Then we walked and stopped at each of the authentic native dwellings that",

          "Enjoyed our visit to this attraction. Very informative -- especially liked the native dance presentation. Highly recommend this site.",
          "Interesting to hear and see the history - loved the story telling that was giving in the beginning. $24.95 fee - many coupons around Northern Lights or Tour Guide Books for 1/2 price. Easy can take couple hours or more to enjoy the whole attraction!",

          "We listened to a story teller, saw two boys do Alaskan athletic events, and a group of teenagers do some native dances (hulas with fur on). There are several outbuildings which depict the way native Alaskans lived. The interns in the buildings didn't seem to know too much",
          "We really enjoyed the information that they shared about their cultures. There were 4 main areas with people to explain what happened when they lived there and how they lived. I loved how one tribe killed bothersome polar bears. They took baleen, sharpened it, wound it us",

          "Took the free shuttle from downtown. Saw a Moose with two calves on the entrance drive guess it hangs out in the area so be on the lookout for picture opportunities. The center was well done with pictures, displays and items from the Alaskan native people. On stage we watched",
          "We throughly enjoyed our visit here. They had a mini village set up around a pond depicting six indigenous dwellings. There were interpreters in each dwelling who shared knowledge of their peoples and their ways of life. There were also many performances in the Gathering Place",
          "The center combines both indoor and outdoor exhibits. Indoor, in addition to the exhibits, are fascinating cultural presentations. Outdoor are various structures representing different locations/groups across Alaska and their way of life, and each structure has an attendant",

          "It is a well run, clean, well presented place where you can see native dancing, music and structures. The only negative is that there are a lot of vendors selling their wears, and we were there to learn.",
          "Alaska is beautiful, no doubt, but no trip to Alaska should ignore the history of this state. Sure there was gold, copper, railroads, Alaska Highway and more, but this place gives a great summary of the five areas of Alaska and the first people who called it home. The five homes",
          "Lots of history here. The outdoor exhibits were very interesting. The dance demonstrations were informative and entertaining. It was raining a bit but they had umbrellas to use so we stayed dry. We got a military discount which is always nice. They also offered a AAA discount.",
          "We spent a lovely couple hours here. There's indoor and outdoor exhibitions (dwellings). At the outdoor ones there are museum employees explaining things, which I really liked. The two things that stood out were the narrated dance performance by First Nation youth and a story",
          "We visited this place on the last day of our 8-day trip to Alaska. You can spend a solid half day here to really learn about the culture of the various Alaskan communities that lived in the area. The center is really very well kept. Though I felt the ticket price was on the",
          "The performances are really good. Songs and dances in native languages. The theater showed a movie on native Alaskans sports very nice. The rest of the tour is guided and walk around various sites showing their way of live.",
          "I found this cultural center very interesting, but was surprised that the artifacts were not authentic, but reproductions by artists. I enjoyed the programs and the tours led by Native Alaskans. I especially liked touring the different habitations and seeing how the Alaskans",
          "We spent a few hours here on a free day in Anchorage. The museum displays and the village mockups on the grounds were fascinating. The stage presentation on native dance routines and regalia was extremely informative and interesting. Well worth a visit.",
          "I honor indigenous peoples everywhere and this center does a great job of education. It is amazing how they lived in such a wild and often dangerous environment. But for them it is home.",
          "My husband and I had been here nearly 17 years ago...about the time it opened. We were on a cruise in late September, and it was basically shutdown for the season, so we took the opportunity to see what we had missed. The first thing we saw was a presentation by three Alaskan",
          "A good stop seeing some of the wildlife that need a little human intervention. Flat surfaces, but rocky to walk around... can get a courtesy vehicle if immoble",
          "Do yourself a favor and take some time to visit this museum. There is much to learn about the native Alaskan tribes and their history. Enjoyed the demonstrations on native games and also seeing the different housing used by the different tribes. Could have spent much more time",
          "We really enjoyed getting a good sense of the culture of the natives in the Center. It has a broad range of programs about the cultural heritage and history of the various native groups that make Alaska their home.  If you  attended the live presentations (story, dance and game",
          "Even though this center is off the beaten path, it is easily accessible to tourists because a free bus runs hourly from the Visitors Center. We chose to visit on a day it was raining heavily so our options were limited. We did enjoy native dance performances and a high end craft",
          "The center consists mainly of the five villages and a hall of cultures that changes exhibits annually. For both, get the app! It gives a deep and nuanced introduction to the native people site-by-site, but remember to take out your earbuds before you enter the sites. As others",
          "I visited the Alaska native heritage center during one of their free admission days, the full price admission is 25$ for adults, 21$ seniors, 17$ children age 7-16. They would get more visitors if they lowered the prices by 5$",

          "Nice cultural center where they give short presentations by Alaskan natives and they have a walking tour of different types of native homes. At certain times you can take a guided tour for no extra. The guided tour was very nice and seeing the different types of native homes,",
          "My favorite parts were the examples of various tribal buildings, craft people with their wares, the dancers.",
          "When leaving Anchorage, we visited this museum which was at about 8 km. from the centre of Anchorage in direction of Denali. There are a lot of things to see concerning the natives and a lot of things are in an external area. Good also the caf\u00e9 of the museum where we had lunch",
          "Anchorage is filled with so many people living their life, but here was the cultural center showing me the rich cultural history of the native people of the north. First, not just one people group but over 10 completely different people. I was shown that there are many ways of",
          "fun learning about the native alaskans. \"alabaskans\", the story telling guides through the village were the best park, the displays are so-so, could have done more inside",
          "Since there is little else in Anchorage to give you a view of the state's former tenants, it's a must see. I only wish it were a little more substantive. It's a little bit of a trip out of town, but well worth the time. It's a little of a funny contrast that it sits",
          "It is one thing to visit a museum to read placards and see exhibits. It is an entirely more fulfilling experience to learn about culture by interacting with super cool people from that culture. Before we even had a chance to visit the outdoor exhibits which show different",
          "Before visiting the museum we knew very little about the local indigenous cultures-- in particular, like most anglos, we probably lumped them all together! These guys did a great job with their different villages helping us to see how different they were, as well as where the",
          "It was truly amazing to enjoy the native educational talk, the traditional dances and all the sites to get to know more about the history, people and Alaska culture. I would say this place is a must-visit location if you are considering visiting Alaska and if you would like to",

          "Highlight of our time in Anchorage. Native sports, dance, and culture. Highlights the differences between the people living in the five regions of Alaska. There are sample lodgings built in each region which allows you to see how each adapted to there local environment. Free",
          "Spent most of the day here and it was well worth it. Very entertaining and educational. If you can, make sure you see the demonstrations of the games and the dancing! The tour of the tribes and villages was very informative and interesting!",
          "We attended an international conference & the organisers arranged a dinner out there. It is almost 1 hour drive from downtown. The center offered a delicious and diversified buffet with a choice of good local wines. On a stage in the main all, teams of native locals perform with",
          "We took the free shuttle from the Visitors Centre. The entrance fee was worth it. Lots of static displays of recorded history and a theatre with ongoing documentaries plus a live theatre where one can listen to talks or watch dancing. There is a walkway that takes one around to",
          "We spent more than half a day at the center participating in various programs about Native games, history, and art. We took a tour of the village that is part of the center. High school students were in each location to explain information about their culture and way of",
          "Interesting and informative museum. But pricey for the amount of displays. Includes indoor and outdoor displays.",
          "This was a highlight of our trip. You can easily spend a half a day here. It's a living history museum, with authentic dancers, singers, drummers, and displays. Our tour guide was a Native American with a wealth of knowledge that he loved sharing. Our one hour tour lasted",
          "It was an interesting and informative visit. We rode a free shuttle van from the Anchorage Visitor Center downtown. First, we watched a Native group of Tlingit perform on the indoor stage, where they danced and answered questions. Later, we saw a member of another group",
          "This centre is well laid out and there's plenty to see. Each place of interest on the outside trail had someone there to explain the exhibit and answer questions. We had dinner there, and it was absolutely delicious. We also had an excellent native show which was genuinely",

        "wiki": "Anchorage (officially called the Municipality of Anchorage; Dena'ina: Dgheyay Kaq') is a unified home rule municipality in the U.S. state of Alaska, on the West Coast of the United States. With an estimated 288,000 residents in 2019, it is Alaska's most populous city and contains 39.37% of the state's population; among the 50 states, only New York has a higher percentage of residents who live in its most populous city. The Anchorage metropolitan area, which includes Anchorage and the neighboring Matanuska-Susitna Borough, had a population of 396,317 in 2019, accounting for more than half the state's population. At  1,706 square miles (4,420 km2) of land area, the city is the fourth-largest by area in the United States and larger than the smallest state, Rhode Island, which has 1,212 square miles (3,140 km2).Anchorage is in Southcentral Alaska, at the terminus of the Cook Inlet, on a peninsula formed by the Knik Arm to the north and the Turnagain Arm to the south. The city limits span 1,961.1 square miles (5,079.2 km2), encompassing the urban core, a joint military base, several outlying communities and almost all of Chugach State Park.Due to its location, almost equidistant from New York City and Tokyo, Anchorage lies within \u200b9 1\u20442 hours by air of nearly 90% of the industrialized world. For this reason, Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is a common refueling stop for international cargo flights and home to a major FedEx hub, which the company calls a \"critical part\" of its global network of services.Anchorage has won the All-America City Award four times: in 1956, 1965, 1984\u201385, and 2002, from the National Civic League. Kiplinger has named it the United States' most tax-friendly city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRussian presence in south-central Alaska was well-established in the 19th century. In 1867, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward brokered a deal to purchase Alaska from Imperial Russia for $7.2 million, or about two cents an acre ($109.3 million in 2018 dollars). His political rivals lampooned the deal as \"Seward's folly,\" \"Seward's icebox,\" and \"Walrussia.\" In 1888, gold was discovered along Turnagain Arm just south of modern-day Anchorage.\n\nAlaska became an organized incorporated United States territory in 1912. Anchorage, unlike every other large town in Alaska south of the Brooks Range, was neither a fishing nor mining camp. The area surrounding Anchorage lacks significant economic metal minerals. A number of Dena'ina settlements existed along Knik Arm for years. By 1911 the families of J. D. \"Bud\" Whitney and Jim St. Clair lived at the mouth of Ship Creek and were joined there by a young forest ranger, Jack Brown, and his bride, Nellie, in 1912.The city grew from its happenstance choice as the site, in 1914, under the direction of Frederick Mears, of a railroad-construction port for the Alaska Engineering Commission. The area near the mouth of Ship Creek, where the railroad headquarters was located, quickly became a tent city. A townsite was mapped out on higher ground to the south of the tent city, greatly noted in the years since for its order and rigidity compared with other Alaska town sites. In 1915, territorial governor John Franklin Alexander Strong encouraged residents to change the city's name to one that had \"more significance and local associations\". In the summer of that year, residents held a vote to change the city's name; a plurality of residents favored changing the city's name to \"Alaska City.\" However, the territorial government ultimately declined to change the city's name. Anchorage was incorporated on November 23, 1920.Construction of the Alaska Railroad continued until its completion in 1923. The city's economy in the 1920s and 1930s centered on the railroad. Col. Otto F. Ohlson, the Swedish-born general manager of the railroad for nearly two decades, became a symbol of residents' contempt due to the firm control he maintained over the railroad's affairs, which by extension became control over economic and other aspects of life in Alaska.\n\nBetween the 1930s and the 1950s, the city experienced massive growth as air transportation and the military became increasingly important. Aviation operations in Anchorage commenced along the firebreak south of town (today's Delaney Park Strip), which residents also used as a golf course. An increase in air traffic led to clearing of a site directly east of town site boundaries starting in 1929; this became Merrill Field, which served as Anchorage's primary airport during the 1930s and 1940s, until Anchorage International Airport replaced it in 1951. However, Merrill Field still sees a significant amount of general aviation traffic.\nElmendorf Air Force Base and the United States Army's Fort Richardson were constructed in the 1940s, and served as the city's primary economic engine until the 1968 Prudhoe Bay discovery shifted the thrust of the economy toward the oil industry. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process led to the combining of the two bases (along with Kulis Air National Guard Base) to form Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.\n\nThe Good Friday earthquake of March 27, 1964, hit Anchorage hard at a magnitude of 9.2, killing 115 people and causing $116 million in damages ($0.73 billion in 2018 dollars). The earth-shaking event lasted nearly five minutes; most structures that failed remained intact for the first few minutes then failed with repeated flexing. It was the world's second-largest earthquake in recorded history. Because the geology in the city and surrounding suburban area was built on top ground consisting of glacial silt, the prolonged shaking from the earthquake caused soil liquefaction, leading to massive cracks in roadways and collapse of large swaths of land.  One of the most impacted housing areas of Anchorage, the Turnagain neighborhood, saw dozens of homes originally at 250 to 300 feet above sea level sink with the land they sat on down to sea level.  Rebuilding and recovery dominated the remainder of the 1960s.\nIn 1968, ARCO discovered oil in Prudhoe Bay on the Alaska North Slope, and the resulting oil boom spurred further growth in Anchorage. In 1975, the City of Anchorage and the Greater Anchorage Area Borough (which includes Eagle River, Girdwood, Glen Alps, and several other communities) merged into the geographically larger Municipality of Anchorage The city continued to grow in the 1980s, and capital projects and an aggressive beautification campaign took place. During this time Anchorage became known as the \"Green Apple of the Arctic.\"\nSeveral attempts have been made to move Alaska's state capital from Juneau to Anchorage \u2013 or to a site closer to Anchorage. The motivation is straightforward: the \"railbelt\" between Anchorage and Fairbanks contains the majority of the state's population. Robert Atwood, owner of the Anchorage Times and a tireless booster for the city, championed the move. Alaskans rejected attempts to move the capital in 1960 and 1962, but in 1974, as Alaska's center of population moved away from Southeast Alaska and to the railbelt, voters approved the move. Communities such as Fairbanks and much of rural Alaska opposed moving the capital to Anchorage for fear of concentrating more power in the state's largest city. As a result, in 1976 voters approved a plan to build a new capital city near Willow, about 70 miles (110 km) north of Anchorage. In the 1978 election, opponents to the move reacted by campaigning to defeat a nearly $1 billion bond issue to fund construction of the new capitol building and related facilities ($3 billion in 2018 dollars).. Later attempts to move the capital or the legislature to Wasilla, north of Anchorage, also failed. Anchorage has over twice as many state employees as Juneau, and is to a considerable extent the center of state and federal government activity in Alaska.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAnchorage is in Southcentral Alaska. At 61 degrees north, it lies slightly farther north than Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki and Saint Petersburg, but not as far north as Reykjav\u00edk or Murmansk. It is northeast of the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak Island, and Cook Inlet, due north of the Kenai Peninsula, northwest of Prince William Sound and the Alaska Panhandle, and nearly due south of Denali.\nThe city is on a strip of coastal lowland and extends up the lower alpine slopes of the Chugach Mountains. Point Campbell, the westernmost point of Anchorage on the mainland, juts out into Cook Inlet near its northern end, at which point it splits into two arms. To the south is Turnagain Arm, a fjord that has some of the world's highest tides. Knik Arm, another tidal inlet, lies to the west and north. The Chugach Mountains on the east form a boundary to development, but not to the city limits, which encompass part of the wild alpine territory of Chugach State Park.\nThe city's sea coast consists mostly of treacherous mudflats. Newcomers and tourists are warned not to walk in this area because of extreme tidal changes and the very fine glacial silt. Unwary victims have walked onto the solid seeming silt revealed when the tide is out and have become stuck in the mud. The two recorded instances of this occurred in 1961 and 1988.According to the United States Census Bureau, the municipality has an area of 1,961.1 square miles (5,079.2 km2); 1,697.2 square miles (4,395.8 km2) of which is land and 263.9 square miles (683.4 km2) of it is water. The total area is 13.46% water.\nBoroughs and census areas next to the Municipality of Anchorage are Matanuska-Susitna Borough to the north, Kenai Peninsula Borough to the south and Valdez-Cordova Census Area to the east. The Chugach National Forest, a national protected area, extends into the southern part of the municipality, near Girdwood and Portage.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n\nA diverse wildlife population exists within urban Anchorage and the surrounding area. Approximately 250 black bears and 60 grizzly bears live in the area. Bears are regularly sighted within the city. Moose are also a common sight; in the Anchorage Bowl, there is a summer population of approximately 250 moose, increasing to as many as 1,000 during the winter. They are a hazard to drivers, with over 100 moose killed by cars each year. Two people were stomped to death, in 1993 and 1995, in Anchorage. Cross-country skiers and dog mushers using city trails have been charged by moose on numerous occasions; the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has to kill some individual aggressive moose in the city every year. Mountain goats can be commonly sighted along the Seward Highway between Anchorage and Girdwood, and Dall sheep are often viewed quite close to the road at Windy Point. Approximately thirty northern timber wolves reside in the Anchorage area. In 2007 several dogs were killed by timber wolves while on walks with their owners. There are also beaver dams in local creeks and lakes, and sightings of foxes and kits in parking lots close to wooded areas in the spring are common. Along the Seward Highway headed toward Kenai, there are common sightings of beluga whales in the Turnagain Arm. Lynxes are occasionally sighted in Anchorage as well. Within the Municipality there are also a number of streams that host salmon runs. Fishing for salmon at Ship Creek next to downtown is popular in the summer.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAnchorage has a dry-summer subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Dsc) but with strong maritime influences that lead to a relatively moderate climate. Most of its precipitation falls in late summer. Average daytime summer temperatures range from approximately 55 to 78 \u00b0F (13 to 26 \u00b0C); average daytime winter temperatures are about 5 to 30 \u00b0F (\u221215.0 to \u22121.1 \u00b0C). Anchorage has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 101 days. According to local folklore, when a native plant called fireweed goes to seed after a full bloom, the first snowfall of winter is 6 weeks away.Average January low and high temperatures at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) are 11 to 23 \u00b0F (\u221212 to \u22125 \u00b0C) with an average winter snowfall of 75.5 inches (192 cm). The 2011\u20132012 winter had 134.5 in (341.6 cm), which made it the snowiest winter on record, topping the 1954\u20131955 winter with 132.8 in (337.3 cm). The coldest temperature ever recorded at the original weather station at Merrill Field on the East end of 5th Avenue was \u221238 \u00b0F (\u221238.9 \u00b0C) on February 3, 1947.Summers are mild (although cool compared to the contiguous US and even interior Alaska), and it can rain frequently, although not abundantly. Average July low and high temperatures are 52 to 66 \u00b0F (11 to 19 \u00b0C) and the highest reading ever recorded was 90 \u00b0F (32.2 \u00b0C) on July 4, 2019. The average annual precipitation at the airport is 16.63 inches (422 mm). Anchorage's latitude causes summer days to be very long and winter daylight hours to be very short. The city is often cloudy during the winter, which further decreases the amount of sunlight experienced by residents.Due to its proximity to active volcanoes, ash hazards are a significant, though infrequent, occurrence. The most recent notable volcanic activity centered on the multiple eruptions of Mount Redoubt during March\u2013April 2009, resulting in a 25,000-foot (7,600 m) high ash cloud as well as ash accumulation throughout the Cook Inlet region. Previously, the most active recent event was an August 1992 eruption of Mount Spurr, which is 78 miles (126 km) west of the city. The eruption deposited about 3 mm (0.1 in) of volcanic ash on the city. The clean-up of ash resulted in excessive demands for water and caused major problems for the Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility.\nThe average temperature of the sea ranges from 35.8 \u00b0F (2.1 \u00b0C) in February to 53.1 \u00b0F (11.7 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAnchorage first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census. It incorporated that same year. In 1975, it consolidated with its borough.\nAccording to the 2010 census, Anchorage had a population of 291,826 and its racial and ethnic composition was as follows:\nWhite: 66.0% (62.6% non-Hispanic)\nTwo or more races: 8.1%\nAsian: 8.1% (3.3% Filipino, 1.2% Korean, 1.1% Hmong)\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Natives: 7.9% (1.4% I\u00f1upiat, 1.1% Yup'ik, 0.8% Aleut)\nBlack or African American: 5.6%\nOther race: 2.3%\nNative Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders: 2.0% (1.4% Samoan)\nHispanic or Latino (of any race): 7.6% (4.4% Mexican, 1.2% Puerto Rican)\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, the largest national ancestry groups were as follows: 17.3% German, 10.8% Irish, 9.1% English, 6.9% Scandinavian (3.6% Norwegian, 2.2% Swedish, 0.6% Danish) and 5.6% French/French Canadian ancestry.According to the 2010 American Community Survey, approximately 82.3% of residents over the age of five spoke only English at home. Spanish was spoken by 3.8% of the population; speakers of other Indo-European languages made up 3.0% of the population; those who spoke Asian and Pacific Islander languages at home were 9.1%; and speakers of other languages made up 1.8%.In 2010, there were 291,826 people, 107,332 households and 70,544 families residing in the municipality.

The per capita income for the municipality was $34,678. About 5.1% of families and 7.9% of the population were below the poverty line. Of the city's population over the age of 25, 33.7% held a bachelor's degree or higher, and 92.1% had a high school diploma or equivalent.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nIn 2010, 83.7% (220,304) of Anchorage residents aged five and older spoke only English at home, while 4.47% (11,769) spoke Spanish, 2.53% (6,654) Tagalog, 1.56% (4,108) various Pacific Island languages, 1.38% (3,636) various Native American/Alaska Native languages, 1.14% (2,994) Korean, 0.63% (1,646) German, 0.57% (1,502) Hmong, 0.50% (1,307) Russian, and Japanese was spoken as a main language by 0.45% (1,185) of the population over the age of five. In total, 16.33% (43,010) of Anchorage's population aged five and older spoke a mother language other than English.As of September 7, 2006, 94 languages were spoken by students in the Anchorage School District.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAnchorage's largest economic sectors include transportation, military, municipal, state and federal government, tourism, corporate headquarters (including regional headquarters for multinational corporations) and resource extraction. Large portions of the local economy depend on Anchorage's geographical location and surrounding natural resources. Anchorage's economy traditionally has seen steady growth, though not quite as rapid as many places in the lower 48 states. With the notable exception of a real estate-related crash in the mid-to-late 1980s, which saw the failure of numerous financial institutions, it does not experience as much pain during economic downturns.\nThe Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (TSAIA) is the world's fourth busiest airport for cargo traffic, surpassed only by Memphis, Hong Kong, and Shanghai Pudong. This traffic is strongly linked to Anchorage's location along great circle routes between Asia and the lower 48. In addition, the airport has an abundant supply of jet fuel from in-state refineries in North Pole and Kenai. This jet fuel is transported to the Port of Anchorage, then by rail or pipeline to the airport.\n\nThe Port of Anchorage receives 95 percent of all goods destined for Alaska. Ships from Totem Ocean Trailer Express and Horizon Lines arrive twice weekly from the Port of Tacoma in Washington. Along with handling these activities, the port is a storage facility for jet fuel from Alaskan refineries, which is used at both TSAIA and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER).\nThe existing port was substantially built in the late 1950s and is reaching the end of its useful life. Beginning in 2017, the Port of Anchorage is undertaking an extensive 7-year Anchorage Port Modernization Project to upgrade its aging infrastructure, support larger deeper draft vessels, and future proof the port seismically and environmentally for another 75 years.\nThe United States military used to have two large installations, Elmendorf Air Force Base and Fort Richardson, which originally stemmed from the branching off of the U.S. Air Force from the U.S. Army following World War II. In a cost-cutting effort initiated by the 2005 BRAC proceedings, the bases were combined. JBER was created, which also incorporated Kulis Air National Guard Base near TSAIA. The combination of these three bases employ approximately 8,500 civilian and military personnel. These individuals along with their families comprise approximately ten percent of the local population. During the Cold War, Elmendorf became an important base due to its proximity to the Soviet Union, particularly as a command center for numerous forward air stations established throughout the western reaches of Alaska (most of which have since closed).\n\nWhile Juneau is the official state capital of Alaska, more state employees reside in the Anchorage area. Approximately 6,800 state employees work in Anchorage compared to about 3,800 in Juneau. The State of Alaska purchased the Bank of America Center (which it renamed the Robert B. Atwood Building) to house most of its offices, after several decades of leasing space in the McKay Building (now the McKinley Tower) and later the Frontier Building.\nThe resource sector, mainly petroleum, is arguably Anchorage's most visible industry, with many high rises bearing the logos of large multinationals such as BP and ConocoPhillips. While field operations are centered on the Alaska North Slope and south of Anchorage around Cook Inlet, the majority of offices and administration are found in Anchorage. The headquarters building of ConocoPhillips Alaska, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, is in downtown Anchorage. It is also the tallest building in Alaska. Many companies who provide oilfield support services are likewise headquartered outside of Anchorage but maintain a substantial presence in the city, most notably Arctic Slope Regional Corporation and CH2M Hill.\nFour small airlines, Alaska Central Express, Era Aviation, Hageland Aviation Services, and PenAir, are headquartered in Anchorage. Alaska Airlines (at one point headquartered in Anchorage, but now headquartered in the Seattle area), has major offices and facilities at TSAIA, including the offices of the Alaska Airlines Foundation. Prior to their respective dissolutions, airlines MarkAir, Reeve Aleutian Airways and Wien Air Alaska were also headquartered in Anchorage. The Reeve Building, at the corner of West Sixth Avenue and D Street, was spared the wrecking ball when the city block it sits on was cleared to make way for the Anchorage 5th Avenue Mall, and was incorporated into the mall's structure. In 2013, Forbes named Anchorage among its list of Best Places for Business and Careers.Five Alaska Native regional corporations are based in Anchorage: The Aleut Corporation, Bristol Bay Native Corporation, Calista Corporation, Chugach Alaska Corporation, and Cook Inlet Region, Inc.\nAnchorage does not levy a sales tax. However, it charges a 12% bed tax on hotel stays and an 8% tax on car rentals. Since about 2000, in response to strong revenue and occupancy rates, major hotel developers from the Lower 48 have been building new hotels along C Street from International Airport Road to just north of Tudor Road, with two more to open in 2017, making this half-mile stretch of C Street a new \"hotel row\". From Anchorage people can easily head south to popular fishing locations on the Kenai Peninsula or north to locations such as Denali National Park and Fairbanks.\n\n\n== Arts ==\n\nLocated next to Town Square Park in downtown Anchorage, the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts is a three-part complex that hosts numerous performing arts events each year. The facility can accommodate more than 3,000 persons. In 2000, nearly 245,000 people visited 678 public performances. It is home to eight resident performing arts companies and has featured mega-musicals performed by visiting companies. The center also hosts the International Ice Carving Competition as part of the Fur Rendezvous festival in February.\nThe Anchorage Concert Association brings 20 to 30 events to the community each year, including Broadway shows like Disney's The Lion King, Les Mis\u00e9rables, Mamma Mia!, The Phantom of The Opera, West Side Story, and others. The Sitka Summer Music Festival presents an \"Autumn Classics\" festival of chamber music for two weeks each September on the campus of Alaska Pacific University. Orchestras include the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra and the Anchorage Youth Symphony.\nAnnually in January, the Anchorage Folk Festival takes place at the University of Alaska Anchorage, featuring concerts, dances, and workshops with featured guest artists and over 130 performances by volunteer singers, dancers, musicians, and storytellers.\n\nAlaska Native Heritage Center\nAlaska Museum of Natural History\nAlaska Aviation Heritage Museum\nAnchorage Museum at Rasmuson Center\nOscar Anderson House Museum\nWells Fargo Alaska Heritage Library & MuseumThe city of Anchorage provides three municipal facilities large enough to hold major events such as concerts, trade shows and conventions. Downtown facilities include the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts, William A. Egan Civic & Convention Center and the recently completed Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center, which will be connected via skybridge to form the Anchorage Civic & Convention District. The Sullivan Arena hosts sporting events as well concerts and annual trade shows. \n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nNational attention focuses on Anchorage on the first Saturday of each March, when the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race kicks off with its ceremonial start downtown on Fourth Avenue. Anchorage is also home to the Fur Rendezvous Open World Championship Sled Dog Races, a three-day dog sled sprint event consisting of 3 timed races of 25.5 miles (41.0 km) each. Held each February, the event is part of the annual Fur Rendezvous, a winter sports carnival.\nAnchorage is the home of three teams in the Alaska Baseball League. The Anchorage Bucs and Anchorage Glacier Pilots, which both play at Mulcahy Stadium, and the Chugiak-Eagle River Chinooks based at Lee Jordan Field in Chugiak.Anchorage has no professional sports teams. The most recent to call the city home was the Alaska Aces of the ECHL. The Aces were very successful during their time in Anchorage, claiming three league titles, four conference championships, and eight division championship during their 29-year history (1989\u20132017).  The Aces affiliated with various National Hockey League teams during this time, including the Calgary Flames, Minnesota Wild, and Vancouver Canucks.  Following the 2016\u201317 season, the team ceased operations and were sold to a group in Portland, Maine, where they became the Maine Mariners in the 2018\u201319 season.\nThe University of Alaska Anchorage Seawolves are a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. UAA has Division I teams in gymnastics and hockey, as well as several other Division II teams. UAA sponsors the annual Great Alaska Shootout, an annual NCAA Division I basketball tournament featuring colleges and universities from across the United States along with the UAA team.\nAnchorage is the finish line for the Sadler's Ultra Challenge wheelchair race, and holds the ceremonial start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.\nThere are four rugby clubs, including the Bird Creek Barbarians RFC, Anchorage Thunderbirds, Mat Valley Maulers RFC, and Spenard Green Dragons. The season runs from April through September.\nThe Anchorage Northern Knights gained national attention when they joined the eight-team Eastern Basketball Association in 1977, a league whose nearest competitor was 5,000 miles (8,000 km) from Anchorage. The Knights captured the 1979\u201380 league championship, and featured several players who would play in the NBA, most notably Brad Davis, a future player and broadcaster for the Dallas Mavericks. They competed in the renamed Continental Basketball Association for five seasons until the economic recession ended their run in 1982.\nThe city was the U.S. candidate for hosting the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, but lost to Albertville, France and Lillehammer, Norway respectively. Anchorage is a premier cross-country skiing city, in terms of density of groomed trails within the urban core. There are 105 miles (169 km) of maintained ski trails in the city, some of which reach downtown. The same trail system also provides access to Chugach State Park, a 495,000-acre (200,000 ha) high alpine park. The Tour of Anchorage is an annual 50-kilometer ski race within the city. and is the Host for the 2009 and 2010 US Senior National Cross Country Ski Championship.Anchorage is also home to Alaska's first WFTDA flat track women's roller derby league, the Rage City Rollergirls.The Anchorage Football Stadium is also a noteworthy sports venue.\nThe 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships was played in Anchorage.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\n\n\n=== Parks, gardens, and wildlife refuges ===\nAlaska Native Heritage Center\nThe Alaska Botanical Garden has over 900 species of hardy perennials and 150 native plant species\nAlaska Zoo\nAlaska Wildlife Conservation Center\nAnchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge\nDelaney Park Strip\nKincaid Park\nPoint Woronzof Park\nFlattop Mountain Recreation Area\nWestchester Lagoon/Margaret Eagan Sullivan Park\nNumerous other city parks throughout the borough\n\n\n=== Recreational facilities ===\nArctic Valley Ski Area\nAlyeska Resort\nHilltop Ski Area\nKincaid Park\nTony Knowles Coastal Trail\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\nMoose's Tooth Pub & Pizzeria, a pub and pizzeria ranked 3rd best in the United States\nAnchorage Museum\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nAnchorage is governed by an elected mayor and 11-member assembly, with the assistance of a city manager. These positions are non-partisan (as is the case with all municipal elected offices in Alaska), and thus no candidates officially run under any party banner. All eleven members are elected from districts known as sections. Five of the sections elect two members from designated seats, while the remaining section elects one member. Prior to the 1980 United States Census, the single-member section was the one centered around the northern Anchorage communities of Chugiak and Eagle River. Since that census, the area encompassing Downtown Anchorage and surrounding neighborhoods has served as the city's single-member section. The mayor (along with members of the school board) is elected in a citywide vote. In practice, however, the party affiliation and political ideology of major candidates are usually well known, and is highlighted by local media for the purposes of framing debate. The city's mayor is Ethan Berkowitz, a registered Democrat. Along with 7 sister cities in the SCI program, Anchorage has a cultural exchange program with the former Yugoslavia nation of Montenegro.\nThe Anchorage Assembly gained national publicity following their 2017 municipal election, when two openly gay candidates (Christopher Constant and Felix Rivera) were successfully elected into the eleven-member council \u2013 becoming the first openly gay candidates ever elected into Anchorage public office.Anchorage generally leans toward Republican candidates in both state and presidential elections. However, since the establishment of the municipality in 1975, there have been two Democratic mayors (Tony Knowles and Mark Begich) who have been elected to two consecutive terms and later to statewide office. Downtown, Girdwood, and much of both the west and east parts of town trend Democratic. However, areas closest to the military bases \u2013 including Eagle River \u2013 and south Anchorage are the most Republican areas of the Municipality. Midtown is relatively moderate by comparison.\nVoting trends show that Downtown Anchorage votes Democratic in large margins, while Spenard, Turnagain/Inlet View, and University/Airport Heights are relatively moderate and swing in elections. The remaining Anchorage area votes Republican. In 2018, Anchorage began conducting municipal elections by mail (as directed by the assembly in 2015) and had the highest voter turnout in the city's history.Anchorage-Eagle River sends 16 representatives (as of 2018 9 Republicans and 7 Democrats) to the 40-member Alaska House of Representatives and eight senators (5 Republicans and 3 Democrats) to the 20-member Senate. When seats from the neighboring Mat-Su Borough are added, more than half of the Alaska state legislature comes from the Anchorage metropolitan area. This is often used as an argument in favor of moving the state capital from Juneau to a location in the Anchorage area.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nWith a reported strength of 383 sworn officers, the Anchorage Police Department is the largest police department in the state, serving an area of 159 square miles with a population of 300,950. Until 2016, Alaska State Troopers provided policing for the southern regions of Anchorage along Turnagain Arm. After their withdrawal, Girdwood contracted with the neighboring city of Whittier for its policing, and the following year APD provided contract policing to other Turnagain Arm communities. The Fire & EMS Operations Division of the Anchorage Fire Department (AFD) includes thirteen fire stations with over 300 personnel covering three rotating 24-hour shifts. Additionally, there are volunteer fire departments in Girdwood and Chugiak and fire departments on Elmendorf Air Force Base and Fort Richardson, as well as the Airport Police and Fire Department.\nIn 2010, Anchorage reported 837.7 violent crimes per 100,000 population and 3,518.0 property crimes per 100,000 population (see table). Anchorage's crime rate, both for violent and property crimes, is higher than for Alaska as a whole or for the U.S. as a whole. When compared with U.S. cities of similar size, Anchorage has a slightly higher rate of violent crime and a slightly lower rate of property crime. Anchorage, and Alaska in general, have very high rates of sexual assault in comparison with the rest of the country, with Anchorage's annual rate of forcible rapes over three times as high as for the U.S. as a whole. In 2010, the rate of rape for Anchorage was 90.9 per 100,000 population, while the U.S. rate was 27.5 per 100,000 population. Alaska Natives are victimized at a much higher rate than their representation in the population.The Anchorage Community Survey, a public survey conducted in 2004\u20132005 by the Justice Center at University of Alaska Anchorage, found that overall, Anchorage residents are fairly satisfied with the performance of the Anchorage Police Department. Most survey respondents perceived the justice system to be \"somewhat effective\" or \"very effective\" at apprehending and prosecuting criminal suspects, bringing about just outcomes, and reducing crime.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nPublic education in Anchorage, Eagle River, Chugiak, Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force Base is managed by the Anchorage School District, the 87th largest district in the United States, with nearly 50,000 students attending 98 schools. There are also a number of choices in private education, including both religious and non-denominational schools.\nAnchorage has four higher-education facilities that offer bachelor's or master's degrees: the University of Alaska Anchorage, Alaska Pacific University, Charter College, and the Anchorage campus of Texas-based Wayland Baptist University. The University of Alaska Fairbanks also has a small Center for Distance Education downtown. Other continuing education facilities in Anchorage include the Grainger Leadership Institute, Nine Star Enterprises, CLE International, Nana Worksafe, and PackBear DBA Barr & Co.\nNinety percent of Anchorage's adults have high-school diplomas, 65 percent have attended one to three years of college, and 17 percent hold advanced degrees.Anchorage has the most ethnically diverse schools in the United States, including the three most diverse high schools, the three most diverse middle schools, and the 19 most diverse elementary schools. Even the least diverse schools in Anchorage rank in the top 1% nationally.The Chugach School District operates neighborhood schools in Valdez\u2013Cordova Census Area, Alaska, as well as the supplementary Voyage to Excellence Residential School in Anchorage; its board office is in Anchorage. The Aleutian Region School District, which operates schools in areas of the Aleutian Islands, has its district administrative offices in Anchorage.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nAnchorage's leading newspaper is the Anchorage Daily News, a citywide daily newspaper. Other newspapers include the Alaska Star, serving primarily Chugiak and Eagle River, the Anchorage Press, a free weekly covering mainly cultural topics, and The Northern Light, the student newspaper of the University of Alaska Anchorage. Anchorage's major network television affiliates are KTUU 2 (NBC), KTBY 4 (Fox), KYES 5 (MyNetworkTV), KAKM 7 (PBS), KTVA 11 (CBS), KYUR 13 (ABC/CW), and KDMD 33 (Ion/Telemundo). Anchorage is one hour behind the Pacific Time Zone, and receives the same network feed as the West Coast. Weekday primetime runs from 7 to 10 pm. Effectively, programs are viewed at the same local hour as those in the Central Time Zone. The city's only cable television provider is General Communication, Inc. (GCI). However, Dish Network and DirecTV offer satellite television service in Anchorage and the surrounding area; and uses East Coast feeds.\nThere are many radio stations in Anchorage; see List of radio stations in Alaska for more information.\n\n\n== Health and utilities ==\n\nProvidence Alaska Medical Center on Providence Drive in Anchorage is the largest hospital in Alaska and is part of Providence Health & Services in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California. It features the state's most comprehensive range of services. Providence Health System has a history of serving Alaska, beginning when the Sisters of Providence of Montreal first brought health care to Nome in 1902. As the territory grew during the following decades, so did efforts to provide care. Hospitals were opened in Fairbanks in 1910 and Anchorage in 1937.\nAlaska Regional Hospital on DeBarr Road opened in 1958 as Anchorage Presbyterian Hospital, downtown at 825 L Street. This predecessor to Alaska Regional was a joint venture between local physicians and the Presbyterian Church. In 1976 the hospital moved to its present location on DeBarr Road, and is now a 254-bed licensed and accredited facility. Alaska Regional has expanded services and in 1994, Alaska Regional joined with HCA, one of the nation's largest healthcare providers.\nAlaska Native Medical Center on Tudor Road provides medical care and therapeutic health care to Alaska natives \u2013 229 tribes \u2013 at the Anchorage site and at 15 satellite facilities throughout the state. ANMC specialists also travel to clinics in the bush to provide care. The 150-bed hospital is also a teaching center for the University of Washington's regional medical education program. ANMC houses an office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and Southcentral Foundation jointly own and manage ANMC.\nThe Municipal Light & Power (ML&P) and Chugach Electric Association provide electricity to the city. A municipally owned utility since 1932, ML&P supplies electric power to more than 30,000 residential and commercial customers in the Anchorage area. Chugach Electric Association is a not-for-profit, member-owned cooperative that was formed in 1948.\nMost homes have natural gas-fueled heat. ENSTAR Natural Gas Company is the sole provider for Anchorage, servicing some 90-percent of the city's population.\nThe Municipality of Anchorage owns and operates the Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility, serving some 55,000 customer accounts with water from Eklutna Lake, which is mainly meltwater from Eklutna Glacier. Anchorage Municipal Solid Waste Services and Anchorage Refuse conduct trash removal in the city depending on location.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Major Highways ===\n AK-1\n AK-3In everyday discourse, Alaskans do not use numerical route designations, preferring instead the named designations\u2014in this case the Seward Highway and the Glenn Highway.\n\n\n==== Highway to Highway ====\n\nOn and off since the 1960s, the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities, in coordination with the Federal Highway Administration and the Municipality of Anchorage (or the lineal predecessors of those entities), have been exploring the concept of a roadway connecting the endpoints of the Seward and Glenn highways. The project is called \"Highway to Highway\", and the most recent concept for this project is that of a \"trenched\" freeway through the heart of Anchorage.\nHighway to Highway was included in the 2005 Long Range Transportation Plan, and would cost at least $575 million ($726 million in 2018 dollars). \u2013 by far the largest urban infrastructure project in Alaska's history.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nAnchorage has a bus system called People Mover, with a hub in downtown Anchorage and satellite hubs at Dimond Center and Muldoon Mall. The People Mover provides carpool organization services. The public paratransit service known as AnchorRides provides point-to-point accessible transportation services to seniors and those who experience disabilities.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe Alaska Railroad offers year-round freight service along the length of its rail system between Seward (the southern terminus of the system), Fairbanks (the northern terminus of the system), and Whittier (a deep water, ice-free port). Daily passenger service is available during summer (May 15 \u2013 September 15), but is reduced to one round-trip per week between Anchorage and Fairbanks during the winter. Passenger terminals exist at Talkeetna, Denali National Park, Fairbanks, and several other locations. These communities are also served by bus line from Anchorage. The Ship Creek Shuttle connects downtown with the Ship Creek area, including stops at the Alaska Railroad depot.\nAnchorage also is conducting a feasibility study on a commuter rail and light rail system. For the commuter rail system, Anchorage would use existing Alaska Railroad tracks to provide service to Whittier, Palmer, Seward, Wasilla, and Eagle River.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\n\nThe Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, 6 miles (9.7 km) south of downtown Anchorage, is the airline hub for the state, served by many national and international airlines, including Seattle-based Alaska Airlines as well as many intrastate airlines and charter air services. The airport is the primary international air freight gateway in the nation. By weight, five percent of the value of all United States international air cargo moved through Anchorage in 2008. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, it was briefly the busiest airport in the United States due to sustained volume of cargo flights through Alaska while passenger travel sharply decreased in other American airports. Next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is Lake Hood Seaplane Base, the largest Seaplane Base in the world. Merrill Field, a general aviation airport on the edge of downtown, was the 87th-busiest airport in the nation in 2010. There are also ten smaller private (mostly Department of Transportation) general aviation airports within the city limits.\nList of airports in the Municipality of Anchorage\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nAnchorage has seven sister cities.\n Chitose, Japan\n Darwin, Australia\n Harbin, China\n Incheon, South Korea\n Magadan, Russia\n Troms\u00f8, Norway\n Whitby, United Kingdom\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAnchorage Fire Department\nAnchorage by singer Michelle Shocked.\nList of aerospace museums\nList of tallest buildings in Anchorage\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Anchorage, Alaska\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPreston Jones.

          "This was well laid-out, good descriptions and films. Good artifacts. The documentary about Alaska at war (in the Aleutian islands) was great, even though it's a '70's film. Worth the visit, especially if you're already near by at the airport.",

          "The early history of aviation in Alaska is thoroughly explored with lots of stories of the early pioneers. There is a 55 minute film available to watch, a restoration area, and a gift shop. A static display stands outside along with the remains of the original control tower cap.",

          "This museum has some aircraft used in Alaska. There are some stories of the airlines and pilots but it seemed very light in what happens in Alaska and the museum more approaches what flew where and when. I'd expect a museum to go more in depth about conditions of flying in",
          "We had a few hours to burn before our flight home. We decided to visit this museum. We were not disappointed. Lots of great displays and expertly restored aircraft. The staff was friendly and the lay out was easily negotiated.",

          "My boyfriend is a self-described airplane nerd, so this was a must stop on our trip. There were displays about commercial airlines as well as the bush pilots (and a small military display) - all were interesting to me. They presented fact and artifacts without using too much",
          "Not the most visited museum but well worth a tour. Lots of amazing information about the first seaplane flights and Alaskan airways. Great fun getting to go onboard an old passenger plane and seeing the decor. Times HAVE changed! Very friendly lady in charge she was a gem too.",
          "This little museum was hard to find as it is tucked away near the International Airport and Float Plane Harbor. It had displays on famous Alaskan aviators, some films, a couple of flight simulators and a few airplanes. I most enjoyed the film about Alaska's role in WW II as I",
          "Great overview of the importance of aviation to Alaska. There is something here for all ages, movies static displays, restorations in progress, even a full sized 737 to walk thru.",
          "Great little place. You've got more than one build'n and what you see in the photo with a bunch of craft in it. I remember a cool little chopper in there. They've got a little hanger for repair'n stuff you can go into. The main museum's a nice place, got some good stuff in it.",

          "This is not only the best museum in Anchorage but one of the best aviation museums that I've ever visited. One could easily spend several hours in this place. There are aircraft outside and inside. The museum also has old army trucks outside and a very old vehicle inside. There",

          "Greatly expanded in the past few years, this excellent facility tells the story of aviation in Alaska, from its indispensable bush pilots to airlines that have served Alaska over the years, and the military's vital role in protecting this great frontier. Well worth a visit!",
          "The Anchorage Museum of Aviation located on the shores of Lake Hood is a place for history buffs like me. Their collection of aviation history is by far one of the best I've seen. If you are like me and like aviation, you could spend the entire day here. They have a fine"

It is the most climbed mountain in the state.\nIt is usually reached by driving to the Glen Alps trailhead and following a well-maintained 1.5-mile (2.4-km) trail, with an elevation gain of 1280 feet (390 m) from the parking lot to the summit. Since it is the most accessible mountain to Anchorage, Flattop is a very popular location for hiking, climbing, berry picking, paragliding, and backcountry skiing. Campouts are held on the summit at the summer and winter solstices.\nFlattop is known for its panoramic views of Anchorage and the surrounding area; Denali, Mount Foraker, and Mount Spurr are sometimes visible on very clear days.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nChugach State Park Hillside trail guide\nTrail map (includes Flattop trail)\nFlattop Mountain Shuttle provides van service from downtown to the trailhead and back.]",

          "Because few of my friends had climbed the back side of Flattop, and most had sworn off the difficult front side, I ended up going with others four times last month. With my slowest friend, it took two hours of stopping to look at the view. With the fastest, it was under an hour.",
          "Once you wind your way up the curve road which already gets you up pretty high, parking is $5 - use the envelope and don't just put our money in the box loose, like I did. (I just filled out the envelope anyway and tore off the flap to put on my dashboard). I knew about the",
          "A steep drive that can get you confused as you drive through areas that look like residences. Once you arrive, if the weather is nice, the view is great. Bonus was the moose sleeping on the hill across the way and a couple more just below us. Quite the hike to get to the top so",
          "We stopped here on our way to Portage Glacier. A fairly steep drive up hill but then once you are there it's just a short walk from the parking lot to the overlook for nice views of Anchorage and the surrounding area. Or you can walk further up the trail to the mountain.",
          "I knew about the railroad ties and warnings of scree but we tried anyway. The top was just too much on loose footing for this in-shape 62-yr-old. My legs would\u2019ve made it no problem but even in good hiking shoes I was way too uncomfortable at the thought of having to come down",
          "Absolutely loved the Flattop mountain trail. There\u2019s 3 trails there. One that takes you to the flattop mountain (there\u2019s also a easier pathway to get to that trail but only easier by 200 yards) then it\u2019s a tough hike to the top. Also another trail which is called overview of",
          "Not to simple a drive and rather steep to get there. Views of Anchorage and across the bay are stunning. Wait for a nice clear day to get a great view. Plenty of room to park and walk around. Bathrooms at end of parking area.",
          "we followed the trail, accidentally zigged where we should have zagged and ended up climbing what they called \"3rd peak\" instead of flat top. a bit steeper and more challenging, but we persevered. decent parking and fairly well traveled so someone to call 911 if a bear eats you.",
          "This is a moderate hike with worthwhile views. It is convenient that it is right in Anchorage, so you don't have to go far to see gorgeous views",
          "Our Lyft driver recommended Flattop Mountain to hike, a we had several hours to kill before our flight home. Exceptional views, easy hiking, and we'd definitely return for more of the hiking experience",
          "If you are not active, this will be a bit of a challenge, but DO NOT GIVE UP. The view at the top is worth the climb! And on a clear day you can see Denali as well as the Alaskan Mountain range.. the water falls and creeks on the back side are very beautiful and make for amazing",
          "If you have limited time in Anchorage, as we did, this is the place to spend it. Easy to get to, gorgeous views, and a nice workout after a long plane ride.",
          "We went there on a sunny afternoon after coming back from Denali. The Flattop Mountain Trail was steep at the beginning and the end. We didn\u2019t finish the entire trail due to time constraints. However, the views we got was still awesome. What I love the most about the flattop",
          "My wife and I climbed flattop Mountain a week ago, and again yesterday. The views are absolutely breathtaking allowing you to see most of Anchorage, the Kooks sound, and the glacial mountains in the distance. It is a strenuous hike. But it is well Mark and you can turn around",
          "The trail is very close to Anchorage. There are a lot people hiking there, some with dogs. On our day hiking there, it was cloudy and view still great. Since we hiked other places in the morning, I was only able to finish 80% of trail. It was steep and slippery. Make sure wear",
          "The upper part of the trail is quite difficult but even at 67 it's doable. Coming down will take a while.",
          "We went up the backside of FTM. It was a great strenuous hike, literally scrambling up scree to get to the top. This was perfect for us because we are experienced hikers. The views from the top were amazing. We went down the \"normal\" way up and it was super easy. It's a cake",
          "From what we read, Flattop Mountain is the most frequently climbed mountain in Alaska. Our third day in Anchorage (July 31) was a gorgeous day and we decided to go for a hike. Flattop Mountain is a short distance from Anchorage and, especially on a clear day, well worth",
          "This climb is well worth the effort and the views from the top are great. However. the last 50 yards to the summit are very challenging. It is difficuly to climb at the end and even more difficult to descend. Be prepared and wear good hiking shoes.",
          "It was my first time climbing to the top of mountain by myself and it took me only two hours 12 minutes and 12 seconds to do it. It is the trip worth doing just wants because it is a hell of a trip back down.",
          "Do it if you're in Anchorage for any period of time. Offers panoramic views of Anchorage. Bring some water, some snacks and a light jacket in summer due to unpredictable conditions at the top - being breezy is a given, and if there are any clouds about, maybe some rain as well.",
          "A great hiking trail to the top of Flattop mountain in Anchorage AK.. its easy to hike it and the views the entire climb is worth the effort. There\u2019s a parking lot that requires payment. You can acquire a seasonal parking pass to Alaska State Parks that includes this parking",
          "If you are in fairly good shape, this is a good hike; especially if you will be doing a lot of tours by train, bus, or boat which is necessary to see a lot of Alaska. This trail is about a 30 minute ride from downtown Anchorage and we used the Flattop Shuttle provided by a",
          "A great place to hike for many activity levels. Hand over hand rock climbing for the last portion. Great fun for the whole family. A must do activity.",
          "I would recommend it to anybody in Fairly good shape to make an attempt at climbing this mountain. I made it 99+% of the way to the top, but due to time constraint, confused about exactly how I was going to get to the top, I decided to turn back. Thought I had to meet my ride",
          "So, I love hiking. I have hiked quite a bit, all over the world. The one thing this trail has is a stunning view. But I imagine you could get the same thing from other spots along Anchorage\u2019s eastern edge. Otherwise, it\u2019s straight up and feels like New York sidewalk complete",
          "Nice place to park and safe to leave your vehicle. Bathrooms and water at the beginning of the 2 trails. small hike on the left is less than half mile. Take a right and you will go on top of flat top mountain. @ 1300 elevation 1.5 miles hike. Take water, good hiking shoes and",
          "We made a quick stop at flattop trail. It was nice to actually be able to drive up to the top and then hike around. It was a windy day when we visited and were not able to stay long because we didn\u2019t have hats. We did get some great nice pictures of the city below.",
          "My husband and 15 year old summited. They did have to use hands and feet to make it to the top. As a novice with no training, I would call this a moderate/ diffficult hike.",
          "If you have a couple hours to spare, take the time to explore this area. Even if you don't make it to the top, the atmosphere changes constantly due to clouds, fog, sun, etc. Make sure you have good footwear on as the trail towards the top is harder to maneuver because of",
          "The initial climb to the \u201cshoulder\u201d is relatively easy taken from the trailhead parking lot. Above the \u201cshoulder\u201d it gets a bit more challenging with some 4 limb climbing but doable for an old man with no disability. Best in summer as snow will make it pretty treacherous in",
          "We took this opportunity to climb a mountain and it was exhilarating! They took us in a van and give you a time plan as well as tips and advice. But overall, you just follow the trail to the summit of the mountain. here are some impressive winds and some impressive hikers on",
          "The hike to the summit of Flattop Mountain enables hikers to get a fantastic panoramic view of the Chugach Mountains and Downtown Anchorage. It cost five dollars ($5.00) to park per day. The hike is about three (3) miles round-trip, and it takes around two (2) hours to complete.",
          "It was a tough hike. The first couple miles are not too bad with plenty of steps. The bad part is the trail doesn't seem to be kept up. There are railroad ties that are leaning forward, so it make the steps uneven. There is also plenty of loose stones and gravel. With about a",
          "A great view from the parking lot loop but with a bit of work you can make the hike to the top of flat top where the views are amazing!",
          "Well worth the effort. Great views and family friendly hiking. Get a picture at the top with the flag",
          "This trail is advertised as having a 1350 foot vertical rise over a 1.5 mile stretch. Near the bottom, the trail is wide and easy to traverse. As it goes higher, the trail becomes treacherous with lots of loose rocks, steep slopes and howling winds conspiring to knock you",
          "You can drive two thirds of the way to the top and in the parking lot there is a lookout over the city. However, there is also a 3 to 7 mile hike that moderate to advanced hikers can enjoy. The trail is fairly wide, not too steep and has recently installed wooden stairs in",
          "This hike has great views the hike is tough I\u2019m 20 pounds over weight very rough doing. The last area is rough climbing but doable I did it.",
          "Hiking Flattop mountain is not for the faint of heart or for those who are not physically conditioned. This will be a brutal hike for someone overweight or under conditioned. Trail is rocky and steep in certain parts but well worth the trip to the top for excellent views of",
          "Fantastic hike with great views of the downtown skyline, Turnagain arm and surrounding mountains. We got overwhelmed by the gusting wind about a mile up and stopped, took photos and returned to the car. Would love to head to the top on a calmer day!",
          "We took a minibus tour from downtown to Flat Top mountain. The views over Anchorage were good, but there was still snow on the mountain and it was lovely to walk up through the snow, though a bit slippery at times, despite wearing walking boots. The final ascent was steep, so",
          "The day we visited was cold and windy. We had 2 toddlers with us.We were only able to get about half way to the top,but the views were fantastic.",
          "This is a very popular hike both for visitors and local people. So be prepared to share the trail with others. We booked a minibus from Downtown Cycle Hire, in Anchorage. You need to go to there website to book in advance as places are limited, but no deposit is taken. The bus",
          "We went into the hike knowing it would be tough. The up part was challenging, but nothing horrible. Even the rock scrambling at the end seemed easier than we thought. Once at the top the scenery was beautiful and there was so much to see all the way around. However... going back",
          "Visited with my parents. We couldn't do the hike but loved the view from the scenic overlook. There are several trails which look vigorous. We saw a couple parasailers glide off the Flat Top summit. Great place for a visit even if you can't do the hike.",
          "We didn't actually do the hike - there was too much snow, and my friends weren't keen on the quick elevation gain anyway. BUT, we drove up to the parking lot, and that alone was a spectacular view! It's a 30 minute drive out from downtown anchorage, and you can just park and",
          "My boyfriend and I spent a week in Alaska around mid-May, and we did this trail on our second day there, following the suggestion of a guy we met at a restaurant the day before. He told us it was not a very long hike, and the views from Anchorage were great. Well, that is all",
          "We're used to hiking in the mountains of Utah and Colorado. I think the elevation gain here is almost 1400 feet in just over a mile and a half. The hike to the saddle was not bad with stairs to make the steepest part easier. In mid May there were several patches of snow to",
          "For a guy who\u2019s never hiked... this was doable but it will test you physically. Hiking is not my thing but by the time we got to the scramble, it didn\u2019t make sense not to keep going. It\u2019s a beautiful view but take your time up and down. It is physically taxing for sure. Now",
          "A quick hike up the mountain before setting off on a four day cruise. We were accompanied by a mother, a 8-month pregnant mother to be, and two dogs. There was still quite a bit of snow on the trail so we didn\u2019t make it to the top. Great views of Denali on a clear day.",
          "This was so great to look down on Anchorage. Walk the trails and play in the snow. Is a great place for couples and families.",
          "It's a beautiful place with several trails to choose from. We went on an early Sunday afternoon and although the parking lot was full, trails were not at all crowded and you can go at your own pace.",
          "There are many routes to the top and the weather can make for many changes in the challenges. It start as a wooded path with some steeper parts and finishes as a grind and rocky approach to the top. Wind is a constant at the top, but the view is terrific and feels well deserved.",
          "When I went to flattop it was quite a hike I thought it was just hiking, instead it was rock climbing at the end of it when my dad told me to be steady I stayed next to him the whole entire time it was scary I thought I was gonna fall!But no.When we got to the top we saw many",
          "You can\u2019t get up their with a rental mini van- sad. However big plus we did see two moose! It was a great drive even without reaching the top! So much for driving a rental mini van!",
          "This is a local hiking spot. It offers very good views out over Anchorage. It was a 15-20 minute drive from downtown but worth it. The trail is nicely maintained and used a lot by the locals.",
          "Close to town. Although a difficult climb for me, kids and hikers have no problem. The views are spectacular.",
          "Doing the trail in the winter is not easy, please be prepared with proper clothing and overall gear. Good footwear is a must. Trust me, the climb is definitely worth it. When you get to the top you get an amazing view of Anchorage and its surroundings (including Denali, weather",

          "This is every Anchoreageite's first \"moauntain climb\". It takes me just an hour to ascend, but you need to wear good footwear, bring raingear just case, water, and a camera because the views are magnificent. The last part is boulder climbing, harder down than up, but you don't",
          "Very steep - if you have a problem with heights don't go. Parts of this climb go straight up and you have to be careful and watch your footing. Beautiful view from the top if it's not rainy.",
          "We took a shuttle van from downtown after arriving at noon on the cruise train from Seward. Most of the trail is above the tree line with great views. Only he first portion is wooded with dwarf pine. We saw a giant bull moose lying below us in the forest! Difficulty is mild to",
          "A couple of trails to explore. One short and one longer one. Easy to get there and the vistas help you comprehend the layout of Anchorage.",
          "This hike was much more challenging than I thought it was. It probably didn't help that I haven't done much mountain hiking, so I didn't really know what to expect or came prepared. Had I known, I wouldn't have ran 2 miles right before!!! Just as we were about to make the trek",
          "Great hike, with superb views (if the weather is kind). The exposure near the top is high (risk of injury if fall) - you can continue on to higher peak if you have time and desire. I took the hike/bike shuttle from Downtown bike rentals.",
          "Instead of climbing Flattop the way most people do, our GPS had us enter from the backside, a new trail put in earlier in the year. It is 1.8 miles, gaining about 2000 feet, so it is not a beginners trail, but it is not very difficult. I heard from regular users that it is",

          "This is a reasonably long hike (took us 3.5 hours) that is close to Anchorage and is a good choice for those looking for a day hike. The last section is a rock scramble that can be scary or impassable for some as it requires climbing over rocks and crossing steep gravel patches.",
          "Though that is hardly to say \"the best\". It is steep in places and the scramble to the top requires some respect and caution. The reward is great views of the city, inlet, and powerline pass. Consider the Near Point hike as an alternative.",

          "The trail leading to the summit was scenic and beautiful. But would not recommend going during colder seasons or else wear winter jacket and good hiking shoes. Not recommended for the not physically fit. There is quite a few ups and downs on the trail. Once you get to the real",
          "Hiked / ran there this morning with 2 friends. Easy hike but end can be a bit tricky when it's icy and snowy which was the case today. If you are fit and a Ken hiker it is no problem, if not, need to be a bit careful towards the end. Views are excellent on Anchorage and Chugah",
          "First time that I ever went to Flattop, driving a stick shift, what a drive. Long curvy road, but view going up are worth it. The top of the mountain has a parking area and restrooms. Path's are pretty clear for walking with benches on the top to sit on. When you get to the",
          "Conquered this peak last memorial day 2016. There are many places to take breaks and the views were amazing. I went with a group of 5 that included 2 kids ages 8 and 9. Getting started up the trail there are 2 options that are clearly marked. Easy route sashays around 1/4",
          "It was icky weather. Very cold, & raining well I should say snowing since the rain turns to snow on the hike!!! All that being said, it was a blast. Gorgeous (hazy) view, no one else was on the trail. I read so many mixed reviews I wasn't expecting much but it didn't disappoint.",
          "It is worth the drive up indeed. Fantastic views of Anchorage. The climb to the saddle is easy. Worth your time!",
          "Easy walking trail once the snow melts, very friendly people and if you go far enough you can also get tasty low bush blueberries later in the summer.",
          "I had a long layover in Anchorage so a friend and I rented a car and drove up to Flattop to pass the time. I am sure glad we did, the view is awesome, we even spotted a couple black bear and moose. For such a short drive out of town this is totally worth it.",
          "We came up here twice, the first time there were very low clouds could not see much, did get to see a couple moose on the way up. Got to be in shape to go up to the top",
          "We came in May and there was quite a bit of snow on the mountain, so this made the final ascent to the summit a challenge. We're not super experienced hikers, but we found the majority of the climb to pretty easy. The trail is well marked and there are steps in some of the",
          "I've hiked Flat Top many times, in all seasons. Definitely would recommend for anyone visiting Anchorage and looking for an outdoor experience. It's a bit of a challenge to go to the top but there is a shorter loop with great views.",
          "Incredible view from the mountain top. It was cold and nearing twilight when we were there but it was a type of awesome that one rarely experiences. Feel the closeness to the heavens, smell clean fresh air, spread your arms out to feel the glory and majesty of this part of the",
          "Easy to find, close to town. I liked that there were trail options. I don't usually hike to get a view of a city so this was different for me. There was still quite a bit of snow & ice on the trail in early may.",
          "Flattop hike has two sections, the first is moderately easy, and the second section more difficult, but both lead to views that show you the entirety of Anchorage. If you are a more advanced hiker these trails lead to more difficult, back country hiking trails, This is a Must",
          "Views from the top are great. The climb was easy in the first mile. Quite brutal with the snow getting to the top but most rewarding. Best to bring layers because it does get chilly at the top. Optional items: ice axe for early spring hike, camping gear--would have been",
          "My wife and I enjoyed a great hike up the Flat Top Mountain Trail yesterday. There was still a bit of snow on part of the trail, especially near the top. Make sure you are ready for a challenging hike/climb to the top. You will certainly get a good workout! The views from the",
          "Flattop is a great day trip - it's strenuous, but not horrible. I'm 55 and still do it. We have a bulldog that managed the hike... It's a very satisfying hike, with an amazing view at the top, especially on a clear day. On hot summer days, there can be a little too much traffic",
          "This is a must-do trail if you're looking for an outdoor experience while visiting Anchorage. The hike is a bit demanding giving the incline, but the stunning views from the trail make it worthwhile.",
          "It is so beautiful, you see the whole city in front of you. On a clear day you can see all the way to Denali! There is a part where there is a short hike, or you can do the longer hike to the top of Flattop! I have not gone all the way up, but my 8 year old has! It is a tougher",
          "You don't find a much easier hike with views like this. Other than avoiding massive amounts of dog feces along the trail edges going up and back, this hike can practically be ran. There is a little hot of a climb at the top, hit each of the different peaks in the same go to",
          "I have hiked Flattop a few times. The last time was on a clear and sunny summer day. It takes around 4 hours roundtrip to summit the mountain and come back to the parking lot. Bring water and snacks.",
          "Very enjoyable hike that gets a bit rugged at the end as you near the top. Quite a bit of hiking traffic when I hiked in September and it gets quite cold at the top.",
          "This is a wonderful groomed trail up 4000 +- feet to the top of Flattop Mountain for a fantastically tantalizing view of Anchorage and beyond.",
          "Best hike close to town, with amazing views of the city and cook inlet. This hike does have a bit of a scramble at the top, but worth the effort.",
          "This probably the most popular Hike in the entire state and Anc Bowl. Great for all types and sizes. But incredible sunsets! Enjoy!",
          "Have not been to the top in years. But the view is very nice of Anchorage and all around. Best to go up Winter Solstice ( December 21) and Summer Solstice (June 21). Best time is in the summer. I think the trail is much more improved now, than it was years ago.",
          "Not a lot of place like this one. And if you are a Paraglider Pilot then its like your own backyard play park. Excellent views and different levels of hiking.",
          "Incredible walk. The \"steps\" presented on this steep trail can be challenging! I did not make it to the top, as a bit out of shape, but breathtaking views of Anchorage and the bay just the same!!!",
          "Excellent day trip of hiking and sight seeing. Breath taking view at the top. Keep eyes open, you never know what great creatures you will come upon.",
          "The trail up Flattop Mountain has been greatly improved over the years. It is a steep walk, but a safe walk wit an unbelievable reward at the top. Do lock your car and put valuables out of site.",
          "If you have time for only one hike in the Anchorage area, make it this one. Challenging but the views and overall experience are worth it!",
          "I arrived early and paid for the parking. I would consider the first part of the hike easy to moderate. The trail is in good shape. However, as I got higher up, and being the only one on the trail in that area, I found it hard to see where the trail was. I definitely got off",
          "Chanced upon this place while hunting for place to watch Aurora. At first we were reluctant to drive up Toilsome Hill Drive road because the road was slippery (although we were driving a 4WD). After some thoughts, we gave it a try and drive slowly on the icy road up the hill in",
          "It was a short trail with amazing views. I did it about 5 days after the first snow and no joke, almost the entire hike was icy and slippery. Once you get closer to the top, be careful because with enough snow, the trail is hard to find and you may have to climb a little. Once",
          "So many trails to take! Pay $5 to park in the State Park area, then watch the sun rise or set, hike a liitle or a lot to the top or further up powerline pass! Awesome views of the city and mountains",
          "Flattop Mountain is well marked hiking trail in vicinity of Anchorage (20 min drive from the downtown). The trail is easy to hike yet last couple of hundred meters might be challengable for small children and seniors. It is quite windy at the top. The view is awarding, worth of",
          "Or first of many hikes in Ak. The sun came out for a beautiful afternoon to get a sky high view of the city. A great intro. for 14 more days inAk.",
          "We did an impromptu hike of this trail after dinner, and was surprised at how popular it is even in the evening. The trail is pretty benign at lower levels, but the top of the trail was pretty gnarly. It was well worth being at the top near sunset, however....",
          "Very good hike, easy until near the top. Good view of Anchorage and the mountains behind Flat Top. Good for a science trip, for what a glacier does/did.",
          "I thoroughly enjoyed the climb up this mountain. We took the direct route straight up the mountain and not the winding path up the mountain. I wore comfortable shoes and NOT boots as the shoes gave me more ankle movement which allowed me to maneuver around the rocks better.",
          "It's very easy to get to and it's a pretty easy hike and the views make it definitely worth it! Take the time to go there. You won't regret it.",
          "A lot more strenuous that we thought. We are both experienced hikers but there was a lot of scrambling to get to the top. Highly recommend it if you have the stamina to get there.",
          "A hike near anchorage, this is one of them. I would recommend going on a clear day. We went on a foggy day or maybe we had low clouds. Never the less... It was still a nice hike. There are a couple different trails. Of course, one being to the mountain top. You can drive",
          "We were in Anchorage on a drizzly afternoon in late August and had heard great things about Flattop Mountain. We found directions online (they aren't obvious) and headed up to the parking lot area. There is plenty of parking, with a pass required (available from a nearby",
          "This has to be one of the most popular outings for locals and tourists alike. I took the return shuttle from the Downtown Bicycle Shop located along 4th Avenue. It cost around $23. They provide you with a map of the trail and drop you off at the foothill. The journey takes about",
          "If you want to do the simple hike along with 200 other tourist this hike is for you. Views are great but views are great everywhere in alaska",
          "IMPORTANT: there are 2 ways to get up to the top that I've discovered. If you use Google you're most likely to access it via Canyon Rd...and a difficult hourlong pull. The more usual access that has a more improved path starts around Glen Alps Trailhead and Toilsome Rd area.",
          "Beautiful trail with great views, unfortunately poorly maintained. Near the top trail is very challenging.",
          "Good hike, even though raining and did not have great view at top. Good workout, bit difficult near top for a newby as path paint marks not very visible, climbed my way to top. Wife stopped just below top, as she was not confident with footing/terrain. Can see why this would",
          "Highly recommended challenging hike/trek during a visit to Anchorage. Beautiful views of Cook Inlet and the city. Enjoyed a hike up at sunset. The scramble to the summit was fun for my teen daughters and made for a sense of accomplishment.",
          "My daughter and I hiked this trail together on a cloudy morning in June. The last 100 yards were a bit of a scary challenge, because it was almost vertical rock climbing, which means that the descent was primarily on one's bottom. I had confidence in my daughter's ability and",
          "The trail has many excellent views and is well maintained. We saw a moose on the road to the trailhead. WARNING, no parking for RVs in this area (we never saw a sign on the narrow road up) but there was none. My husband stayed in the vehicle and moved around while I hiked the",
          "We hiked this mountain which can be steep and rocky in places. This is not a hike for someone in flip flops. You need hiking boots, and walking sticks are helpful. there are some fairly steep parts of the trail too. But the view was worth it!",
          "Easy hike and GREAT views!! This is fairly easy and a lot of fun. Might not be the best hike for small children.",
          "I had an out of state friend visiting and we had a sunny evening, so after work we did the loop trail up Flat Top around Blueberry Hill. We could see the entire Cook Inlet basin and even Denali . This is a unique treasure no other cities have so near the city center .?",
          "We used the Flattop Mountain Shuttle to go out to the mountain. They leave you about 2.5-3 hours to go as far as you can on the trail. The first two-thirds is strenuous and does include some steep steps with railroad ties. My wife has a slight disability but she managed",
          "It's about 30mins drive from Anchorage, I was afraid hike up the mountain by myself in the beginning , but when I arrived, there were many people there, kids, dogs. The view is amazing, overlook the Anchorage downtown area near by the parking lot, when you hike up, clouds were",
          "The view is worth the drive. Look for the State Park \"brown\" direction signs starting on O'Malley at Hillside. There are two short paths, paved and gravel. The view is 360 degrees. We came the end of August so we were able to see some of the fall colors of the tundra. Make",
          "This was a wonderful time. The trails mostly up were good, but the last 1/2 mile was not a good go for most people. We had many people say that you really need to take water and have climbing shoes. We were also told by a professional climber that people have gotten into",
          "Easy to find, close to town and a great, quick workout. The hand-over-hand scramble to the top requires a three points of contact stance.",
          "Excellent quick hike, technical finish, great views from up top. Also a great prelude to more elaborate hikes, as several trails pass through the flat top summit and continue from there on.",
          "A great hike! Not too difficult until the very top when the trail disappears and it becomes a rock scramble to the top.",
          "If I lived in Anchorage I'd definitely be hiking the Flat Top Mountain Trail for my daily exercise. A short drive out of town brings you to the parking lot where one can get out and see the panoramic view of Cook Inlet and Anchorage. On clear days you can see Denali. The trail",
          "I've hiked up to the top of Flattop numerous times. It's one of my favorite hikes in the Anchorage area, giving you panoramic views of the city of Anchorage (the Anchorage bowl), Cook Inlet, and the mountains beyond in all directions, including Denali way up north. The trail",
          "Let me be upfront and state that due to physical limitations compounded by laziness, I have not actually done this climb. That said, the comments are those of multitudes of friends who do it at least once a year somewhat as a ritual because (they say) it is easy enough for",
          "We went here on a beautiful summer afternoon. The views over the city of Anchorage and Cook Inlet are spectacular. We did not go all the way up as it was very windy and we were pressed for time but even from the base parking lot level you have great views. This trail is not as",
          "Spent the afternoon hiking Flattop. Beautiful views on the way up and most certainly at the top. We only had one day in Anchorage and this gave us great views of the city. Great afternoon of hiking. Public restrooms at the parking lot before you start your hike.",
          "For the average joe this would be a real workout. Bring plenty of water, some snacks, decent clothing for all temperatures and good hiking shoes. Can get away with runners although they will get smashed a little. Views up the top are amazing the trail is easy to follow. Just",

          "This is 15 minute drive from Anchorage, easy to find, easy to park, multiple trail options leading to the summit of Flat Mountain about 3-4 miles in and out. Easy for experienced hikers, but last part is a short scramble up the last 300-400' of elevation gain that will require",
          "A must do for most nature lovers that visit Alaska. We were able to trek up the slope right up to the summit. We did not summit though as the last leg of the trail above 2nd saddle is a bit hard. Lovely views of downtown Anchorage. Lots of blueberry picking opportunities.",
          "My wife and I took our 7 kids age 6-16 on this hike. They all made it. My 6 year old is a runner and climber though. Be prepared for a rock scramble at the top. If there was a dedicated trail at the end, it's been camouflaged by all the other trails created. Just pick your",

          "It is not a difficult climb - takes a few hours. I've climbed much harder, but when I was younger. Quads burned on the way down. The views are what you would expect for Alaska - nice! You will definitely enjoy the scenic views. Wear good shoes (not tennis), bring a poncho, and",

          "We only went a short way up the mountain but was enjoyed the view from the viewing platform near the Parking Lot. $5 to park for the day. Bathrooms available. Not too crowded. Easy drive.",
          "Nice hike even in the rain, the first two thirds was mild but the last was hands and feet kind of climb but was worth it.",
          "Hailing from a flat city at sea level, even as a fairly fit person, this hike does get a bit challenging - especially near the top, where you are scrambling over rocks and looking for footholes - but it is worth it for the beautiful views. Since the top of the mountain is flat,",
          "This was a difficult hike that was especially strenuous at the end, but the views were completely worth it. It's a little difficult to track where you are because of the lack of signage. The first hill you reach is the Blueberry Knoll, and you continue on up the side of the",
          "Wow this was a great start to our alaskan adventure. The climb to the summit is tough and the way down can be dangerous. Definitely not for children. You should be at least somewhat fit to reach the summit. Very windy at the top. You will not regret making it to the top. It is",
          "Life changing. My 1st time on a mountain. One day away from work and ut was worth every minute. ALASKA IS BEAUTIFUL",
          "My wife and I selected an early arrival into Anchorage just so we could have plenty of time to do this trail. I planned accordingly thanks to TripAdvisor, but there are some things reviews do not prepare you for, like the last part of the trail! Most of the trail is easy enough,",
          "Great hike. It is somewhat steep at times, the top is made of large rocks with no trail, you just need to make your way up the rocks as best you can. Not great for dogs or smaller children. There are a few places to stop and view if you don't want to go all the way to the top.",
          "My children are all 10 & under and although we enjoyed the spectacular views, they weren't keen on hiking/walking. It was breezy when we went so that may have been part of it.",
          "This is an extreme hike with trails, snow, rocks, boulders etc. But amazing if you are up to it. You will see wildlife so be careful...be smart. The view at the top is spectacular! An all day event.",
          "Tough hike! Maybe too many dogs. I love dogs, but it seems like a lot of stress on the natural critters.",

          "I was just here today. It rained briefly but cleared up within an hour and there were blue skies for great pictures, just bring a coat if rain is expected and you should be fine. There is also wind so a coat is a good idea regardless of rain anyway. Also, bring water, I did",

          "I didn't spend a lot of time reading the reviews of other folks before going on this trip (or otherwise for that matter). Bottom-line, I wasn't expecting much, but thought it would be a good way to spend some time and get a little exercise on our last day in Anchorage before",
          "If you just want some great pictures you won't have to walk too far. It's just a hope skip and a jump and you'll have your Kodak moment. If you want to hike and explore just make sure you are bear aware. The trail is paved in some parts and the rest is gravel. If it's winter and",

          "A place for gorgeous views, wild life viewing, and if you're up to it....great hiking! We drove up to the trail head and just off the parking lot...without any hiking required...we were able to take in spectacular views of Cook Inlet, the Anchorage skyline, and Denali! But the",

          "This is a little hard to find, but a good GPS will get you there. The drive up is interesting, seeing as its a neighborhood. The 1/2 mile trail is paved and comfortable with great views of the Anchorage bowl and on a clear day, Denali. The hike to flat top is strenuous,",

          "I'm in good physical condition so while the hike had some steep areas on the whole it was very manageable. The first 2/3 of the hike while requiring effort is manageable with just your feet. The last few hundred yards is a rock scramble to the top and you need to carefully",

          "Great little hike but be wary to get to the top is not for the faint of heart. It is a scramble to get to the top other than that quick jaunt from Anchorage well worth the visit.",

          "Great trail, it was not easy but definitely worth the effort. Beautiful views!",
          "Great iconic hike, but lacks the upkeep I feel the $5 cover charge asks for. If you are going to make stairs into a hike they must be updated as needed or removed. \nOn another note, the feeling you get reaching the flag pole at the top is \u2026",

          "Plan your visit accordingly, parking fills rapidly. Dress in layers, and don't forget essentials depending on time of visit. Ice cleats, sunscreen, water, sunglasses, etc. Nice views, but some days haze may obscure views across Cook Inlet, and other areas.  Be prepared for the traffic on the road, which seems narrow in spots.",

          "First time up there fun!!!!",
          "Joined the conga line up and down for a great view of Anchorage.  2,000 feet up in a bit over a mile makes for a stiff pace but it was all worthwhile.    A bit of a scramble at the top cut down the number of people.",
          "Amazing hike, can go all the way to the top or stop a bit short if you don't feel like going up the loose rocks. Dogs made it up to the very top fairly easy.",
          "Fantastic views of Anchorage!",
          "Excellent viewing from the top if you can get a clear day. The issue is getting off the Flattop. \nInvigorating climb. The last 10% of the trail is extremely poorly marked, causing a random scramble down the mountain until almost the  2nd plateau.",
          "Overall great experience even for beginners. Caution about the very slippery, dry dirt and rocks. I made about 50-70 ft from the top and had a panic attack and could have fell when I ended up near a steep edge with very slippery dirt that lead to a drop off. Stay on the larger, stable rocks even if they look steeper then the dirt.",
          "Calm & senic place",

          "Hike was meh.  Was a little disappointed that I could not see Russia from the top.  Phone died halfway up and couldn\u2019t believe there wasn\u2019t a charging station at the top.  A soda machine at the top would really help out too.  And an ATM machine for the soda machine.  Or \u201cpop\u201d machine if you\u2019re from one of those weird states",
          "B-E-A-UTIFUL Sunset at Flat top",
          "This is a great trail system.  Really gorgeous views of Anchorage, Denali and Turnagain Arm!",
          "Slightly difficult, but so worth it! Watch your step going up and down the rock face. Look for faded orange dots for trail guidance. Enjoy!",
          "I like it. Took my whole family. There are paths for both little kids and grown ups. I took my one year old. We didn't make it to the top but there is a smaller trail. Also went with my 9 year old we made it to the top.",
          "Come here for a great hike and a Beautiful view.",
          "Well maintained trail with great views of the city.  There were a lot of people on the trail many with dogs, and younger children.  There are several steep sections but you can also stop and rest along the way as needed",

          "Cold...but beautiful",
          "Great hike. It is short for a hike but gets steep. Towards the top it is definitely a hands on climb. Going all the way to the top is not appropriate for children under seven unless one goes slowly and helps them along with a strong climber \u2026",
          "Made it a third of the way on the trail with a 2 y/o and 7 m/o in tow. Worth it. Plus there's alot of crowberries along the way.",

          "This was a great activity. It is very organized and so much to see! Even in the \"off\" season we found it to be very interesting. Especially loved the Junior Master Gardener plot!",
          "Loved the differently designed gardens. Although many of the plants were in their fall dress...there was still joy to be had meandering along the path. I particularly enjoyed the massive stone container rock garden. These gardens are intertwined with the natural woodland",
          "I have always enjoyed botanical gardens and this place isn't any different. I was actually doing a whereigo cache where it guides you through the area and asks you questions. It is nice to do sometimes. Entrance fee was minimal but these always help to support the gardens so",
          "Do not visit these gardens if you are expecting to see well groomed massive flowerbeds. These are working gardens that exist in a climate that is difficult to garden in. My son and I found them to be groomed but not with huge lawns. There were numerous very interesting plants.",
          "We had read a review saying this was \"small\" but my husband and I spent about an hour and a half walking around the garden/woods area. We did not walk the entire garden but it was worth at least 100 of our pictures we took! It is later in the season for them but they still have",
          "My wife and I visited the Alaska Botanical Gardens on our recent visit to Anchorage. We have visited many many Bot Gardens around the world as my wife is a Horticulturist and has an obvious interest in gardens. We were extremely disappointed in these. Basically, the first 100",
          "We had some extra time today and wanted to spend it outside. It was a good choice to come to the Botanic gardens. Even though it is getting late in the season. We saw beautiful flowers in bloom . It was clear that they have a really good selection of peonies which have all",
          "It is obvious the garden is tended by staff who are enthusiastic about local plants. The 1/2 mile pathway takes you through a peaceful walk, punctuated by moderately sized groupings of local plants. It is a good way to spend an hour or two, out in a natural setting.",
          "Are you interested in plants? This is a well cared for woodland garden in Anchorage. Your modest donation to this nonprofit gets you into rock, peony, herb and educational veggie gardens. There are many native plants. They are even labeled! Amy did a great job answering all my",
          "In this often wet and frigid climate, it's amazing that such beautiful flowers grows in such abundance. Tended by proud volunteers, the Botanical Garden is worth a visit.",
          "Beautiful gardens, well maintained. Staff were all very friendly and informative. Nice way to spend 2 to 4 hours",
          "The Alaska Botanical Garden is a community garden maintained by a small staff and a lot of volunteers. It features perennial flower beds, a heritage garden showcasing what Anchorage's gardeners were growing 100 years ago, an herb garden, a rock garden. There is a half mile",
          "I've lived in Alaska all my life and I enjoy photography a lot and I decided to check out the botanical gardens and I loved every moment of it!",
          "The garden is gorgeous in a natural setting and includes many very unique art structures, hypertufa troughs with creative plantings, wildflowers, rock gardens, herb gardens in boxes with flowers, etc. The garden is supported by the community and we really enjoyed the junior",
          "The Garden was in full bloom when we visited last week. Gardens are well kept and labeled. I used to live in Anchorage and was on the Board for ABG so have watched this grow from one pathway to the education entity it is today. It's great to see Alaska-specific plants and learn",
          "Loved the fact that everything was labeled. It's given me some ideas for my own gardens. The bathrooms could be a lot better though.",
          "I'm the first to admit I'm a plant person. I like gardening and looking at plants. This place certainly has plenty of plants. I don't know how it is in the long winters Anchorage has, but it is gorgeous in the winter. It really gives you an idea of what gardening up north is",
          "We visited the Alaska Botanical Garden on a trip to Anchorage in July. The flowers were spectacular. The landscaping set into the natural surroundings was so relaxing and beautiful. I loved the herb garden and the old pick up truck that had squash growing in its bed. The",
          "We had extra time so we went to the Alaska Botanical Gardens. We walk the trails and view of the many plants, flowers. Not to share you we when on the trails that the Botanical Gardens warn people of possible bear encounters and sure enough we encounter a large Black Bear. We",
          "I think maybe it was our mistake but we went at the very beginning of June and there was not much to see. Especially for $12 admission we spent less than an hour. Bring bug spray! We got attacked by mosquitos the entire time. Only porta-potties available and no food or drink.",
          "I took my kids last summer,they loved it. The grounds are great for a light walk,and the flowers are so beautiful with all the sun they get here. You can smell them without even putting your nose to them. The colors are so vibrant. I love the herb garden too.",
          "We visited the Botanical Garden our first day in Anchorage! The greenery is amazing! Love the different species of flowers and what a cute idea to put a vegetable garden in the truck bed! Cute!",
          "One of my favorite things to do is to take pictures of plants (is that weird?), and this is a great place to do so. Nothing out of the ordinary, but a great place for a stroll and to see a variety of flowers, ferns, trees, vegetables, and many other types of plant life. They",
          "Well laid out. I think it's an asset to the community. The volunteers have really done a great job. They have special pricing for non residents which I feel is too high for what we were able to take in.",
          "The botanical garden was a pleasant surprise and a nice way to unwind as we were winding down our vacation. The plants were spectacular, particularly from the size aspect. Everything was 50% to 200% larger than what we can grow in our garden in Nevada.",
          "Quick visit to the garden revealed a rich collection of temperate climate staples as well as some surprises. Campbell airstrip trails are just a few minutes' drive away. Well worth the time after driving to the garden.",
          "The parking is not so good but there is a strip mall parking lot less than 3 blocks away. The walking tour is of moderate difficulty. The pathways are wide enough for wheelchairs and walkers/canes. There is a very wide range of native plants, mushrooms (after a rain) and",
          "I went here on a cloudy day and I can see that it would be very nice on a sunny day. The garden it self is very large. The path through the garden is paved and easy to travel. There are trails that lead out of the garden to the surrounding hills, so you could spend all day here.",
          "This is a paid entry garden, with improvements being made. There is a paved path through the main part, with an unpaved trail that loops through the forest by a creek.",
          "I have visited several times. I love to search the garden to find different flower to photograph. There is a great variety and the gardens are very well maintained. You might even are a black bear wander through the area so keep I out for one and make noise. It is not close",
          "You never think flowers for Alaska just snow... LOL! But it is a beautiful garden, a lot of locals come her to relax, read and just enjoy the scenery but completely safe for tourists. Price not to bad, has great hours to visit and keep up very well. It only takes 2 hours to see",
          "I am not making this a negative review but I can't make it a glowing one, either. This botanical garden was okay but not among the best. That could be due to the short growing season. There were a lot of plants native to the area but nothing really spectacular. Not a lot of",
          "I've visited a number of botanical gardens in the U.S. and internationally. This was among the least impressive. $12 entrance fee/person for adult, with discounts for seniors, etc. I didn't feel the cost was unreasonable for a gardens (actually, relatively inexpensive).",
          "I unexpectedly stumbled across the garden one sunny July morning. Not only a feast for the eyes but the air was scented by the lush plantings. Lots of interesting garden nooks off a paved walking circuit and mulched walking tracks through the woods. What a treat.",
          "We love botanical gardens, and have been to many across the country. Alaska's gardens are very beautiful! It's amazing to me that they can grow these beautiful plants and flowers in such a short growing time. This is a great way to spend an afternoon in Anchorage.",
          "Interesting array of flowers but beware of bears\ud83d\udc3b should stay maybe less than an hour to walk through. Make sure u don't miss sign to left where gardens are. Some parking lot as a high school",
          "Simple with rural quality and gracious hosts. Beautiful flowers and nature trail by water. Not crowded.",
          "When visiting Anchorage for a couple of days after a week in the bush, I found this to be a hidden jewel. It was inexpensive and beautiful. Mostly paved or easy gravel paths. Lovely flowers, great displays. A great way to spend a couple of hours.",
          "If you want to just relax to a wonderful smell and beauty then this is the place to visit it has a charm that is simply to die for.",
          "Quite possibly not your usual botanical gardens if you are used to Sydney, Singapore or Paris, but the Anchorage one has lots of Alaskan natives and is well laid out. Certainly worth a visit if you have a spare hour or so.",
          "'Trails closed due to bear activity' is not a normal occurrence in a botanical garden. But this is Alaska and normality is relative. The range of sub arctic species on display is impressive and a sense of peace and calm prevails.",
          "Our botanical gardens at home are bigger and have more attractions - but they are not displaying the beautiful flower that grow twice as big in Alaska - if it is your first time to AK and you have time stop by.",
          "We spent our last afternoon in Alaska strolling in the botanical garden and then sitting in the herb garden listening to a quartet of flute and recorders playing classical music. What a chamber concert (which was free). The garden includes wooded paths where you can get a good",

          "Disappointed to see entry fee of $12 - should be subsidised by Parks and Recreation. We had to make our way here by bus which took about 30mins and return got a taxi costing about $20. Saw plenty of wildflowers on the walk there from bus stop, even some of the locals had never",
          "Such a beautiful, peaceful, serene garden & woods! So educational & learned a lot while walking thru the 1/2 mile trail. My friend from Montana & I enjoyed it so much, & took many pictures! Definitely recommend visiting the Alaska Botanical Garden.",
          "This attraction certainly isn't of the class of some botanical gardens in large cities in the lower 48, but it's not too shabby for Alaska. The only restrooms are porta potties, in case that is of concern to you. They've really done an excellent job of labeling the plants and",
          "This garden really demonstrates just how much variety Alaskan gardeners can grow. The herb, perennial, rock, wildflower and heritage gardens were all just lovely in mid-June. Casual garden walkers can tour the entire place in an hour; more committed plant people could take 3.",
          "Not much to see at the time of our visit, they seem to be geared up for more visitors after Memorial Day Weekend so check website when you are planning to trsvel",
          "After shopping thought a nice stroll around the gardens. Yes lots of flowers, shrubs etc but did not take that long to get around actual gardens. One can venture out further than the fence but beware Bears.",
          "We happened to get here when they were having a plant sale so the gardens were free! We enjoyed the shaded walks since it was a bright sunny and warm day. I especially appreciated all the labels since there were quite a few plants we did not recognize. There are benches paced",
          "Just a beautiful garden it takes about an hour to walk through, there is a lot to see. Because of the 20 hour days the plants are large and vibrant. If you like flowers this place to stop. Also has a small gift shop with some unusual gifts.",
          "This garden is beautifully laid out with gardens nestled in the woods. I highly recommend it! It has a paved loop, a nature trail, wild flowers and a really cool rock garden. Bring your camera and get close. You will get amazing shots. In 2016, they are having a photography",
          "I am a new member and live the peacefulness if the gardens. Not your typical botanical gardens Alaska style. Great knowledgeable staff. Worth the visit",
          "We visited the garden early in the second week of May before very much had sprouted/bloomed. The sheer volume of the collection of plants was impressive but due to the earliness of the season it could not be enjoyed to the fullest.",
          "You feel transported to paradise. Such a variety of trees and flowers, many visitors, nice gift shop. A must to see.",
          "I love the mixture of native plants, beautiful flowers, herbs, and peaceful atmosphere! If you love leisurely walks among a variety of plants, this is perfect! Late June through August would be the best time to go for the most flowers in bloom.",
          "These gardens are a wonderful place to take your family. They offer an amazing variety of plants and trees. You will not believe what variety we have. I have gone here with my wife many times over many years. There are many trails with only some accessible to disabilities but",
          "The perfect place for locals to bring visitors from outside. It is beautiful. Gardens on the edge of the Alaskan wilderness. Check it out.",
          "This is a must see if you are visiting Anchorage. It is a small gem located in a large city. We have visited many botanical gardens in our travels throughout the US but this one was so well maintained and the plants so well identified. All of the guides were most helpful and",
          "Love botanical gardens, and this one was excellent. Didn't expect to see beautiful flowers and plants in late September, but this beautifully kept garden exceeded our expectations. Took many close ups of the blooming flowers and beautiful vegetables. Very nice paved walkways,",
          "We have a great interest in plants, so this was high up on our list. We arrived early in the morning and had the place mostly to ourselves. The worker gave us a map and great briefing about the different areas. There are many native species, as well as exotics and decorative",
          "I really would call it a botanical garden. It looks more like a really cosy and well kept park. However, it is a bit far away from the city center and is not worth a special ride. But if you happen to find yourself in the area, you can relax in this garden, for it is super",
          "I have lived in AK for almost 20 years, but had never before visited the gardens. It was worth the 1 hr drive. The best part is the Heritage Garden, developed with local seeds from statehood and before. The walkways are beautiful and add to the peaceful nature of the garden.",
          "As the other reviews note, this is a very pleasant place, even late in the season. Easy paved walkway. $8 per senior. Only port-a-potties. But the sign is on the left side of the road below a large sign for a secondary school and we missed it, driving to the end of the park.",
          "Lots of flowers, short trails. I went for \"Beer in the Garden\" and enjoyed listening to music and sampling beer as I walked the trails. Milt toe off the beaten path but worth a visit if you like gardens...after all you're in Alaska! Be surprised by all the grows here!",
          "One morning we drove out to the Alaska Botanical Garden. While it's not a great arboretum, we enjoyed walking the grounds and looking at the native plants and trees. As it happens, our hometown arboretum (the North Carolina Arboretum in Asheville) has a reciprocal arrangement",
          "I wouldn't call this a must see, but it was certainly a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. Not too pricey, a recommended donation on the honor system. The flowers were beautiful, but not the best botanical gardens we've seen.",
          "A nice place to visit during summer. the variety of flora is good. I love their flowers. I would come back here",
          "We visited the gardens on a beautiful sunny afternoon. Because it was mid August a lot of the flowers had already bloomed. Even so there were things in bloom and the herb garden was lovely. I enjoyed walking around and the gardens are nicely groomed and labeled. The walk was",
          "Very well maintained garden. Loved their fkiwers and veggies. Black and red currant bushes! Very pretty walk.",
          "We went for a free day. It was enjoyable enough. But I wasn't super impressed when I went in June. I'm guessing it's hard to keep beautiful flowers when it was icy just a month prior.",
          "Yeah it's way out from downtown and it's by no means the wild. What it is, is a local garden with lots of trails to wander. Lots of flowers to enjoy. Very relaxing. Very nontourist but local.",
          "This is a lovely spot. One of the smallest botanical gardens I have been to but very worth it. They do a wonderful job. Usually quite a few mosquitos so I would recommend bug spray as the location is higher up the mountain with woods. They really appreciate donations upon",
          "The gardens are evolving every time I go. They are peaceful and beautiful with artful plantings. For Anchorage's centennial celebration, there is a new heritage garden. Pioneers and old books were consulted about what was grown in the early days. The long summer days but",
          "A true botanical experience, don't expect manicured gardens but do expect beautiful local flora - especially in the summer. Wish there were real restrooms - not a fan of port-a-potties when I pay admission. Don't miss the partially off-premises Lowenfel trail.",
          "My husband and I recently visited the garden with our 6 year old grandson. We absolutely loved it, so quiet and pleasant. Everyone on staff was so friendly and answered our questions. The entire garden was well laid out and nicely kept. While I didn't expect our grandson to be",
          "Lots of local plants well marked to learn. There are lots of easy trails no more than 1 mile long. Part of the trails go in the woods behind the gardens and crosses the Idirod trail.",
          "I make it to the botanic gardens about once each summer. While the entry fee is steep ($10), the gardens are beautiful and lots of infrastructure building and planting is obviously ongoing. The entire garden is now enclosed with moose fencing and many of the paths are paved,",
          "We are real lovers of botanical gardens, and came to this one with high hopes after reading some positive reviews. And to be honest, I'm sure it deserves them- but not in early June. We just saw loads of leaves, that I'm sure would produce spectacular blooms in a few more weeks.",
          "This is my 2nd visit. My previous visit was this past August 2014. Comparatively, last August was incredible and this past Thursday's visit was a little diappointing. I was told that the season to come back would be the end if May or beginning of June for the peonies to be in",
          "If you want to see a wonderful collection of native plants and plants that survive the climate and light factor of the north this is the place. I call it a hidden treasure since it provide a nice walk thru a forested area located in north Anchorage. I would estimate it would",
          "Low snow load this year and it will be interesting to see how that works for the Botanical Gardens. They are enjoyable to visit all the time and it is still too early to see much there but the layout is nice just to walk around. Towards the mountains and you want to wear nice",
          "Right here goes, yes it's April and out of season, but this attraction is posted as a year round attraction. At the entrance there is a \"please pay admission here\" box, so doing the right thing we paid and entered thinking there were gonna be greenhouses with local flowers and",
          "We really enjoyed our visit to the Botanical Gardens. Almost every plant was labeled & the staff was helpful answering questions we had about the plants. Good wide walk ways. We didn't take advantage of it but you could hike to Campbell Creek that was on the property. I would",
          "At the end of a two week vacation, we decided to check out the Botanical Garden. Even though it is not the best garden I have seen, it was beautiful. Well worth the price of admission. I would go back if I was in the area and had some time to kill.",
          "It's real beautiful. They've expanded the place with a bunch of sections and you get a good walking experience with the opportunity to get into woods too.",
          "This gem is hidden from view. We had always wanted to visit this site but kept missing it. We parked in the school lot next door. Walked past a bear/moose fence and were greeted by a friendly host. We wandered around for hours, looking at native and exotic plants. Because of",
          "It is a small place with beautiful flowers, pleasant staff and a nice walking path and benches for a relaxing moment. I would recommend the visit if you have a moment to take in the fresh air.",
          "The botanical gardens provide the visitor with a different view of what you'd expect in Alaska. The gardens are sectioned off and the amount of flowers is totally unexpected. If you are a gardener, this is a must visit.",
          "I was pleased with my visit to the Gardens. I have lived in Anchorage for 37 years and didn't realize this little gem was here. The staff were wonderful and their passion for gardens was showcased throughout. I left there feeling at peace and then trying to find an excuse to go",
          "Kind of a let down... We found enough interesting stuff to look at, but it certainly wasn't the feast for our eyes and senses we were hoping for... Especially after seeing some amazing landscaping with vibrant flowers at many of our other stops in Alaska. Maybe our donation will",
          "I was in Anchorage last week and l went to visit this park. Is absolutely wonderful. You really going to have a great impression!! Is located 30 mins from downtown. if you love nature, this is for you! Special thank you to the Russian lady in the Main entrance!!",
          "Be sure to visit the Alaska Botanical Garden when you go to Anchorage, for an education in the plants of Alaska, and for a moment of perfect peace. The pathways invite you to amble through forest and flowers, the shop displays seeds and garden inessentials, and they purvey",

          "I love gardens (having a black thumb myself, I find that I prefer to see and photograph pretty flowers instead). Being accustomed to the larger botanical garden and greenhouses near my home on the east coast, I had expected the place to be larger. And while beautiful, I had",
          "We went with another couple for the daily 1:00 guided tour and enjoyed it thoroughly. The trail begins in a beautiful Alaskan forest with spruce and birch, aspen, alder and lots of ferns and mosses; continues through a couple of formal flower gardens, an herb garden and a",
          "I liked it but it is a small little garden and, had I known of its limitations before hand, I would have chosen to spend my time better. (Although, in Fairbanks, that is a problem). In any event, the sun was out (only day in two weeks), the weather was warm and the herb gardens",
          "Time in the woods and beautiful garden \"rooms\" at this botanical garden--great way to what can be grown in this part of Alaska. The peonies -- wow! Lovely herb garden, rock gardens.",

          "My mom and I had the opportunity to visit the Alaska Botanical Garden in Anchorage. The flowers, foliage, and grounds were beautiful... We were a little disappointed that there wasn't more diversity in the type of flowers/greenery and that the garden wasn't larger.",
          "I was looking forward to walking around here, but it was pretty disappointing. I've gotten much more enjoyment walking around the Anchorage Zoo, which is in a beautiful setting with better paths. There really wasn't much to see, and the layout wasn't the greatest. I know it's",

          "Make sure you go late enough in the year for plants to be up and flowers out. We went on May 28 this year and hardly any flowers were out. It is devoted mainly to plants native to or suitable for Alaska. Everything is well labelled. Be sure to bring bug spray, you WILL need it",
          "This garden area is part of the Botanical Society's national circuit. It offers the uniqueness of plants that can be planted in Anchorage. But is also affords a walk thru nature. It is easily accessible off Tudor road. I have visited other Botanical Gardens in other states.",

          "We always visit botanical gardens when in a new city. The parking lot is shared with a high school which was confusing at first. Also, they have a huge gate across the entrance which makes it look closed. It's there to keep the moose out, but there's a side door you can use",
          "110 acres of natural, native foliage with 3 (?) designed gardens awaited me late in the season. A couple of the gardens were under construction. With the majority of the flowering plants done I enjoyed the native plants and just the amble through the grounds. They had a small",

          "great visit option while waiting on your flight... took a bunch of great flower photos, and was easy to get over to the airport afterwards. I've been to more elaborate gardens before, but this one was easy and quick to get in/out, just what we wanted .",

          "Definetly worth the time. They ask for a $5 donation. You can spend almost 2 hours exploring the place",
          "I loved going here. Then plants were beautiful and they had a wide variety of different species. It is a must to go here.",
          "This is a wonderful place to visit. A variety of flowers, herbs, and wild plants to look at, most of them labeled. There are several little areas along the trail to explore. Had my wedding here in the circular area and I was happy with their accomodations for it.",
          "We had a few hours to fill before leaving Anchorage and decided to go to the Botanical garden, it was a great idea. I have not seen such a nice garden in a long time and the nice thing about it is all the hiking you can do between the different gardens. It is well worth a couple",

        "wiki": "Akimiski Island is the largest island in James Bay (a southeasterly extension of Hudson Bay), Canada, which is part of the Qikiqtaaluk Region of the territory of Nunavut. It has an area of 3,001 km2 (1,159 sq mi), making it the 163rd largest island in the world, and Canada's 29th largest island. Akimiski Island is only 19 km (12 mi) from the province of Ontario. From the western side of the island, one can see the Ontario coastline.\nThe island's name is Cree for \"land across the water\".The island has no year-round human inhabitants; however, it is part of the Attawapiskat First Nation's traditional territory and is frequently used for traditional purposes. The surface of Akimiski is flat and slopes gradually to the north. Most of the vegetation that covers the island consists of lichen, moss, sedges, and dwarf black spruce. The island is a coastal wetland that includes mudflats, tidal marshes, and tidal mudflats. Freshwater streams that flow into southwestern James Bay carry sediments and abundant nutrients that help to sustain the productive waterfowl habitat around Akimiski Island.\n\nThe Akimiski Island Group includes Akimiski, Gasket, and Gullery Islands; Albert Shoal; and the Akimiski Strait Isles.\n\n\n== Climate ==\n\nMean annual temperature: 2.5 \u00b0C (36.5 \u00b0F)\nAverage rainfall: 450 mm (17.72 in)\nAverage snowfall: 250 mm (9.84 in)\n\n\n== Conservation ==\n\nAkimiski Island is a Canadian Important Bird Area, site #NU036 (53\u00b010\u203212\u2033N 081\u00b019\u203248\u2033W). Its eastern portion is also a federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary, and much of the coastline is a Key Migratory Bird Terrestrial Habitat site.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\nThe coastal waters and wetlands of Akimiski Island (and James Bay in general) are important feeding grounds for many varieties of migratory birds. Notable species include:\nAtlantic brant\nCanada goose\nLesser snow goose\nMarbled godwit\nSemipalmated sandpiperJames Bay and Hudson Bay are funnel-shaped and consequently cause migrating birds from the Arctic to concentrate in this area. During fall migration, there is an abundance of birds when adults and young are present. In the springtime, the birds tend to reside in the southern areas of James Bay until the northern section thaws.\nAmong mammals, ringed seals, polar bears, and beluga whales can be found in the area.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nNASA Photo : \"STS085-713-070 Akimiski Island, Northwest Territory, Canada August 1997 Akimiski Island, a 2000-square-mile (5180 square kilometers) uninhabited island, is the largest island in James Bay (a southeasterly extension of Hudson Bay).\"",

          "This was a very easy nature walk on a boardwalk to view the Marsh and the birds. Pleasant stop to take a short break if traveling for a long distance.",
          "We stopped at the Potter Marsh Bird Sanctuary to watch for wildlife. The wooden walkways are elevated and in very good condition. We saw a moose and several species of birds while there. The only worry we had was the ease on entrance onto the walkways which would allow wildlife",
          "The boardwalk was good with good spots to see birds. There is a running tally of what has been seen in the area to help with possible sightings. Nice spot to spend sometime.",
          "Well maintained boardwalk with benches, informative plaques and telescopes. Large parking lot. Beautiful views. Not many birds to see during our walk. Restroom on site.",
          "Easy stop and great birding. There is parking and restrooms. This path is an elevated deck that winds through the marsh. We saw lots of birds and enjoyed the beautiful scenery. A juvenile bald eagle flew right over my head and landed in a nearby tree. We watched it as a",
          "Great boardwalk location for viewing wildlife and birdlife. There is some great viewing platforms with binoculars for the best sightings.",
          "With convenient parking and an easy-to-navigate boardwalk, Potter Marsh is a pleasant place for a casual stroll, but its location on the North American flyway makes it a prime spot to see migrating birds in season. Bring binoculars.",
          "Lots of elevated Boardwalks to walk on. Saw lots of birds, including several Herons. Saw hundreds, if not thousands of Salmon in a small creek.",
          "We visited on a sunny day in September. There were not many birds at the time, but we saw salmon. It is easily accessible by car from Seward Hwy and with wheelchair. There are binoculars located at multiple points and also at wheelchair height. It is a nice place to visit.",
          "Pleasant spot to view the local birdlife. Well laid out with plenty of nice flat boardwalk to stroll around on. Worth a visit.",
          "We enjoyed our walk along the boardwalk looking for birds. We saw a few ducks, but nothing else. There was a note that bald eagles had been spotted the day before. Regardless, it was a pleasant way to spend some time outdoors.",
          "You can enjoy a nice walk along it's many boardwalks but the wildlife viewing is seasonal i.e. if you catch the bird migrations at the right time you can enjoy the viewing. Time of day will also make a difference. The park has plenty of spaces, restrooms and free viewing",
          "I thought I would see more birds in the first week of August. Place was not worth the stop at the time I did but maybe better at other times.",
          "We stopped on evening as we arrived in Anchorage in the middle of August. We saw salmon swimming in the waters and several types of birds around the area, too. The boardwalk makes walking and animal viewing very easy. We didn't spend a ton of time here, but could see on the",
          "There are a number of boardwalks over the marsh and the walking was pleasant. Unfortunately on the day we visited it appears the birds decided to spend time elsewhere. Such is the luck with trying to view any wildlife, you never know when they'll appear. The boardwalk also went",
          "A nice place to watch Alaska coastal birds, a lot of tern, goose, seagulls. I spent a day here and took a lot of nice pictures.",
          "Easy walk around boardwalks with varied views over the marshes and several boards with wildlife info. Great early morning and you would get more birds at other times of the year. Could only be improved if someone started up a coffee cart in the car Park!!",
          "Potter Marsh is only around a twenty minute drive south of Anchorage on the Seward Highway, so if you are in Alaska why not stop and stretch your legs. There is a large car park, which is free and restrooms available. The walk through the marsh is along raised boardwalks, and",
          "Whether you are a birder, nature lover, or just a passing tourist, this place is well with your time. Any time spent here will be rewarded. Whether it is wildlife like the crazy Moose that hangs out here, a passing bear, the multitude of birds, or just the marsh itself. You",
          "Right off the highway, and featuring raised wooden boardwalks, you are able to wander above the marshes and along a river where salmon swim upstream and birds scour the shores. It is a beautiful place, but directly across the highway (so loud cars) from a shooting range, so it",
          "We stopped for a look here when passing on the road but at that moment there were not many birds here. Maybe you need to visit at a specific time or something. There are long boardwalks you can walk on and it is nice but as mentioned, not many birds.",
          "I visited Potter Marsh in late July, and I'm not sure what the draw is. I saw some small fish in the creek, and that's about it. As far as the location goes... it's not far from Anchorage. The boardwalk is nicely set up, and makes for a good stroll. The walk has some",
          "Not really interested in birds, but this was an interesting stop. Very nice walkway out into the marsh. Could spend as much time as you wanted. Didn't spend much time here, but a good place to stretch your legs.",
          "This has a long boardwalk that goes two different directions. They have information boards telling you what is there. We saw lots of birds, ducks, geese, etc. We saw alot of fish (salmon) in the stream. We didn't see any big animals, but we did spot that was a possible bear",
          "I recommend renting a car when visiting Anchorage Alaska to fully experience the area. Book as far in advance as possible and check rental rates to optimize savings. Being avid birders and naturalists a visit to Potter Marsh was essential. Driving 20 minutes south on beautiful",
          "Although the area is negatively impacted by the smoke from fires on the Kenai penninsula, it was still a delight to walk along the extensive boardwalks and take in the sights. There were not a large number of birds to see, but enough to make things interesting. We especially",
          "In June, the arctic terns are nesting and babies are hatching and being fed....also, eagles, lots of different gulls and ducks..a bird watchers' paradise",
          "July 17, 2019 we stopped here to see what was going on. Large parking lot. The boardwalk goes a couple of ways, and if the birds are in, the bird watching could be fantastic. We enjoyed our time, as did the mosquitoes.",
          "You do not need to book a tour for this ;) Just park your car and hop out and enjoy it on your own. Trails are mostly on boardwalk so the walk is easy for anyone to do and great for strollers! We saw a bald eagle and salmon in the stream. Great place to stretch your legs with",
          "The birds in Potter Marsh were absolutely amazing. I wish there was an attendant we could have asked questions to, but the signs along the boardwalk did help to educate us. My daughter was able to release 12 birds from the Bird TLC there and she loved the experience. We actually",
          "this is once of the first scenic stops on the way to seward - hwy1 . close to anchorage. it is great for bird watchers. the board walk is a nice 30-40 min walk/stroll . i would recommend an morning or late in the day visit when it is cooler as the birds are hanging around as",
          "This is a beautifully maintained area with a great boardwalk out through the marsh. Passed it several times during my stay in Alaska. It's right outside of Anchorage on the way to Seward, Girdwood and Whittier, and is a great stop on its own. In the evening, we saw hundreds of",
          "Good visit on the way from Anchorage to Seward. Is a nature boardwalk. Views of birds, and eagle. Close to Anchorage.",
          "Very nice boardwalk and quite a few birds. However, nothing special. If you are passing the area, it is a nice stop,",
          "This place was close to where we were staying, so we went over about 9 pm to see if any of the other animals would be out and about. We saw several different birds and three moose, as well. Definitely a nice well-keep place with public restrooms. Across the road by the water",
          "We stumbled across this during our drive between Anchorage and Seward. So glad we stopped! If you like watching birds, this is the place for you! We also saw salmon in the stream. The viewing boardwalk seems to go on and on! Highly recommend!",
          "If you are an avid birder, this is the place for you. Geese, eagles, ducks and arctic terns just to get you started. And if you are lucky, some of the cow moose hang out here with their calves because of the succulent grasses that grow at the edge of the marsh. Saw a mother and",
          "Very pleasant early and late in the day for birds and an occasional moose. Watched an arctic tern bring bugs today her chick.",
          "We had been trying to squeeze in as much as we could in my brief visit. This was a nice respite from all that. We saw some ducks, and some birds as we strolled along the boardwalk. Nice views as always in Alaska. We enjoyed the downtime. Easily doable for all.",
          "Potter Marsh has been a wonderful spot for bird watching and baby animal spotting for years but the newer signs and informational areas make the experience even better. Today we saw baby ducks, geese, spawning salmon and a multitude of small birds. Lovely area.",
          "This is a great outing from downtown. Can be done with ride sharing easily. Moose and two calves. Lots of birds easy to see along boardwalk. Good view of mountains. Nice graphic information. Really pretty.",
          "The boardwalk is fabulous for out of staters and in staters a like. It can be a tad windy down there on the water though so make sure you bring a wind breaker. If you're lucky you'll see the baby eagles.",
          "A 20-30 min walk trail with beautiful views and possibilities to see a moose and birds. Very simple no stairs.",
          "There is an extensive boardwalk to lead you around the marsh. The birds can be very close. In June you can watch the baby Canada Geese feeding close to their parents. There are informative signs explaining the habitat. There are facilities at the entrance. No charge for a",
          "Went by to walk the boards and watch wildlife. Didn\u2019t see any returning salmon, but did see over a dozen baby Canadian geese goslings. Great place to walk flat surfaces and or push a stroller.",
          "We were driving to Anchorage. The driver stopped and we saw some birds and a happy Moose. It was a good photo op.",
          "Nice place to get out and stretch your legs on the drive to Girdwood and Whittier. Lots of birds and a beautiful walking path.",
          "It was 60 degrees, the last week of May. But the wind made it the coldest windy day I have ever experienced. Even the birds seemed to not like it. Almost no bird life to speak of. We saw far more birds on a lake in downtown Anchorage. I have been here before and no it can be",
          "Spring and summer are apparently rich for viewing wildlife. I was there in time for an early spring. There was still snow and ice on the ground but we spotted a couple of eagles, ducks, a trumpeter swans couple, and a few moose. The park is open as long as there is light.",
          "We were driving back from Seward and spotted a bunch of moose feeding in Potter Marsh just before sunset. We stopped and walked the elevated boardwalk. We were able to see 10 moose wandering around eating and one came up very close to the boardwalk so we got some great pictures",
          "a great free place to visist with the whole family. no matter what time of the year you visit the scenery and views are breath taking. easily accessible paths for anyone walking, in a wheelchair, or with a stroller.",
          "Well constructed boardwalks will take you over this marsh where you can see birds, fish, and even moose if you are lucky. It's accessible and beautiful. I've been many times.",
          "It is worth the time to explore is habitat and discover the amazing wonders of Mother Nature. The color of the area will never leave your brain.",
          "Make sure to stop at this hidden gem. The sanctuary is awesome for families and couples. Easy to access Potter Marsh. Lots of bird life.",
          "It was wonderful to walk along the boardwalks that take you out over the marsh for view the birds. So many varieties and so up close. Lovely walk and a great place to take a good camera!",
          "This little spot on the road is easy to miss, but take an hour or less to just enjoy nature and you\u2019ll be glad you did.",
          "We walked the entire boardwalk. We didn't see much of anything but we did find some moose tracks. It was overcast the day we stopped and it would have been prettier if the sun would have been out. We did enjoy the walk on the boardwalk anyway! (Christa)",
          "Great place to take family and friends for an afternoon stroll. Dont forget the binoculars. Very long boardwalks over the marsh and wetlands. Plenty of places to sit and take a break. Loved it!",
          "Each time we went to the boardwalk over the marsh, we saw a different variety of birds and wildlife. Spent a good part of the day just observing and enjoying the outdoors. Many wonderful pictures of beautiful scenery and animals.",
          "My husband and I stopped in Potter Marsh Bird Sanctuary on the way to Girdwood. It\u2019s very scenic and has an amazing 1-mile round trip wheel chair accessible boardwalk that takes you over the marsh and tall grasses. We saw a large moose lying down in the tall grass trying to",
          "If you are interested in Birds - here it is! We have been here several times and each time we are pleased at the variety of birds we have seen. Best thing - it doesn't cost a penny and there is plenty of free parking!",
          "The boardwalk here is very accessible and easy walking. We saw quite a few different birds despite it being August and not prime birding time. It was very pleasant.",
          "Loved having my husband take me there last week, gorgeously beautiful. Everyone should experience this while in the Anchorage area.",
          "We started our 12 day tour with this beautiful board walk. My parents wore the ponchos and we, kids, wife and I, had the umbrellas. The sky was covered with thick cloud, the fogs created a mystic feeling. White birds, half seen mountain peaks all just seemed to be skteched in",
          "We saw many different ducks, trumpeter swans and an eagle. It was a pleasant walk and they have some view finders available to see critters closer (that's how I saw the eagle!). There's a nice boardwalk, then there are additional areas you can walk and observe.",
          "It\u2019s not much there but it\u2019s beautiful, flowing streams, lots of wildlife in the marsh (ducks, birds, dragonflies and salmon) and the boardwalk is in total 1 mile long (2 different sides to walk and includes walking one side and coming back). It\u2019s so relaxing",
          "The bird watching tours are wonderful. I\u2019ve been several times. The boardwalk is a relaxing stroll and the watching tours are informative and fun. Good views of Turnagain Arm. Worth the drive or tour bus trip. It is right at the southern edge of Anchorage. Not a far drive.",
          "We arrived from the east coast and woke up early and thought we would go bird watching. We were surprised to find a gate blocking the road - it opens at 6am. We waited. The caretakers are lovely and offered binoculars - you can borrow a pair if you leave your car key with them.",
          "Was hoping to see more wildlife, didn't see any bears or moose, did see a lot of salmon, took some great pics.",
          "We stopped for a few minutes and ended up staying for a half an hour walking only a small section of the boardwalks which are excellent for both accessibility of the wetlands viewing for anyone with or without any mobility challenges (or a stroller). If the skies clear, you",
          "Potter Marsh was a great place to see various birds, including eagles, as well as salmon. We even saw a moose! They have a very nice boardwalk system, which let's you see for long distances.",
          "the walking trail is well maintained and the views of the marsh/mountains are gorgeous there ARE bear and there ARE moose in this area--we just didn't see any the day we went. But we had a great time anyway. the salmon were running so there was a lot of bird activity and the",
          "My husband and I visited Potter Marsh on the southern tip of Anchorage today. It was a quiet stroll along the boardwalk that stretched a half mile over the marsh. We saw salmon spawning and all kinds of birds. Many photographers were finding a plethora of things to capture",
          "Great way to see some wildlife and get back to nature. On our visit we saw a moose and a bald eagle fishing in the river. The scenery was just so beautiful!",
          "Another stop included in our excursion to Beluga Point and Alaska Wildlife Consevation Center, it was interesting trail and to see wild salmons.",
          "This place is about 20 minutes out of Anchorage toward Seward on the Seward Highway. There is a nice boardwalk above the marsh where you can bird watch, look for wildlife and watch the salmon swimming up to spawn. We were there on a beautiful sunny day and the views were",
          "Went early morning in June - very pleasant walk except for the mosquitos. Watched a moose grazing the wetlands and saw a few birds. This is great free nature area very convenient to Anchorage.",
          "Had a lovely walk through Potter Marsh. We saw a moose and lots of salmon. The salmon were spawning when we were there. Very enjoyable.",
          "A friend and I spent a day and a half in Anchorage before departing for Nome and other points north. I had been to Potter Marsh but many years ago. We are birders, so we knew that would be a good place to bird without having to drive far. Our best sighting was of two Bald",
          "Easy to get to, not far from town, varied habitat makes for seeing both waterfowl, shorebirds and resident tree birds very nicee.",
          "This is not a hiking spot. Its a elevated walkway with information and views of a marsh with a lot of birds, fish and we did see a moose! Very pretty and relaxed atmosphere.",
          "We'd heard this is a great place to see moose so we stopped on our way from Anchorage to Portage. While we didn't see any moose we did see some salmon and some ducks. Potter Marsh offers extensive board walks accessible to anyone wishing to walk them. Well worth the stop!",
          "I went two or three times a day. On the way to everything. Eagle nests, moose, yellow legs, beavers, muskrats and bears.",
          "We spent several minutes here and it is a beautiful spot. There is a long boardwalk which was interesting to walk. Most of the birds were elsewhere, but we were able to see a few. We also saw a few salmon in the streams.",
          "You can't leave Anchorage on the Seward Highway without passing Potter March. A boardwalk begins at the northwestern end (free parking lot). The marsh is also home to some large mammals.",
          "drove past several times while on vacation. We always saw numerous visitors, so we had to stop and check it out. A very nice elevated boardwalk system allowing visitors to view wildlife. We didn't stay long but did get to see a female moose grazing, maybe 20 yards from us.",
          "Boardwalks are wonderful! It was a bit windy the day we were there, so there weren\u2019t a lot of birds, but there was a moose! It is difficult to get there if you don\u2019t have a car; outside Anchorage bus routes.",
          "We must have arrived to Potter's Marsh on a slow night because the only wildlife we observed were what appeared to be seagulls and some wood ducks. Boardwalk makes it an easy walk if you have time to kill and are a bird watcher (we are not). You can probably see just as much",
          "We enjoyed walking the boardwalks one afternoon after several days of clouds & rain. We saw a moose, lots of ducks & geese, salmon in the stream. Take the time to walk both sides, it only takes about an hour or so.",
          "There were very few birds along the boardwalk to see. Most of them were down further where there was no boardwalk, along with moose we actually saw on the drive to the park. The coolest thing we saw were some spawning, jumping salmon, otherwise it is not a must. I do realize you",
          "Just about fifteen minutes outside of Anchorage is the boardwalk area over a wildlife sanctuary. Eagles overhead, moose lurking in the trees around you, steps from civilization yet miles from the hustle and bustle of the city. Kudos to those who built the meandering wooden",
          "Fabulous place to visit. Kids have special items to see with special viewing platforms. Saw all 4 kinds of salmon, less than 15 feet away. Canadian geese with their babies. Eagles were nesting in mid-morning",
          "Great location with elevated walkways and interesting information kiosks. Easy parking with fast access to see the area allowed us to take photos quickly.",
          "This is a great stop south of Anchorage proper, about 30 minutes from the airport. There's a decent sized parking area with restrooms as well as addition paved pull offs from the highway south to Girdwood. Stopped at the pull off as well as parked and walked the elevated",
          "We stopped for a few minutes at the sanctuary and wound up staying there for about an hour. Plenty of parking, restrooms, and a boardwalk system to get you out into the marsh. Mainly saw ducks, eagles, and hawks. We did get to see a sow and her calf up close. That was fun",
          "I am sure this would be a lovely visit on a better day. It was windy and chilly and not much wildlife was out and about. The site has very nice boardwalks for visitors with telescopes for viewing and benches for resting. Would love to return on a sunny, calm day.",
          "Not as many variety of birds as we expected, but we also saw moose. The first visit was great weather, the docent was well versed in what we might see. The second visit was in bad weather, so we parked on the parking lot off the main highway and watched the birds struggle in the",
          "Not a lot of wildlife. Saw many ducks, geese and birds but highlight was seeing the mother moose with her calf grazing in the marsh.",
          "Only 20 miles out of Anchorage. An \u201caccidental\u201d habitat that resulted from an embankment built for the railroad cutting off salt water almost completely and transformed to a fresh water habitat due to numerous creeks passing through. Uncomplicated and succinct information boards",
          "Best time to visit is later half of July. Skip a paid tour and just walk the boardwalk and read the signs. You may see salmon moving up the small river there to spawn.",
          "After I parked, I hiked around the boardwalk to see many birds and a female moose who was way in the distance. This park is off of the northbound Seward Highway and it is nearby ANC.",
          "We thoroughly enjoyed spending time here. We even came back again at the end of our day. Saw a baby moose (once laying down, once foraging) and a teen male moose (small antlers) walking through the water (see pics). One woman had been in Alaska 3 weeks and was leaving later that",
          "Easy and short walking path. I went after the birds flew south for the winter but it is still a nice place to visit. Very serene.",
          "Long boardwalks where you can view salmon, moose, and many kinds of birds (depending on the season).",
          "This was a last minute addition to our trip and I am glad we made the stop. The boardwalk is very easy to walk. While walking the board walk we saw an incredible amount of wading birds as well as bald eagles and moose. The road traffic can be noisy near the road.",
          "You get to see many of Alaska's native birds including eagles, magpies, willow ptarmigan, etc. Wonderful views, the ocean, the Alaska Train, etc.",
          "Great place to walk and observe the land and animals. We loved all the birds and even saw an eagle. It was great to get out and walk for a change.",
          "Good viewing area for birds and wildlife. Saw many different waterfowl and 4 or 5 Moose. The boardwalks built, create a way to get around to different views without disturbing any of the lands or animals. The walks can be as extensive as you would like.",
          "The boardwalk makes this a must see kind of place. You can visit Potter Marsh and then it's just a short drive on out to Baluga Point. The marsh is great for birds but I wanted moose. My wife had seen two moose from the train as we passed by the marsh the day before. I looked",
          "This was a nice break to our day. The marsh is beautiful and boardwalk well kept. We caught a glimpse of a cow moose before she decided to lay down in the long grass and disappeared. There is one major draw back to this peaceful spot and it is not the highway. Who in their right",
          "We flew into Anchorage a few days before we were going to do a cruise & spent those days driving the Turnagain Arm drive & the Portage Valley drive. Both can be found on alaska.org (not sure if I can include a hyper link here). The Potter Marsh Bird Sanctuary is the first stop",
          "Eagles nesting in trees towards the mountains, spawning salmon in marsh, moose grazing in marsh. Birds in abundance including ducks, geese, swans and eagles. Pretty cool place for a day walk along the boards.",
          "We had passed the sanctuary several times as we traversed the highway. Every time we went by there there seemed like there were 1,000s of birds. So we got up one morning to make a trip there. Sadly, we only saw a few birds. And we have those same birds here in SC. It's still a",
          "We stopped by here on a whim and ended up spending over an hour exploring. We saw a moose, a bald eagle, swans, geese, arctic terns, kingfisher and many other birds in this beautiful setting. Plus, it's free.",
          "Wonderful trails and vantage points, we throughly enjoyed all the birds and other wildlife we saw. Worth a look",
          "We came out to look for moose and bears but only saw birds. It's a lovely peaceful location and so clean. Birds flying and nesting all around. It's a place you could just sit and watch for as long as you wished, there is always something to see. What's more , it's free, can't",
          "This wonderful birding site is conveniently located 10-15 minutes south of Anchorage. The birding is even better from a pullout about a mile south of the boardwalk",
          "Friendly locals gave us tips for best viewing and photo times, and one even guided us to a site where two eagles were protecting their territory!",
          "Potter Marsh Bird Sanctuary is a great place to see the many birds in this part of Alaska. On our drive, it was rainy and cold, but we still had a great time seeing the birds and fowl.",
          "It was my first contact with nature in Alaska, since I visited during my drive from Anchorage to Seward. There were not so many birds late September, since it's almost winter. It's probably better during summer time. But it was a safe stop, good for families.",
          "Located along the Seward Highway, just south of Anchorage. Good access and boardwalks make this easy place to visit. Take your time walking the boardwalk and trails to watch the birds and to get some good views of the mountains. Spring, Fall and Summer are all good times to",
          "August 12 2017 mid-morning - first site visited in Alaska, just on outskirt of town; overcast day of visit, saw a few salmon in streams; very few bird sightings, did see bald eagles. Thinking that you could visit different times of the day and for longer periods of time just",
          "The visitors area is nice and plenty of parking. Outhouse, but that is to be expected. The boardwalk is nice and long and an easy walk to accommodate most.",
          "Very well set out with lots of walkways, but we were there at the wrong time, so there were no birds. In the migration season the birds would be easy to see and it would be a great day out.",
          "We stopped here to/from our trip to Anchorage. This is such a wonderful treat very close to Anchorage. There is a wonderful boardwalk that covers a number of habitats and allows you to see a good variety of bird species. It is well maintained with a number of viewpoints",
          "We visited on September 24, 2017, so many of the birds had already migrated south. But it is a beautiful boardwalk, worth taking a walk on. We did see trumpeter swans, shoveler ducks, and other birds. We did not see any moose, but they may be there as well.",
          "If you are birder this is a must in Anchorage. We visited 3 times we loved it so much. its clean well marked and has picnic areas and restrooms. Parking is free. The boardwalk is easy to navigate and there benches available. We saw a moose calf, gull chicks, Arctic Terns",
          "During a recent visit to Anchorage, we took a tour to Potter Marsh Bird Sanctuary. Unfortunately, the September weather did not cooperate and it was damp, foggy and we did not stay very long. But there is a beautiful walkway, a boardwalk actually, along the marshland where a",
          "Nice place to walk around and bird watch. We did see a moose, that was a big bonus. The elevated walkway is great for watching Nature.",
          "We enjoyed this trip a lot. There's so much to see and plenty of walking paths. This is a must visit for any anchorage trip.",
          "Only rating this low because there was little bird activity...probably the time of year. The boardwalk and viewing areas are wonderful. Migrating birds would love this natural area, but alas...nothing to see.",
          "This is not a huge bird sanctuary but it was very interesting. Tundra swans, eagles, and various species of ducks were there. It was a windy day so we didn't stay long and a lot of ducks were hunkered down. The boardwalk allows you to access the marsh. Nice place for a",
          "We have zipped up and down this boardwalk many times, probably more than a dozen. Great place to stretch the legs! When my kids were young, they loved it...because its a boardwalk! They could run up and down it and not get lost, Obviously we have hit it at the wrong",
          "Just next to the road to Kenai peninsula from Anchorage is this beautiful boardwalk where you can see many of Alaska's birds, from ducks to bald eagles. Very informative boards along the walk give you tidbits about the history of the place and the species you can find here.",
          "There aren't many places that are just a good place to see nature in a big city. I mean you have to usually hike out somewhere to a quiet sanctuary to see birds and things but this environment has just that. During the run season you can walk close to the highway side and see",
          "We have driven by here many times, but finally took the time to stop and walk the boardwalk. We did not see a large variety of animals, but did really enjoy seeing the salmon and Trumpeter Swans.",
          "We visit the marsh at least a couple of times each summer. The best time to visit is in May when the leaves on the trees have not come out yet, at least to view the bald eagle nest that is easily seen from the end of the boardwalk. The next best time to visit is in June when",
          "We had a little time before we headed to the airport. so stopped here and so glad we did! The elevated boardwalk was perfect for walking around and trying to catch site of wildlife. We saw eagles, salmon, various other birds and moose tracks. Such a peaceful, beautiful place to",
          "Located directly adjacent to Seward Highway, Potter Marsh is unexpected. The elevated boardwalk makes viewing birds and other wildlife easier. Gun fire can be heard from a shooting range on the opposite side of the highway, and I can't help but think the noise may keep some",
          "The Marsh is just outside of Anchorage. In fact the exit comes up so fast you might miss it, it's not well marked. Basically if you're headed south out of Anchorage, the road is right after you start seeing the water of Cook Inlet on your right. You turn left, across traffic,",
          "We walked along the boardwalk and saw some birds and fish in the water. It was windy, good to have a jacket. Noisy from the freeway of cars, but a beautiful area to admire different wildlife",
          "There is a decent size parking lot. Then you walk on some raised long wooded paths. There was a moose and her baby. And lots of birds. And on the size towards the road there were huge fish that I would guess swam in the breed. It was a great spot.",
          "We stopped here and we didn't see many birds. Probably the time and the season is not perfect to observe birds and animals in this area. We saw animal prints of bear and moose.",
          "After being at the market we still had some time with daylight on our side so we drove to Potter Marsh and just walked the broad walk which goes on for ever. A lovely place to relax and let the world go by. Locals frequent this place so you know you have found the right place",
          "My husband and I stopped here to stretch our legs. We were there in the afternoon and saw a flock of birds hidden in the trees and I was able to photograph a pair of geese and their goslings. It\u2019s free, wheelchair friendly and you never know what you\u2019ll see.",
          "This place is suitable for all ages and we visited twice because it's so peaceful (yes, there is that highway out there, but ...). We saw a moose and calf, a bald eagle having a snooze, and salmon waiting for the right time to commence their upstream journey. Nice, wide and",
          "I lived in Anchorage 20 years ago. We loved going to Potter's Marsh. It has grown since then, but it is just as beautiful. There are raised boardwalks around the sanctuary with informational signs and binoculars. There are opportunities to see fish, all kinds of birds",
          "We saw the salmon and several different species of birds, including two bald eagles. The signage was informative and interesting",
          "Two week trip to ak and this was our final day. It was here I finally learned what those small darting birds were that I saw continuously throughout our trip. Love birding in Alaska, love the tree swallows.",
          "Last time we were here the birds were gone - this time they were in and it was fantastic. In addition to the birds there were salmon which made it even more exciting, especially for the children. The birds do not come up to the boardwalk, so a camera with a good lens or a pair",
          "Yes, it's a great place to see birds-so bring your binoculars. But for me, it was worth it to see the salmon under the boardwalk-I'd never seen wild salmon before and these fish are enormous!",
          "The walk on the raised wooden trail is pleasant and easy, but I was disappointed I didn't see any wildlife other than birds. If you love birds, bring along your binoculars and you'll have a lot to see.",
          "My wife and i had a day to kill in the Anchorage area and ended up going south on Seward Highway. We stopped off at Potter creek marsh on the way back. There is an elevated walking path that keeps you i. A safe zone from wildlife, yet a great opportunity to see and photograph",
          "We came in the late afternoon and walked the boardwalk. It's a pretty walk, but perhaps we came at a bad time of day. We didn't really see many birds. A little disappointing.",
          "What a pleasant side trip in Anchorage! Spent about 90 minutes or so walking the boardwalks and viewing a variety of birds. Easy to just sit on a bench or lean on the rail and get lost in nature! Saw a bald eagle return with a fish!",
          "Watched a pair of eagles who were watching their nest very closely. Went multiple days over a week, and at least one was there each time. Many different kinds of birds to watch and listen to - if not for all the people, would be a peaceful place to relax",
          "This was a great stop just south of Anchorage heading towards Seward. The boardwalk is in great shape and made for a nice walk enjoying the views and birds. An easy place to stop and stretch your legs on the way out of town!",
          "If you want to see a variety of Alaska' s birds this is the place. It is easily accessable from the highway and there is a boardwalk into marsh.",
          "I hadn't been to Potter Marsh in seven years and was delighted with the upgrades and additional paths to take over the marsh. The boardwalks were exceptionally maintained and LOVED the interpretive signs. Saw many different species of birds.",
          "Easy and Safe place to see Moose and Birds of all kind. Salmon in Streams easily viewed and photographed from above are safe and long Boardwalk. Worth the time!",
          "Ocassionally a moode or two will wonder through, salmon swimming up rest under path bridge. Rare but might spot a bear. During winter water is frozen so area ajacent to park becomes a local family skating area. very wonderful!",
          "A really nice boardwalk right along the Seward Highway as you head out of Anchorage. We went in the morning around 7am and saw some really cool ducks and a moose. Well worth the stop.",
          "The boardwalk is an excellent place to walk and view the birds. Many water birds were present and easy to see from the overlooks.",
          "The wooden walkway provides a great view of birds in the marsh, and is a good place to watch for moose and maybe bears. Just a few miles out of town so something you can do at the end of the day, especially since it never gets dark in June. It does close at 11 P.M.",
          "I am not normally a bird person, the Marsh was a stop on our tour. However, i saw a baby moose and tons of birds. Very glad we stopped here to stretch our legs! Easy walk.",
          "Only thing making this a 4 vs 5 was constant sound of gunfire in background from nearby rifle range.",
          "Huge boardwalk on the Marsh and in the trees. Eagles nest. Great hosts. Audubon guided walks. Moose everyday.",
          "Potter Marsh is just a 15 minute drive south from Anchorage. There is a fantastic long boardwalk from which you can spot all sorts of birds including terns, geese, shorebirds and songbirds. They have naturalist guides on duty to help you spot them. There was also a baby moose",
          "A must visit for wildlife enthusiasts - especially birders! I visited Anchorage with my family of four in late June and spent many hours at the place. The flat, marshy land offers a habitat for a variety of water fowl - trumpeter swans, Canadian geese, a variety of ducks. We",
          "We enjoyed stopping at the marsh and viewing the birds/waterfowl...there certainly were plenty to see. We couldn't identify some of them, but we're no experts...we just like to view them. Great views of the Turnagain Arm as well.",
          "My husband and I love nature and wildlife. Although raining when we arrived, within the first minute along the boardwalk we encountered a juvenille eagle sitting on a stump. Also saw gosslings; on our way out we were treated to a moose and her 1 week old calves munching on the",
          "We live on the hill above Potter Marsh, so we see it frequently. There's a very nice boardwalk for bird and salmon watching. There's also a couple of pullouts off of Seward Highway for birdwatching at the other end of the marsh. In fall - right before ice freezes, we usually",
          "We went on 5/31 and the entire wildlife/waterfowl consisted of one duck. The only good thing is that it's right off the highway from Denali down to Anchorage, so we didn't go far out of our way.",
          "The boardwalks here are a beautiful walk through the marsh. We saw geese with their babies, a bald eagle , a moose mama, a lot of different birds and ducks, and the beautiful area that it is in.",
          "What a nice viewable wildlife area. Very nice signage and elevated walkways, and viewspots with some blind-effect for watching with your own binoculars or their scopes. We saw little birds of various kinds, terns, a moose, muskrats, geese, ducks, a huge salmon, among other",
          "We enjoyed this stop at the beginning of our drive down the Turn Again Arm. It has a very nice boardwalk that takes you out into the marsh to view the many different birds that nest here. As soon as we arrived a Bald Eagle flew over to welcome us. There are a number of different",
          "It was a little too windy the day we went. That's probably why we didn't see too many birds. But it was a beautiful spot and we did get some great photos.",
          "This is a great place to walk outdoors and see some water fowl, maybe a moose or bear. And its free. I visited early June and did not see a lot but loved the walk. Most places charge a $5 fee to park but this one does not charge, so an added bonus. I got some nice photos of",
          "We saw a large crowd here Saturday and stopped to check it out. There was a free day to promote wildlife conservation so we got lucky. There's a long pier out into the marsh to observe the birds close up with binoculars for viewing. This is a great place for kids to learn about",
          "We visited Memorial Day morning. We listed 18 different birds including the rusty blackbird, three-toed woodpecker, Savannah sparrow and Arctic warbler, We were also blessed with a visit by a mama moose and her two babies!",
          "To see the birds, and the moose, you need to get in an early start. There wasn't much activity when we were there late May. Mid June to Mid July would be best",
          "We were on our way to Seward and stopped here. Even though it was a rainy chilly morning it was a nice stop with lots of birds and interesting information about the area and wildlife. Worth a stop.",
          "We went to Potters marsh shortly after getting off the plane because we knew that our hotel room would not be available for us yet. We enjoyed watching some of the wild life there last time we were there and figured it would be a nice place to spend some time. We got a big a",
          "Potter Marsh has a long stretch of boardwalks so you can walk out and over the marsh. In spring it is filled with swallows and thousands of nesting shore birds. There is an occasional moose or bear.",
          "My wife and I visited Potter Marsh today. The location is quite beautiful but we really did not see too many birds at all there. Not sure where they were hiding. The Boardwalk is nice.",
          "Excellent board walk and observing platforms. This is exposed to the bay winds and weather. We found our rain gear very useful. There are good displays regarding the wildlife foound there that include color pictures. The walking path is handicaped accessable and includes optics",
          "Sometimes there are a variety of birds, other times not so much, but during the out of town guests seem to love the walk and view. Earlier this year we counted 12 moose just at dusk.",
          "After all the years we'd lived in Alaska, this was our first stop at Potter Marsh. We watched the salmon for a while--take a right on the boardwalk and head toward the highway. The boardwalk crosses a creek and we watched some reds that were pooled up there. Saw lots of birds",
          "Visiting the first time our GPS took us to turn off of Seward Highway onto Rabbit Creek Road then right along the back side of Potters Marsh - road which was very bumpy but there she was - standing proudly like a statue - a mother moose just munching on fresh green grass",
          "We stopped the car to enter here from a busy highway and we were disappointed as we didnt see any bird ..",
          "We stopped here to let the kids burn off some energy while driving from Willow to Homer. They had a blast and were sad that we only had time to walk one 1/2 of the boardwalk. We did not see a lot of wild life this trip (may-aug is the best time to visit) but we did see swans,",
          "If you are visiting Alaska, don't bother - it's a noisy area on the busiest highway in Alaska. It makes a decent quick getaway for Anchorage residents, but as far as a tourist stop, I don't recommend it.",
          "Drive down the Seward Hwy, and you can't miss it. Choose to view while driving by or pull over. There is a lovely boardwalk from which to view the birds, or you can see them from the highway (if you are in a hurry).",
          "good close views of wildlife but always aware of the traffic unless you willing to walk some distance. nice place to stretch legs if you on long drive",
          "If you love Bird watching this is the palce for you. The main issue I see is a major road runs right by it so it doesn't give you a quiet day out.",
          "We were here last summer in time for the summer salmon run. They congregate in a pond near the highway, then make their way upstream to spawn. The natural cycle is there before you.",
          "The first thing you notice is the quiet serenity. It's a beautiful walk with lots of animals, fish and birds (including an Eagles nest) to view. We walked all through the area and had 2 young kids with us and we spent about 2 hours. It was time well spent and just a lovely",
          "Good free site near Anchorage for easy walking on boardwalk with observation points. Ducks, eagles, kingfishers and greater yellow legs were our main subjects.. If I lived in the area I would visit often. A long telephoto would be helpful to have for camera.",
          "Potter Marsh Bird Sanctuary is a beautiful drive up the coastline. It wasn't on our list of things to do, but while driving home from Homer decided to stop ! So glad we did! We enjoyed the walk and looking for fish and finding a few dead fish. Poor Salmom!",
          "Even though it was after the summer season had a great time with a 5 year old. The family spent time running around trying to find wild life.",
          "I spotted a moose who was eating as we were driving by so we pulled the RV in and took a nice walk here while seeing wildlife. Salmon,ducks,birds and a moose in a very accessible location.",
          "This is a nice location to just get out for a little bit and not have to drive too far. It's about a one mile boardwalk path with lookouts. Its a nice spot to take in nature and not be far from civilization. It's great for kids also!",
          "We saw a Bald Eagle and other water fowl. Very nice walk over the marshlands. Easy to park and the price is right. Fairly windy day in the inlet but the berm protected us for the most part. Nice spot to walk and enjoy nature.",
          "Scenery is always great, but if lucky will see birds and moose. We saw quite a few swans, along with ducks, muskrats.",
          "We were there in September. Didn't see any wild life, but it was a good place to stretch as we traveled from Anchorage to Seward. The boardwalks are sturdy, clean and interesting.",
          "Went on a VERY windy day in Sept. and not much there. Came back a week later when calmer and saw tons of swans. Great boadrwalk.",
          "We stopped at Potter Marsh on our way south down the Seward highway and spent about an hour walking the boardwalks. We were there on a somewhat overcast August afternoon. The boardwalks were easy to walk and were pretty extensive. We could see views over the marsh area below, as",
          "We stopped here late one evening and observed a moose which was neat. The boardwalks make for easy walking.",
          "A well preserved tidal marsh close to Anchorage. The boardwalk was in good condition. I went at low tide mid day and there wasn't much bird activity. All-inall a don't miss for birders and nature lovers passing by.",
          "This was a really cool experience and we went in the evening. We saw a moose, lots of duck and muskrats that were eating fingerlings (salmon or trout). The baby fish were jumping out the the water after bugs.",
          "Nice walk & viewing. We did not see as many birds that would normally be there because we were there in Sept. Most of the birds have migrated. We were there in Sept.",
          "What a nice boardwalk. This is the everglades of Alaska. So relaxing, pretty and peaceful. I saw different species of ducks and birds and eagles too. It was raining at a distance and there was a rainbow over the marsh. A Kodak moment for sure. It didn't come out on my cell",
          "My husband I were driving down the Kenai Peninsula from Anchorage. What a beautiful drive. We stopped at Potter Marsh Sanctuary and spent over an hour here photographing and watching birds of all kinds from terns to bald eagles to warblers. We saw muskrats, too! Just a great",
          "Our 1st stop on the Seward Highway was the Potter Marsh bird sanctuary. You walk on a boardwalk so it would be easy for people in wheelchairs to see birds.We saw fledgling eagles, many ducks,and swans. You can also see salmon spawning. Bring binoculars to see birds.The boardwalk",
          "This is a bit out of town, so hard to get to, but if you like birds or happen to be passing it is certainly worth stopping. There is a raised boardwalk so it is very easy to get around and there is an amazing array of bird life. We saw several eagles in the creek and if you",
          "It is a short drive from Anchorage and the scenery is beautiful. But it is very very small. The boardwalk is short, very easily walked. There are birds, trees, water, marshes and quite a bit to photograph but you should be done in 1/2 hour if you take your time. There were",
          "Nice board walked area, close to the city of Anchorage, for wildlife viewing. Well used by visitors and locals alike. The day we went we saw bald eagles, and spawning salmon.",
          "Bear tracks, dabbling and diving ducks, ravens, kingfishers, there were a few different varieties of birds to see when I visited in August. Arrive in the early morning and there will be more bird activity. Also many birds are only passing through the sanctuary and will arrive",
          "the boardwalk out into the march was great to watch except we got hit with rain so binoculars and camera were getting wet. We thoroughly enjoyed reading about the area and the animals and birds, just disappointed it was cold, breezy, and rain.",
          "I definitely recommend a stop at Potter's Marsh. There is a board walk all along the edge to allow excellent bird viewing and also when the salmon are running, viewing of them as well. This attraction is easily accessible.",
          "Have been numerous times with guests. Have seen the salmon run, moose, Eagles and many ducks. Amazing place to see animals and experience nature without getting muddy.",
          "This is a wetlands park on the south end of Anchorage. You can look around from boardwalks with very good signage that explains the ecology and the wildlife, spending as much or as little time as you wish. It's convenient, right off the Seward Highway (Rt. 1). We were there",
          "Whether you are a photographer, or just a nature lover, this is the place to be. The boardwalk is a wonderful way to see all kinds of birds and animals. Bring your telephoto lens!",
          "The long walkway allows the visitor to see birds, salmon, and the marsh in its natural setting. There are many information boards posted along the walkway",
          "This is a must. The boardwalk takes you right into the marsh. Many, many birds are flying in and out. Sometimes I've seen Dahl sheep on the cliffs. I've also seen Beluga whales on the other side of the roadway in the Cook Inlet. Sunset is phenomenal when it's not too",
          "The wooden board stretched around the marsh. The board end where you can you the scopes to look around trees for birds. It's easy to find the marsh with plenty of free parking.",
          "It was raining when we stopped here, but we still saw several birds & enjoyed the great boardwalks. Very convenient place to visit if you are traveling from Anchorage to Seward.",
          "Even without seeing any birds, just the vast openness of Potter Marsh was enjoyable. We saw 3 eagles during our visit. One was on the railing of one of the viewing stations. It even squirted a giant poop that almost reached us - we were standing approx 10 feet away. Another",
          "Visited this place twice; once mid morning and once late afternoon. Nice, easy boardwalk trail. Didn't see any mammals but watched salmon swimming and enjoyed watching the birds.",
          "With ample parking, clean restrooms, and wide boardwalks, this nature sanctuary is a must do - free - for anyone visiting Anchorage. Taking your own binoculars is recommended even though high quality binoculars are provided at various points. If you can go at high tide, there",
          "This was a nice easy walk and calm day. The landscape view and wildlife view was amazing! We were very lucky and were able to see coho, sockeye, chum, and pink salmon all with their changed colors. This was an amazing afternoon walk. I think we were there 30-45 minutes.",
          "Fabulous salt marsh bird sanctuary within a few minutes of downtown Anchorage. Ducks a plenty and spotted 2 immature bald eagles a northern harrier, kingfishers and 3 newly rehabilitated merlins. Not birds but several species of salmon were lurking in the creek ready to go",
          "The Pottery March Sanctuary is unique in Anchorage. Three creeks flow into the marsh and you never know what you might see here. The tide (salt water) flows into the marsh during high tide and this time of year you can see salmon ready to go up the larger creek to span. From an",
          "The Potter Marsh Viewing Boardwalks are wonderful. There are two main wooden walkways - one parallels Seward Highway and the other goes the opposite direction. The marsh is teaming with bird life. The time we visited the salmon were coming from Turnagain Arm into the marsh and",
          "We went to Potter Marsh Bird Sanctuary and while there saw a moose and some Bald eagle fledglings and adult bald eagles as well. There were many other species of birds as well as Salmon in the creek. It was a good experience and I can recommend it to any bird lovers.",
          "As part of our city tour we stopped here to see the salmon and we were not disappointed. The area is very nice and there are multiple trails or boardwalks you can walk around but we only did the one.",
          "A boardwalk takes you over the tidal marsh area s of Anchorage to view all kinds of shorebirds, ducks, salmon, and a bald eagle's nest when we were there. The immature eagles were flying around and had already left the nest but the parents were probably still feeding them.",
          "We drove in from Denali NP and arrived at Potter Marsh at about 3:30pm, planning to stay for about 30 minutes before heading to our hotel in Anchorage. We ended up spending about 2 hours at the sanctuary. Nice boardwalk extended east-west across the north end and south along",
          "It's near a noisy highway. Other than that: go here! It's a nice walk across a moor with lots of wildlife.",
          "Made a quick stop here and enjoyed it very much. A good number of aquatic birds, a bald eagle sitting in its nest, and a moose nearby and in plain view for ten minutes.",
          "We stopped on the way back from Seward. The walking area is very nice. We saw a couple eagles in the tree tops. We also saw salmon and other birds in the water. Very quiet area. Worth the stop.",
          "Great place to walk the easy raised boardwalk to see nesting bald eagles, sandhill cranes, salmon. Easy to get to off the Turnagain arm near Anchorage.",
          "What can I say, it was a marsh. Had some nice wood paths into the marsh. Lot of different species of birds make it home.",
          "We walked along the boardwalks into the Marsh along the highway and railway to view the birds. We appreciated talking with a knowledgable ranger who had set up a telescope for viewing fledging activity in an eagle's nest. The walk ways had many descriptive sign explanations of",
          "Nice idea, but too close to the highway and the rifle range....guns and car noise persisted for our entire visit.",
          "Whether you walk or need assistance if is worth stopping to see. Fully handicapped too. Great views, weird till you read why it's there and why its' so close to the road, then you get it and why it's there. You may even see bear on your walk around the platform areas. Great for",
          "It's a great place to go birding and to see other wild life. When we went last, we saw a moose as well as two fledgling bald eagles!",
          "Great spot to get out and have a nice walk. Towards the end we saw a moose with her baby. There are a lot of birds and it's ery peaceful.",
          "On the first day we went left and spotted a bald eagle on a sand bar eating a fish while the magpies clamored for leftovers. We drove around the park and spotted a great horned owl in a tree. The next day we went the other way and spotted the spawning salmon. The boardwalk is",
          "Very well done boardwalk, great for kids and families. Lots of birds but no moose. Worth a stop if you are nearby.",
          "Great place to view lots of birds. Easy to get to off the Seward Hwy. Elevated boardwalks give you a great view. Also saw a moose!",
          "We walk here almost every night, and it's almost always a joy. Occasionally, there'll be large groups or families with screaming kids that don't understand the meaning of a \"sanctuary\", as opposed to a playground or party spot. Fortunately, this doesn't happen a lot. Usually",
          "If you are looking for a nice spot to see wildlife outside of Anchorage, this is a good choice. We saw a moose and a bald eagle. We also saw Salmon swimming upstream (end of July). Bring binoculars (though some viewers are there, too).",
          "We spent an afternoon looking at birds and the moose. It was a fund experience on such a sunny day. The moose came into view several times and then went into the under brush to escape the heat.",
          "The boardwalk is easy walking. The day we were there was ridiculously windy. Bird life was scarce. A few ducks and that was it. So overall, it was a bit disappointing.",
          "This is a great place to stop along the Seward Highway, about 9 miles south of Anchorage just as you are approaching Turnagain Arm. The turn-off and parking lot are on the east side of the road. Potter Marsh is part of the Anchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge and has a 1/2 mile",
          "There are two raised boardwalks over the marsh area. One follows the Seward Highway and, when the salmon are running, will provide the opportunity to see spawning salmon up close. The second goes away from the highway and is much quieter and peaceful and has a informational",
          "Potter Marsh offers some of the best bird viewing. It is just south of Anchorage, along the Seward Highway. Boardwalks carry the visitors out and over this marshy area where birders can find many species of birds. Pay close attention to the various signs and informational",
          "We made a fairly brief stop here while driving from Anchorage to Girdwood. There is a pit toilet for your convenience. We walked down the boardwalk and stopped several times to look for wildlife. Saw a muskrat. We aren't really birders, so I can't attest to that. It was a",
          "Head here between April and August to see a wide assortment of wildlife. You will see a variety of birds ranging from Canadian geese to harriers and pintails. Bring a camera.",
          "Disappointment says it all. It is a wetland adjacent to the only road going S out of Anchorage. There is a large parking area, OK for several large buses or RV's. There is 2 outdoor restrooms. It is open from 6 am until 10 pm although we were there at 5 am two mornings and it",
          "Nicely laid out for easy access, great birdlife and animal tracks visible in several places (moose). Visited several times.",
          "We booked a tour with Tours by Locals. Our guides name was Brad F (He does Anchorage City Tours). Brand packed quite a bit into our morning. This was just one stop. His knowledge of the city and the history of Anchorage and the surrounding area is exactly what we were",
          "Very well maintained boardwalk over the marsh provides lots of area to view the birds. The nesting eagles are in the trees to the left of the end of the boardwalk...huge nest!",
          "After driving past this several times, we stopped by to walk the boardwalks. Not a lot of activity while we were there, but we saw an eagle's nest and heard we just missed a mom and baby moose, and our friends saw a moose here earlier in the week. Nice walk and views, worth a",
          "Nice day. My friend took us to walk the nice boardwalks at the sanctuary. Saw several birds and some large salmon. Didn't see any moose.",
          "Mesmerizing views but very windy. It's also wheelchair accessible for those who are wondering. Some of the binoculars are even made for those who are on wheelchairs! The entire area is very safe for children as well. The boardwalk is long and is a great location for after meal",
          "We stopped here after a trip from Flattop Mt. There weren't too many birds when we there. We did see Arctic Tern and a nice Bald Eagle nest. Beautiful Boardwalk and nice place to walk. We brought lunch and used the picnic table. They had the typical porta-potties, too. If you",
          "After all your touring adventures, this is a lovely quiet time to stroll the wooden walks out around the marshes. Well signed with information on the visiting birds, you'll find this a respite from some of your more active endeavors. Bird watchers paradise for sure!",
          "A great boardwalk allowing closeups of birds, marsh with an outstanding mountain backdrop. We saw an eagle.",
          "Keep your eyes open and your mouth closed for the best chance at seeing wildlife. Moose love the marshy areas, especially in the evening.",
          "have to say - I was expecting more variety.. but mother nature did not cooperate on the day I was there (6/13). Spotted a large flock of geese, and a few small birds.. but about the only thing in abundance was mosquitoes! wounded up getting driven back to the car for my",
          "There is an eagle's nest visible from the east end (end closest to the mountains) of the boardwalk. It has been active for many years and will likely continue to be in the future. Potter Marsh is great for birds in general with good access to shorebirds and aquatic birds. In",
          "Don't miss this on the Seward Highway southbound away from Anchorage. Several long boardwalks take you out over the marsh and away from the highway.",
          "We went by this area. Unfortunately there were no birds but seagulls when we went but friends went later and saw an eagle up close, nice for pictures",
          "It is a tranquil place to stop but there was not much to see. May be it was not the right season to see birds or fish as we were there in early June",
          "This is a wonderful addition to Anchorage, so close to the city yet accessible to everyone. When we arrived we were greet by a pair of low flying bald eagles. Birds we were particularly keen to see. There was plenty of birds to see and you go on the walkways to find the other",
          "Just getting to this location is worth the effort due to the amazing scenery. GREAT place for a visit. The boardwalk makes for easy access to the birds and possible wildlife viewing. Just beautiful!",
          "Potter Marsh Bird Sanctuary is a glorious contradiction. Peaceful wildlife setting adjacent to a busy highway and shooting range. It is perfectly designed. The parking is easy, and the boardwalk has many stopping points to dilute the crowd. We arrived in early evening when the",
          "Great chance to look for local birds and wildlife. There is a long boardwalk to walk along into the marsh area to see a variety of wildlife.",
          "I love this place. I walk here multiple times a week just to see how things change. Right now (May 2016) there is a pretty great eagle nest right off the boardwalk, which makes the chance of seeing an eagle pretty high. I don't get as excited about that as the tourists do, but",
          "Close to Anchorage (5-10 minutes) and has a long deck walk with many info signs. Safe for kids and there is a camp host on site. Grandchildren love it so we go back again and again. NO COST is great.",
          "The Potter Marsh boardwalk is a great structure that gives you a peek into a wildlife refuge space close to the city of Anchorage. It is also a great place to see birds. The only downside to the marsh is something that they have no control over, and that is the shooting range",
          "This is nice place to have a nice little walk on the boardwalk in the evening. You can have a picnic on one of the benches. There are reading boards all along the boardwalk that will tell you what is going on in the area. The bird watching is great. Just sit quietly and",
          "We rode by this area several times before we decided to stop by and check it out. There is a raised walk that allows you to have unobstructed views of the Marsh and the wildlife that inhabit the area. we saw a large variety of birds. The high point was seeing a pair of Swans.",
          "Sadly the very busy Seward Highway along Patters Marsh, in addition to the Rabbit Creek Gun Range, the area is too noisy and polluted. It's too bad. I have seen many moose here and a multitude of migratory birds. Sadly there is only one pull out along the highway. The",
          "It's nicely set up with informative displays about local avian life. Boardwalk can sometimes get crowded but it's a great time and pretty scenery.",
          "Potter's Marsh is just a short drive from Anchorage and worth seeing. We arrived early on the day and saw several different ducks and birds, but the highlight was moose grazing near the Boardwalk. Such a treat!",
          "yesterday was a lovely day to be on the boardwalk. beautiful view of the mountain and the inlet. not to many birds were out. its a free place to visit. they do have a donation box available. :-)",
          "A good place to see the Signet & Trumpeter swans. Also has a very nice walkway for bird/wildlife watching if one has the time.",
          "Just on the edge of Anchorage is Potter Marsh and it is worth a stop as you venture down the Turnagain Arm. Easily walkable and great views of scenery and wildlife.",
          "I love walking along the boardwalks in this sanctuary! There are places to sit, different areas and birds that are really fun to watch. Arctic terns, Canadian geese, swans, eagles and songbirds that occupy the little houses hung in the trees for them. Awesome! During the warmer",
          "I love the new boardwalk they installed, absolutely gorgeous place to go for a nice walk and watch the birds.",
          "This is an easy area to hike, easy to reach and very peaceful and pretty (especially for being so close to the highway). We will return again to this pretty spot!",
          "We were driving past a second time in two days and saw a gathering of approx. 6 moose in the marsh. Too bad because we were there the day before and all I caught was a chickadee in my lens.",
          "In the summer this place is teeming with birds of all sorts! I love the boardwalks that go over the marsh and the blinds for bird viewing. It is great for all outdoors lovers including those of limited mobility.",
          "We stopped to stretch our legs and stayed over an hour. Saw bald eagles and many other birds. really a nice walkway too.",
          "We have been to here often and its a great place to watch birds or just enjoy a great view of the mountains. Bring a jacket because it could be chilly even during summer time.",
          "Depending on the time of year, you can see birds, fish and sometimes even wildlife. Nice boardwalk to mousy on and enjoy the scenery. Tends to be windy from the coast.",
          "The Potter Marsh Bird Sanctuary is worth a casual stroll along the board walk, very peaceful looking at the waterbirds. There were no moose when we did the walk, which was a pity. Take your camera as you can get some lovely photos.",
          "I always enjoy stopping and walking along the boardwalks at the nature preserve. It's a great place to see the sunset in the winter. Of course there's not much bird activity during the winter until the summer. But it's a nice place to walk and be outside even if it was windy!",
          "I'm not sure myself why but I love this place. Have stopped here on previous Alaska vacations and it's a place I will stop at over and over. To start with, it is just plane pretty. At different times, we have seen moose, bald eagles, spawning salmon, and a multitude of other",
          "The Bird Sanctuary has an awesome boardwalk system that is 100% ADA and wheelchair accessible. The boardwalk is a nice level ans smooth walk, and it winds out into the Potter Marsh, with lots of seasonal bird watching and even salmon returning to spawn in the local stream.",
          "Not too many birds here but it is beautiful with the Turnagain Arm right behind you and the Chugach National Park on the other.",
          "On the way to Seward, just as you leave Anchorage, this is a wonderful place to stop and walk the boardwalks. Depending on the time of year you go there are tons of birds, even if most have flown on for the winter, still stop and see it, it is a wonderful walk. There is a",
          "We kept seeing this from Seward Highway and finally caught a nice weather day. So glad we stopped and walked through this interesting Bird Sanctuary. Got some great photos of snow capped mountains reflecting in the water with grass framing the reflection.",
          "The noise from the highway disturbs the sanctity of the place and there werent very many birds in July. So overall average. Its a little further down from Anchorage so if you dont have a car, you will need to take a taxi.",
          "The drive to here and walk on boardwalk was scenic and enjoyable even during late November. We got to see a moose here. It would be even better when the marsh was not frozen.",
          "Some people heading north to Anchorage find parking along pullouts along the highway. There is a parking lot north of the marsh. Walking is on a boardwalk where you can view wildlife below and birds above. We saw 2 young moose eating and walking in the water along the",
          "Take the board walk out to view ducks and look down on spawning streams. Potter Marsh has some of the best birding areas in the country. I've seen many migratory species here. Eagles are often visible along the edges (bring binoculars or a long camera lens). The marsh was",
          "My family and I visit Potter's Marsh a couple of times during the summer. We like walking on the boardwalk from one end to the other. Our last visit was in August. It was fun to watch the salmon. They were bright red! We saw different kinds of ducks, eider and mallards.",
          "A great stop for any serious photographer during summer and the migration seasons. Lots of aquatic fowl and lots of great photo ops.",
          "You cannot go wrong visiting Potter Marsh. We just visited this past week and although we did not see any wildlife, there were amazing views to take photos of.",
          "We drove through the area and had to stop and see. The wildlife here was amazing. The walkways were nice. The views all around were absolutely stunning. You could spend a long time here with a good set of binoculars!!",
          "Like my title says its right along the main highway but still its a beautiful place like 100% of the rest of my home state. It requires a quality camera to get good shots from teh board walk but fortunatley you can drive around all of the marsh and get better viewing points if",
          "Stopped on our way to Girdwood on rainy day in early October. Didn't see more than a few birds but the boardwalk, setting, sounds, and view made it a great place for a few moments of respite. Lovely.",
          "Go. You will be amazed at the diversity of the bird life here. It is a good place for children, but quiet is the key to a successful visit here.",
          "Saw some seagulls there once, but usually see more birds in my backyard. It's a nice transition from the ugly scenes that have grown up along the Seward Highway in Anchorage to the beauty of Turnagain Arm, which never gets old. Not a destination in itself. Not really worth",
          "The well-kept boardwalk provides an excellent opportunity to overlook the marsh and see wetland wildlife.",
          "Beautiful scenery. Didn't see any animals, but it could have been just the time of day/weather. Great stop for a quiet leisurely walk. Several others had kids with them enjoying it as well",
          "Just a few minutes drive south of Anchorage this is a truly amazing sanctuary to watch birds and salmon and view some of the spectacular scenery around the Anchorage area. Their are boardwalk elevations as well as telescopes, plenty of parking space and a family friendly",
          "We visited Potter Marsh in the spring. It was an excess of bird sounds. The world was turning green as we watched. Lots of shorebirds and lots of nesting gulls. It's a good place to walk and has a great raised platform.",
          "There are two boardwalks that take you deep into the Marsh. These include signs describing different aspects of the area. Unfortunately this day had little wildlife, only some ducks, salmon and a single bald eagle in the distance. It was still a nice diversion",
          "An enjoyable walk on this boardwalk. Saw a lot of salmon, two eagles, birds etc. Highly recommend it for an easy nature outing. The bathrooms were amazingly clean for an outdoor spot.",
          "We saw people walking along the boardwalk while we were driving along. We love birds, so decided to take a closer look. We saw all kinds of cool birds (see photo of posted list), including Trumpeter Swans! Also saw salmon swimming in the creeks. Cool!!",
          "One of my favorite things about fall is looking for the swan pairs around Southcentral as the leaves fall, the temperature drops, and the russets and reds ad yellows abound. I can always count on Potter Marsh to show me a pair or two at this time of year. Enjoy!",
          "It may be that we visited on a bad day for birds. The marsh is easy to find, though you wouldn't want to hike on the mud flats--you'll sink right in.",
          "We stopped to see what we could see - some birds - this place was well marked and a perfect view over the marsh",
          "A nice place to stop. Great Boardwalk. Well maintained. We visited twice, once on our way to Whittier, once on the way back. We were a little disappointed each time by the small number of birds. I'm sure it's better in other seasons but it was pretty quiet in the beginning of",
          "This is a bird sanctuary, and you really ought to see it with the birds are in season. We went at the end of August and saw a fabulous boardwalk and nary a bird but the omnipresent diving ducks.",
          "We loved Potter Marsh. There is a walk way built around parts of it and you can watch all kinds of different birds, etc. We saw swans, salmon, lots of birds I don't know what they are and a moose. The day before there was a bear with two cubs in the marsh also we were told.",
          "This is one of my favorite spots near Anchorage. There are plenty of birds, a great view of Turnagain Arm, and a boardwalk accessible for wheelchairs and strollers. Walk out the boardwalk on the highway side to see the salmon. It is exciting when the train comes by.",
          "My wife and I visited potter marsh while we were touring Alaska. It's a very nice place to visit and is a short drive from downtown Anchorage. There is a very nice boardwalk you get to walk on that hovers over part of the marsh. Some cool birds were floating around and we saw",
          "Very cool area with boardwalk the you can walk out on a see the birds as well as seeing a mouse by the tree line",
          "THis is an amazing marsh to film swans ....but must catch them in Cotober ... and the other birds and wildlife is fun !!! Do not miss this if you are in Alaska. There is a platform to provide the viewer with an even closer look !!! NOT TO BE MISSED !!!",
          "One of the best places in Anchorage to view wildlife safely. In the spring look for migratory birds and keep an eye out for moose. The boardwalk is family friendly and handicapped accessible making it a great spot for all.",
          "Very close to the city is a good way to start your journey in Alaska. We were there in August early in the morning and we saw a nive Bald Eagle vey close. Probably spring/autumn is the best season.",
          "Really enjoyed this place..boardwalk has increased since we were there last...very good. Saw a moose",
          "This was a nice place to visit, even though we didn't see many birds on the day that we visited. Maybe it was too cold of a day?",
          "This is a nice little stop and worth it if you have the time. Just outside Anchorage. Two nice boardwalks. We saw an eagle, and lots of salmon. I am sure at times there could be bear, moose, and who knows what else. Very nice.",
          "We hiked the boardwalks of Potter's Marsh. It was a peaceful experience on a warm, cloudless day. It was midday and we saw ducks, geese and an eagle. Most of the birds were probably out of the sun of midday. The highway is a bit distracting. I enjoyed the back boardwalk the best.",
          "Long, impressive boardwalks for viewing wildlife, easy access. We saw salmon, shore birds, ducks, geese, bear paw prints, and eagles. The views of the marsh itself were not as pretty as from the road. It\u2019s free and a great place to bring little ones because you don\u2019t have to",
          "Nice long boardwalk that spans out into the marsh. Lots of birds and ducks, but also bear and moose can frequently be spotted as well. There are restrooms open year round too.",
          "Beautiful scenery, birds and creek to view as you walk easily along a well maintained wooden walkway for hundreds of yards out over this marsh.",
          "The water levels in August are vary low which means very little wildlife are in the marsh. We walked the board walk and only saw 2 ducks and a volunteer searching for an eagle.",
          "In the evening we saw two bald eagles and their fledgling, plus a belted kingfisher that kept diving for his dinner in addition to many shore birds (mostly lesser yellow legs). Early Saturday afternoon isn't the best time as the nearby shooting range is a constant barrage of",
          "Don't miss this place right on the Seward Highway just outside Anchorage. Walk the boardwalk and see lots of birds - we saw a bald eagle and its fledgling. Don't miss the salmon spawning in the creek, either. Great place to bring kids - we saw several families there. It's free,",
          "The extensive board walk is impressive. Lots of viewing stations, yet we didn't see that many birds and zero mammals. Probably due to the time of day and the number of people (ie running children). Even though its near the highway, you feel like you are out in the marsh/country.",
          "It was a nice break in the driving from Homer to Anchorage. We saw many bear and moose tracks but no animals. We did see eagles, snow geese and other birds. Fish we saw rainbow trout and sockeye salmon. It was a nice leisurely walk and place to visit.",
          "Really nice boardwalks and views to spend some quick AK time if you don't have time to drive very far. Crazy fun when there is almost 24hrs of sunlight.",
          "Get out of your car and enjoy the boardwalk. You might see eagles-certainly some ducks. We saw salmon from the boardwalk over a little creek. The bathrooms are typical Alaska-basically porta-potties, but very clean and no smell. Just a perfect walk.",
          "A very nice facility with boardwalk over marsh for visitors. Located short drive south of Anchorage.",
          "Potter Marsh is a great place to view birds and possibly other animals as well. We were able to see the Pink Salmon make their run from Cook Inlet up through the marsh as they came in from the sea through a tunnel that runs under the highway. It is a beautiful place.",
          "Located just off a major highway, this Bird sanctuary is a bird watcher's delight. The down-side is try and make it here early in morning or late in afternoon/evening. We only could make it at late morning when there were lots of other tourists and not many birds around.",
          "Not many things in Alaska are free but this was one of the lovely places that was. The boardwalk is very well constructed and the different plaques are very informative. Although it's close to the interstate at one point, it's very quite and a great peaceful view. Didn't see",
          "This is a wonderful place for bird watchers. We saw several species including eagles (and nest), terns, geese and ducks. The boardwalks are great. We even saw a muskrat one of the times we went. It is an easy place to get to from Anchorage. During our two week stay we went",
          "We visited early in the morning and was happy to find a person leading a walk and talk through the boardwalk. There was a moose and baby at the edge of the field that we watched. An eagle and baby were also in a nest. The guides set up a scope and we were able to see the",
          "Nice walk ways, great marsh,and informative signs. Easy to identify several species at any visit. We have made several visits there.",
          "Depends on time of day and time of year, but always a good way to get out and see birds and wildlife",
          "Potter Marsh is part of Anchorage's Coastal Wildlife Refuge. It is easily accessed from the Seward Highway and is well worth a visit at any time of year. You never know what you will see there. On a recent sunny July afternoon we watched a Bald Eagle chick about ready to leave",
          "Many, many nicely designed platforms above a marshy area. We viewed lots of birds. Did not see salmon or any other fish. A good stop along the road for an hour or so.",
          "We visited from 7:30-9:00 p.m. in mid-July. The weather was terrific, and because there were fewer people, it was very peaceful. We watched the marsh birds run about, saw little fish leaping from the water and saw a playful ermine chasing the birds! The boardwalk is sturdy,",
          "This is a short drive from ANC but we spotted 2 Bull Moose and a number of bald eagles. The boardwalk makes the walking easy.",
          "Scenic view that gives you a chance to see lots of different wildlife all year around. Even if birdwatching isn't your \"thing\", it's a nice little walk.",
          "I walked around the boardwalk, but did not see many birds or other wildlife. However I was only there a short amount of time.",
          "I'm not a birder. We had hoped to maybe see a moose and didn't. It's definitely worth stopping for 15 or 20 minutes to walk the boardwalks. The scenery is beautiful. I would definitely stop again if I were in the area. We enjoyed strolling along and seeing all the birds.",
          "well i saw many zooming lens and i assume it must be something worth it in for them. well i am not big into photography so found the place nice but nothing i would have missed.",
          "If you are a more serious birder, you will find birds here. There were warblers, chickadees, etc. in the trees and ducks, sandpipers and gulls in and near the water. I think we saw around 15 species despite it being in the middle of an afternoon. Take advantage of the parking",
          "Easy walk along a board walk. Lots and lots of different birds plus a moose. Probably not a great place for kids that aren't interested in birds and who might run along the boardwalk disturbing folks who are looking at the birds.",
          "Here was this beautiful Boardwalk Lots of birds and flowers We walked around and looked through telescopes",
          "What a pleasant place to visit when in the Anchorage area. We saw some great wildlife including a pair of bald eagles, arctic terns, pintail ducks, and 3 moose. You can stop by for 30 minutes or so or stay the entire afternoon and be patient while you seek out wildlife.",
          "we had a nice walk along the trail. However we did not see much wildlife. Probably it was too early. The area is very scenic and quiet.",
          "We were with friends who suggested a stop here. This is a series of boardwalks through a marshy area. We saw various birds, ducks and otters. In one area, there are salmon congregating. Due to recent dry weather some of the normally wet area was quite dry. Our friends have seen",
          "Stopped here to try and spot some wildlife. Got to see a bald eagle nest with it's eagle. Also saw a moose eating. Was told it was a momma and that the baby was hidden under some brush.",
          "This is a good place to stop to observe some wildlife, and see views of mountains. Its pretty simple, not the most exciting place to stop.",
          "We had some tome before our flight home and visited Potters Marsh for several hours. Very relaxing place to wait before going to the airport. Lots of birds and wildlife.",
          "Vast expanse of bird watching can be seen from the Seward Hwy, as you drive along Cook Inlet. (If you are the driver - watch the road, as others will be watching the birds.) Park and walk the boardwalk for the best views.",

          "Lovely although very few birds and waterfowl in late September as they are migrating. Did see some ducks, trumpeter swans, and others.",
          "Quiet today with only ducks present",
          "Pretty spot off the highway to go birdwatching",
          "Extensive wooden boardwalk with signage on one end. Other end simply has a gravel pullout, I think (we didnt stop). Parking lot has a pit toilet. When we went in the summer there was a camp host. Paw prints in the cement in the parking lot \u2026",
          "Always clean and has bathrooms. One of my favorite walks in Anchorage! Boardwalks over the marsh give you a unique view.",
          "A must visit place!",
          "Just a beautiful place to be!",
          "Very nice seen alot wildlife",
          "Worth the visit. Lucky to have this available so close to Anchorage.",

          "Safe and fun!",
          "Scenic boardwalk bird watching close to Anchorage",
          "Alska is beautiful city.",
          "A quiet place to watch the birds",
          "Beautiful stop",
          "Potter's Marsh isn't only a bird sanctuary, it's also a people sanctuary. This is a great place to take visitors or just a nice stop for locals who want to take a break from the highway. In the winter you can often skate here, in the fall look for swans, and in the summer pick some wild sweet gale.",
          "A surprisingly awesome place!",
          "A nice short walk on a well maintained elevated path. It is out and back, not a loop. If it looped it would get a higher rating. The path has several bridges over creeks so there is a chance of seeing salmon run if the season is right. Good place to see birds. I saw signs of moose, but no actual moose sightings here for me. ",
          "Any sanctuary is good sanctuary",
          "A peaceful experience",
          "Neat place to watch the Salmon and a few birds.  Minus one star for the loud traffic, but interesting interpretive signs and beautiful boardwalk.  Very family friendly.",
          "Very cool",
          "We didn't see anything. We didn't have binoculars. If you're lucky might see some birds.",
          "If you are doing the drive from the Kenai to Anchorage, this is a worthy stopping point.  The boardwalks take you out into the wetlands where there are great birding opportunities.  I particularly enjoyed watching the salmon swimming upstream.  ",
          "This place has some wildlife like moose(rarely) , birds and bald eagles. There is trail in which people say you may spot a bear, if you are lucky, but I did not take up the trail. Not a very good spot for wildlife viewing. It has lots of \u2026",
          "Very nice view of the wet lands there , board walk stretchable pretty far maybe a quarter mile , you can spot eagles nest and Eagles on the far left side of the walk away from the high way. Also a dirt path that leads to parking moose can be spotted there too. On the walk by the high way underneath the walk there's salmon.",
          "Simply amazing.",
          "Great scenery",
          "I love the boardwalk. Depending on the time of year, you get to see a variety of wildlife up close without disturbing them.",
          "Great place to take pictures or go for a walk. Always wildlife here",
          "Amazing display of nature. We were there during the salmon run season. A huge, 42 inch, King lingering just below one of the walking bridges. ",
          "Spectacular views and wildlife. Close to many other beautiful highway stops.",
          "A fantastic bird and wildlife viewing venue right in the middle of an urban setting.",
          "Great boardwalks and good moose viewing along old rabbit creek road.  Great ice skating in the winter.",
          "Great spot for watching wild life, seen all kinds of creatures. ",

          "Great views. Nice place to sit and relax.",

          "Good to transverse the boardwalk to see the birds below you in the Marsh land below ",
          "Saw a kingfisher!",
          "Nice place to take a walk and bird watch, for an hour or so. Not a big board walk.",

          "Beautiful scenery and a chance to see bears and eagles",
          "Great spot",
          "Great birding spot.",

          "Not as many birds as I thought ",
          "Beautiful place",
          "Suitable for eco-photography, wild bird appearance and a great place to walk outdoors, it is also a famous tourist attraction on the outskirts of Anglet.\n\n",

Its exact boundaries are controversial. It is served by Inlet View Elementary School, Romig Junior High and West Anchorage High School. Its scenic features include Elderberry Park, the Oscar Anderson House, the Westchester Lagoon, and access to the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail and the Lainie Fleischer Bike Trail. It is located near the tidal flats of Cook Inlet. The Alaska Railroad passes between the residential zones of Bootleggers Cove and the tidal flats. Bootlegger's Cove was affected by the 1964 Alaska earthquake. It is currently represented in the Alaska State Legislature by Representative Les Gara and Senator Johnny Ellis.\nIn 2003 Bootlegger Cove resident Bethany Correira was kidnapped, and her body was later found abandoned by a roadside north of Anchorage. Her employer and landlord, Michael Lawson, was eventually convicted of her kidnapping and murder.\n\n\n== External links ==\nhttp://www.muni.org/Departments/OCPD/Planning/Documents/Map_5_Northwest_Bowl.pdf\n\n\n== References ==\nMunicipality of Anchorage map\nTower, Elizabeth (2003).

          "Great trail along the coast. I only walked portions of it in different areas, but it's a great way to stretch your legs and see different environments around the city.",
          "We took this bike tour with Elly as our giude. She is very knowledgeable about the area and shares lots of great information. We saw two moose on our morning ride. I highly recommend this tour. Thanks Elly, you are the best!",
          "Rented a bicycle to enjoy the length of this coastal trail. Beautiful views and even the occasional moose sighting. Definitely worth the time to walk, run or bike along this trail.",
          "This trail is very well maintained, paved, and follows the coastline through the forest of Anchorage. We did not see any moose or bears but there is always the possibility. At the turnaround point there is a HUGE hill with a small building that has restrooms and an observation",
          "The Coastal Trail is well maintained year round however that makes it incredibly crowded particularly on good days.",
          "You can see all of downtown anchorage and trails leading to eagle river and south Anchorage. Get a bike and see it all. Great for weekends. You will see some homeless folks. Usually no problems.",
          "In early October, this was a bit gloomy, but I KNOW it would be stunning on a bright day. This is a gem if you lived nearby. I would bike this trail daily or be out with my dog. An easy walk, wide and paved.",
          "This is one of the best parts of Anchorage. Wonderful scenery, some wildlife, and great exercise. For the most part safe place to wander and explore. Earthquake Park especially interesting with view of the City.",
          "This is a paved trail that stretches from downtown to Kincaid Park. It is relatively easy to navigate and offers opportunities to see some local wildlife. There are mile markers, benches and a few dirt paths leading to the water. Want free parking? Start your hike at Kincaid",
          "We really enjoyed this trail - just 11 miles long in the heart of Anchorage. When you ride the trail, you leave the city behind and immerse yourself in the woods along the shore. Really fun ride that may include some wildlife if you are lucky!",
          "A gr8 20 mile round trip hike with lots of picnic spots and view points to view nature and wildlife. Its better to pack some sandwiches and water to bike as there is minimal food available in the trail itself.",
          "We enjoyed this trail on bike and found it very interesting. Tons of great views of the coastline and the land. You can make it as long (up to 22 miles) or short as you prefer. Overall the terraine wasn't that hilly so it would be easy for most folks to ride. The coastline is",
          "We walked on it a bit, on a sunny day, when the tides were low, and saw 20+ belugas swimming up into Knik Arm. I recommend taking binoculars.",
          "My wife and I had a great time walking on this beautiful trail. You need to be aware of the bike riders that are not respectful of others walking on the trail. Only a few good bike riders gave us a warning when they approached from behind. Also, several bike riders were",
          "Great trail. Rented a bike and took the trail. We chose to take 11 miles and then continue. I recommend this as we got to see more of landscape and into the city a bit where we stopped for lunch along the way to watch seaplanes land and takeoff at Lake Hood. Something new to",
          "This was a great way to burn off some of the extra calories from the cruise ship. I haven't been on a bike in years and we rented bikes at the top of the hill, walked them down to the start of the path and then rode for about 7.5 miles. The path was very easy to navigate even",
          "We didn\u2019t walk very far only a couple miles and was fascinated by an ocean beach with no water. Obviously the tide was out! Wish we had more time or chose to rent electric bikes to see while trail.",
          "If It is smokey skip this walk/ride. Couldn\u2019t see a thing while we were there this week. Actually hard to breathe.",
          "What a peaceful walk to enjoy the views and history of Anchorage. You need to be aware of the bicyclists.",
          "I walked this track in the morning then went back in the afternoon for a bike ride. The scenery was gorgeous! Wide pathways so plenty of space for everyone. Many viewing areas to take in the beautiful vistas. I would highly recommend doing this trail.",
          "Do some research on where to start. We started by the international house of hot dogs and went south on the coast for a few miles.. with bike rentals available right next door. Cheapest prices I saw. They have regular and electric. We got regular and made it a few miles out, but",
          "My sister and I rented bikes and did the whole trail. So beautiful and peaceful. We had a fantastic time. Thanks!",
          "After hiring cycles from Downtown Bicycle Rental we tackled the 11 mile trail and back. Really great, scenic trail throughout. Lots of places to stop and take in the views on the way. Although a coastal trail the trail goes through a number of parks and woodlands too and you",
          "Disappointed based on the reviews. We walked a portion of the trail and it was underwhelming. It was also low tide so there was not much to see while we were walking. The surrounding areas were also unkept and had used clothing and other personal items. I would pass if you are",
          "This was a great outdoor activity. Very friendly guide who made sure everyone had fun and was able to keep pace. Saw a moose and her little one on the trail. We stopped and safely took pictures. Learned about 1964 Earthquake at Earthquake park. A must.",
          "Easy. Fun. Some people don\u2019t understand etiquette for riding and walking. Other than that lots of smiles back.",
          "This is a nice paved trail near the water, a great way to stretch your legs after traveling a long way. We actually saw beluga whales out in the inlet, which was a treat.",
          "We loved renting bikes and riding this whole trail! It felt like we were far away, but it was easily accessible from our hotel.",
          "I've walked along this trail more times than I can count. Very pretty walk, especially if you enter through Elderberry park and go left. I have never done the entire trail as it is very long but would absolutely recommend people check out.",
          "This trail is pleasant and well maintained. An easy, level walking tour, but access points are few and far between.",
          "This trail follows the coastline and leads past lakes and waterways. There isn\u2019t much seating but there is variety and it doesn\u2019t cost anything.",
          "Definitely a nice ride out to pass a few hours, not sure I\u2019d recommend for young families as it\u2019s quite long and the uphills can be fairly arduous. Great views of the cook inlet, lots of people taking photos of the mudflats. The highlight for me was seeing a mumma moose and her",

          "Love it. Great for walking/ running (did both). Lots of people, bikes so always felt safe. Trail is 11 miles with views of ocean and wooded sections. Go one way you head into town, the other you head to Earthquake park. Great trail for whole family with places to stop & take a",
          "What an awesome way to explore Anchorage, bicycling from downtown and continuing past the airport to Kincaid Park. Not only will you learn about our planets with proportionally-spaced educational placards along the way, you\u2019ll see firsthand the effects of Anchorage\u2019s 9.2",
          "We spent a half day exploring the trail and we could have made it a much longer visit. Lots of wildlife, scenery and fauna to see. The trail is relatively easy, with a few moderate inclines along the way. One of our highlights of our Anchorage visit that we will look to do again",
          "I thought Anchorage would be the Jewel in Alaska, instead it's a grotty old city lost somewhere between 1970 and 1980. Granted it does have some pretty cool restaurants , but that is where it ends, until we found this bike trail. 11 miles of flat easy bike trail following the",

          "My husband and I rented a tandem bike and hit the trail, doing about 8 miles of it and back. The trail is well maintained and alternates between being in the shade of the trees and overlooks of the sea. There are plenty of stops and of course the planet walk if you want to take",

          "The path hugs the coast, and connects a series of parks and sights of interest. These include earthquake park, reed beds, salmon lakes and beautiful forest. You can easily cycle the trail, or walk if feeling energetic. We saw Moose and huge Crane birds up close, and all manner",
          "We arrived during high 80s heat wave so we didn't walk the entire trail. There are several places where you can drive to the trail and park, so we did that in several places and just walked a little ways from each location. The views of Cook Inlet and downtown Anchorage were",
          "On a nearly perfect 75-degree day, my husband, adult son and our friends took a bike ride down the trail which was easily accessed from near Pablo's Bike Rentals. The trail is well maintained, has several bike repair stations (something I had never seen), a lot of variety and",
          "We rented e-bikes from Alaska E-Bike and had a blast riding 22 miles in 2 hours. The trail is beautifully constructed, very well maintained and very scenic. We saw 2 moose during our ride!",

          "We biked 10 of the miles one way of the Tony Knowles Coastal trail. Great trail and lots of nature to see. If you have a couple of hours, make sure to make time to bike the trail. It is definitely worth it!",
          "We went out yesterday on the Tony Knowles bike tour. First, the quality of the bikes they provided us were fantastic. Our guides were extremely knowledgeable and so friendly. This is a must when in Anchorage!!!",
          "I am a runner, and one of the first things I did when I was planning my trip to Anchorage was look for running trails. I am so glad I found this trail! The view from the trail is beautiful. Lots of opportunities to spot wildlife, nature, or if you're looking to get a nice",
          "We flew into Anchorage for a one night stay and had the whole afternoon to explore the city. We rented bikes and rode the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail. It was a beautiful afternoon, clear skies and a really fun way to traverse the trail. We even saw a black bear in the meadow",
          "Okay, i have to prefix this with that it wasn\u2019t your typical ride. But still it was well worth it, beautiful view, couldn\u2019t quite see Denali but still if you like to ride and look at nature well worth it. Now for my ride, at about 7.5 miles a mama bear crossed my path (scary",
          "Wonderful trail which goes all the way to Kincaid Park (10Mi.). Cook Inlet view on one side and Alaska fauna on the other. This is a multi Use trail which gets well used on sunny summer days.",
          "A great way to see the beauty of nature, trails that go on forever. You can walk ride ,skateboard. See the ocean, wildlife, sunsets, and just have an overall enjoyable time",
          "We biked the trail and while a bit busy (it was a weekend) we never felt it was over-crowded or that we couldn't go slower to appreciate the views of the Cook Inlet. Rented from Downtown Bike Rentals who were more than helpful with maps and information",

          "My husband and I wanted to get some exercise while we were in Anchorage, so we decided to spend a couple of hours on the trail. We started at the entrance near Christensen Drive and 2nd Avenue. We walked for an hour to Earthquake Park and then walked back the same way. The trail",
          "We recently rented bikes at the Copper Whale Inn Bike kiosk and spent a wonderful hour or so biking down the Coastal Trail 4 miles to the Airport Inlet Overlook. Beautiful views of Cook Inlet constantly. Ride is easy with few hills and wide enough to pass with courtesy. Also",

          "We rented a couple of bikes from Pablo's and rode the whole 11.5 mile length of this trail. It was a lot of fun and my wife the non-bike rider had a great time too. Rolling hills except for the final hill to the park which both of us had to walk our bikes up tot he park.",
          "This is a good filler in Anchorage! We are walkers so it was a great trail for us. All concrete paths. Some wildlife to view but not a lot.",
          "If your time is limited, definitely start from the south end and take a bike. Walking from the north end, you'll be right by the edge of downtown, which might be convenient, but it will be more crowded and developed.",
          "We rented electric bikes at Pablo\u2019s and enjoyed three hours doing the 11 mile trail both ways. Lovely! Beware the hill near the park at the end is brutal! Thank goodness we had the ebike!",
          "Nice, quiet and relaxing walk along the trail. Access the trail from 5th Avenue. There were park benches along the trail.",
          "Fun way to see some areas around the city! It was just myself and my husband that morning so we got a very private tour. We rode through the parks and along the coastal walkway, saw two moose along the way. Elly and Frankie were very knowledgeable about the city and answered all",
          "we spent a day in anchorage and did this as a part of our anchorage stay. we rented bikes from downtown bicycle rental which is 1 mile or less from where the trail starts. we were 4 adults and a 3 year old . 3 year old was in the tag along and adults were on booster bikes",
          "If you\u2019re looking for an easy walk with nice views of the city, then definitely go here. The trail is very long, but there are many different access points so you can walk as much or as little as you want. It is shared with bikes, so make sure you stay to the right. We almost",
          "Rented bikes at Pablo\u2019s and cruised the trail early in the morning. Beautiful, although I didn\u2019t see any wildlife which I was hoping for. It did start to get a little crowed at about 11:00, but by then we were done. Loved it. Another check off my bucket list!",
          "We were determined to travel this trail so on a gray and drizzle day we rented bikes from Pablo's and hit the trail. We were told by Bella at Pablo's to expect to see moose and maybe bear. We saw both. Up close too. 4 moose all together and a black bear with cubs - all right",
          "This is a Paved trail along the coast line . It is Mostly flat and easy. Good for bird watching . I\u2019d do this if I were training for a flat fast 5k or 10k",
          "We rented bikes and cycled this route on a hot day. It is beautiful route through woods, past mud flats with lots of places to stop and admire the view. There are also bike repair points. Not many places for drinks or snacks so be prepared",
          "We planned on the bike ride for the whole trail starts by Cooks monument all the way to KINCADE PARK. You see more wildlife ofn the southern section, take breaks and learn of the big earthquake and see how the land shifts. Moderate hills Enjoy the ride or walk.",
          "Went for a walk on the trial after dinner at the 49th state brewing. The trail was nice but I\u2019m not sure I would recommend the portion downtown for a woman traveling solo. Once it was more by the water there were lots of people and it was nice... just a little sketchy walking",
          "We rented bikes and went along the trail. It happened to be on a weekend and it was quite busy. The trail is 11 miles one way. We did not see any wildlife while we were there as is to be expected with all the people around, but it was a nice bike ride along the coast.",
          "My wife and I rented bikes from Pablo's and rode out the coastal trail. It was fun and scenic and good way to get some exercise in while seeing some sites. The info about the earthquake was very interesting. We tried walking through the earthquake zone but the mosquitoes were",
          "Riding this trail is remarkable. Full of hisotry and wild liffe. It goes 9 miles to the park where are always moose and bears to see. A failly easy trail, but still takes some effort. The earthwake park is haunting and the best way to see it is on bike. Rent from Pablo's.",

          "I was expecting a really enjoyable scenic route but it was not that interesting. The view over the water even at high level was a lot of mud flats of grey mud. The path was wide and well maintained and also good for riding, maybe a better way to go.",
          "Had some extra time before heading to the airport and decided to take a walk on the Trail. Started at the north end of the trail off W 2nd avenue and walked for about a half mile before turning around, since it appeared there was nothing special about this Trail. It was low tide",

          "This urban trail along the western coastline of Anchorage was well worth checking out. We rented bicycles downtown and hit the trail. The only bad mark was that after about a mile the trail detoured back into town due to a bridge being repaired and we got lost coming and going",
          "We walked this from the train station aiming for Earthquake park. At the cross over under the tracks at the creek they had closed the bridge and diverted us on 3 mile detour which was badly marked and took us along roads with no sidewalk into oncoming traffic. Ended up very",

          "Did the whole trail and thought it was really nice!! Great mix of flat and hills .. great scenery.. fun to stop and watch the planes taking off and landing..it was really busy because it was a Saturday and really nice out... would like to do it again when it\u2019s not so crowded!!",
          "Visiting town for just a few hours, time for just one thing to do..and I picked a bike ride on this trail. Fantastic coastal wide territorial views, estuary birdlife, forest riding too...and moose! Trail very well marked, wide, and enough people using to feel safe for this solo",
          "A very nice trail which can be combined with several other trails for a 30+ mile ride. We experienced a flat tire on our rented bike, and was running short on time, so we returned in on Coastal Trail. If lucky/smart one should choose to ride when the tide is in, otherwise the",
          "Unlike most of the Anchorage bike trails, this one does not run alongside noisy busy highways with multiple cross streets. It runs through heavy woods, meandering to frequent water views. We saw a moose. Overall, our most enjoyable ride in the 4 day, 121 mile bike trip in the",
          "Rented bikes from Pablo's and hit the trail. The bikes we're great but make sure you have them sized correctly, the bike repair station had been vandalized and therefore didn't have the Allen wrench for the seat post as they said. Would be better if they had quick release seat",
          "If you have a free day in Anchorage, or just want to explore at your own pace, do yourself a favor, and rent a bike downtown and hit the trail. The trail winds along the coast line as you head towards the airport. You will pass Westchester lagoon, a great place for bird",

          "Gorgeous walk along the coast from Anchorage to Earthquake Park or if you want, Kincaid Park. The trail is wide and immaculate and paved. It\u2019s shared by walkers and cyclists as well as many families enjoying the flora, birds, and scenic views. We had a clear day and saw Mt.",

          "This is a great trail that you can use year round. Whether it is walking or biking it goes from Anchorage to past the airport to Kincaid park. You can cross country ski in the winter.",
          "This is the first time walking this trail and the overall experience was excellent! Great and beautiful walking trail. While walking the trail we were very fortunate to see a moose grazing in the tree line. I do recommend walking the trail early in the morning to avoid the crowd",
          "My husband and I Ubered to the end and walked the entire 10 miles back to our hotel. It was quite disappointing. I don't get the appeal. You can't predict animal behavior, but we did not see much at all. A few birds is it. There are a few signs along the way to read and if you",

          "Clean fresh air you can smell the ocean. Great place to take a walk or run. You will most likely see wild life. And being in the moment and relaxed. Great way to start a vacation & know the surrounding plus stretch after a long plane ride from lower 48. Very nice, clean & kept",
          "We spent about 3.5 hours biking this network of trails and did not ride on all of them. Perfect weather for our ride, but I'd make it again even on a rainy day. Beware of cyclers passing without announcing that they are \"on your left.\"",
          "The trail was pretty cool and offered decent views, but I've seen prettier coastlines. I think it would've been cooler if we could've biked it (covered more ground), but I was there with my parents and they were too scared to bike. Positives: The trail was easy to walk on",
          "My wife and I began our 2 week Alaska visit in Anchorage. We rented bikes to ride the Coastal Trail and get our first glimpse of outdoor Alaska. The trail is great; smooth and shared by walkers, runners, strollers, visitors and locals alike. Approximately 4 miles from our",

          "We rented ebikes and rode the entire trail. We were tight on time and the ebikes made the ride easy and enjoyable. Allow several hours if you want to ride the entire 22 miles. Much of the trail is in the shade so I\u2019d recommend bringing at jacket if you ride in the morning. We",

          "We walked along part of the trail on two occasions during our trip and saw some good views of Anchorage from a somewhat different perspective. It was quite something to realise that this city is only just over 100 years old and was hit hard by the 1964 earthquake which",

          "We took a stroll on the trail as we were only in town to pick up our rental car and grab lunch but the weather was warm and sunny so we took a little extra time to enjoy. The trail was bustling with people walking and riding bikes on this enjoyable Saturday. I would recommend",
          "We rented an electrical bike and had an awesome time . For the plane lovers you go right near the airport and it feels the planes are landing on you ! . Great views !",
          "Just want to let everyone know that there are some pretty things to see on this trail, but mostly what you will see during the day is a mud flat when the tide is out. Lots of people, and I believe if you actually got to see an animal that something would have to be wrong with",
          "The path parallels the coastline from near the Captain Cook monument in downtown Anchorage and seems to go forever. We didn't have time to go more than a mile or so, but enjoyed the stroll while in Anchorage.",
          "Yes, you need mosquito spray. With that said, what a gorgeous place to walk and wander. As a science teacher, I was very interested in the information about the earthquake. The exhibits were well done. The paths were smooth and easy to walk, also.",
          "Only complaint is with all of the walkers and bikers, there should be additional restroom facilities and availability of drinking water. It was so nice to be out along the water and see views of Denali. Major stop for most to watch planes come in to land.",
          "I have been on city trails all over the country. This one is outstanding. Rent a bike and ride it or walk a section but give it a try. You can get on the trail downtown and get to Westchester Lagoon about a mile away. From there you can take the right fork and continue along the",
          "We rented a couple of bikes from a place on 4th street in downtown. Then we rode the 11 mile long Tony Knowles Trail (22 miles round trip). It was beautiful but there are several significant hills along the way. It is totally worth doing but just be aware of the physical demand.",
          "This is a well maintained paved trail that starts in downtown and goes a long way (not sure where it ends). It is great for walking or biking, and it is not difficult. We started the trail at Earthquake Park. Note there are two lookouts on the map that are definitely worth",

          "We spent the better part of a day walking from downtown to Earthquake Park and back and had a wonderful time. The trail is mostly level, though hilly when you get to Earthquake Park. We wanted to stretch our legs after a long flight to Anchorage the previous day, and the trail",
          "Walking, running, and even a marathon. Have seen moose and fox. Denali is visible on a clear day, and between where you are and Denali - only wilderness. One can see south as well down Cook Inlet. Lots of waterfowl. Great place for a long run or bike ride. The further",

          "I love the Coastal trail all the way from downtown to the airport. I typically walk or jog and have even Segwayed on the coastal trail. Beware of moose, bear and some asinine bicyclists who refuse to yield or slow down. My child was nearly run over as he held my hand as we",
          "Probably one of the nicest trails we\u2019ve ever done... we rented e-bikes from Pablo\u2019s Bicycle Rentals, who is awesome (check out my review), and did the 22 mile back and forth trail. The scenery was breathtaking, it\u2019s smelled so fresh and pure and there were plenty of rest points",
          "We rented e-bikes from Pablo's to ride the 22 mile round trip coastal trail. It was a perfect (& easy!) way to do the trail. This is our second time renting e-bikes & we love them! We did the trail on May 25th & it was still pretty cold so we're glad we had layers & gloves!",

          "We rented bikes from Pablo's, rode nearly the 11 miles! The trail is beautiful, very well maintained. Whether walking or biking, everyone is out, enjoying vistas, wild life, points of historic interest. If I lived in Anchorage, I'd be on it daily!",
          "Excellent walking path. Very fortunate to see a moose who had just given birth in someones backyard 5 metres from the trail. So exciting. Lovely view of the mudflats and saw Denali mountain in all her glory . This viewing was about 5kilometres from the start of the path.",
          "Lived using this great path system that starts at the city and weaves its way along the coast then into forest. Excellent sign markings and overlook areas with seating. Take your own water as we could find anywhere to top up. Watch for moose and bears...They were there...And be",
          "After renting my bike from Pablo\u2019s I took the trail for about 6 miles kept thinking about how great this is compared to my spin class",
          "This is a great way to start your tour of Anchorage, and see some beautiful views of the mountains and the water. It\u2019s not really a trail, more like an urban walking path. Although it\u2019s popular with tourists, it\u2019s the kind of place you\u2019d jog if you were a local. We parked in a",

          "Full of beautiful homes and views of water and mountaintops this is a great, pretty easy to ride bike trail. We did the whole trail and then grabbed dinner at the end of the trail. Bike rental options are at the end of the trail. Some wildlife is rumored to visit the",

          "I first rode the Coastal Trail during a visit in May 2015. I returned to Anchorage in May 2018 and knew I wanted to ride the Trail again. I was still impressed with the trail and the scenery. My only negative continues to be lack of water or restrooms until you reach Kincaid",

          "You can jump on at 4th street and it goes on for almost 20!miles all around. Since I am not familiar with the area I was surprised there didn\u2019t seem to be any restrooms scattered along the way and also no outlet back up to the town without just turning around Worth it if running",

          "Go early in the morning. Most people saw moose and one person saw black bear. I went later in the day about 3pm and didn't see any of that. But it was a great trail and enjoyed every bit of it. This is probably the best thing to do in Anchorage other than shopping and going to",
          "I love these kind of trails. Easy to use, no fear of getting lost, and the scenery is beautiful. I usually wish I had a bike for it, as I have never been too far on this trail....my family makes us turn back.",
          "This is an easy trail, good for walking, biking, strollers, etc. Very long, so choose your route. Head into town for a chance to see moose...the trail out of town is pretty boring with not much to see.",
          "The trail is awesome. Very easy ride with incredible views most of the way. Some hills toward the end but you can walk your bike up them if you needed to. No water on the trail, so bring a bottle. Saw two moose when coming back the \"back\" way from the trail by Lake Hood.",
          "Great well maintained trail for all levels of cycling. Easy to access from bike rental downtown. Watch for moose on trail. Fall foliage was wonderful.",
          "This shared trail extends from downtown Anchorage to Kincaid Park, right along the Knik Arm. Great for strolls, bike rides, runs.",
          "We enjoyed the walking trail and wished we had rented bikes. A bike rental store with electric bikes is very close to the trail. We walked but would have gone the whole trail if we would have had bikes. We were visiting so didn't have our bikes with us.",
          "The walking and bike paths in Anchorage are fantastic. You get to see the great outdoors almost wilderness with the possibility of moose and bears. You get to smell the scent of the forested coastline and the salt water breezes. You get the quiet of being out of the city while",
          "Everyone goes there. Always crowded but nice trail to get our workout done. There are many dogs walking with owners and they are not responsible to pick up after them so I see everywhere. It's too bad there are not too many options for anchorage residents to go.",
          "Beautiful paved trail. However, when it is a rare nice sunny summer day, bumper to bumper traffic. I recently rode a bike about 14 miles on this trail and between the other bikes and all the people on cross country skis on wheels it was a nightmare. I felt like I was driving in",
          "We rented bikes at Pablos (behind Snow City Caf\u00e9) and headed out for the afternoon. The trail offers fantastic views and has gentle grades for the most part. We went all the way around to the chalet and then continued back through the City so we could stop by the Lake Hood",
          "We started at Kincaid Park which was very nice! There are hiking trails and a food truck there. There were many trees and wildflowers, and we even saw a moose!",
          "I walked a section of the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail and loved it. There were lovely views of Cook Inlet. My beginning was at W 2nd Ave, and I followed the trail for a couple of miles to a connection with the Chester Creek Trail which can lead you to 17th Ave, and then it's",
          "This is a nice, but long, trail around anchorage. If your looking to walk, this is the place. A lot of runners and bikers also like this path.",
          "We started the Tony Knowles Trail not far from 3rd street. Walked as far as Westchester Lagoon. Easy stroll. Peaceful and scenic along the water. The tide was out. Had views of the Port of Anchorage and the mountains. On the return trip we took a neighborhood route up U street",

          "We enjoyed walking here but know that access is somewhat limited so once you start you either turn around to get off or walk to the next access point which should be a mile or two away. Many bikes.",
          "Walked for about 1.5 miles from entrance at Elderberry Park. Came to a lagoon lined with flowers and with a beautiful view of mountains.",

          "The Coastal trail circles along the West side of Anchorage for approximately 12 miles. It is a paved and well-maintained trail. Very popular with walkers, runners, skaters, geocachers and bikers. A number of Cook Inlet and mountain viewpoints. Moose sightings are common.",
          "Nice Walking Trail. We did not walk the entire trail; however, the section we did walk was all board walk and/or paved. all of the section we walked had a zero degree of difficulty.",
          "if you come in by the park - go left - right has nothing... They have done a nice biking, jogging, walking trail. Can't always see the water as a lot of trees and bushes",
          "Took an afternoon stroll to see the beautiful coastal scenery. The trail is paved and accessible to bikes and walkers or runners. definitely a must see",
          "What a great trail! Lots of beautiful views. Well taken care of the whole way. Sometimes crowded. Look for moose.",
          "We hired ourselves a couple of e-bikes and set off for a great relaxing day of cycling. We had been told this trail was where we would get to see the elusive moose we had hoped to see in Alaska and were not disappointed. We collected our bikes from Alaska eBike Store and set",
          "Downtown bicycle rental was terrific and the trail is pretty easy and well maintained. Rode it with my 8 year old. We went to a couple of good playgrounds too that were along the trail.",
          "After renting bikes from Pablo's Bike rentals, we made our way to the trail which we rode for 21 miles round trip. Sea views, mountain views, wetlands and meadows all were present along the trail. To change things up, moose were seen in three different locations along with",
          "Checked this out mostly to get some Cook Inlet shots and found it nice and well-utilized by visitors and locals alike.",
          "Completely missed the wow factor for me...was bored 5 mins into it, walked for 2 hours waiting for something cool but it never came. I wouldn't waste time on this trail",
          "This trail is not only a scenic treasure, but is smooth and well-maintained. It is a \"must-do\" if you have a day in anchorage and have even the slightest enjoyment on a bicycle. It's a well marked easy ride that is second to none!",
          "The biking on this trial is not terribly difficult.It's idea for the occasional biker.I loved the many creatures we came across as we enjoyed the wonderful scenery. We seen a moose,bald eagles ,squirrels and many big mosquitos . This trail is near airport,so you will see several",
          "The bike trail has several entrances, either at Kincaid park, Point Woronzof, Earthquake Park, Westchester Lagoon or on 2nd Avenue. Trail is wide and paved. During peak times (10 am - 7 pm) the path can be crowded in some parts. Nice viewing. Small hills near 2nd Ave, larger",
          "Easy access to intercoastal trail starting from downtown Park, Elderberry. Steep hill down to park, then a level trail that goes for miles. Saw many bikers (some looking like biking to work or running errands, shopping), rollerbladers, bike club group riders, and walkers.",
          "Walked part of the trail with my wife, ran part in the Anchorage Run Fest. Nice paved path, good views of the water and some wildlife. Didn't rent bikes but if the weather had been better we would have. Definitely worth checking out if you're in Anchorage.",
          "If I lived in Anchorage, I WOULD BIKE RIDE ON THIS TRAIL EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! It is easy access! Lots of people enjoying biking, walking, running. There's a long hill near Kincaid Chalet, but other than that it is pretty flat. The scenery is incredible, and you pass through",
          "Very nicely maintained trail that seem to go forever. Nice to be able to start Downtown and walk out to the suburbs along a coastal route. Felt very safe, but remote at the same time. Great trail with easy access. It's paved and people of all abilities are making use of it.",
          "This trail is easily accessible from downtown Anchorage. Very enjoyable and comfortable walk. Fun to watch water birds.",
          "It ended up being a sunny day so we decided to spend some time walking the trail. Didn't go terribly far. Saw an Alaska Railroad train go by.",
          "This is a must see in anchorage. The trail is increadable with views of the mountains, Pacific Ocean, planes taking off, and wildlife. We rented bikes and although we only made it to mile 4 out of 9 before having a picnic and turning around, it was worth the trip. I highly",
          "This scenic trail follows the shoreline of Cook Inlet in north and northwestern Anchorage. Relatively flat, it has a few small hills that shouldn't be a problem for most riders. Some interesting places on the trail are Earthquake Park and the edge of Ted Stevens International",
          "we rented bikes from a downtown place and did the loop. It is beautiful. We went early in the morning, I was happy about that because by noon it was very busy.",

          "The beginning of the trail is mostly uphill--small hills but persistently up. (Does make the end downhill coming back!). We were on it on a Monday, and there was lots of foot, bike, and skate traffic for the first several miles. You do ride directly under a departure path from",
          "Be sure to bring your camera and binoculars. The trail winds around the cost. It is slated wooded and easy to walk. There are steps but ramps for strollers and wheel chairs. Fee parking available. Some homeless natives were hanging around but did not approach or ask for money.",
          "My hubby and I had a couple of hours to kill before heading out of town. We went for a walk here and it was very enjoyable. I wish we would have had bikes so we could have seen the entire trail. We started at the 2nd Ave. entrance. A note on parking, we found a lot that",
          "We rented two bikes from Pablo's very near the start of the trail in downtown Anchorage. Nice, comfortable bikes on a relatively flat, paved trail. We are two fit senior citizens and we were out for about 2 1/2 hours but did not complete the entire 22 mile round trip ride.",
          "I was visiting Anchorage solo and decided to rent a bike (from the Copper Whale Inn) and explore this trail - glad I did! It is a very long trail, so I only rode part of it (about 45 minutes one way and then 45 minutes back), but the portion that I rode was very beautiful. You",
          "Beautiful scenery. We encountered bear scat and smelled bears nearby, but did not see them, but did see a moose! The ride is moderately strenuous, especially for someone who hadn't ridden a bike in awhile. I'd recommend turning after the airport rather than returning through",
          "This was a pleasant walkway that ran for several blocks facing the water. Part of it overlooked a commercial shipyard but another part featured the memorial to Captain Cook and nice views of the water and beyind",
          "11 mile trail available for walking or biking along the coast passing right by the airport and going through several parks.",

          "Whenever I think of Anchorage I think of running along Turnagain Arm on this paved trail. It's beautiful, safe, interesting and slightly rolling along its eleven miles toward the airport. You can bike, walk, jog...whatever. I wish the glum hard core bike guys would stick to the",
          "We had a free day in Anchorage and after reading reviews on Trip Advisor we decided to walk the Tony Knowles Trail. We walked from our hotel, the Sheraton, to where the trail began. Be aware that all the numbered street do not go through to the trail - I believe 5th street",
          "Wanting to play with a new camera and not having anything booked for the day, we decided to go for a walk along the Coastal trail. It seems to be very popular with walkers, joggers and cyclists. Nice views of the waterfront and with plenty of wildflowers along the way.",
          "It was a great day for a ride, so we hoped on the Coastal trail from downtown and went all the way to Kincaid Park. Good to have a bell, because there were a lot of people on the trail. Beautiful scenery and well paved. We did see bear scat by Earthquake Park area. Nice ride!",
          "This trail runs along the coast and through boggy land surrounding the airport. There are many side trails with interesting exhibits and views of the ocean. There are bicycle tool stations, as Mark on the city bicycling map. The hills are minor.",
          "My wife and I went for a hike on it. Near the start of the trail by the city it is a nice mix of walkers and bikes. It was maintained nicely and had nice views along the trail.",

          "We walked for a couple of hours on the last morning of our trip. The trail is peaceful, easy to walk and scenic at various points. A gem in Anchorage!",
          "The coastal trail is a delightful urban amenity - not a tourist destination per se but a part of everyday life - bicycle commuting or running (or skiing) at lunch during the workday. For visitors it does offer a nice bike ride of up to 10 miles (one way) to Kincaid Park - with",
          "Hiked this paved coastal trail, planning to hop off when it began to rain. It never did rain! 18 miles later, having seen so much shoreline, birds and habitats, we reached Kincaid Park. We lucked into a cab ride back into the city, as there was no bus route that reached the",
          "Fun place to explore, use mosquito spray. Didn't see any wildlife, but I'm sure they are out there. Not too difficult and lots of places to pull off and enjoy views.",
          "We rented bikes at Pablo's and road almost to Kincaid park in 45 mins. The paths are well paved, and it was not a problem to pass other bikes or pedestrians. Nature abounds with water, birds, plants - no moose this trip!",
          "Our family walked a portion of this trail as soon as we were checked in to our hotel. What a great choice! Reluctant teenagers became interested sightseers as we walked along and enjoyed the parks we came to. A beautifully built trail. It was fun to have the railroad next to",
          "We had a great time on the Tony Knowles trail, the entire family (including 74 y/o parents) biked it. We had a great weather day where the breeze cooled us off, but yet warm enough to bike in short sleeves. It was a nice change of pace to do something like this on vacation",
          "Though this trail extends much further, the best portion is from the airport to downtown, which takes about half an hour by bike, and offers 4-5 good spots to take photos. The ride is a little easier starting from the airport, mostly flat, with a couple challenging sections.",
          "By far the best thing we did in Anchorage. The trail is well maintained and wide enough even with oncoming cyclers and hikers. At one point we saw moose right on the path! We went about 18 miles there and back, next time I would go further.",
          "Well laid out and some beautiful scenery. Loved the tunnels! Much better than dealing with one way streets and trying to park downtown",
          "If you are fit and athletic this may be your thing but for an average family with a 6 year old we were underwhelmed with the trail",
          "Paved/flat trail that is mostly pedestrians and only occasionally shared with bikes. Don't expect a loop as this one goes up and down the coastline so plan accordingly. Beautiful views on sunny days and cool mud flats when the tide is really low. Locals and visitors alike really",
          "My husband and I regularly walk when we\u2019re home, so this was nice to do after dinner especially since full dark is about 11 pm-ish. This actually starts in the downtown area. To do the full path it\u2019s probably better to do via bike unless you\u2019re a marathon runner. We walked part",
          "The Trail is a real highlight of Anchorage. It follows the line of residual forest that goes along the water, so you have trees and water views over much of the Trail. It is an easy walk but there are not a lot of places to get off the trail for some sections of it. We",

          "Unfortunately we did not have too much time in Anchorage, so we just managed to see parts of the trail. Nevertheless, we really enjoyed our time and as the weather was very beautiful, it seemed like half of the population was on that trail. A lot of fun!",

          "I love the Tony Knowles trail. It is usable in the warm months for running, biking, roller skating, walking and in he winter months for skiing, fat tire biking, and running. In some spots in is bumpy where roots have grown under the trail and bumped up the concrete. In the",
          "The Tony Knowles Coastal Trail is one of the best features in Anchorage. A great place to take a walk or better yet bike the trail. Lot's to see with views of the Cook Inlet and some of the nicer houses in Anchorage also back up to the trail. There can also be wildlife. Bears",
          "I enjoyed this trail so much, I did it twice in my four-day stay in Anchorage. The first time, I did see two cow moose and their calves, so be mindful that wildlife DOES live in downtown. A lot of people use the trail, so I'd suggest going during the weekdays to avoid crowds.",
          "I was pleasantly surprised by this trail. I jumped on it from different points. Most people bike this trail .. I walked 10 miles of it. Amazing views of the bay. Highly recommend this one. Next time I'm in town I'll be renting a bike!",
          "Depending on where you get on this trail, it's either all nature with nice views of the bay, or urban areas teaming with kids at play. Either way, it's a wonderful place to walk/ride.",
          "From downtown Anchorage the 4 mile-plus trail provides a scenic walk, jog, or bicycle ride along the inlet shore. The Earthquake Park is an interesting place that describes (via information plaques) how a whole neighborhood slid toward the inlet in the 1964 earthquake.",
          "We biked the trail on our last day in anchorage and it was awesome! Loved the beauty and seeing all ages enjoying it together. We rented from downtown bicycles and it was perfect for my husband (although, had a a few rough moments up the slight hills, my teen sons and my 11",
          "From downtown to Natural Kincaid park about a nine mile hike one way. Beautiful multi use paved trail year around along the coast. I've walked from both sides and biked round trip. Have to be aware of wildlife and crazy cyclists. Great way to spend an afternoon.",

          "My wife and I enjoyed a stroll for several miles at both ends of the trail. We saw a bull, cow, and calf moose along different parts of the trail. If you have time and good walking shoes I would recommend this trail.",
          "For encountering moose, drive over to Kincaid Park, where this trail begins (or ends) depending how you look at it. There is free parking there if you take your car. We took an uber there. We saw two bulls, one female mother and her calf about a mile in. They seemed unphased",
          "I was really blown away by this experience. I cycled this trail and loved it. The views are incredible, the wildlife is awesome, the trail is paved and in excellent condition. Check out the incredible video I took of this bull moose right on the trail. A real adventure and great",

          "After spending all day flying cross-country, we needed to stretch our legs and get some exercise. Our driver to the Marriott suggested the Coastal Trail. A great suggestion! Access to the trail was only a few blocks from the hotel, and it was an easy and delightful walk along",
          "This is one of our favorite activities to combat jet lag. Get to a bike shop early to rent and beat the rush. We usually start at 8am. It's a very peaceful ride. Take a break at the airport and watch the jets take off and land. If you make it to Kincaid--it's okay to walk up",
          "If you go the entire length of the trail, you are almost guaranteed to see moose! We ran the entire 22 miles round trip, many people were on bicycles. At the turnaround point, you can fill up on water, get a soda and snack from vending machines. We saw 5 moose and a porcupine.",
          "I was in Anchorage for an afternoon waiting to get in to our hotel. I rented a bike & rode 8.8 miles round trip. There were walkers, bikers & skateboarders along the wide paved path. I was told the the water has low tide & high tide every 12 hours. I caught the low tide which",
          "We rented a tandem bike (from Downtown Bike Rentals) and road the whole trail and alternate route to make a complete loop. Stopped at the Lakefront Hotel for lunch and watched the many seaplanes taking off and landing just feet away. We saw lots of birds, 2 moose and beautiful",

Located in Elderberry Park, the structure was built in 1915 by early Anchorage resident Oscar Anderson.  Anderson claimed to be the 18th person to set foot on what is now Anchorage.  The structure was the first wood-frame house in Anchorage, and was occupied by Anderson until his death in 1974.  The house was completely restored to a 1915 appearance between 1978 and 1982, and is now open as a historic house museum.\nIt was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Anchorage, Alaska\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOscar Anderson House Museum - Alaska Association for Historic Preservation",

        "wiki": "The Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center is a non-profit organization dedicated to conservation, research, education, and animal care. The center is located on about 200 acres (81 ha) at the head of Turnagain Arm and the entrance to Portage Valley, Milepost 79 of the Seward Highway, about 11 mi southeast of Girdwood.  The Center is in the Municipality of Anchorage on the approximant border of the Kenai Peninsula and the Kenai Mountains to the south and the Chugach Mountains to the north.\nIt is a Wildlife sanctuary for orphaned or injured wildlife, as well as home or temporary home to captive born and translocated wildlife such as wood bison. It is a wildlife sanctuary that provides comfortable, permanent homes for orphaned and injured animals.\n\n\n== History ==\nFounded by Mike Miller, The Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center opened in 1993 as the for-profit Big Game Alaska.\"In 1999, the center became a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, with Miller serving as the center's executive director. The name was officially changed to Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, Inc. in 2007. In 2018, Miller departed the center as executive director, with Dianna Whitney being promoted to that position. In 2019, the center acquired the land and remaining assets from Miller.\n\n\n== Animals ==\nAnimals at the center include timber wolves, Grizzly bears, black bears, Alaskan moose, red foxes, elk, muskoxen, sitka black tailed deer, Porcupine caribou, Canadian lynxes, bald eagles, great horned owls, wood bison, and porcupines. This wildlife conservation center is also home to coyotes.Most of the animals are cared for in large natural habitats. For instance, three brown bears live in an 21-acre (8.5 ha) habitat of brushland and conifers, and two black bears are housed in a 14-acre (5.7 ha) enclosure with a stream.\n\n\n== Education ==\nThe center offers educational programs and tours in self-guided, drive-through or walk-through formats.\n\n\n== Conservation ==\nStarting in 2003, the center has taken part in a program to reintroduce the wood bison back into Alaska after a 100-year absence. The wood bison is the largest land mammal in North America, and is a keystone grazing herbivore from the region. Conservationists transferred thirteen wood bison from various Canadian wildernesses to this wildlife conservation center in 2006. They sent fifty-three more Canadian wood bison from Alberta's Elk Island National Park for their survival two years later. This project was a joint effort with the Alaska Department of Fish & Game and other conservation groups.\n\n\n== Media ==\nSeveral documentaries, features films, and other video media have been shot on location at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center including a documentary for National Geographic and Into Alaska featuring Jeff Corwin in 2007, and Into the Wild, starring Emile Hirsch. Other special guests to the center include Jungle Jack Hanna who filmed a few segments for his syndicated program.\nIn July 2010 the center's resident porcupine, \"Snickers,\" gained worldwide publicity from video footage in which the friendly rodent appeared to behave like a puppy. The video went viral on the internet in a matter of days.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website\nIUCN Bison Specialist Group Web site",

          "We had travelled for 11 days from Kenai to Fairbanks to Anchorage without seeing any animals apart from goats and sheep in the very far distance and a bald eagle in Ketchikan. So it was rewarding to be able to get very close to some of the animals we had come to see. Sure, they",
          "We stopped here en route from Seward to Anchorage. There\u2019s quite a few animals here including brown and black bears. It\u2019s fairly spread out so there\u2019s quite a bit of walking. We were only just starting our trip in Alaska and were travelling all over so were expecting to see",
          "The Layout of the center was not the best for visitors and required a lot of walking between animal enclosures but truthfully visitors are second to caring for the animals.",
          "We enjoyed visiting the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center and seeing the wildlife especially since we didn't see much wildlife in our visit to Alaska. We enjoyed seeing the musk ox. We were there at bear feeding time and got a good view of the bears. The moose also came out",
          "We spent an hour here on a recent trip and would have been there much longer had the weather cooperated. The Musk Oxen and bears are amazing but the other animals are also very interesting and are kept in huge enclosures where they can enjoy the outdoors. Definitely worth a",
          "Yes. this is a \u201cmust\u201d for your coming trip to anchorage. It will take around 2hrs to be able to see all animals in a normal pace. we enjoyed.",
          "So if you happen to not see a lot of wildlife on your drive, you will see it here. Moose, Eagle, Black Bear, Caribou...animals who were not able to live in the wild. Of course there is a large gift store with many nice items. It was a very nice experience.",
          "Happy we went because we saw a bear which we did see in the wild. Brook our guide was terrific. She was concerned that we were warm enough and sent a balanket for our granddaughter to use on the raft ride.",
          "The centre rescues wild animals and if possible cares for them so they can be whenever possible be released back into the wild however there are a couple of brown bears and a black bear along with elk, muskox etc that cannot so it is possible to see the animals close up.",
          "This is a cool place to see a range of animals present in alaska however I did feel a bit uncomfortable with how small the enclosures were. I know they are animals in need of aid but it would be nice to have a bit more space for them.",
          "Check website for daily hours. Ample parking. You can drive or walk through the park. We chose to walk and spent about 2 hours. Great photos and opportunity to see the local wildlife. Be sure to check out the Animal Program Schedule written on the whiteboard outside of the Be",

          "You can walk or drive the whole conservation. Keep in mind it is a lengthy walk. But you can drive and pull over to get out and up close to the wildlife throughout you excursion. There are feeding times you can watch which are pretty exciting. Kinda crazy to be that close to a",
          "We didn\u2019t see it at its best as it was raining, but we had a very good guide who told us all about their aims. Many of the animals had been injured and nursed back to health. The high light for us was the small family of wolves",

          "This is a small wildlife centre, it appears mostly rescue animals which no doubt can't be released, but nevertheless it is a shame to see bears, moose and foxes confined behind wire fencing. It is worth a visit if passing along Turnagain Arm toward Seward, Homer or Whittier but",

          "Took the self guided tour and stopped at every exhibit. Truly glad they are helping the animals but felt sorry for them. Many looked malnourished. Not sure why. Some of the exhibits were over grown and hard to see the animals. Felt like there needed to be more background",
          "I highly recommend making this one of your stops while in Alaska. Family friendly. Tour guide was very knowledgeable of all the animals and could any questions anyone had. Well worth the time we spent there!",
          "As the name suggests it is NOT a zoo but a working, non profit center looking after injured and orphaned animals. You get a close look at most of them.",

          "My husband and I were staying in Anchorage and decided to take a trip about an hour outside of the city to this conservation center. We rented a car, which in general I would highly recommend when you're visiting Alaska, and it's a very easy drive to the conservation center.",
          "The center was included in one of our tours we took while in Alaska. It was really amazing to see these animals up close. Highly recommend!",
          "If you are on a cruise or bus tour, you will only have 45-50 minutes, but it is so worth hoofing it around the site. As you drive in closer to the main buildings, look left. Get off bus and go back to the bear and wolves then around buildings to coyote and porcupines. Cross over",
          "A nice stop along the way to Whittier for a cruise, but the dining options could be a bit more substantial. Could actually use about 30 more minutes to fully appreciate without feeling rushed. (Bus/tour transfer from Anchorage to Whittier)",
          "It really helped to come here first so I could see all the animals up close, get my pictures, and then in Denali when we would spot animals far away I wasn\u2019t at frustrated at not being able to zoom enough or get a good picture or make out the animal\u2019s features. An easy drive",
          "Our trip to the AWCC was interesting but not a must do or see. We were on our way to portage and worked into our schedule. Many of the animals were hiding but we did see the musk ox, the bear, and some of the others.",
          "Wonderful place! Wish we had more time to see animals but unfortunately our tour bus was only there for an hour. The shuttle van wasn't running that we saw so there was a lot of walking for someone with two knee replacements. I would recommend having a car to drive through here",
          "The AWCC is such a neat stop in Girdwood! A lot of really neat/unique animals to see up close, that we wouldn\u2019t necessarily get to see in South Texas. We purchased the Bear Encounter tickets, and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to everyone!!!! Purchasing these tickets gave us a more",
          "I\u2019m sure they do a good job with the animals but we weren\u2019t overly impressed by what we saw there. Skip it if your time is limited.",
          "Mostly run by volunteers who obviously Care about these animals, all of whom are rescued for assorted reasons. Visitors center has information and bathrooms.",
          "Watching the Bears was the highlight - but not worth the money to get into the Wildlife Center. Bears, Moose, Snickers the porcupine (was in a very small area),",
          "this heritage center is more than a museum, it\u2019s a history lesson. the docents, mostly teenagers out of school for the summer, were kind and provided quality presentations/information. well worth the time.",
          "We had a blast!!! This was an amazing conservation center, the accessibility to the animals was unlike any other. We loved how all the animals were rescues & each area had a plaque that told their stories. If you can, walk the center instead of driving, it\u2019s a 2 mile walk, but",
          "There are snack options and multiple clean bathroom locations. It's best to park near the gift shop and walk. The road is very potholey and you're going to be stopping every five seconds anyway. You can get really close to the animals. Even though they have large roaming areas,",
          "The AWCC was a stop on our Authentic Alaskan Tour that I had no opinion about prior to visiting. It was going to be \u201cokay\u201d but once I got there I was SO GLAD it was included. I guess I could say I wish we had more time. The variety of animals and ability to see them up close was",
          "We had chosen to stop here on our way from the cruise ship to Anchorage. Awesome Stop. Enjoyed seeing the animals although the bears did not come out. It\u2019s nice to know if they are well & able to be returned to the wild they are. I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s wrong or why the ones they",
          "My husband and I like to check out the wildlife conservations wherever we travel. This was one of our favorites. You can walk or drive it. Learning about the animals during the times listed was an added bonus. We got one of the wolves to howl back!",
          "The animals seemed well cared for, and not sad like you sometimes see when animals are captive. All animals had ample space to roam yet they were close enough to get good pictures. We saw bears, moose, elk, coyotes and my husband\u2019s favorite were the wolves. This is definitely",
          "We went down to the conservation center mid morning on the day we flew out of anchorage. It was nice to have somewhere to walk around and see the wildlife up close. There are some enclosures that do make you feel bad for the animals- a zoo type feeling. Others seemed to have a",
          "Photographer's paradise for animals you might not get to see in the wild, or HOPE you don't see in the wild, like bears. A good variety of animals native to the area of Alaska can be found here and some nature talks are held by staff. Not sure how far it is to walk the entire",
          "What a fun place this is! We travelled there on our tour with Big Bus on the trip from Whittier to Anchorage. Lots of animals living in their own enviornment, all natural. Lots to see. We enjoyed the bison, bald eagle, foxes, antelopes, bears and more. Lots of exercise",
          "We love wildlife and heard about AWCC while we stayed in Anchorage/Alaska for a few days. We went one morning and regretted that we did not go sooner! First of all, it was a beautiful place! The mountains surrounding it, the water, trees/forests, the clouds.... just beautiful!",
          "This Wildlife Conservation Center was quite nice! Walk or drive along the 2 mile path to see many native Alaska Wildlife.",
          "What a great place for families. I like the idea of driving and/or walking thru the exhibits. The animals are always out, unlike a zoo where they are sometimes off exhibit. The only thing that would make it complete is an actual cafe.",
          "For those who can't wait to see wildlife or missed out while visiting Denali, this is a great spot to see most of the native wildlife, including moose, caribou, bear...even bison and porcupines! If you take a motorcoach like ACT, you can include this park in your trip (we did,",
          "For us it was an unexpected outing but turned into a great afternoon! There are a variety of animals and they all seem to have lots of room to roam around. One of my favourite elements is that there are information signs about each of the animals on their enclosures (names, how",
          "We stopped in for a couple hours on our way from Anchorage to Seward. I would recommend it as a great chance to see the wildlife up close and learn a great deal. Your admission fee also helps fund their effort to rehabilitate injured animals in need and educate the public to",
          "Great stop for families to learn more about alaska's wildlife. Get very close (safely) to bears and moose if you haven't been lucky enough to see them on your trip yet.",
          "While vacationing in Alaska, I really wanted to see the wildlife. While I did see some in their natural habitat, they were often too far away to photograph (and I enjoy life too much to even consider trying to approach them)...LOL!! This facility takes in orphaned and injured",
          "Many visitors expect to see much wildlife but are frustrated in not seeing them. This conservation center allows animals to roam in open ares and are easily photoed from safe distances. Moose, caribou,bear,musk oxen,etc. a fun place for the whole family that you can drive",
          "We were a little unsure about visiting the Wildlife Conservation Centre after seeing so many animals in the wild, but pleased that we did. We spent 3 hours there walking around at our leisure. They do a wonderful job at the centre looking after orphaned and vulnerable animals",
          "We did the behind the scenes tour which was completely worth it! Lilly, our guide, was full of information about the animals there and the wildlife in Alaska in general! This place is truly worth the visit, tour or not. What they're doing is remarkable! A great way to spend the",
          "My grandson and I wanted to see native Alaskan wildlife and when pr friend from Alaska recommended this sanctuary, we were anxious to check it out. Our drive took longer than usual, from Anchorage south towards Seward, because we stopped often to admire the beauty of our",
          "Very cute stop on the way to Seward, Alaska! Only $16 a piece for adults and you can either walk or drive to see the animals. Wished there were animals and maybe more interactions but it was still cool to see animals that you wouldn\u2019t encounter on the road! Included moose,",
          "I went here on my last day in Alaska! I really don\u2019t like seeing animals fenced in, it usually depresses me. In this conservation center I was so moved by how well these animals are being cared for. These are all animals that could not survive in the wild for one reason or",
          "This was nice to be able to drive thru and still see most of the wildlife from the car. must walk the bear area for sure.",
          "This place is fun. We got there a little before closing, and still had a blast. You get to get close to the animals. Amazing pictures. I will definitely visit again.",
          "Very interesting, lots of animals and humans environment. Too bad they don't return them to the wild.",
          "Huge bears lounging in their natural environment, foxes roaming and climbing, elk, bison and many more. Separated by just a wire fence from you. Excellent photos!",
          "This was an educational stop along our way from anchorage to homer. The animals are all rescues of sorts. Nice to see the animals well taken care of.",
          "We stopped in at the conservation center and was very impressed with it! We went on the tour, (because i walk with a cane) and wow was it great! We were the only ones on the bus so we got a great narrative of the center, some of the info you might not get by walking and reading",
          "Loved seeing all the animals w gorgeous mountain backdrop! A great walk on the grounds and loved the bear feeding. The rescue animals are all so amazingly cared for. Learned a lot about the bears at the bear feeding!",
          "This is a wonderful place for people of all ages! The animals are great examples of Alasan wildlife, in close to their natural habitat. Unlike a \"zoo\", these animals have, for the most part been of a rescue. Wander the grounds at your leisure, watch them feed, frolic, and be in",
          "We did not plan to Stopp but I am now glad we did. Great job you are doing here! Many creatures to see that you can\u2019t see on a roadtrip",
          "After 2 weeks travelling around Alaska, this was a good place to get a closer look at some of the wildlife we didn\u2019t manage to spot on our travels. It\u2019s always difficult seeing these guys fenced in so we had our usual mixed feelings about some of the enclosures, but at the end",
          "We wanted to see musk ox and they had a few. Such cool creatures. For sure something we would never see at home. The conservation center is located in a beautiful area. All the animals appear to be well cared for. Allow a couple hours. We brought a lunch to eat however they did",
          "This was a stop that was scheduled on a bus ride from Whitter to Anchorage after our cruise. We really enjoy our hour stop. All the animals have been orphaned or injured. You can see the animals up close. The animals are very well taken care of and the facilities are great. I",
          "This attraction was special because they have the native animals where they can be seen up close, but safely behind fences. The animals seem to have more freedom to roam than in a zoo. We watched the bear feeding and they were right next to us. We could see the bear eat the",
          "We visited the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center during our stay in Girdwood. We wanted to see wildlife in when in Alaska, but it is hard to spot animals in the wild. By visiting here we were sure to see LOTS of animals. We weren't disappointed. As we entered the center,",
          "We had family visiting from Washington state so we decided to take a drive around Knik arm and stopped at the AWCC. It was a fun time and a good chance for them to see Alaska wildlife up close. It was 16$ per person for admission. The funds support their work and maintain the",
          "Wildlife are very difficult to spot in nature. This rescue organization rehabilitates Alaskan wildlife, some of which can be returned to the wild and some cannot. You will find a wide variety of Alaskan wildlife here for observing. Great for photographers, as the animals",
          "We enjoyed walking around the wildlife center. You definitely don\u2019t need to do the \u201ctour\u201d just pay the regular entrance fee and either walk or drive through for a considerable cheeped price. There was a stand with snacks, hot dogs, brats and drinks. Nice way to spend the",
          "I visited early on a Thursday in late summer just after they opened on my way to a glacier cruise in Whittier. This is a place where tour buses stop, so going early or late is your best bet if you don't want to be swarmed by the tourist mobs. Ticket person was great, gave me",
          "What a treat to get to go behind the scenes while everyone else is looking through a fence. Our guide, Lily was so knowledgeable and friendly. We learned a lot about the animals and gained an appreciation for this place that cares for all these animals that would otherwise not",
          "Well worth a stop and a wonder. This is Not a zoo, it is a beautiful place where wounded animals are taken care of in very large and spacious enclosures in beautiful surroundings. It is very well organized, you can walk or drive between the places were bears, wolfs, moose,",
          "Beautiful place! Great variety of animals. Definitely a way for someone from the lower 48 to experience the animals of Alaska!",
          "This a popular place for visit. Expect a line up at the entrance gate, $16 for adult, youth 7 to 17 $11, 6 and under are free. It was a sunny warm day. There were a few animals that didn't come out. The rest came out to greet us. The whole center is over 200 acres, accessible by",
          "Great stopping point on the drive to Whittier from Anchorage. Alaska Cruise Transportation stopped for our trip.",
          "I visited this place while on a tour with others. It was clean and the animals appeared healthy. It was well planned and organized. Feeding time for the bears was handled with humor but care for the safety of the bears and the people watching so everyone could get their pictures",
          "Fabulous place doing outstanding wildlife conservation and education work. Doesn't have any of the feel of a zoo ... visitors can wander around what are seemingly open paddocks ... the security fencing is unobtrusive and the animals are in great condition with substantial range.",
          "Most animals are rescued and would most probably nit make it in the wild. Large enclosures with additional fencing keep humans away from animals but close enough to appreciate. Musk oxen, elk, reindeer, moose, porcupines, wolves, coyotes, foxes...it\u2019s pretty amazing. Nice",
          "I stopped in literally hours after arriving in Anchorage. About a half hour drive. YOu can park at the central gift shop area and walk the whole stretch (about 2 miles) or you can drive it all. Very easy walk on gravel road. They had exhibits with Moose, Musk Ox, Wolves,",
          "Like a zoo with a better mission, they take in injured and rescue animals with the goal of release when healthy. I was able to see moose up close though I prefer see real nature",
          "One advantage of the Center is that the animals appear to have sufficient space to roam. Of course, the downside for humans is that the number of animals per unit of walking distance is low, but again it is better for them to hopefully enjoy their surroundings. You can walk",
          "We throughly enjoyed the park. You can walk the 2 mile loop or drive your vehicle. The animals all had large roaming areas which felt like natural environments. Especially enjoyed the moose and bears. Excellent place for everyone of every age.",
          "I saw species and sizes of fish I\u2019d never seen in other aquariums. Interesting salmon exhibit; be sure to hear/see a handler talk/feed them. I rated a 4 instead of 5 because it\u2019s expensive. They do give a small discount for AAA, but you have to have proof of membership for each",
          "We have been to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center twice now, and it is definitely one of our favorite places to go in Alaska. First, we love the fact that this facility is for the purpose of rescuing wild animals. All of the animals at the facility are still wild. They\u2019ve",
          "Enjoyed the walk about the park as we were able to see all of the animals except the lynx. Watching the bear feeding was a treat and our group was able to drive the wolf pack to howl along with us.",
          "The center is nicely located outside of Anchorage. There are signs on the road which make it easy to find. The enclosures are big enough for all the animals. The bears come right next to the fence at feeding time. It takes about 2 hours to walk around the place, but it only",
          "What a great experience; to see animals with space to roam in their environment. This is the place to visit no matter what you do in Alaska. Up close to all animals that habitat in Alaska, was amazing! The animal conservation center does a great job with rehabilitation of the",
          "Amazing Center!! My husband and I both said if we lived in AK close to this center we would want to be members or volunteers. Beautiful spaces and the people seem to really care. There is a snack bar and gift shop. I did hear/see the gift shop offered military discount. We",
          "We dropped by after our visit to the Portage Glacier. If we had planned a little better, perhaps we would have enjoyed the visit better. As it was, most of the animals there we had seen before (bears, buffalo, elk,, etc.) since we live \"in the West\" and most of them were in",
          "We absolutely loved this place! This place is very affordable since it's only $16 each for adults and you can stay as long as you would like. We choose to walk around the 1.5 mile loop and enjoyed all of the animals. They have bears, moose, coyotes, elk, foxes, great horned owl,",
          "On my way to Whittier I had the pleasure of visiting AWCC. Visitors are in for a treat here. The animals are able to roam about and visitors can watch them up close. I took multiple photos and favorite photos are of a fox and bear.",
          "Enjoyed seeing all the animals at this location restrooms food gift shop tour guide good place for photos",
          "Our visit to Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center was trully enjoyable. Entire area is very walkable as well as drivable. Each animal habitat is in great condition and seeing animals puts simle on your face.",
          "It\u2019s a nice conservation center. We loved seeing bears up close and other animals. They have food stalls and coffee (the coffee is really bad) and a nice gift shop. Overall it was a fun and quick stop on our way to Seward.",
          "Traveled a little way out of Anchorage to get to the Conservation Center but the views were extraordinary, passing Balluga Bay (Spectacular). Entrance to the Conservation was a bit hard to find but once in there it was great. A good variety of animals to view, enjoyed the",
          "Wanted to see some of the animals of Alaska in an environment easy for my 4 grandkids and my mom. Since she has issues walking and we had a 2 year old and (believe it or not it was HOT), we were a little over whelmed by the distance to walk. We noticed the shuttle and lined up",
          "We toured the \"turnagain arm \" with Albert Marquez, owner of Planet Earth Adventures... what an awesome time we had... we also visited the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center, great place for a camera!!! They have bears, moose, caribou, an eagle, etc which are being taken care",
          "It's a 2 mile loop and you can either drive or walk it. We chose to drive and were glad we did, plenty of places to pull over and see several exhibits. We enjoyed the diverse wild life--about the only wild animals we saw! We particularly enjoyed the black and brown bears.",
          "We stopped here after our cruise, while on a transfer to the airport in Anchorage. I was with my 86 year old Mom and teenage kids. We are very supportive of the mission of the center and enjoyed what we were able to see. My kids walked around and were able to spot the bears,",
          "We visited the center which was part of our bus ride from Seward to Anchorage Airport. Although our time was short there, we truly enjoyed ourselves and seeing all the wildlife they had there. We liked talking to some of the employees about the different species, and it was",
          "It is wildlife park that you can walk it or drive thru. They have a good assortment of animals but no one walking around to ask questions. As well we waited for a lecture that was posted but no one showed up. Good mission to take in orphan animals but the place was lacking.",
          "Wanted to see a bear after two bear-free weeks in Alaska. This is a decent place doing good things. I don't know much about this, but the animals seem to be very well cared for. A good opportunity to see animals, and donate to a good cause.",
          "we enjoy this visit would go back again next time we are in the area .... we got great pictures of the wildlife",
          "I recommend the AWCC for Alaska visitors who want to see wildlife--in the wild, yet accessible. The center does a good job of protecting and rehabilitating wildlife in a natural setting; especially good place to see brown bears up close.",
          "While you may spot a moose or two lingering around Anchorage\u2019s parks, the best way to get up close to Alaska\u2019s diverse wildlife is to drive about an hour towards the Portage glacier to visit this expansive sanctuary. Drive through the center, and then, get out and walk as you",
          "If you looking for a zoo, don't go here. If you want to see real wildlife up close and personal that has been taken in and cared for, go here. This was a stop that we will not soon forget. JB was incredible! Everything was!",
          "We booked a private tour that started at 9am and it was outstanding. We got up close and personal with many of the animals and the guide's knowledge was outstanding. My wife and I as well as our 10 year old grandson really enjoyed the personal attention of our guide. We learned",
          "Young and old in our family party enjoyed our time at the Center. You can drive to viewing areas and/or walk around the center. It\u2019s so nice to see the animals in large habitats and to read the history of how they were rescued and brought to the Center.",
          "The center was very expansive and in a beautiful setting surrounded by mountains. Most of the wildlife were in wide open, fenced meadows or fields and were either resting, sleeping or eating. One exception were the bears that were in a very realistic setting with low lying",
          "You can either walk or drive the trail. I decided to walk it, it\u2019s mostly flat but has rocky areas. If you drive it, you can see most of the enclosures minus the bears. You will need to get out of the car to see the bears. The animals have very large areas to roam around and",
          "This was an interesting site to visit. You actually drive through the small park and stop at the various enclosures to get out and view the animals. Unfortunately, the day we visited some of the animals chose to hide within their enclosures. Not a fault of the site, just the",
          "This is a very nice sanctuary for \"lost\" animals. If you want to see some of the native animals of alaska up close, this is the place. It was amazing that during our entire 5 days in Alaska, we did not see a single wild animal in its native environment....and we drove a lot.",
          "We really enjoyed the Conservation Center. We saw wolves, bears, moose, porcupines, bison, muskox, reindeer, elk, caribou, lynx and more! We walked the loop with our baby in a stroller - it's an easy walk, with beautiful views of the mountains and Turnagain Arm. We listened to",
          "It was interesting to see some of the less common northern wild animals up close but it was far from authentic. Many of the animals were lethargic. One poor little porcupine seemed almost demented as he traced and retraced his steps alone in his tiny cage.",
          "If you want to see bears up close this is the place! We saw at least 5-6 (brown & black) bears! Then bison, moose, caribou, deer, musk ox are spread out in large fenced areas. Also a few fox, wolves even a lynx (which we didn\u2019t catch)! A little dusty walking on gravel, but",
          "Great way to see a bunch of animals! Not in the wild, but more free than a zoo. Would be great for the little ones or an older crowd. They brought back animals on the verge of extinction. They provide animals in a caring monitored environment for the needs of media in Alaska",
          "We loved this place. You get up close to all the animals you hoped to see in Alaska. Except I wanted to see wolves and it was an unusually hot day and they were hiding in the shade. The kids did see bears up close though and so many other animals. Really great place!!",
          "The best way to safely see bears and other Alaskan wildlife up close! Great place to go with young kiddos too!",
          "The Wildlife Conservation Center was included in one of the tours we took while visiting Alaska. It was a great introduction into the wildlife living in Alaska. We got to see Grizzly Bears, Moose, a bald eagle, a bison, a lynx, wolves, Fox, an owl and some Caribou Each animal",
          "The zoo in anchorage is pretty depressing, and I hope they transfer all animals to the conservation center, but this place is worth the drive. They only need to build suitable housing for the anchorage zoo polar bear. Gorgeous miles of land, animals run wild and free. The only",
          "We have kids ranging from 5 to 12 and all of them loved to see the bears, wolves, mooses, elke, bisons, reindeers, etc. It's sad to read the stories of how the bear cubs lost their mother and fortunately there is still a place for them at the center. Everyone interested in",
          "This was an interesting stop on our way to Denali. The animals looked well cared for and we could see them really close up.",
          "went here as part of a tour called Trains, bears and bergs. The tour broke into small groups of about 4 to 6 people and here at the conservation centre which is a sanctuary for the animals, our guide was very informative. Would highly recommend a stop here, doesn't take too long",
          "You are guaranteed to see bison, bears, moose, elk and several other animals up close. Easy to drive or walk through the center. We booked a tour at $100 each (party of 4) that included stops at 4 locations to pick up other participants then a drive directly to the center.",
          "My family really enjoyed our visit. The staff were able to tell us about how the animals ended up at the conservation center and why they are not all able to go back to the wild. They looked well cared for. I wish we would have more time to spend here, but were on a tour",
          "Musk Ox are probably very interesting to the people who are carrying out the conservation work, but after half an hour of the slow walk looking at the same animals while the guide talked was probably not a good idea. Items to buy from their groomed hair are incredibly",
          "This looks a bit like a tourist trap. But it\u2019s probably worth it to me to contribute $16 a head to feed the rescued wildlife. And it is a beautiful setting, nothing like a city zoo. A neat place to get close enough to view Alaska wildlife in a reasonably natural setting.",
          "The WCC is doing a great job rescuing orphaned or injured animals. It\u2019s a great opportunity to see animals that you might miss out on in the wild. It\u2019s a small park that\u2019s easy to drive around, stopping at each enclosure. The road is dusty but not a problem. Sometimes animals",
          "We love the idea of an animal conservation/rescue center so I booked the Vip package so we could experience the park with a guide. Our guide was terrific as were the animals and experiences feeding and petting the animals. We were amazed at the number of stories we were told",
          "Definitely a must visit place, you get to see the animals up close and personal in their on habitat. Grizzlies, moose, muskox, wolves, etc!",
          "Be sure to stop here and see some wildlife that you may not see anywhere else in your AK trip, especially if you're taking a cruise and not getting into the wilderness much. Though in captivity, many have been rescued and the visit is educational and leisurely.",
          "Travelled here by car from Alyeska Resort, easy to find and a good price for families! You can drive or walk around the conservation site and take as many photos as you wish! We saw moose, bears, bison, reindeer, carabou, wolves and deer. The expanse of land all the animals have",
          "I was impressed how much room some of the animals had to roam in. I was also impressed that they rotate fields so the grazing animals have fresh grass. It is a rescue center and doesn\u2019t breed animals into captivity- another very positive point in my opinion. I didn\u2019t find it",
          "I visited this place with no real idea about what I would experience. I was blown away by the close encounters with wildlife. At one point I was 3 feet away from a brown bear. Then within a foot of a moose. These people are doing good work. I had an excellent tour guide who",
          "Super sweet experience. The energy and spirit of the whole conservation was wonderful. Highly recommended!!",
          "Though a visit to the AWCC wasn\u2019t on our itinerary, it was recommended by a server at a restaurant in Anchorage. We\u2019re glad we took his advice to stop while in the area. Teens and adults enjoyed seeing the moose, bears, and wolves most of all. Animals appeared very well taken",
          "This was a stop on our trip from Anchorage to meet our ship in Seward. It was a chilly, rainy day, and the facility does not really offer a welcoming and sheltering experience. Some wildlife was out and about, and if you came prepared for wet weather and did not mind walking",
          "We booked a tour in front of the Anchorage Visiting Center next to Hospitality center. It was recommended strongly by the staff at the visiting center. But this is not a good tour. Our tour guide is old speaking very softly so we could barely hear anything from the back of a",
          "This is a great venue to see Alaska's wildlife up close and personal! Bears, caribou, moose, and bison. It's a walking tour so wear your comfortable shoes!",
          "Large enclosures not zoo like. Spaces seem to be sized by animal not tourists needs. 1 1/2 hours is sufficient.",
          "We spent an afternoon walking, and viewing wildlife. Well done, and very interesting. Would definitely do this again with young children.",
          "A fun 1/2 day activity, we walked the loop instead of driving which allowed us to be much closer to the animals. I recommend getting here right when it opens because it will fill up with buses quickly.",
          "If you weren't lucky enough to see wildlife on your own in Alaska, this place is a guaranteed way to see black bears, grizzlies, musk ox, bison, foxes, wolves and more. Parking is kind of a nightmare, at least if the cruise ship buses are all there. The road is dusty gravel and",
          "There are some really amazing animals to see and they have large, beautiful enclosures. Bears, moose, reindeer, elk, musk ox, etc.",
          "This is a super site worthy of several hours visiting. The animals they care for can be seen right up close and everyone is quite helpful. This is a super fun place for all ages, especially educational for kids. Must see and support.",
          "Our family spent an afternoon at the AWCC. The animals are easy to view and the wolf feeding was fun. Try to make it to the feedings and talks. The staff has info to share and great stories.",
          "You can see so pretty pink fireweeds on late July. We got a lot great photos for my group. Very enjoy this place.",
          "My husband and I came here to visit the animals as we had been now in Alaska for a whole week and barely saw any animals at all. This was our only chance to see a bear and elk up close. There is not a walking path or sidewalk to stay on, but you just walked on the road and",
          "Make sure to time your visit with the bear feedings so you see the bears. This is very much a nature preserve so you won\u2019t see everything if it\u2019s not feeding time. It is a stunning place, beautiful. The bears and wolves were both highlights. The bear feeding was at 4:30",
          "There are several types of animals with scheduled times for a discussion about the animals. Very dusty if you walk. Unpaved road for about 2miles I think.",
          "This is an awesome place... 6 of us were on a tour from Seward to the Anchorage Airport and our tour guide (Planet Earth) stopped here for us to view all the animals. Got some great photos and loved seeing the varied animals - fox, moose, reindeer, elk, bear, coyote, wolves,",
          "The Wildlife Conservation is an amazing way to see native animals. Almost all the animals there have been rescued. They live in a spacious natural environment.",
          "Nice to see animals in somewhat natural habitat. Moose, bears, bison, muskox. Has food trucks with snacks and nice gift shop.",
          "This is no ordinary \u201czoo!\u201d These are rescued animals kept in amazing enclosure that give them a tea and acres to roam! The animals are very much loved and very well cared for. Wonderful to see a live moose only feet away!",
          "Duane, Was an amazing well knowledgeable tour guide and made the tour very interesting. The tour was an hour and we saw all the animals. My kids where very amused and interested in the guide. This is a great place for families of all ages and the facility is well maintained.",
          "Our family of five stopped here on our drive from Anchorage to Seward (kids 15, 11, and 11). I wasn\u2019t super excited, figured it would be like a zoo. It was actually a huge hit. We got some great photos of black and brown bears as well as moose. The whole family loved it. There\u2019s",
          "Lots to see; well-trained \"Rangers\". Easy to walk around. Can get there by railroad (with free Shuttle) as well as by road",
          "We came here as part of a tour with Chugatch Adventures and you do see all of the large mammals of the state. All were orphaned or injured however they do try and place the newborn animals back into the wild.",
          "This was set up to care for hurt or orphaned animals. There are bears, elk. moose, 3 legged porcupine, wolves, wood bison, coyotes, an owl and an eagle with a shot up wing, plus more. Get there at 3:30pm for the bear feeding, an event you won't want to miss.",
          "It costs something like $15 per person to get in and it's totally worth it. We spent 3 hours or so here. The best way to experience it is to park near the gift shop and walk the 1.5 mile loop, stopping at each animal along the way. We saw basically every animal you could",
          "This place is a great place to see Alaskan wildlife in a non-zoo setting. They are involved in conservation and rescue of native animals. You can see coyotes, fox, wolves, bears, moose, musk-ox etc. It is definitely worth the visit. Just watch the giant speed trap known as",
          "The wildlife here is mainly comprised of rescue animals, e.g. Twix the 3-legged porcupine. If you come here, you are basically guaranteed to see many of the major Alaskan wildlife. Animals seem well-loved and kept in an environment that seems well-designed. Staff were also very",
          "Nice park for animals that need rehabilitation and it better than a zoo as animals are in their own habitat although restricted by fences. The area space is ok for what they have and much better than a zoo. Worth visiting to see animals that you may or may not see in the wild",
          "You'll be wowed by how close you can get to wolves, bison, brown and black bears, caribou, and more as the AWCC works to help these animals recuperate in settings that are meant to mimic their own natural ones. For kids and other animal lovers, this is a must see!",
          "Thought this was a State run facility. It is not ! More like a local animal park. Animals are penned with plenty of room but most ( Bison) look lethargic. Main Critical Remark - Food Service is halfa - - with little to offer. If you got little kids 12 and under might be worth it.",
          "We enjoyed the stop at the park on the way to the cruise port. We had about an hour and had adequate time to see the main attractions including bear feeding.",
          "About halfway between Anchorage and Seward, this place is such a treat! Guaranteed wildlife viewing run by a great, educational non-profit. Animals ranged from musk ox, to moose, BEARS (brown and black), porcupines, wolves, foxes, caribou, etc. We went on a bus tour that",
          "Stopped here as part of photo tour. Variety of animals on site, bears, wolves, musk oxen, deer, porcupine. Gift shop and food stand to buy snacks.",
          "This was our 2nd visit to the Alaska Wildlife Center and boy has it grown, which is nice to see. There is a large sign which states that Princess cruise line has contributed to their growth. This is not like a zoo as the animals have a large natural habitat in which to live and",
          "Was so excited to see bears, caribou, moose, wolves, musk oxen, porcupines, elk, and foxes. Got some amazing pictures. It was really crowded, though, and I couldn't get a good view of the grizzly bears through the throngs.",
          "The center has done a very nice job with their wide open enclosures to house several different types of animals. A lot like a zoo but for injured animals. A nice respite when traveling from Anchorage to Seward!",
          "We were impressed with the condition of the animals and the amount of space they had to move around. That hasn\u2019t always been our experience at wildlife centres.",
          "Came here believing this was a wildlife center and not a zoo, but we were mistaken! They have built a really nice area for the bears and their life seems ok but the rest was really horrible!!! After visiting several wildlife centers in Australia earlier on our trip we expected",
          "Our van shuttle stopped here on our way from Anchorage to Seward, about an hour's drive. Not a lot of amenities here but you can see bears, moose, caribou, wolves, reindeer and some other native Alaskan wildlife. There's an elevated walkway from which you can look down into",
          "Conservation Center was excellent. Loved seeing the animals and the work they do there. My children loved the porcupine.",
          "There is wildlife. Bears, elk, moose, eagle, musk ox and even wolves. Really informative walk-about. Up close with rescued animals. This is not a zoo. Learn some valuable info about Alaskan wildlife. Not to be missed.",
          "We visited this place on our transfer from Whittier into Anchorage. It was wonderful to see some Alaskan wildlife that we probably would not have seen otherwise. It is a very open place so it is not like a zoo. We were happy to be able to see a brown bear, moose, porcupine,",
          "The AWCC is a great place to not only see wildlife in thier natural habitats, but to learn about the various species. All the animals are either orphaned or injured when they come to this rehab refuge. Saw porcupine, fox, wolves, coyotes, elk, bison, bears, deer, moose,",
          "Excellent place to visit. Would definitely recommend as they are doing a great service to the animals they look after and you feel like for the small fee to enter you are doing a huge thing to help the animals",
          "Fed a moose, saw baby musk ox, grizzly bears playing in a stream, a baby bison less that 12 hours old (they are all orange), a one-winged eagle, a three-legged porcupine...and on and on....wonderful!",
          "Visited twice by accident. Nice place to see animals even if there are fences. Some good photo opportunities without fence to distract. Bald eagle and foxes are there to see but definitely behind fence. Gift shop and food trucks available. The wolves even sang for us!",
          "We stopped as part of our bus tour of Alaska. Most animals were easy to view and you could get great pics.",
          "Came here as our flight was cancelled. Was ok , have a couple of bears and other animals . Nice to see them not in a zoo . Would be nice to have more back ground on where /why these animals are there . My credit card has been double charged so hence the three stars",
          "See many large native animals up close and learn about their behavior and environment. Seeing them in captivity isn\u2019t ideal, but knowing how the animals got here and that some future generations are returned to the wild helped.",
          "The animals all seem healthy and happy. Easy to walk around and see all of the animals, or you can drive if you have mobility issues. Staff is very informative. Lots of signs and information about the animals. Cute gift shop with some interesting items. Adequate restrooms.",
          "We really enjoyed our visit and got some wonderful pictures of bears, musk ox, deer, porcupines, caribou, an eagle, and especially the moose. A great place to visit for all ages in a beautiful setting.",
          "I've lived in Anchorage 10 years and passed the AWCC many times going to Seward or the Kenai Peninsula. I decided to take the grand children ( 6 & 8) there as they were visiting from Fairbanks. I have to say AWCC totally blew us away. This place is awesome! The AWCC had plenty",
          "We stopped by the Wildlife Conservation Center as part of a tour to the Portage Glacier. It was a great experience! First of all, the place is situated in an incredibly picturesque area! the animals are beautiful too and the guides are all very knowledgable.",
          "We visited the conservation center as an afterthought, but were glad we made the stop. This was the closest we got to moose even though we did quite a bit of hiking during the trip.",
          "We spent 3 hours here viewing bears, musk ox, elk, deer, wolves, caribou, porcupines, and bald eagles. We were lucky enough to view musk ox being sedated and getting their hooves trimmed. The staff was professional but not very forthcoming regarding the process when we had",
          "If you have never been up close to some of the bigger animals, then this is the place for you. Even though I had seen moose, I had no clue they were so big until I visited this place. Children would love it. Take time if you are in this area to visit.",
          "Excellent area for orphaned animals. Staff seemed very caring. Bears were especially good. Easily viewed in a large natural environment.",
          "The center cares for abandoned and injured animals and tries to replicate their natural environment. We saw bear, moose, caribou, Sitka deer, wood bisons, musk ox, fox, porcupine and more. The back of the center is on two rivers and Turnagain Arm. Kenai and Chugach Mountains",
          "Very nice place to visit to see lots of wildlife up close. This would be a great place to take children. We especially liked the moose.",
          "Our family really enjoyed the center. There were a nice variety of native animals as well as demonstrations. We were there for the Bear feedings. Exciting to be up close and personal with the bears. The wolf exhibit was very interesting. The guide had us call the wolves. You",
          "We did this park as part of a bus tour from Seward (where our ship docked), to Anchorage (Airport). The Wildlife Refuge has plenty of animals (Elk, Moose, Bears, Wolves, Reindeer, and much more). We had an hour there as part of our tour. It was enough time to see most of the",
          "We stopped here on our way from Anchorage to Seward to catch our cruise ship with Anchorage Tours and Transfer company. It was a great place to see all kinds of wildlife. It was warm the day we were there, so walking was a little hard, but our bus driver took us throughout the",
          "Their mission is amazing and the animals you see are really intriguing. Loved seeing the porcupine being fed - she was adorable.",
          "If you don't get great pictures here of wildlife there's a problem! Of coarse these animals are in a habitat but it is a large habitat with beautiful scenery. We had a personal guide named Kyle from Chugach Adventures who took us here in a van from the train. Loved seeing the",
          "It is a great place to see the big game of Alaska up close. In addition to the bears and moose, there are foxes, wolves and many others.",
          "The place was okay. It took about 30 minutes to drive through the entire place. I had my 6.5 year old with me and I lost him after the gift shop told him about a playground about 15 minutes from there. He was no longer interested. The moose feeding was NOT worth it, IMO we",
          "We stopped here as a pre-cruise stop and enjoyed ourselves very much. It has large preserve areas to see animals, some close, some from afar, in their natural habitat. Signs about the animals are informative, and we liked the option of driving around the preserve rather than",
          "Loved visiting here with our 3 yo daughter. We walked mostly, but then caught the shuttle b/c my aging mother had a hard time walking back to the main parking lot, and the shuttle driver was so knowledgable, funny, and really great with our 3yo :) Will definitely be coming back",
          "Nice little center that has native animals in spacious pens. The loop road that takes you by all the pens is in horrible shape! Lots of huge pot holes. It was better to walk from one area to the next. It was a lot like a very small outdoor zoo.",
          "This was a great way to spend an afternoon. Took a tour and got to see moose, bears and other animals up close, good thing too because I didn\u2019t get to see any in the wild.",
          "We are not giving it the one star the experience deserved solely because of the great mission this place accomplishes. It\u2019s wonderful that these animals have a home but it\u2019s really just a crowded zoo. Don\u2019t expect to see \u201canimals in the wild\u201d. They are fenced in pens. We were",
          "I went there 3 times during my 10 day trip to Alaska. I went once by myself, once with a tour group and once when a couple of family members came up and every visit was phenomenal! My perception of Alaska was it was all wild, which it is, a while I saw multiple moose and a few",
          "Go early before the tour buses arrive. It's a 2-mile loop you can either walk or drive. If you walk, be sure to bring rain poncho, etc., because of changeable weather. If on foot and windy rain starts, there's no shelter in most places to get out of the rain, but don't let",
          "A huge thank you to the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center for the great work you do for Alaska\u2019s wildlife! We visited during a drive between Anchorage and Seward and were really wowed by the amount of space and layout for the animals. The bear and bison habitats were",
          "The rescue and rehabilitation of the animals is a very good thing, and most are native to Alaska. Most of the animals have plenty of acres in which to roam. The eagle & owl are in cage-like enclosures. Perhaps that is to keep other birds of prey from swooping down and harming",
          "Great staff...Check! Great scenic viewing...Check! Great wildlife viewing...Check Not only does the center care for sick and injured Alaskan wildlife, they also educate and use your admittance fees to expand and improve the center! I've been coming here for many years and I'm so",
          "we saw all kinds of animals. they were feeding the bears, so we got to see them up close. they do a good job taking care of the animals they rescue.",
          "We stopped here on our way from Anchorage to Seward, it's a great way to see wildlife if you didn't see wildlife actually in the wild :).",
          "On our cruise tour/transport from Seward to Anchorage, we stopped at the conservation center and enjoyed our time there. Definitely a place to go when visiting the area. Our family of 12 only had 45 minutes in our visit. Definitely not enough time to really take in the complete",
          "Enjoyed walking around to see all of the animals up close. Employees very helpful. Had bison hotdog at kiosk by visitors center. Nummm. Interesting and educational.",
          "We did a bear tour in Homer to Lake Clark - and saw awesome bear there. However, this was still awesome in a different way since you can be so close. The moose, bears, and musk ox were great. We spent about 2 hours there.",
          "We were here during a recent hot spell, so a lot of the animals were staying in their den areas. The area was easy to walk, and had great views of the animals that were out. You are able to get very close to most of them, and only have a fence between you and them. Our kids",
          "You do not need to book a tour for this, just go see it on your own :) You can drive though the center or walk. We saw moose, bears, caribou, reindeer, elk, wolves and more! Pretty cool to see everything up close! This is not a zoo ;) Animals are seen in a larger more realistic",
          "Great opportunity to see wild Alaskan animals close up. Relaxing drive through the park and you are able to stop and get out anywhere. Highly recommend.",
          "What a fun stop with kids. We saw lots of animals. It was a quick stop, but the kids got to see everything they wanted to see.",
          "Stopped at the wildlife refuge from Seward port on the way to Anchorage airport. We got to see all the animals from black bears, moose, wood bison, lynx and fox. The only animal that was too shy to come out was the porcupine. It was a lovely stop, complete with a gift shop,",
          "I have stopped here several times on my way to Seward/Whitter for a cruise. It is a good place to see the animals that you want to be sure to see in Alaska. My last stop was in July 2019 on the way back from the cruise ship to Anchorage. We stopped for an hour but I think 2",
          "We enjoyed see the various animals in a very close setting. We also liked that by stopping in we were supporting the efforts of the Center. Their rescue and care of these animals is a noble task, and we were happy to support it.",
          "What a special place! We saw so many incredible animals native to Alaska up close. The drive from Anchorage was beautiful and scenic. This was a highlight of our trip!",
          "We had time to kill before our flight back home and decided to check out the conservation center. We didn\u2019t know exactly what to expect but it did not fail to impress. You can walk the center viewing all animals or you can drive the park and then get out to view if you choose",
          "We were in Anchorage for one day on June 10, 2019 on a cruise stop, and we rented a car to drive 1 hour to do a Portage Glacier boat ride followed by a visit to the Wildlife Center (only a 10 min ride from Portage). We thought the wildlife center was a bust. You can either",
          "We were there for the feeding of the bears and wolves. Many musk ox, and musk ox babies, wood bison, buffalo, reindeer, eagles, owls, fox all being cared for by very thoughtful individuals. Spend the day or several hours. We will visit again!",
          "My wife and I enjoyed seeing the various animals up close and personal, but also felt a bit saddened that they were no longer in the wild. I do understand that the center takes in injured or orphaned animals and tends to them, but nonetheless that bald eagle looked very sad.",
          "Interesting place, convenient and just a short drive for a half day visit from Seward or Anchorage. Place is surrounded by beautiful scenery, being able to capture some nice shots of wild animals in captivity, including caribou, bears, fox, deer, moose, wolves, etc. Some animals",
          "After experiencing Brooks Falls and seeing wild life in Denali, the AWCC just felt like a zoo. And a small zoo at that. I don't want to take away from their mission... they are doing great things to save animals stranded in the wilderness (assuming it does not take away from",
          "Part of the bus tour from Seward at end of cruise, going back to Anchorage. Lots of people here, I was surprised at the crowd. Very small town, low budget, but still fun. The animals were not out much because it was in the high 80s, heat records for everywhere. But 3 bears",
          "This was included with our Portage Lake glacier tour. We got to see bears, moose, wolves, etc. The place is not huge so you don't need a lot of time to see most of the animals. The bears were really cool, apparently one of them, Joe Boxer, responds to his name and will come over",
          "This place made me sad. They say they are rehabbing the animals, but it seems many are there permanently in dusty enclosures with tons of people and cars passing by. Wish I wouldn\u2019t have supported them. Seems like a not so good zoo.",
          "My husband and I stopped by the conservation center while in Anchorage. It was about an hour drive along Seward highway, which is beautiful! Loved seeing such diverse local wildlife and felt great to know our money was going to such a good cause. The animal habitats were large",
          "I loved this place, the great job these people do with the lost and orphaned wild animals, today they treated one of the bisons... It is a 1.5 mile walk or drive, very comfortable great for taking picture up close of the wild life in Alaska... Loved it.",

          "My family and I loved seeing all the animals here. We liked getting to see them up close, while still knowing that the animals have plenty of space to roam around. Our favorite animals included the bears, bison, moose, and elk. Highly recommend this place to those who want to",
          "The Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center was definitely worth it! Watching the bears was the highlight of the day. Highly recommended!",
          "We loved the awcc. We didn't know this is essentially a drive through zoo, but it makes sense because all the animals were so large. They need room to roam and were absolutely wonderful to watch. We particularly enjoyed watching the feeding of the bears and most of the bears",
          "The Conservation center allows people to see a wide variety of animals up close. The drive from Anchorage is beautiful.",

          "The drive from Anchorage is beautiful and the conservation center is an opportunity to see the wildlife of Alaska up close. Seeing these animals in the wild is rare so it was great to have this place. A nice walk to see the animals or you could drive to most spots. The bear",
          "We went for a tour of the Alaskan Wildlife Conservation Center, it was a most wonderful day even in the rain. These people are so informative and the most caring people I\u2019ve ever met. The animals are so well taken care of, and that\u2019s what I was looking for. We got there in time",
          "If you are traveling nearby this is a good stop. You can see animals in a very natural habitat who have been rescued or are in a conservation breeding program that you may have missed in the wild. Beautiful setting.",
          "We visited AWCC during our trip to Alaska. We were very impressed with the work that they do with injured or abandoned wildlife. Additionally, prior to our visit, we were unaware tHat Alaska had a separate type of bison or their role in the re-introduction of the Wood Bison to",
          "Not as many animals as I expected. They must be doing a great job rewilding. We drove a rental car, so missed the tour guide descriptions",
          "Great way to see Alaskan wildlife up close. Saw moose, black and brown bears, musk ox and lots more.",
          "This place was part of our Portage Glacier tour stop. Heading back to Anchorage, we took about an hour stop here to try and view some local wildlife in Alaska. We were hoping to catch a glimpse of the black and brown bears in the sanctuary. Also, there are some wolves, ox,",
          "On our bus tour to Whittier, we stopped at the conservation center and enjoyed our time there. Definitely a place to go when visiting Anchorage.",
          "Great experience & a great way to see and learn about some native Alaskan wildlife. They are doing some terrific things here with animal conservation! The animals have lots of natural space, partners and are very free to roam, not like a zoo in the lower 48. Lots of variety to",

          "Try to go when they feed the animals. We were able to watch the brown bears get a treat. It was totally worth it!",
          "I reserved a private tour for a group of 8. The tour guide was wonderful. We got to feed a baby moose and baby porcupine and listen to a pack of wolves sign (howl). It was the highlight of our groups trip!",
          "An inexpensive way to help the wildlife while having the opportunity to see the animals up close. It takes about an hour by car or two hours walking to complete the loop. There is plenty of space at each exhibit to take photos and watch the animals.",
          "Great opportunity for photos of all the local wildlife. Good access to enclosures but most animals were shading from the record breaking temperatures!! Bears put on a show for us though. Restrooms were very clean. Only down side the roadways were very dusty. Definitely worth the",

          "A great spot for up-close wildlife observation that's easily accessible by everyone! The center appears well cared for, and the opportunity to see some of Alaska's biggest creatures so close is fascinating even to adults. If you are making this part of a road trip, also plan for",

          "A great spot to check out the Alaskan wildlife in person. All sorts of animals - Moose, muskox, bears, bison, porcupine, fox, wolf, bald eagle, elk and so on. We were most interested in bears like everybody else and were lucky to see a grizzly bear playing in the pond trying to",
          "It was very crowded and I kind of felt sorry for the animals because of all the people, who were teasing the animals. Apart from that it was very impressive to see so many of Alaska\u2019s animals and I think the conservation center is doing a great job with rehabilitating the",
          "The AWCC is a must-stop when traveling through this area of Alaska. We got to see tons of Alaskan animals, including a bear cub in a playful mood. It doesn't feel like a zoo, and you can walk around (or drive) on your own schedule while enjoying the outdoors.",

          "You can either drive or walk the loop. It is not that long a loop and definitely worth the time to walk. We saw a lot of animals that are usually only seen in the wild. They have injured animals or animals that had been abandoned when young. Some of the animals were a bit",
          "Our family really enjoyed the Walk in the Wild Side tour. We got to get up close and personal with some of the animals and even got to feed a few as well. This is a wonderful facility that takes great care of the animals that reside there. They take in injured and orphaned",

          "This place needs to be supported since it helps animals who cannot be rehabilitated. Each animal has a story. They are well taken care of and have a lot of room. We saw wolves, bisons, elk, caribou, black and brown bears etc. The caretakers are friendly and nice.",
          "We enjoyed the wildlife conservation center. It was great to see the animals in a close up situation. The work the center does to help wildlife in danger or in need of medical attention is very commendable. We saw a bald eagle with one wing, an orphaned musk oxen, many bears,",
          "Enjoyed seeing the animals. Frolicking bear cub, eagle, reindeer, among others. The center takes in abandoned and injured animals for rehabilitation and protection.",
          "Stopped on our way down to Seward. Admission 16.00 (adults) 14.00 (seniors & military) 11.00 youth Free kids 6 & under. We got there in time for a porcupine chat, was surprised by the lack of direction given us by the staff, but we managed to find it, despite their help. There",
          "I looked for a moose all over Anchorage and couldn\u2019t find one, so I was happy to come here and see one. We paid extra for the moose encounter which wasn\u2019t really worth it. You got about 30 seconds feeding the moose some leaves and that\u2019s about it. I would skip that but the rest",
          "They have grizzlies, caribou, muskoxen, etc. This is worth going to if you don\u2019t get a chance to get out into Denali or drive up to Prudhoe Bay. If you are getting out into Alaska, this isn\u2019t worth the entry fee in my opinion. I give it a 4 star because it was what we",
          "I went to Two presentations about bears and Drove and parked several places to see the wildlife. This organization rescues orphaned animals and provides them a chance to thrive. I spent more time there than I expected.",
          "If you haven\u2019t spotted any wildlife while driving here in Alaska then this is the spot for you. Easy in and out and nice viewing areas to take some pics. Not a place to spent several hours.",
          "We visited the AWCC because we were interested in seeing more native Alaskan wildlife. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit! You have an option to drive through the park. You can park your car and walk to the enclosures to get a better view. We decided to walk the whole center, which",
          "Like typical zoo but smaller and focused Alaskan wild animals like deers, moose, foxes and bears. Was nice to meet those black and brown bears.",
          "This wasa great place to stop after the portage glacier. They have a great knowledgeable staff and lots of native animals to see. The pins are great for viewing and they have the best bear enclosure I've seen. Best of all, Any proceeds go back to the care of the animals.",
          "Worth doing just so you can see up-close many of the animals you spend your Alaska trip looking for. You don't need a lot of time to take in the sights. Gift store was fine, but nothing we couldn't pass up. Definitely recommend, just don't expect more than it is intended to be -",
          "We had a great time seeing the animals; its about a 2 mile loop that you can walk or drive. We saw bears and Wolves up close (those were our must sees) and enjoyed a reindeer dog. it is worth your time to visit, both my teenage boys (14/15) enjoyed it.",
          "Visiting Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center is getting Alaska in a nutshell: virtually all wild animals can be seen in an almost natural environment.. , We highly recommend visiting this attraction whenever you will visit Alaska. Charles and Barry",
          "Beautiful artwork and recreation of village life. We bought some beautiful native jewelry here storytelling by natives was fun and educational. I would recommend this.",
          "Okay place to see but don't go out of your way. Animals well cared for. Good photo opportunities. Pleasant people.",
          "This wildlife conservatory was the highest ghlight of our transport to the Anchorage airport. Amazing animals native to Alaska. We saw bears, moose, bison, reindeer and much more. Excellent stop. We loved it.",
          "A great place to stop and see some wildlife. The Conservation Center has elk, bears, wolves, moose, deer, eagles, musk ox and so much more. It had a great gift shop with many cool items. A great place to stop.",
          "We stopped here in connection of the guided tour to Portage glacier. The park is small, e.g. only few kinds of animals, nothing worth to use time for, especially for dedicated trip there. For combination with other tours on the way could be OK.",
          "The Center is a sanctuary dedicated to preserving Alaska\u2019s wildlife through conservation and animal care. During our visit we saw Wood Bison, Deer, Elk, Caribou,Moose, Black and Brown Bears. You can drive around the site, but will see a lot more by walking. There is a huge",
          "We are very happy we were not on a tour and enjoyed the park without time constraints! We walked the entire loop first, viewing the animals and then took one drive of the loop on our way out! Since we were in June, the animals were losing their winter coats. We loved seeing",
          "Made the trip to visit this nature wonderland, it was awesome to see these wild animals in their natural habitat. Seeing a bear so close up was thrilling. The park was very well set up and nice restrooms, and picnic area.",
          "We enjoyed our bit but did not allow enough time. Our guide was a bit Co that he needed to allow us at least 30 minutes or more in the gift shop so our group of 35 felt rushed. Wonderful center and would recommend visiting.",
          "This Conservation facility rescued these beautiful creatures that can\u2019t be returned to the wild, saving their lives. Was a pleasure to hear their stories. Thanks to the caregivers! The bears loved their midday fruit snack. 3:30 was snack time\u2014be there a bit early with cameras",
          "Check this place out. These people do some amazing work in rehabilitating animals. Strongly recommend this place.",
          "This place was awesome since they take in and care for animals who were orphaned/injured. Definitely a cool place to stop by if you have the time.",
          "We had the time of our life visiting the conservation center. They take really good care of their animals and they know them personally which is really nice to see. It was great being there when they fed the bears and we got to see them really up close and very personal. To me",
          "Seemed mighty expensive to enter. This may indeed be a genuine outfit that has the bests interests of the animals in mind but it did not feel that way. Animal enclosures were not great. It felt like a for profit establishment even though it has been converted from a for profit",
          "We purchased tickets for a guided tour and we were not disappointed. We fed a porcupine named Kit Kat and several deer and learned some really interesting facts about Alaska\u2019s wildlife. Every animal there has an interesting back story and knowing that your money is going towards",
          "It is good to see the animals in need being taken care of so compassionately. It is a nice place. It was part of our tour to Portage Lake Glacier and well worth the stop.",
          "After seeing the wildlife off in the distance, we thought that it was amazing to see these animals up close - to really realize the true size of them. we strongly recommend a visit",
          "This was worth spending a couple of hours! Got up close to the beta and the moose and the porcupines and it was magical. Great place to take the family too!",
          "The center is interesting and it is located in a great place with magnificent views of the mountains and the river. The animals are well kept in large areas and are interesting to watch. However, it has become a very commercialized place with many tourist buses coming from",
          "We totally enjoyed the animals and the information the guides provide. You can pay to feed the moose or watch others do so. We watched the bears being fed apples. It was great. They had 2 baby orphaned musk ox when we were there, they were adorable. Still bottlefed, so kept",
          "We visited the center recently and enjoyed the guided bus tour, the stroll through exhibits and the gift shop. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. The animals that live there are very carefully tended and a joy to see. This is a quite different experience from that",
          "Seeing these amazing animals indigenous to Alaska(North America) was probably one of the highlights of our trip to Alaska. The centre has bears, mooses, elks, caribous and wolves. Worth visiting to those who have not seen these animals before.",
          "we stopped on a road trip on the scenic highway from anchorage to seward. Surprisingly interesting. Up close with the bears. Muskox was changing its coat from winter to summer and looked amazing",
          "I read reviews about the road being horrible here and they were right. In a rental car I was extra careful navigating. We walked to each enclosure and took pictures in a hour and a half. So i would say that is average time here. They had a session where they fed the bears",
          "I visited in early May and was really amazed. The bears were probably my favorite, but the moose were a close second. As I stood listening to a member of the staff talk about the wolves, a young Moose walked up to the fence and listened in. The animals are so amazing. I was",
          "Really loved seeing the animals today. Fantastic place looking after the animals. Would\u2019ve loved more time here. Highly recommend!!",
          "Great way to see the animals up close! Everyone was friendly. Not so crowded that you couldn't see everything.",
          "As part of our Alaska tour this was one of our stops and it was great to see some many animals. You can see bald eagles, black bear, coyotes, wolf, moose, etc. at a close up. Definitely enjoyed the visit.",
          "We visited the refuge as part of our BigBus tour so had just over an hour to look at the large compound. It was lovely to see the bears, which seemed generally happy, as did the other animals. One black bear did seem a little distressed by his audience as he had been caught in a",
          "Hubby & I visited on our last day in Alaska, and it was an adventure! I wasn\u2019t used to seeing ALL THOSE animals all at once, but we enjoyed it!",
          "Came here on our way to Seward for the cruise we took in May 2018. Lots of wild animals to see, great visit.",
          "We have been here many times. Most of these animals are rescued and would not have survived unless they were here. They do have breeding programs to help repopulate species into areas where they have been over hunted. In the afternoon it is feeding time and so much activity.",
          "We stopped here briefly on our ride from Anchorage to Seward. The park is incredible and the animals seen were amazing. We watched the bear feeding, saw black bear and a couple of grizzly bears. We watched the white wolves being lazy and playing with each other. There was",
          "Nice animal enclosures, much like a zoo. If you aren't able to get off the beaten path to see animals in the wild, this is the place to see them up close. They had a road greater in the yard, but apparently no one knows how to use it. These are some of the worst roads we have",
          "We stopped to visit the conservation center because my son recommended it and had a great time. It was neat learn how quickly a moose grows antlers, see a bald eagle up close and see the bears moving around. The wolves were resting during our visit which was disappointing but",
          "Watched the brown bears frolic in a stream, enjoyed a \u2018concert\u2019 of sorts by the wolves who all got together and howled a beautiful song. Saw other animals up close. Some have been healed but can\u2019t return to the wild - which is sad",
          "What a neat way to see animals being cared for. Able to see wildlife up close and personal. Can either drive or walk to each exhibit.",
          "The animals here are rescues. The foundation that runs the center has built a great display of very unusual animals is almost invisible fencing and compounds! Most of the animals were active and appeared healthy! The moose and bison did not seem to appreciate the temperatures",
          "It took about an hour to get here from Anchorage (the drive is gorgeous). You can either park your car and walk around or drive the entire time..I recommend walking bc it\u2019s gorgeous and you can really get up close to the animals. To be able to be so close to these animals...such",
          "The musk ox are like something from the Land of the Lost. We saw \"Snickers\" an orphaned porcupine that lives at the center, as well as foxes, bears, moose, reindeer and more.",
          "This was better than going to the zoo. Animals were more a active and great gift shop. We had alot of fun driving through it.",
          "Really enjoyed our morning and afternoon at the Wildlife conservation center. Although it was a bit rainy (typical for the area), it was nice to be able to drive to different areas and pop out to see the animals up close. Most of the animals were very active. Definitely see the",
          "We only had about 3/4 here but managed to see the bears and moose and a number of other animals (porcupines, elk, deer, bison, bald eagle) in that time. The animal enclosures are all pretty big so they can roam a fair bit. We scooted through the gift shop but didn\u2019t have time to",
          "I have lived in Alaska for 10 years. When anyone visits, this is a must see. The animals here are rescued from wildfires, or bad situations. It\u2019s a great way to see wild animals close up and appreciate their beauty.",
          "We spent one and half hour looking at moose, elk , deer, brown and black bears etc Entrance fee fid adults $14 each",
          "A great place to see Alaska wildlife up close, but still in a nice, open environment. All outdoors, so best on a sunny day.",
          "We enjoyed the animals, the pleasant walk and the staff. We watched two of the programs while there (bear and wolf) and they were both great.",
          "Amazing place working hard for animal conservation and education. Plan on at least half day to truly experience each animal and educational talks (schedule on their website). If short on time, highly recommend the wolf talk, which ends with a pack howl, a must experience. You",
          "We enjoyed a couple of hours here... looking at the Alaskan animals. In particular, the brown bear areas were very well designed . You could view the bears from an elevated boardwalk without looking through a fence. The whole place was well laid out. Neat and clean facilities.",
          "This place is a must see. They have almost all of the animals indigenous to the Pacific Northwest. I went a few years ago and it was on my list to go again. I loved this facility.",
          "We stopped here as part of our transfer from Anchorage to Seward. We only stopped for an hour, and could have spent a lot more time. We'd already been in Alaska for a week, and had only seen bears from a distance, so it was great to see them up close (as with the porcupine). All",
          "Very special place to go and take children with u. Grizzly and black bears near to you but in a safe way. Very large area for all animals, so you don\u2019t have the same feelings like a zoo.",
          "Had a fun time. Great place to see the wildlife up close. Can drive or walk it and take pictures. Even my to cool son fought enjoying himself. Definitely stop if you are in the area. Very easy trip from Anchorage.",
          "Visited The Conservation Center on a rainy day with friends from Anchorage but still had an amazing time. Saw so many animals from the red fox, maple fox, elk, caribou, brown bears, a black bear, Sitka black tailed deer, and even a bald eagle that was shot in 1995 and had to",
          "This park was a fun last minute stop. We had some time to kill so decided to stop by. The park was easy to walk around and had driving access for people who don\u2019t want to walk it. Saw lots of animals up close (feet away from bears/wolves!) Very well kept facility. Would",
          "We had a quick visit and walked to see the local wildlife being rehabilitated. The viewing areas were nice and accessible but the only food was as food truck serving coffee and prewrapped hotdogs.",
          "Everywhere you look you see beauty. Truly an amazing experience. Highly recommend for everyone to see. Pictures cannot do justice.",
          "What a very wild day, spent at the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Centre. Up close and very personal with the wild locals. Visit the rescued animals in a large refuge. Spend a few hours and walk or 1 hour and drive around the park and see the animals in their enclosures.",
          "Excellent day at the conservatory. Enjoy seeing all the animals. The best part is reading how the animals came to be part of the conservatory. Nice gift shop and a few food trucks. Great day to spend with family or friends.",
          "This was worth the drive to us even though alot of the animals were under cover-it was also fun regardless of the rain the whole time. Got to see many up close and got good pics-price was fine to us to see this place and most all of the enclosures are good for these larger",
          "A very interesting place to visit if you want to see some Alaskan wildlife. Bears, eagles, porkupines, oxen and lots of other critters are available to view in their large enclosures at the Center. Great. Highly Recommend.",
          "We visited on a rainy day which meant less interaction with staff and most of the time spent in our vehicle. The boardwalk between the bear exhibits is well done. The entry fee is high unless one considers it to be a donation towards wildlife conservation. That makes the price",
          "All the animals in one spot. The offered \u201cmeet the foxes\u201d didn\u2019t happen - not sure why but no one showed up. Otherwise was great to see some animals up close. Felt bad for some of them whose enclosures seemed really small for that size animal. Had thought they would be s little",
          "The Alaska wildlife conservation center is a great place to view local wildlife. The bear and wolf areas were my favorite. The scenic drive from anchorage is well worth the trip",
          "Im so glad to see their work. I was able to enjoy seeing the animals and care givers in person after following their site for a year. Only downside is the inability to get good pics through wire. Wish they had platforms for clean pics. But good experience.",
          "We stopped in on our way from Anchorage to Whittier and greatly enjoyed our visit. Aside from learning about various animals native to Alaska, the views around the wildlife center are breathtaking. Would recommend this as a must see for any animal lovers visiting the area. The",
          "Visited and saw native animals very close from a raised walkway. It was a wonderful trip. Would definitely go again",
          "Had the most amazing walking tour on our trip. Was definitely the highlight of visiting Alaska. The animals were awesome and our guide provided us with great information on the land, animals and sanctuary. This place does so much for the special animals of Alaska, donations keep",
          "Happened by this spot in the road back to Anchorage. Lots of cool wildlife that just fit in perfectly to the surroundings.",
          "Worth a trip from Anchorage. Wrap up warm as the wind gets up in the valley. Nice to see local animals up close, most of the enclosures are a good size with plenty of roaming room for the resident animals. Lovely gift shop and coffee available.",
          "Lots of animals for the children to see! I enjoyed the brown bears the most! Definitely worth the 30 min drive!",
          "This area has a lot of good Alaska animals like musk ox, moose and an eagle and bears, but all the fencing makes it difficult to bring home nice pictures.",
          "Second time there and it's a great place to visit and see the Alaskan wildlife. Great exhibits to see and read about all that is there in Alaska. Daily programs with different animals.Great place to relax and enjoy the environment and animals. Beautiful drive there on the Seward",
          "I was convinced by the website to do the Walk on the Wild tour, where you get to feed a moose and have a personalized tour of the facility. My husband and I were shown around by Duane, who was an excellent guide, very knowledgable and friendly, who made us feel very welcome.",
          "There weren't a lot of any one animal (and as it was, there only had around 15 types of animals) and while you don't want them to have too many animals, because that means there are more injuries, you also feel a little shafted for spending $$ to not see that much (they do have",
          "Participated in the Walk on the Wild side Tour (WOW Tour). Great experience, tour guide, Duane, was very thorough in his presentations and genuinely engaged with our group. Observing Austin, their designated animal feeder, execute his daily care taking duties really brought the",
          "Very thankful the conservation center afforded my class and I the opportunity to tour and learn as much as possible about the care the animals receive. Our tour guide (conservation employee) not only came to our classroom in Palmer, but also guided us on a more detailed",
          "We didn\u2019t have he best weather, but this place is worth the visit. Exceptional staff with huge hearts and a huge commitment to animals. Here you are guaranteed to see the wildlife! Thanks to Duane for his great knowledge and humor!",
          "First off the park is a rescue and the animals are there to rehabilitate them and if possible reintroduce them into the wild (though a very informative guide, Duane I think, told us most of the animals are there for life). The animals are all healthy ( discounting the",
          "Such a fun experience! We arrived at the conservation center and it was a little overcast but that didn\u2019t stop the fun! For $10 more than the initial cost we were able to feed a moose! And the rest of the center was awesome. The moose feeding occurs at 10:30am. And all the other",
          "This is such a magnificent attraction. Well guided by staff, but also there\u2019s plenty of space to wander at your own pace. Take a camera and spend plenty of time. These people are doing a fantastic job",
          "Lots of animals living in large enclosures roaming relatively free but easily visible from the roadway through the complex. We saw all the animals listed except the beaver and porcupine. It was one of the first days of sunshine, so most were out soaking up rays. We saw moose,",
          "Plan to spend a few hours walking around. Only other place you will see these beautiful animals this close is at the zoo!",
          "What an amazing experience! It is incredible to see the amount of animals they are rehabilitating and also working on reintroducing back to the wild. They are doing a wonderful service at AWCC! A MUST SEE if you are visiting Alaska.",
          "I was happy to see so many animals being taken care of by passionate employees. Definitely a great way to see Alaska wildlife. Kids would love this place!",
          "I don\u2019t typically like zoo\u2019s but this was something different. All of the animals were there rehabilitating or were born in captivity and can\u2019t be released back into the wild.",
          "It was nice to see the wild animals rescued and being taken care of. Overall the layout was good. There were many tourists who had purchased the stopover transit from hotel to cruise ships and everyone had the same schedule on the road as there was specific timing for the gate",
          "We loved this place. It's great to know that there is a place that takes on animals in need of some human intervention when they cannot be released back into the wild. The option to either walk or drive is great and the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable. Great",
          "Nice layout. Accessible to a lot of people... you can drive the 2 mile road or walk it. I like the concept of having a place for the animal that can\u2019t be release into the wild for a reason or another. Each animal have their own enclosure and we couldn\u2019t interact with them.",
          "We had a bad day to view the animals, literally colder and wetter than the mountains had been. But the bears were cool, they put on a show. And you had to feel for some of the animals with nowhere else to go like the eagle with only one wing, ouch.",
          "We had a free day and came by rental car from Anchorage. Seward highway was free of snow/ice. Although WLCC had snow roads, not a problem to drive. There were only a few cars, so we could park by the bears and other areas. Great to see the animals and also the beautiful scenery.",
          "It was a great price to get to see all the animals. We were able to take our time and watch the animals. It was nice to see them and learn about them.",
          "We had the best time walking and touring throught the Wildlife Conservation Center. The animals wer very big and so beautiful.",
          "There aren\u2019t a ton of things to see but we still enjoyed it and id opt to drive it in bad weather. I think it was a memorable experience I would definitely return",
          "We really enjoyed the conservation center. It was very inexpensive and full of wildlife everywhere. Close up photos of bears and moose.",
          "Only had short time but enjoyed seeing the bears, wolves, bald eagle, porcupine and musk ox. Everywhere looked well kept. Toilet facilities were clean.",
          "We had a quick stop here. Got to see several animals. You can tell the workers love taking care of them. Great place to see the local animals!",
          "The picture with this site does not depict the Alaska Wildlife Conservation Center I visited. There is a variety of animals, but their quantity of each is very small. March may have been a factor. Please take that into consideration. There is, however, good background knowledge",
          "The animals were spectacular and we were fortunate enough to be there during feeding time. The animals were very active, and the handlers were very attentive to them. On our way out we talked with one of the workers that did some of the animal presentations. He was very",

          "Upfront encounters with Alaska wildlife animals. Guided tours or drive through and enjoy on your own pace.",
          "We drove from Anchorage to the park. Beautiful journey in the snow. Enjoyed walking around the park in the snow. Shame we didn't see the bears but I guess they were hibernating. Lovely place to spend a couple of hours \ud83d\ude0a",
          "The bear exhibit was incredible--those animals have a huge, natural area to roam, and humans can get very close with the raised viewing path. The moose also have a very large area, and one or two always seem near the fence. A few enclosures were small and sad, like for the",

          "The Alaska Conservation Center is one my favorite places to take people who come to visit. The cost for admittance is so very reasonable, especially for Alaska! It's a drive thru park, but they have it set up well so you can park at different places on the route and get out and",
          "I was born and raised and still live in Alaska. I love this place and try to go once a year. Always a great experience and love the animals and how close you can get to them.",
          "We became members before our trip so we could visit a few times. I suggest parking and walking around - this was our first view of a moose & bears. Great photo opps- keep up the great work! They also had the best t-shirt designs that I saw in our 2 wks of touring :)",
          "We visit here often and it\u2019s always so much fun. We bring family here whenever they visit and it\u2019s lived by all ages. The new bear exhibit is great. I could watch the bears eat all day. Definitely a must visit!",
          "Animals looked well cared for. It was feeding time when we arrived. Duwane was very friendly and feeding Snicker the porcupine. Duwane was very informative and engaging. All animals looked healthy and well cared for. My only complaint was that when 5 of us walked into the gift",
          "Great place to take the family for up close views of big Alaskan animals. The bears are really fun to watch!",
          "I love going to the ConservationCenter! There are so many animals to see that you normally don\u2019t see on a hiking or backpacking trip. If the bears aren\u2019t sleeping, then definitely check them out. There\u2019s also a black bear and an arctic wolf.",
          "We had a fantastic day at the Conservation Center. I chose to book the Walk on the Wild Side Tour in the hopes of getting up close to more of the animals. Our guide was Duane, and we could not have asked for better. I feel like we left afterward knowing so much more about the",
          "Since I only had one day in Anchorage, I visited this place as part of an organised tour. Great place to see animals that otherwise would be difficult to spot in the wild. Nice winter wonderland with animals.",
          "we picked a very nice day to go not to cold out you can start out by walking to the first couple cages where the animals are kept and then finish driving to the other areas we got to see the one bear playing in the snow and he rolled down the hill he was sitting on and got as",

Unfortunately for people on wheelchair it is very hard to visit the park as most of the outside is gravel and it is hard to push a wheelchair.

          "This place was not worth my time. They say the animals are in their natural habitat. I do not believe this to be true. The animals looked miserable. It was a waste of time. I am not sure why they think this is a good thing. To drive is \u2026",
          "There are a lot of wildlife with seeing like brown and black bears, bison, a bald eagle, white fox, owl, elk, reindeer, moose, and a few others. It's a nice walk and is next to the inlet. \n\nThe price was $14 per person regardless of age but \u2026",

          "Nice idea.  We walked the two mile loop en route to Anchorage from Seward. We saw all of the animals in large enclosures. I don't know what I was expecting other than lethargic animals in penned enclosures. I get how animals are rescued and \u2026",
          "Loved this place! Great collection of native animals and tours to educate the visitor. Gift shop was pretty darn good too!",
          "This place is awesome.. even got to see a newborn moose. Loved our time there!!!",
          "Well worth the price. About a half mile dirt road that can be walked or driven. Large pens for bears, moose, wolves, deer etc. By far the easiest views of large wildlife. Birds of prey including bald eagles congregate at all feeding times around the pens. Food for purchase and restrooms available.",
          "Wonderful experience to see animals in their natural habitats.",
          "Wonderful facility! The enclosures were well maintained and the animals seemed generally happy! Beautiful views here as well!",
          "Bring good walk shoes and time. Not sure if animals are watching the people or are people watching animals, no matter. It's great to be outdoors and see them up close. Wow and experience. Bring the kids of all ages.",

          "Very good place to visit",

          "This is a rip off from a tourist perspective... $28 for two of us for a 15 min drive through alot of mud and potholes... however my friend kept reminding me that the money was going to save the animals which made it feel better... would be more appreciated by children I'm sure",
          "If you skunk out on seeing wild animals in Alaska, this is a good alternative. Excellent day trip from Anchorage. Can drive or walk a loop to view native Alaskan animals. Has a gazebo with a great view of the turnagain arm.",
          "A must stop. This place is great. Animals you would never see. Bison, reindeer, black bears and so much more.",

          "Very cool self guided tour that only costs a few bucks. You can drive through and park and view different wildlife that has been rescued.",
          "Seems a little pricey, but I'm sure it does take a bit to feed and care for the animals. Not a huge place. Animals were out and seemed to be having quite a good time. Read the negative reviews before I went and must say I don't think most \u2026",
          "Pretty cool place, but I can't give it 5 stars because Bear Country USA in South Dakota is much better.  This one has all of the animals in enclosures that you stay on the outside of.  At the one in SD, you drove THROUGH the exhibits (with \u2026",
          "A great place too see the rehabilitation of several animals, most native to Alaska. For me getting extremely close too a bull moose was an exceptional",

          "Very cool stop. Lots of active animals!",
          "Very nice place to see animals up close. Especially local animals. You can watch them when feeding, walk or drive through.  Moderately priced with a gift shop and small food vendor.",
          "This was way overpriced at $15 per person. The animals were nice to see. It's kind of like a very small zoo. It's worth $5 per person max. There are so many more things to see in Alaska. I would not go again. The food & gift shop were \u2026",
          "The animals here are taken such good care of here. I normally don't like the concept of zoo-type centers, but I don't consider this to be one. The animal enclosures are enormous and well maintained.",

          "Great place the see wildlife up close.",
          "I purchased two tickets for AWCC online and printed out my purchase confirmation email. I showed my print out to the employee at the entrance gate, was given a receipt with tape to put on the inside of my windshield. It serves as an all day \u2026",
          "Good experience to know more about Alaska native animals and see some of them in action. The small animals and birds need more space. Better walking path would be good for seniors",
          "It was a great place for the Alaska visitors, who missed to see any wild life and you get to see lots of animals, entrance fee $15",
          "Nice place. Doing good for the animals.  Kids tour was going on when there and they were patient and informative with the kids",
          "Too cold for us Southerners to walk around but the center has it set-up where you can drive or walk to the different exhibits, doesn't take long to drive it. Lots of info posted about the different types of animals, very informative visitor's center. Nice touch with the food stand and gift shop.",

          "Pretty cool way to show wildlife while keeping them safe and the humans safe. I really enjoyed the best area seeing how active the bears were before 2pm",
          "Brilliant experience today awesome to see the animals. Must come again!! 100% recommended for anyone especially coming off cruise ships to pass by :)",

          "We love this place and are annual members. Go see the amazing variety of animals they have! The elk bulls are always fun to watch...a bunch of hooligans! They do good work and obviously care about the quality of life of the residents!",
          "This was a nice place to see wildlife. It is a small place and you can walk through in about an hour. It's sad to see animals behind fences but this place is helping sick or wounded and placing back into the wild when they can.",
          "Perfect for a rainy day in Alaska. If you driving down to seward it is worth a visit, especially with kids",

          "A very cool place to take your family. Lots of cool Alaskan animals. You can see the moose up close! You may or may not see bears, so if you're banking on that, you might be disappointed.

          "Good variety of animals . You will enjoy the sights",
          "Really good loop that you can walk or drive to get really close to the animals. Maximizes your chance of recognizing them in the wild.",
          "Seriously disappointing. It's basically a big area where you drive through and see animals as you're passing. You can get out and walk up to them at the gate or fence. The black bears were really cool and the Moose were cool. We were in and out in basically no time at all.",
          "Beautiful place to spend a few hours. I took a lot of nice pictures.",

          "It does seem overpriced but its going to a good cause right? Definitely go during the times on the board for the animals you're interested in. If you arrive and there's no activities happening soon I can see why you'd be disappointed. I was \u2026",

          "Very interesting. Glad the human race is taking care of the wild life.",

          "Tons of animals from Alaska. Very informative and beautiful park. I enjoyed the option of either walking or driving around.",
          "AWCC is a wonderful place to visit while in Alaska. Got to see some of my favorite animals up close! Some of the enclosures seem small although maybe they are the size they are supposed to, I'm no expert..",
          "Very cool place to see some Alaskan Animals. Make sure it is open, because in winter the days are short, so their hours are short. You can drive your car through the whole thing, so if you can\u2019t walk or aren\u2019t much of a walker, you can see \u2026",

          "Wonderful center with so many animals.  Appreciate the good work they do.",

          "It was absolutely amazing!! I loved the wolves.",

          "It was neat and as far as I could tell, good to support. A little disappointing in the lack of movement from animals as far as what could see good or not but still had a good time. Mostly saw bears and did a lot of editing to get the fence out of the pictures bc of where they were laying lol",
          "Stopped here as part of a tour. Had a great time seeing all of the wildlife. Our tour guide also had stories about some of the individual animals as well which made it a lot more special than going to a zoo.\n\nWe got to see some of the bears \u2026",

          "Great place for family and kids. Lot of Alaska animals.",

          "This was not very good. Poor animals are definitely not in their natural habitat. Not worth the price",
          "Love to see all these wildlife animals up close!!!\n\nInstead of joining the cruise excursion and HOPING we can spot any wildlife in the jungle, we chose to come to the wildlife conservation center!!\n\nMaybe because they have seen human \u2026",
          "Lots of animals to see. You can drive through, but walking will hive you an up close look at these incredible animals",
          "My husband & I visited the AWCC on Thu Aug 8, 2019. It is definitely a mixed bag, almost gave it 2 stars, but will wait to hear from staff before I make that decision, or possibly upgrade my rating.\n\nHere are my concerns: 1) the 2 moose \u2026",
          "Plenty of animals in well kept areas made to mimic the areas they are normally found in.",
          "Beautiful place! And to the young lady who was making coffee today(5-7-19) the machine works great and the coffee is delicious!",
          "An opportunity to view wild animals. Disappointing however that such little space is given to bear, eagle and wolf. This place felt more like a zoo than a conservation center in some areas.",
          "One of the best places to see on our land/ sea cruise! Best place to actually see Alaska animals that few get to see in the wild. At 200 acres, plenty of natural habitat even though they are fenced in somewhat to protect the humans but does \u2026",
          "It seems the bears are always playing in the water when we go. Such awesome animals to watch.",

          "Wonderful place",
          "Awesome place. They do an amazing job with the wildlife. Very educational also. Well worth the trip down from Anchorage.",
          "First stop from the airport - felt good to get out and stretch our legs. Not overly exciting. Seen it, done it kind d of place.  Not very many animals.  Kids would enjoy as they can run all over and you can wear them out \ud83d\ude00",
          "Had a chance to see bears up close and personal. Lots of wildlife to see.",
          "Fun place to see a lot of animals and spend a couple hours",
          "Really easy to see all of the animals and the gift shop is really cute",
          "If you have not been able to see the bid animal of Alaska - bear, moose, deer, fox - in the wild. Then this is a great place to definitely see them all! There is reindeer, bears, bison, musk-ox, foxes! They also have an eagle, which we \u2026",

          "This center is amazing! Love all the animals and a great place to make sure you see almost all the land animals in Alaska. Great exhibits and love watching the bear feedings in the afternoons during the summer. If you are visiting Alaska this is a great place to visit!",
          "The only place I saw a freaking moose.  Haha",
          "Very huge facilities... we can walk or ride our own car or RV. If you want to see Alaska's animal then this is the place.",
          "You can see the animals that they have saved and will be let back into the wild .",
          "You will see all the animals listed.\nExpensive for what it is.  Food is basically a hot dog stand",
          "Worth the stop! Very cool photo opportunity of lots of animals",

          "Worth stopping. Very nice all the Animals were out and active.",

          "This is a great place to stop by on the way from Anchorage to Seward. However, we've already spent a few days in Denali and after seeing animals in the wild, the captives here seem a bit depressing. We understand this conservation center is \u2026",
          "Nice place to learn about sea life and they're doing nice work.",

          "This place was awesome!!  So many cool animals to see.",
          "Between Seward and Girdwood lies the Wildlife Conservation Center. It\u2019s a place to see moose, bears and other animals that have been rescued from the wild. The whole place is a little too sad with the porcupine showing stereotypic caged behaviour by walking up and down. It\u2019s a favourite of cruise ship pre and post tours.",
          "This is quite interesting. And this place has a purpose.",
          "Loved it, and got to see lots of amazing animals!  Only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was bear feeding. Handler making bear sit and stand on command to get food. This is not a circus! These animals would be wild except for trauma so \u2026",
          "This place does amazing things for injured and abandoned animals. They have great staff and show when they feed the animals. A great way to see some of Alaska\u2019s wildlife.",

          "Fun to see the animals close up front in their habitat.",
          "An excellent place to visit and see wildlife you only see in outdoor magazines and TV shows.  We heard the Bull Elks mating call, but too bad for him no cow came his way. Watching the bears from above is a cool experience too.  They Lunx \u2026",
          "This place is totally awesome well worth the price to get in the people seem very knowledgeable about the animals and you can get pretty close to some nice wildlife",
          "It's is just a very bad zoo. \nThe exhibits are not cared for. It seems as if someone fenced their land and casually done animals were inside",
          "Well worth to see the fantastic work they do....and the gift shop was surprisingly cheap with the money ploughed back into the venue.....Well done!",
          "A very nice place to view wild animals.",
          "Great to learn about the other life with which we share this planet.",
          "Great views! The educational boards are also very humorous and interesting. Worth the cost. We got out to walk around but all the spots were drivable and had parking areas to get out and read. There\u2019s a section that\u2019s still unopen, and I felt the one special learning session I attended was too short.",
          "Fun stop between Seward and Anchorage.  Kids loved it.",
          "At first it didn't seem like it was worth the $15 a head, but with a little patience it ended up being pretty cool.  Both my kids ( 20 year olds) enjoyed it.  The moose are giants, standing over 7 ft tall.  The bison are my favorite...they \u2026",
          "Amazing photo ops with bears and was able to howl with the wolves",
          "Great wildlife but roads, signage and mobility  access were all poor which made our visit more challenging than anticipated",
          "Great chance to see native Alaska wildlife up close",
          "Awesome place that does awesome work. There are so many different animals to see and get up close to. It's well-worth a visit when coming to this part of Alaska. The gift shop is also really great and has a lot of great local items to take home. One of the highlights of our trip!",
          "The center was great.  Without it we would have not seen either bears nor moose during our Alaska cruise/ trip.  We visited on August 30.  It was cold and the lines for hot beverages were too long.  They can improve by having an extra line \u2026",
          "A fantastic stop to see the native wildlife. You are able to get much closer than you would at a zoo. So many beautiful animals are kept there. It has a great gift shop too ;)",
          "Great way to See the most of Alaska Wild and wilderness a must stop for everyone.",
          "Great place much better than any zoo. You can get quite close to the animals.",

          "Beautiful absolutely brilliant amazing",
          "If you are not sure to see the wildlife in Alaska or if you want to see them closely, this is right place. \nYou can see bears, coyote, wolves, elk, moose and more\nYou can enjoy around 1 to 2 hours to see them all.",
          "What an absolutely amazing experience I had here! Well worth the price of admission to support this place. I especially loved watching the Bear cub play next to the wolf pack the day I was there. \n\nIf you\u2019re driving from anchorage the drive itself is also beautiful so this is like a 2 in 1 experience.",
          "Lots of animals. Support a good cause!",
          "Wonderful conservatory for the wild animals. Up close encounters, helpful & knowledgeable staff & caregivers.",
          "Loved the experience here. Definitely a must see when visiting. You also see tons of wildlife and eagles on the way! Loved it. Family from out of town enjoyed the unique experience as well. The scenery on the way from Anchorage and while we were there was absolutely breathtaking!",
          "First hand view of Alaskan wildlife. A gift shop is available for a wide selection of gift ideas.",
          "The bear walk is really cool. They have grizzlies and black bears. I enjoyed the moose the most. I didn\u2019t expect the conservation center to offer lunch but they had a BBQ stand. I also liked that mostly all the animals were rescues in some shape or form.",
          "Really good place for animals viewing. Learned a lot about them.",
          "This place is a bit of a hidden gem. After having driven past it numerous times, we decided to check it out and I was pleasantly surprised. There was a lot more there than I expected. Lots of different animals native to Alaska in a large area. Worth checking out!",
          "This is the best place to take pictures of Alaskan wildlife. It is a non-profit that rescues animals that need rehabilitation. I dare say that this was the best stop I took during my visit to this wonderful state.\n\nPlease \"like\" if this review has been helpful to you.",
          "This is an amazing place to see wildlife and nature near Anchorage. I could spend a week coming back here and spending time with the Bears, Caribou, deer and the tons of other amazing wildlife that this preserve has to offer and educate people on. A lovely place to visit for cruise tours and an amazing place to take a drive to!",
          "Unique location where you can see native Alaskan wildlife up close.",
          "It was a really nice place to see wild animals of Alaska. They are in nice enclosures and are obviously well taken care of. Most of them have been rescued and would not survive in the wild. Good job AWCC.",
          "A very good place to see Alaskan wild life",
          "Really cool place to see some wildlife up close.  Unfortunately dusty roads diminished the experience as passing cars throw dust in your face.",
          "Good to visit but it is designed to care for permanently injured animals instead of being a zoo.  Best if you are able to time your visit with some of the animal feeding times.  We saw the porcupine being fed and it was great to be able to see it being much more active",
          "Cool place. Working hard to show the wildlife of Alaska and save the lives of a few in the process.",
          "A great way to contribute to a good cause and see some of Alaska's famous wildlife up close and personal. You get the added benefit of wonderful scenery, too.",
          "It's a great easy walk around the animals. You can drive which is good for people who have mobility restrictions. Wounderfull to get kids out and feel closer to the wild life. Just get there early enough because the tour buses take over the place at about 12 to 1 o'clock.",
          "Worth the visit.  To see the animals and what they are doing to help conservation.  Will be back something \ud83d\ude00",
          "They rescue orphaned animals and birds and give them a home. Cute bears!",
          "The drive out was really nice, the center allows you to walk or drive.  There are covered areas ( it was raining) the staff was friendly and knowable they have clean bathrooms and a nice souvenir shop as well.",
          "Really liked the place. Very similar to the Yellowstone bear world. The place can be easy to miss on your right if you are driving down from anchorage and the next turn out is only after eight miles so keep a lookout. Did see a lot of tour \u2026",
          "Great place to see any native Alaska wildlife you may not of had a chance to see while on your Alaskan cruise. If you are cruising from north to south a good place to see what to look out for in the wild of Alaska. Most animals are laid out \u2026",
          "I'd put this on your must do list for an Alaska trip. The animals are given way more space than I've ever seen in any zoo. Many are rescues, and some were too injured to return to the wild. I got the sense that the people here really care about their animals. If you didn't get to see an animal in the wild, come see them here.",
          "Lots of animals to see & nice gift shop.",
          "Quick layover...lots of animals roaming around",
          "Loved every minute of it \u2764\ufe0f",
          "Animals look healthy and happy!! $16 little expensive. I loved the time spent here.",
          "Animals seemed happy and relaxed, and like they enjoyed interacting with the crowd.",
          "Big place. Got to see many animals. Plan hour or more.",
          "Turns into a winter wonderland with the snow. Very scenic and they do a good job attracting the animals to easy to see places. Make sure you catch the white wolf padding around with his pack.",
          "Must see worth the drive so picturesque bears, moose, wolves, educational family fun for all!",
          "This is a really neat facility to see local wildlife. All of the animals seem content and well cared for and the enclosures are all good sized. There were several babies (wood bison and deer) when we were there, so that was a treat. Everything is easily accessible and the surrounding mountain views are beautiful.",
          "I enjoyed this place because it is clean and well cared for, and the animals seemed happy and healthy. The staff actually care.",
          "This place was awesome, I went before years ago and it wasn't nearly as nice as it is now. Even in the rain we saw all the animals!",
          "It's alright to stop on the way to seward or Anchorage. Good place to see the wildlife.",
          "This a beautiful spot, not far from Wittier on the main road down from Anchorage. \n\nSet back from the road, this animal sanctuary gives you the chance to see amazing animals, up close in an amazing setting, surrounded by snow capped \u2026",
          "Well maintained. Worthwhile place to visit.",
          "Bears come right to the fence and are so friendly",
          "Great little zoo that is helping wildlife and educating people",
          "Great place to see all kinds of animals",
          "A great place to see Alaskan wildlife.",
          "Liked the refuge, but under better conditions.   It rained the whole time we were there.",
          "What a great place to see all sorts of Alaska wildlife.  I went there twice in the past month.  It\u2019s best to go on a cool and cloudy day, as the animals are more active then.  The animals have lots of room to roam, as compared to a zoo. \u2026",
          "Nice place. Cold and rainy right now. But would come back if I had the chance. Most animals are bedded down in March/rain.",
          "The animals are amazing. The gift shop items are a little pricey. Like you are paying $9 for and I could get the same exactly the same for cheaper. On the other hand some of the stuff have a reasonable price like the skins.",
          "Good solid place. Lots of animals.",
          "Animals seemed very sad and unkempt; we saw the wolves and foxes trying to escape. They seemed perfectly healthy. Very little information about why each animal was there and what the treatment plan is, leading me to believe this is a \u2026",
          "Beautiful setting, lots of animals. A nice place to spend a few hours. Fee very reasonable. Nice gift shop! Appropriate for all ages, as you can drive by the animals if walking is an issue.",
          "Neat place.   Walkable, but driving to cut the size down  a bit may be smarter next time",
          "Good place for kids, but few animals can be seen",
          "Loved it here. Great way to see alot of the Alaskan wildlife.",
          "Recommended visit if you're ever in the area",
          "It was a very cool place. It has bears, bison, elk, and other native Alaskan wildlife. They had a bear feeding at the time that we got there, so we got to watch bears tear into some meat and veggies. There also were soe wild dogs, and those were cool to see. It was a good place.",
          "Great visit loved the animals",
          "It didn't live up to its hype. It was OK for a one time visit but it required us to take a 200 USD round trip Uber from Anchorage which is too much for a tourist not renting a car. The staff was great though.",
          "Nice place to Go and see some of the wildlife.",
          "Had a great time seeing all the animals",
          "You can see lots of wild animals here! Caribou, moose, wolf, elk, .....etc. just 2 miles route you can walk in this center. It just need to take 30min -1hour I you like take a photo.",
          "Place is simply amazing! A must visit if you are visiting Anchorage. We caught it on our drive from Seward to Anchorage after our cruise, which is an awesome drive as well. The kids will love it and so will the adults.",
          "Lots of beautiful animals but not terribly educational...just a go and see place. Great mission statement/purpose.  Demos and \"pseudo ranger\" education would improve the experience-there was a school group in when we were there so perhaps that's where the staff was.  Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",
          "It's a small place but a good one to check out.",
          "Excellent way to get up close with Alaska's wildlife safely.",
          "It was fun to get up close to the Bears and Moose !",
          "A unique experience for me, just relocating from South Florida. I appreciated the opportunity to see open spaces, plenty of roaming areas, and seeing the staff interaction with people. I really enjoyed the time we spent here.",
          "Worth the money to see all of the wild life that the area has to offer",
          "Awesome place to see rescue animals in Alaska in a safe environment.",
          "Love it!",
          "The moose encounter is fantastic, the animals are great, and it's a lovely place.",
          "Great place especially for kids.",
          "Perfect for kids and it's a 2 mile walk to see all the animals. Plus not very expressive!",
          "They do a great job. Drive through or walk for a more up close view of these rescued animals.",
          "Nice to see some wild animals close up.",
          "Absolutely breathtaking views of wildlife in their natural habitats. Worth the trip and a better option than the zoo, which is same price. The bridge over the bears was definitely the highlight. Unforgettable!",
          "Great stop on the road to Seward\n\nWe stopped here on a cruise transfer from Anchorage to Seward. Our 90 minute stop was sufficient for lunch, a walking tour and lots of photos. The animals are well cared for, with lots of room to roam. This was a fun stop.",
          "Great stop! Nice to see a place taking care of these majestic animals. Worth the price of admission,  the money is going for a good cause. Not a zoo like setting. Visited on 8/27/18",
          "This was a highlight of my Alaska trip. A great chance to see local wildlife up close in their natural surroundings (I\u2019ve seen very little wildlife elsewhere in Alaska so I\u2019m glad I saw it here!). A beautiful setting too.",
          "This was really nice to see the animals and had the time to watch and see them as long as we wanted.",
          "Had a good time here, I actually visited with a tour. While there are a lot of animals, there is not a lot of diversity and part of the park was closed when we went. Altogether, the animals seemed content and we got some good up-close shots.",
          "Up close and personal with the wildlife.  It was great to see them in their habitats.  The place itself needs to do a better job of separating cars and people.  And it is super dusty.",
          "It was so hot out, we felt sorry for all the animals. Global warming!!",
          "Priceless place the animals are amazing the keepers were very informative",
          "Amazing place to go see wildlife up close and personal. good quality exhibits and educational programming. worth the money to go.",
          "The conservation effort is remarkable. This is a must stop if you are in Anchorage. You get so close to the bears you get a feel for their individual personalities. There is a wide variety of wildlife and 20+ acres of free space for the animlas. This is NOT a zoo, it's an educational experience in a beautiful setting.",
          "Awesome! What a treat! Support local wildlife and visit. :)",
          "Wonderful Concervatipn Site in Alaska.",
          "This was well worth the money. I saw all the animals up close and personal including bear and moose. A really nice place",
          "I like the mission, but they need to be able to invest in more land for suitability of the wildlife. The bear and wolf areas are about 30 square miles short, and the rain deer/ carabu are about 100 square acres short. If we can rally some funding that would be focused on procuring additional land, that would be great.",
          "So cool to see all the wildlife up close",
          "Super cool!\n\nYou can tour this conservatory in your car at your own pace, and park to look at the animals as well. There are bison, black and brown bears, birds and eagles, yaks, an owl and reindeer.\n\nThe gift shop is nice too.",
          "Fun place to see native animals.",
          "I really wasn't sure if I was going to like this place but it was really fun. It is nice they way they have it set up and if you are in the area with no other plans you should definitely come visit. You get to see a lot of wildlife up \u2026",
          "A real nice time, great to view animals.",
          "Amazing educational place to visit",
          "Loved this place and the work they do. Intend to visit again!",
          "Nice clean place but we didn't get to see the bear....the eagle was so beautiful the Wolfpack are cool...I got some really cool stuff the bring back home (San Diego) at the gift shop",
          "A nice little activity right off the highway. Signs for the enclosures have a lot of interesting information about the animal species, as well as some which are about particular residents (Adonis the one-winged bald eagle, for instance). We \u2026",
          "A great place to take the family. See animals up close and personal. This is a conservation park, not a zoo, so they are continuously upgrading and improving.",

          "Beautiful.  Well taken care of. Informative.",
          "Great place to see a lot of animals!",
          "Great help. Thank you",
          "The only way to see bear and moose without fear for you life. Many other interesting animals as well. Worth the drive and totally worth the money.",
          "They are doing an amazing job by taking care of these refuse and orphan animals. Got to saw a large number of Bison, bear, mux ox, moose, reindeer. There was an eagle who was shot and he is there since 1995. Awesome place to visit",
          "Had a super time here. You all have to do this without driving Your car through it Walk it",
          "What a great place to come and see some Wildlife prices are very cheap and there's plenty to see it's worth the trip.  $16.00 for adults.",
          "I love showing my friends from out of state this place. It is a great way to experience alaskan wildlife while also supporting local conservation. These views around the center are breathtaking \u2013 you can not get away from the scenic \u2026",
          "So many great animals and beautiful location!",
          "Awesome. Can be dusty. Worth the price.",
          "I love visiting Alaska.  This is truely God's country",

          "Spectacular views of Cook Inlet. Walkway winds around, wheelchair accessible. Posted placards explain view points.",
          "Great statue, beautiful views. Very quiet early in the morning to just reflect. Within walking distance from several downtown hotels.",
          "Good place for sunset viewing! We came here after dinner, and the sunset was remarkable! When in the area make sure you stop by.",
          "This is just a small park with a monument to Captain Cook and an overlook of Cook Inlet. There is a large walkway that allows different views of the inlet.",
          "Not only do you get to learn about Captian Cook and his role in Alaska's history, you get stunning views from here across the water and you can even see Mount McKinley on a clear day! Beautiful and picture perfect vistas!",
          "Resolution Park (named after Captain Cook's ship) is about a 10min walk from the city centre and is located at the end of L Street and W 3rd Avenue. This is where the monument of Captain Cook is located as he faces towards the beautiful bay \u2013 other than that there\u2019s nothing",
          "There is the monument of Captain Cook along with his history which is worth a read, but not much else. Good views of the bay from here.",
          "If it is a clear day, you can see a lot --- even Mount McKinley. Unfortunately, my visit was on a very misty and cloudy morning... couldn't really see much except to take a photo of the statue.",
          "The Cook monument is nicely displayed on a deck with a great view of the Cook Inlet. Amazing that Cook and his explorers made it this far north and \"turn again arm\" on his search for a northern passage. It wasn't clear enough to see Denali on the day we visited, but worth a",
          "One of the best views in Anchorage on a clear day. Can see Mt Foraker and the tip of Denali 170 miles away if you get lucky on a clear day. Great views of Knik Arm and Cook Inlet as well as Pt Woronzof over to the left.",
          "A park with a purpose. Come and see Captain Cook as he overlooks the inlet. Great statue and a wooden viewing area to take it all in. Was concerned as there were 2 overseers on sight at 6 pm. Ramp from viewing area leads down to walking bike path.",
          "The view from this quaint park is phenomenal. It let us relax and enjoy your city on a wonderful afternoon.",
          "History & scenery all in one place! It is worth a stop to learn more facts about this explorer. Take the time to read all about him.",
          "One of my favorite spots in downtown anchorage that on clear days offers views of Mt Susitna \u201cSleeping Lady\u201d and if you\u2019re lucky views of Denali over the bluff across Cook Inlet. Also referred to as the Captain Cook monument. Took a Segway tour downtown and this was one of the",
          "Happened upon this small municipal park while walking a few blocks from the Hotel Captain Cook in downtown Anchorage. All I did was tell my husband to go toward the water and viola we were there at this park. There is a statue of Captain Cook along with descriptions about Cook",
          "If you are a history buff then you must visit this site! Standing there next to the statue you can just imagine Captain Cook and his crew sailing past on their way to trying to find a NE passage. Its one of those landmarks you will always remember visiting!",
          "This is a small park with a statue of Captain Cook overlooking Cook Inlet. On a clear day you can see the surrounding mountains, including Mount Sustina which is closer and more visible and Denali which is further away and more likely to be obscured. Worth coming down for the",
          "The place was not far from our hotel, and the view was nice, we could identify several mountain from here, Mt Susitna, Denali (Mt McKinley). And sunset can be seen here nice too. There is also statue of Captain Cook standing on wooden deck.",
          "Resolution Park is a small vertical space overlooking the Anchorage Estuary. The statue to Capt Cook is impressive, and the view is panoramic, but there is little else to the \"park\". It is on a curve in the road, and several locals asked about its whereabouts, didn't have a",

          "Capt. Cook found Anchorage harbor but not northwest passage. This is one of 7 worldwide statutes - copied from one in Whitby England.",
          "Great view of the bay, easy walk, lovely flowers. This was interesting and had history I was unaware of.",
          "This was worth the time just because it was close and historically speaking. Not only did it have the statue of Cook, but you could walk down a boardwalk and see the beautiful scenery.",
          "Resolution Park has a great statue of Captain James Cook and some nice views over Cook Inlet. It is far from a must-see destination but is worth a short stop if you are in the area.",
          "The park itself is pretty average but the views across Cook Inlet to Mount McKinley and a whole bunch of other snow topped mountains was awesome - but you need a clear day to make the trip worthwhile.",
          "Somewhat off the beaten path but worth the extra steps. Great viewing of the inlet and surrounding mountains and land mass. Signage highlighting the distant ranges needs some work to eliminate the effects of weather and local graffiti artists.",
          "I wish we had known about this and planned a run while in Anchorage for one night. We had to satisfy ourselves with a walk before dinner. It is lovely, winds along the water. Lots of locals out at the end of their work day with baby joggers and dogs on leashes. If you are a",

          "On the edge of downtown, off 3rd street. This is basically a wooden viewing platform and a statue. I went around 6am because it was very close and I needed something to do before catching my train. It has some old looking graffiti they need to repair, otherwise it would be five",
          "This is a very fitting statue to a wonderful and talented man, Captain Cook. The views from this wooden pavilion type park are beautiful and so well thought out. A pity about the graffiti and rubbish left around such a historical place.",
          "The Cook monument is a great place to take in views of Cook Inlet and Mt Susitna... and maybe... if you time it right... views of Cook Inlet Belugas swimming by. Its also a fantastic place for sunset photos especially in the spring and fall.",

          "There's not a whole lot here, but the view of Cook Inlet is very nice. It was the perfect walk with the kids after a late arrival. With the long flight and the late sun, we didn't want to go straight to bed, so this was a good choice for our introduction to Alaska.",
          "From this park, you can take in the breathtaking views of the Talkeetnas and the snow-covered Alaskan range. The bronze Captain Cook Monument looks out to sea toward the route he used when he explored Cook Inlet in 1778 aboard the HMS Resolution.",
          "We visited this park several times in our walks about Anchorage. On our last visit, the skies were clear and we could see the very tip of Mt. Denali. This was especially important to me because we had ridden the train down from Fairbanks and the skies were too cloudy to see much",
          "Ok, our driver gave us SO much info....it was kinda running together. All I could remember him saying was the guy NEVER actually reached Anchorage....so we were then like WHY is he bonzed then? We drove by this statue and he gave us some background, but we didn't get out of the",
          "Whether or not you enjoy learning about historical events and fun facts - this is one stop in Anchorage you do not want to miss. Not so much because there is a lot to see, which there is if you pay attention, but because it is easy to cast your imagination into the blue sky and",
          "Resolution Park was an attraction not far from the Westmark Anchorage where we stayed ~ about 5 blocks. The park was named for HMS Resolution, Captain Cook\u2019s ship that explored what is now known as Cook Inlet when he was searching for the Northwest Passage in 1778. Although",
          "Park is free. Excellent Overlook of Cook Inlet. Good history lesson to learn about Captain Cook and his travels. Easy to get to from Anchorage downtown.",
          "This little park has a viewing area of the sea and mountains and a ramp that goes down to sea level. It makes a nice destination on a walk. When you can turn your eyes away from the scenery, look at the statue of Captain Cook as he gazes out to sea.",
          "After eating at Simon and Seaforts, we took a stroll down to the park. The boardwalk was nice and it served as a good walk to shake off some of our gluttony after an amazing meal. I'm always down for a history moment and the area provided a lot of information on James Cook.",
          "I rated this very good due to the views from the park. The ramp down to the shore was somewhat secluded and looked like there may have been some party activity by kids there, trash and grafitti. It's probably safe, but I would go during the daytime.",
          "This quaint little park offers nice views of the Inlet and downtown Anchorage. If you are a history buff, you will truly enjoy.",
          "Scenic spot with Captain Cook's statue in place. In good weather, a great view out over the water to the mountains in the distance.",
          "OK park with some nice views if the weather cooperates. A statue of Captain Cook marks the spot. Not much going on here but hey if you are in the area I suppose it's worth a short visit.",
          "My frind decided to do some shopping and I went to visit this area. This area is quite nice but it could be organised in a better way. The view is nice even thouh when I visited it it was raining a little and there was no sun, so it was quite gritty.",
          "Not very interesting! Just ok to walk around and see some locals and tourists walking or biking! They could improve the park by making it more family friendly and having better care of nature! Perhaps adding some beauty to it.",
          "spend a little time here and look over the area and just think of the past. Just look out and enjoy the view.... I",
          "I stopped by Resolution Park as part of a walking tour of downtown Anchorage. It has a nice overlook area, but it's not a park where you would recreate or picnic in. Some educational material, but not sure it would entertain kids.",
          "I saw this park as a result of a walking tour. It was an easy walk from downtown. Some interpretive signs and you do see the statue, but not a recreational park, as such. Still, worth a trip if you have the time.",
          "Short walk from the city. Nice monument and information re Captain Cook. Great views of water and on a clear day of mountains. We were lucky and could even see Denali from Anchorage during our stay.",
          "A nice place to visit with good view but not uniquely better than other spots around Anchorage so hard to rate it much above average.",
          "This is a stunning beautiful place on the edge of downtown. Views are marvelous, especially in good weather looking toward the Cook Inlet. You will also learn a few minutes of history about Captain Cook and his experience with Alaska. Of course, people were living in this area",
          "If you have a few minutes to stop and look out onto the ocean. its a beautiful view. i loved learning about the \"the sleeping giant\".",
          "We all went and walked the Resolution Park. It's something I would recommend for visitors to Anchorage area. The people are so nice. The walking path it very clean and safe.",
          "Good overlook of cook inlet is about a 10 minute walk in town. Takes about 10 minutes to enjoy add your own graffiti.",
          "I like to get a hotel room downtown and spend some time walking around. I stumbled on this little park in the middle of winter and was very glad that I did. There is a great view and a little bit of history too.",
          "This park is walking distance from the Hotel Captain Cook. The park is kept clean, there is a fine statue and some descriptive plaques about Captain Cook. The views of the inlet and the Sleeping Lady mountain are spectacular. I went here during the day and the night and",
          "We were here for the 4th of July celebration and it was a beautiful area. It can get windy so I would suggest taking a jacket. We were there in July but it was overcast so it was a little chilly. Otherwise it's a beautiful place to visit.",
          "A small park with a view of Cook Inlet. A nice place to see the city and get a view of the coast. Park consists of a deck, sculpture and viewpoint.",
          "\"Ambition leads me not only farther than any other man has been before me, but as far as I think it possible for man to go. \"",
          "This is a nice viewing platform downtown, just about 2 blocks from the popular Snow City Cafe. There is street and parking lot parking nearby. Great views of the Cook Inlet and a statute of Capt. Cook. Best to come day or night with others, as there may be less desirable",
          "Never knew Captain Cook sailed up here to Alaska, nice historical spot Has nice views, only concern is for safety, every time I have went there it has some weird people hanging out down in the lower stair area",
          "This place has a statue of Captain Cook and some plagues with information. It is diable freindly. Ona clear day you can see Denali and the Cook lnlet from here.",
          "We stopped by Resolution Park and enjoyed seeing the statue of Captain Cook and reading the plaques with information about his voyage. Unfortunately the morning in August that we were there was drizzly and overcast. We could see the Cook Inlet below, and some hazy land in the",
          "This small park is worth checking out for a great view on a nice day. Denali can be seen from here when conditions are right.",
          "If you are really lucky and catch a clear day, you can see Mt. Denali from this viewpoint park. Statue of Captain Cook, a British explorer of the west coast.",
          "easily found , this monument pays tribute to captain Cook. This is small park at the end of downtown Anchorage . It is safe although I suspect some drug addicts visit the place. A security guard was on site though",
          "Able to look out and see Mt. Denali, and other great views and saw some beluga whales. Cool view of the \"sleeping lady,\" and nice to take in the beautiful scenery.",
          "During our private city tour we stopped here to see the reindeer but also learned the history. It was amazing that this was a tent city at one time for the railroad.",
          "If you go, walk the park with an informed local. It makes the mini experience worth the walk and a few of historical tidbits are very funny.",
          "We ventured here while waiting to eat at Snow Caf\u00e9. Great view of different side of the city and nice info on Captain Cook on the statue. Easy access, nice view, good information",
          "interesting structure with ok view of the sea. Junkies hanging out and lots of trash, not worth the walk.",
          "Nice park downtown Anchorage with sea view Very close to The center A The Very beginning of 5th street or avenue. Cook statue and sole history on His Life. The place is Very Tiny but downtown that' s The sole place where you can HavE A sea view also on part if The harbour.",
          "Nice little park overlooking Prince William Sound. I'm sure you could see more if you were there long enough. Went on the walk to kill time. Left after a few minutes. If you are expecting a traditional park with trees, shrubbery and grass, this may not be what you're looking",
          "We ran into this park when walking back from Simon & Seafort Restaurant to Hilton Anchorage. It's a very small park with a Captain Cook monument. It overlooks the Cook Inlet and on a clear day (which is quite rare in Alaska!!) it is said you can see Susitna and even Denali",
          "Stopped by on a tour. The views were great and it's nice place to take photos and take in a little bit of history.",
          "This is a nice place to see the view and to take pictures. We were there on a partly cloudy day, still worth the time to stop and see the mountains.",
          "Near downtown and on the trolley tour, great place to see the mountains and the inlet on a clear day.",
          "This park is close to the downtown hotels and a nice way to glance over the horizon. Lots of clods blocking the view, but that's anchorage.",
          "I love learning about the history of Alaska and stopping here broadens my knowledge even more. Plus the view of the water is spectacular and easy to access while visiting Anchorage.",
          "The statue of Capt. Cook anchors a beautiful boardwalk from which Cook Inlet can be viewed. It's an impressive sight and just a short walk from downtown.",
          "This is a tiny little \"park\" with a statue of Captain Cook looking out over the Cook Inlet. Great photo opportunity and great views of the Cook Inlet. Other than that there is a boardwalk and not much else but it is worth going to see for the view alone.",
          "Quiet beautiful views. A nice stroll with benches to sit on. Very romantic spot but also suitable for families.",
          "While waiting for breakfast, we toodled over to the park. This could be made so much nicer if the boardwalk was kept up and graffiti removed. Also, with grand views of Cook inlet, would like to see more historical information on the permanent markers.",
          "This monument to Captain Cook is right at the edge of Downtown Anchorage and right out overlooking the ocean.Just a few things to read and well done. A good history lesson about the area and an early explorer. Walk a few blocks to the Captain Cook Hotel and see even more out in",
          "Apart from the statue of CAPT Cook there is not much else to see. There is a small plaque below the statue which claims Cook to be the best ever explorer !",
          "We were just walking around Anchorage and came upon this gem in the corner. It had been raining but it wasn't too terrible in the rain. Great little history lesson.",
          "This place has great views but really that is about it.... Nice place to watch the sun set...just a shame that it does not set...",
          "Came here to look at the Captain Cook Monument mainly but became interested in the scenic outlook of the Cook Inlet and the tidal factor. Could do with a bit of a revamp and public toilets nearby -plenty of tourists visit.",
          "The statue of Captain Cook looks out over Cook Inlet with lovely views of the water and mountains. There are two other ones that we know of and have also visited. The one in Hawaii, you have to canoe to a small island and the one in Victoria, BC is right across the street from",
          "Enjoyed sitting in the sun on the decking below the famous statue with a wonderful view of the Cook inlet.",
          "A must see. Kids will enjoy knowing the statue of Cook is facing Australia, facing the same statue of himself. Great view of Cook Inlet. A stop on the Trolly.",
          "When the clouds lift, this is an excellent place to see Denali, Hunter and Foraker mountains from afar as well as Mt. Susitna across Cook Inlet",
          "Being from Australia, we had no idea of the close connection Alaska has with our very own Captain Cook. I suppose I should have guessed seeing Cook Inlet is right there. We wandered down to Resolution Park (the name of one of his ships), to find a large monument to him, looking",
          "Not much to speak of here. Nice memorial statue of Capt. Cook with some historical tidbits. Great observation deck with beautiful views of Cook Inlet.",
          "It's an easy place to drive right past and not even know it's there. Parking in the area can be a little sparse but it's worth the trip if you can find. Views from there are pretty good and the Captain Cook Monument is a good photo op.",
          "Near the south end of 4th Street, an easy walk from most tourist places in Anchorage. You get great views of Cook Inlet and several mountain ranges. Really great photos at dawn and sunset. The statue isn't much, but still worth the stop for the sights. On a really clear day, you",
          "This is a quick 15 minute stop. If you're already in Anchorage...why not? It's a great place to take photos and view the vastness of Anchorage",
          "Being a Kiwi (New Zealander) I have an affinity to Captain Cook, so it was a no brainer to visit this Alaskan monument. On a good day, the views out to Cook Inlet are pretty good as well. There was a good history lesson around James Cook, stuff I hadn't known or was long",
          "It was close to our hotel, and I like Captain Cook stuff. Glad we went. Near the Tony Knowles trail. You can see this in 5 min.",
          "We came here because we wanted to see Captain Cook's Monument. We heard there is another monument in Hawaii? Later we found out, Captain Cook started his 3rd voyage in Alaska and he passed away in Hawaii. The park & monument is surrounding by office buildings. Walking distance",
          "This park is just a short walk from the Marriott Hotel where we stayed. The information signs point out the various mountain ranges and peaks that can be seen on a clear day. This is definitely not a must see, but the plaque that honors Captain Cook and the plaque that details",
          "We stopped here very briefly to see the view and take a few photos... I went down by myself while my husband waited in the car. Some clown had put sunglasses on Captain Cook's statue... so much for a photo op. The views were stunning of the Sleeping Lady. However, there were",
          "Nice overlook of Cook Inlet with a billboard display showing the features of the inlet and the Alaska Range across the water, so you know what you're looking at. There's an series of balconies and ramps to provide good viewpoints and it looks like you can eventually get down to",
          "This park is a short walk from The Hotel Captain Cook with a nice monument to Captain Cook overlooking Cook Inlet. A nice place to sit and overlook the water.",
          "Nice spot to watch the sunset with the sleeping lady in the frame. Pretty nice wooden platform built to allow patrons enjoying the scenery and Captain Cook's monument. If you're staying in the Hotel Captain Cook, then visiting this park is a must to get a combo :) It was like 5",
          "We stumbled on this park and glad we did. It is small but the view makes up for it. It is wheelchair/stroller safe too. It wasn't crowded and seemed to have more locals than visitors.",
          "A GREAT place for pictures! Beautiful views. Visited with a 15 and 7 yr old and they loved it. Nice contained way to view over the water. Deck was a little faded but I imagine the weather is pretty harsh. A little graffiti. Overall a really nice part of our walk around town.",
          "Nice view that's it, don't go out of your way to visit. All that's there is a statue of James Cook and a decking area no grass. Once you have taken photo move on, spent 5 minutes in park.",
          "Just wanted to point out that Anchorage is NOT on Prince William Sound. At the monument you're looking at the Knik Arm of Cook Inlet. Also, there are no oil refineries in Anchorage. Probably they were looking at the Port of Anchorage which does have some tanks.",
          "A ranger suggested we check out this little park. Not your typical green grass and trees park but worth the visit. There's a series of wooden walkways down the bluff and close to the water (when the tide is in). But I think people go there for the views of the mountain ranges.",
          "The park is well located in downtown Anchorage and its perfect to have a nice view of the mountains that sorround the city.",
          "Nice view, with a statue and a decent map of the vista. My boy liked running down the wooden walkways, though they weren't the cleanest.",
          "If you are expecting a traditional park with trees, shrubbery and grass, this may not be what you're looking for. Resolution Park is a multi-level set of wooden observation decks, with the Captain James Cook monument at the top, looking out over the Cook Inlet. The view was",
          "We stopped by since we were at Snow City Cafe just up the corner, but it was worth a look. You can see across the inlet. Walk down the ramps and check out the lower viewing areas too.",
          "We visited Anchorage in Mar 2014 and were lucky enough to have sunny days. Captain Cook's monument is one of the places within walking distance from downtown. You can see Mt. McKinley (or as locals refer 'Denali') from this point. It's beautiful and picturesque scenery. It also",
          "I went here during a morning walk and saw Mt McKinley before the clouds moved in. Ok, I didn't see the top because the clouds already covered the top but nevertheless it was a nice view. the snow covered volcanic mountains across Cook Inlet also looked good. It was",
          "The sun sets over one part or another of the Alaska Range. On a clear evening, you can see the entire range, including Denali!",
          "We walked down to this area from downtown to see how far out the tide had gone. It is just amazing the difference between high and low tide. Well worth the visit--and it's free!",
          "Nice little park overlooking Prince William Sound. I'm sure you could see whales if you were there long enough. Went on the Solstice to watch the sun go down, well sort of, the sky got pretty colors, never did really go down. Left at 11:30 p.m.",
          "The sorta platform the park is on is really neat, and the view is stunning at times.",
          "Good viewing area, and right across from the Snow City Cafe, a great place to eat, but very busy.",
          "I thought that this would be a great place for a picnic lunch, but I was disappointed. The view was nice, but not as outstanding as I had hoped. When you looked to the right, you saw a bunch of oil refineries and there were some drunks at the benches here so we tried to keep",
          "Beautiful view of the inlet! Great picture opportunity!",
          "The bronze Captain Cook Monument stands on a large wooden deck, but he's gazing out to sea -- the opposite of the way he was facing when he explored Cook Inlet in 1778 aboard HMS Resolution. Cook didn't personally come as far as Anchorage, instead sending a boat with his ship's"

          "Well organized, informative, varied presentations, great info on the natural history of Alaska; an excellent way to spend a couple of hours in downtown Anchorage.",
          "Really great museum. If you are staying in the downtown area of Anchorage this is an easy walk without mobility problems. Adults are $5 - Children $3. We got a military rate - which I believe was $4.00. They do have tour guides that take groups through. Very interesting."

My daughter loved it I just felt bad for anyone in there with us since every excited noise sounded like the apocolypse.",

        "wiki": "Anchorage (officially called the Municipality of Anchorage; Dena'ina: Dgheyay Kaq') is a unified home rule municipality in the U.S. state of Alaska, on the West Coast of the United States. With an estimated 288,000 residents in 2019, it is Alaska's most populous city and contains 39.37% of the state's population; among the 50 states, only New York has a higher percentage of residents who live in its most populous city. The Anchorage metropolitan area, which includes Anchorage and the neighboring Matanuska-Susitna Borough, had a population of 396,317 in 2019, accounting for more than half the state's population. At  1,706 square miles (4,420 km2) of land area, the city is the fourth-largest by area in the United States and larger than the smallest state, Rhode Island, which has 1,212 square miles (3,140 km2).Anchorage is in Southcentral Alaska, at the terminus of the Cook Inlet, on a peninsula formed by the Knik Arm to the north and the Turnagain Arm to the south. The city limits span 1,961.1 square miles (5,079.2 km2), encompassing the urban core, a joint military base, several outlying communities and almost all of Chugach State Park.Due to its location, almost equidistant from New York City and Tokyo, Anchorage lies within \u200b9 1\u20442 hours by air of nearly 90% of the industrialized world. For this reason, Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is a common refueling stop for international cargo flights and home to a major FedEx hub, which the company calls a \"critical part\" of its global network of services.Anchorage has won the All-America City Award four times: in 1956, 1965, 1984\u201385, and 2002, from the National Civic League. Kiplinger has named it the United States' most tax-friendly city.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nRussian presence in south-central Alaska was well-established in the 19th century. In 1867, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward brokered a deal to purchase Alaska from Imperial Russia for $7.2 million, or about two cents an acre ($109.3 million in 2018 dollars). His political rivals lampooned the deal as \"Seward's folly,\" \"Seward's icebox,\" and \"Walrussia.\" In 1888, gold was discovered along Turnagain Arm just south of modern-day Anchorage.\n\nAlaska became an organized incorporated United States territory in 1912. Anchorage, unlike every other large town in Alaska south of the Brooks Range, was neither a fishing nor mining camp. The area surrounding Anchorage lacks significant economic metal minerals. A number of Dena'ina settlements existed along Knik Arm for years. By 1911 the families of J. D. \"Bud\" Whitney and Jim St. Clair lived at the mouth of Ship Creek and were joined there by a young forest ranger, Jack Brown, and his bride, Nellie, in 1912.The city grew from its happenstance choice as the site, in 1914, under the direction of Frederick Mears, of a railroad-construction port for the Alaska Engineering Commission. The area near the mouth of Ship Creek, where the railroad headquarters was located, quickly became a tent city. A townsite was mapped out on higher ground to the south of the tent city, greatly noted in the years since for its order and rigidity compared with other Alaska town sites. In 1915, territorial governor John Franklin Alexander Strong encouraged residents to change the city's name to one that had \"more significance and local associations\". In the summer of that year, residents held a vote to change the city's name; a plurality of residents favored changing the city's name to \"Alaska City.\" However, the territorial government ultimately declined to change the city's name. Anchorage was incorporated on November 23, 1920.Construction of the Alaska Railroad continued until its completion in 1923. The city's economy in the 1920s and 1930s centered on the railroad. Col. Otto F. Ohlson, the Swedish-born general manager of the railroad for nearly two decades, became a symbol of residents' contempt due to the firm control he maintained over the railroad's affairs, which by extension became control over economic and other aspects of life in Alaska.\n\nBetween the 1930s and the 1950s, the city experienced massive growth as air transportation and the military became increasingly important. Aviation operations in Anchorage commenced along the firebreak south of town (today's Delaney Park Strip), which residents also used as a golf course. An increase in air traffic led to clearing of a site directly east of town site boundaries starting in 1929; this became Merrill Field, which served as Anchorage's primary airport during the 1930s and 1940s, until Anchorage International Airport replaced it in 1951. However, Merrill Field still sees a significant amount of general aviation traffic.\nElmendorf Air Force Base and the United States Army's Fort Richardson were constructed in the 1940s, and served as the city's primary economic engine until the 1968 Prudhoe Bay discovery shifted the thrust of the economy toward the oil industry. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure process led to the combining of the two bases (along with Kulis Air National Guard Base) to form Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.\n\nThe Good Friday earthquake of March 27, 1964, hit Anchorage hard at a magnitude of 9.2, killing 115 people and causing $116 million in damages ($0.73 billion in 2018 dollars). The earth-shaking event lasted nearly five minutes; most structures that failed remained intact for the first few minutes then failed with repeated flexing. It was the world's second-largest earthquake in recorded history. Because the geology in the city and surrounding suburban area was built on top ground consisting of glacial silt, the prolonged shaking from the earthquake caused soil liquefaction, leading to massive cracks in roadways and collapse of large swaths of land.  One of the most impacted housing areas of Anchorage, the Turnagain neighborhood, saw dozens of homes originally at 250 to 300 feet above sea level sink with the land they sat on down to sea level.  Rebuilding and recovery dominated the remainder of the 1960s.\nIn 1968, ARCO discovered oil in Prudhoe Bay on the Alaska North Slope, and the resulting oil boom spurred further growth in Anchorage. In 1975, the City of Anchorage and the Greater Anchorage Area Borough (which includes Eagle River, Girdwood, Glen Alps, and several other communities) merged into the geographically larger Municipality of Anchorage The city continued to grow in the 1980s, and capital projects and an aggressive beautification campaign took place. During this time Anchorage became known as the \"Green Apple of the Arctic.\"\nSeveral attempts have been made to move Alaska's state capital from Juneau to Anchorage \u2013 or to a site closer to Anchorage. The motivation is straightforward: the \"railbelt\" between Anchorage and Fairbanks contains the majority of the state's population. Robert Atwood, owner of the Anchorage Times and a tireless booster for the city, championed the move. Alaskans rejected attempts to move the capital in 1960 and 1962, but in 1974, as Alaska's center of population moved away from Southeast Alaska and to the railbelt, voters approved the move. Communities such as Fairbanks and much of rural Alaska opposed moving the capital to Anchorage for fear of concentrating more power in the state's largest city. As a result, in 1976 voters approved a plan to build a new capital city near Willow, about 70 miles (110 km) north of Anchorage. In the 1978 election, opponents to the move reacted by campaigning to defeat a nearly $1 billion bond issue to fund construction of the new capitol building and related facilities ($3 billion in 2018 dollars).. Later attempts to move the capital or the legislature to Wasilla, north of Anchorage, also failed. Anchorage has over twice as many state employees as Juneau, and is to a considerable extent the center of state and federal government activity in Alaska.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nAnchorage is in Southcentral Alaska. At 61 degrees north, it lies slightly farther north than Oslo, Stockholm, Helsinki and Saint Petersburg, but not as far north as Reykjav\u00edk or Murmansk. It is northeast of the Alaska Peninsula, Kodiak Island, and Cook Inlet, due north of the Kenai Peninsula, northwest of Prince William Sound and the Alaska Panhandle, and nearly due south of Denali.\nThe city is on a strip of coastal lowland and extends up the lower alpine slopes of the Chugach Mountains. Point Campbell, the westernmost point of Anchorage on the mainland, juts out into Cook Inlet near its northern end, at which point it splits into two arms. To the south is Turnagain Arm, a fjord that has some of the world's highest tides. Knik Arm, another tidal inlet, lies to the west and north. The Chugach Mountains on the east form a boundary to development, but not to the city limits, which encompass part of the wild alpine territory of Chugach State Park.\nThe city's sea coast consists mostly of treacherous mudflats. Newcomers and tourists are warned not to walk in this area because of extreme tidal changes and the very fine glacial silt. Unwary victims have walked onto the solid seeming silt revealed when the tide is out and have become stuck in the mud. The two recorded instances of this occurred in 1961 and 1988.According to the United States Census Bureau, the municipality has an area of 1,961.1 square miles (5,079.2 km2); 1,697.2 square miles (4,395.8 km2) of which is land and 263.9 square miles (683.4 km2) of it is water. The total area is 13.46% water.\nBoroughs and census areas next to the Municipality of Anchorage are Matanuska-Susitna Borough to the north, Kenai Peninsula Borough to the south and Valdez-Cordova Census Area to the east. The Chugach National Forest, a national protected area, extends into the southern part of the municipality, near Girdwood and Portage.\n\n\n=== Cityscape ===\n\n\n=== Wildlife ===\n\nA diverse wildlife population exists within urban Anchorage and the surrounding area. Approximately 250 black bears and 60 grizzly bears live in the area. Bears are regularly sighted within the city. Moose are also a common sight; in the Anchorage Bowl, there is a summer population of approximately 250 moose, increasing to as many as 1,000 during the winter. They are a hazard to drivers, with over 100 moose killed by cars each year. Two people were stomped to death, in 1993 and 1995, in Anchorage. Cross-country skiers and dog mushers using city trails have been charged by moose on numerous occasions; the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has to kill some individual aggressive moose in the city every year. Mountain goats can be commonly sighted along the Seward Highway between Anchorage and Girdwood, and Dall sheep are often viewed quite close to the road at Windy Point. Approximately thirty northern timber wolves reside in the Anchorage area. In 2007 several dogs were killed by timber wolves while on walks with their owners. There are also beaver dams in local creeks and lakes, and sightings of foxes and kits in parking lots close to wooded areas in the spring are common. Along the Seward Highway headed toward Kenai, there are common sightings of beluga whales in the Turnagain Arm. Lynxes are occasionally sighted in Anchorage as well. Within the Municipality there are also a number of streams that host salmon runs. Fishing for salmon at Ship Creek next to downtown is popular in the summer.\n\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nAnchorage has a dry-summer subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: Dsc) but with strong maritime influences that lead to a relatively moderate climate. Most of its precipitation falls in late summer. Average daytime summer temperatures range from approximately 55 to 78 \u00b0F (13 to 26 \u00b0C); average daytime winter temperatures are about 5 to 30 \u00b0F (\u221215.0 to \u22121.1 \u00b0C). Anchorage has a frost-free growing season that averages slightly over 101 days. According to local folklore, when a native plant called fireweed goes to seed after a full bloom, the first snowfall of winter is 6 weeks away.Average January low and high temperatures at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) are 11 to 23 \u00b0F (\u221212 to \u22125 \u00b0C) with an average winter snowfall of 75.5 inches (192 cm). The 2011\u20132012 winter had 134.5 in (341.6 cm), which made it the snowiest winter on record, topping the 1954\u20131955 winter with 132.8 in (337.3 cm). The coldest temperature ever recorded at the original weather station at Merrill Field on the East end of 5th Avenue was \u221238 \u00b0F (\u221238.9 \u00b0C) on February 3, 1947.Summers are mild (although cool compared to the contiguous US and even interior Alaska), and it can rain frequently, although not abundantly. Average July low and high temperatures are 52 to 66 \u00b0F (11 to 19 \u00b0C) and the highest reading ever recorded was 90 \u00b0F (32.2 \u00b0C) on July 4, 2019. The average annual precipitation at the airport is 16.63 inches (422 mm). Anchorage's latitude causes summer days to be very long and winter daylight hours to be very short. The city is often cloudy during the winter, which further decreases the amount of sunlight experienced by residents.Due to its proximity to active volcanoes, ash hazards are a significant, though infrequent, occurrence. The most recent notable volcanic activity centered on the multiple eruptions of Mount Redoubt during March\u2013April 2009, resulting in a 25,000-foot (7,600 m) high ash cloud as well as ash accumulation throughout the Cook Inlet region. Previously, the most active recent event was an August 1992 eruption of Mount Spurr, which is 78 miles (126 km) west of the city. The eruption deposited about 3 mm (0.1 in) of volcanic ash on the city. The clean-up of ash resulted in excessive demands for water and caused major problems for the Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility.\nThe average temperature of the sea ranges from 35.8 \u00b0F (2.1 \u00b0C) in February to 53.1 \u00b0F (11.7 \u00b0C) in August.\n\n\n== Demographics ==\nAnchorage first appeared on the 1920 U.S. Census. It incorporated that same year. In 1975, it consolidated with its borough.\nAccording to the 2010 census, Anchorage had a population of 291,826 and its racial and ethnic composition was as follows:\nWhite: 66.0% (62.6% non-Hispanic)\nTwo or more races: 8.1%\nAsian: 8.1% (3.3% Filipino, 1.2% Korean, 1.1% Hmong)\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Natives: 7.9% (1.4% I\u00f1upiat, 1.1% Yup'ik, 0.8% Aleut)\nBlack or African American: 5.6%\nOther race: 2.3%\nNative Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders: 2.0% (1.4% Samoan)\nHispanic or Latino (of any race): 7.6% (4.4% Mexican, 1.2% Puerto Rican)\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, the largest national ancestry groups were as follows: 17.3% German, 10.8% Irish, 9.1% English, 6.9% Scandinavian (3.6% Norwegian, 2.2% Swedish, 0.6% Danish) and 5.6% French/French Canadian ancestry.According to the 2010 American Community Survey, approximately 82.3% of residents over the age of five spoke only English at home. Spanish was spoken by 3.8% of the population; speakers of other Indo-European languages made up 3.0% of the population; those who spoke Asian and Pacific Islander languages at home were 9.1%; and speakers of other languages made up 1.8%.In 2010, there were 291,826 people, 107,332 households and 70,544 families residing in the municipality. The population density was 171.2 per square mile (59.2/km2). There were 113,032 housing units at an average density of 59.1 per square mile (22.8/km2). There were 107,332 households out of which 33.2% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 48.4% were married couples living together, 11.7% had a female householder with no husband present, 5.6% had a male householder with no wife present, and 34.3% were non-families. 24.9% of all households were made up of individuals and 4.9% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 3.19. The age distribution was 26.0% under 18, 11.2% from 18 to 24, 29.0% from 25 to 44, 26.6% from 45 to 64, and 7.2% who were 65 or older. The median age was 32.9 years. 50.8% of the population was male and 49.2% were female.The median income for a household in the municipality was $73,004, and the median income for a family was $85,829. The per capita income for the municipality was $34,678. About 5.1% of families and 7.9% of the population were below the poverty line. Of the city's population over the age of 25, 33.7% held a bachelor's degree or higher, and 92.1% had a high school diploma or equivalent.\n\n\n=== Languages ===\nIn 2010, 83.7% (220,304) of Anchorage residents aged five and older spoke only English at home, while 4.47% (11,769) spoke Spanish, 2.53% (6,654) Tagalog, 1.56% (4,108) various Pacific Island languages, 1.38% (3,636) various Native American/Alaska Native languages, 1.14% (2,994) Korean, 0.63% (1,646) German, 0.57% (1,502) Hmong, 0.50% (1,307) Russian, and Japanese was spoken as a main language by 0.45% (1,185) of the population over the age of five. In total, 16.33% (43,010) of Anchorage's population aged five and older spoke a mother language other than English.As of September 7, 2006, 94 languages were spoken by students in the Anchorage School District.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nAnchorage's largest economic sectors include transportation, military, municipal, state and federal government, tourism, corporate headquarters (including regional headquarters for multinational corporations) and resource extraction. Large portions of the local economy depend on Anchorage's geographical location and surrounding natural resources. Anchorage's economy traditionally has seen steady growth, though not quite as rapid as many places in the lower 48 states. With the notable exception of a real estate-related crash in the mid-to-late 1980s, which saw the failure of numerous financial institutions, it does not experience as much pain during economic downturns.\nThe Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (TSAIA) is the world's fourth busiest airport for cargo traffic, surpassed only by Memphis, Hong Kong, and Shanghai Pudong. This traffic is strongly linked to Anchorage's location along great circle routes between Asia and the lower 48. In addition, the airport has an abundant supply of jet fuel from in-state refineries in North Pole and Kenai. This jet fuel is transported to the Port of Anchorage, then by rail or pipeline to the airport.\n\nThe Port of Anchorage receives 95 percent of all goods destined for Alaska. Ships from Totem Ocean Trailer Express and Horizon Lines arrive twice weekly from the Port of Tacoma in Washington. Along with handling these activities, the port is a storage facility for jet fuel from Alaskan refineries, which is used at both TSAIA and Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER).\nThe existing port was substantially built in the late 1950s and is reaching the end of its useful life. Beginning in 2017, the Port of Anchorage is undertaking an extensive 7-year Anchorage Port Modernization Project to upgrade its aging infrastructure, support larger deeper draft vessels, and future proof the port seismically and environmentally for another 75 years.\nThe United States military used to have two large installations, Elmendorf Air Force Base and Fort Richardson, which originally stemmed from the branching off of the U.S. Air Force from the U.S. Army following World War II. In a cost-cutting effort initiated by the 2005 BRAC proceedings, the bases were combined. JBER was created, which also incorporated Kulis Air National Guard Base near TSAIA. The combination of these three bases employ approximately 8,500 civilian and military personnel. These individuals along with their families comprise approximately ten percent of the local population. During the Cold War, Elmendorf became an important base due to its proximity to the Soviet Union, particularly as a command center for numerous forward air stations established throughout the western reaches of Alaska (most of which have since closed).\n\nWhile Juneau is the official state capital of Alaska, more state employees reside in the Anchorage area. Approximately 6,800 state employees work in Anchorage compared to about 3,800 in Juneau. The State of Alaska purchased the Bank of America Center (which it renamed the Robert B. Atwood Building) to house most of its offices, after several decades of leasing space in the McKay Building (now the McKinley Tower) and later the Frontier Building.\nThe resource sector, mainly petroleum, is arguably Anchorage's most visible industry, with many high rises bearing the logos of large multinationals such as BP and ConocoPhillips. While field operations are centered on the Alaska North Slope and south of Anchorage around Cook Inlet, the majority of offices and administration are found in Anchorage. The headquarters building of ConocoPhillips Alaska, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips, is in downtown Anchorage. It is also the tallest building in Alaska. Many companies who provide oilfield support services are likewise headquartered outside of Anchorage but maintain a substantial presence in the city, most notably Arctic Slope Regional Corporation and CH2M Hill.\nFour small airlines, Alaska Central Express, Era Aviation, Hageland Aviation Services, and PenAir, are headquartered in Anchorage. Alaska Airlines (at one point headquartered in Anchorage, but now headquartered in the Seattle area), has major offices and facilities at TSAIA, including the offices of the Alaska Airlines Foundation. Prior to their respective dissolutions, airlines MarkAir, Reeve Aleutian Airways and Wien Air Alaska were also headquartered in Anchorage. The Reeve Building, at the corner of West Sixth Avenue and D Street, was spared the wrecking ball when the city block it sits on was cleared to make way for the Anchorage 5th Avenue Mall, and was incorporated into the mall's structure. In 2013, Forbes named Anchorage among its list of Best Places for Business and Careers.Five Alaska Native regional corporations are based in Anchorage: The Aleut Corporation, Bristol Bay Native Corporation, Calista Corporation, Chugach Alaska Corporation, and Cook Inlet Region, Inc.\nAnchorage does not levy a sales tax. However, it charges a 12% bed tax on hotel stays and an 8% tax on car rentals. Since about 2000, in response to strong revenue and occupancy rates, major hotel developers from the Lower 48 have been building new hotels along C Street from International Airport Road to just north of Tudor Road, with two more to open in 2017, making this half-mile stretch of C Street a new \"hotel row\". From Anchorage people can easily head south to popular fishing locations on the Kenai Peninsula or north to locations such as Denali National Park and Fairbanks.\n\n\n== Arts ==\n\nLocated next to Town Square Park in downtown Anchorage, the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts is a three-part complex that hosts numerous performing arts events each year. The facility can accommodate more than 3,000 persons. In 2000, nearly 245,000 people visited 678 public performances. It is home to eight resident performing arts companies and has featured mega-musicals performed by visiting companies. The center also hosts the International Ice Carving Competition as part of the Fur Rendezvous festival in February.\nThe Anchorage Concert Association brings 20 to 30 events to the community each year, including Broadway shows like Disney's The Lion King, Les Mis\u00e9rables, Mamma Mia!, The Phantom of The Opera, West Side Story, and others. The Sitka Summer Music Festival presents an \"Autumn Classics\" festival of chamber music for two weeks each September on the campus of Alaska Pacific University. Orchestras include the Anchorage Symphony Orchestra and the Anchorage Youth Symphony.\nAnnually in January, the Anchorage Folk Festival takes place at the University of Alaska Anchorage, featuring concerts, dances, and workshops with featured guest artists and over 130 performances by volunteer singers, dancers, musicians, and storytellers.\n\nAlaska Native Heritage Center\nAlaska Museum of Natural History\nAlaska Aviation Heritage Museum\nAnchorage Museum at Rasmuson Center\nOscar Anderson House Museum\nWells Fargo Alaska Heritage Library & MuseumThe city of Anchorage provides three municipal facilities large enough to hold major events such as concerts, trade shows and conventions. Downtown facilities include the Alaska Center for the Performing Arts, William A. Egan Civic & Convention Center and the recently completed Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center, which will be connected via skybridge to form the Anchorage Civic & Convention District. The Sullivan Arena hosts sporting events as well concerts and annual trade shows. \n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nNational attention focuses on Anchorage on the first Saturday of each March, when the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race kicks off with its ceremonial start downtown on Fourth Avenue. Anchorage is also home to the Fur Rendezvous Open World Championship Sled Dog Races, a three-day dog sled sprint event consisting of 3 timed races of 25.5 miles (41.0 km) each. Held each February, the event is part of the annual Fur Rendezvous, a winter sports carnival.\nAnchorage is the home of three teams in the Alaska Baseball League. The Anchorage Bucs and Anchorage Glacier Pilots, which both play at Mulcahy Stadium, and the Chugiak-Eagle River Chinooks based at Lee Jordan Field in Chugiak.Anchorage has no professional sports teams. The most recent to call the city home was the Alaska Aces of the ECHL. The Aces were very successful during their time in Anchorage, claiming three league titles, four conference championships, and eight division championship during their 29-year history (1989\u20132017).  The Aces affiliated with various National Hockey League teams during this time, including the Calgary Flames, Minnesota Wild, and Vancouver Canucks.  Following the 2016\u201317 season, the team ceased operations and were sold to a group in Portland, Maine, where they became the Maine Mariners in the 2018\u201319 season.\nThe University of Alaska Anchorage Seawolves are a member of the National Collegiate Athletic Association. UAA has Division I teams in gymnastics and hockey, as well as several other Division II teams. UAA sponsors the annual Great Alaska Shootout, an annual NCAA Division I basketball tournament featuring colleges and universities from across the United States along with the UAA team.\nAnchorage is the finish line for the Sadler's Ultra Challenge wheelchair race, and holds the ceremonial start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.\nThere are four rugby clubs, including the Bird Creek Barbarians RFC, Anchorage Thunderbirds, Mat Valley Maulers RFC, and Spenard Green Dragons. The season runs from April through September.\nThe Anchorage Northern Knights gained national attention when they joined the eight-team Eastern Basketball Association in 1977, a league whose nearest competitor was 5,000 miles (8,000 km) from Anchorage. The Knights captured the 1979\u201380 league championship, and featured several players who would play in the NBA, most notably Brad Davis, a future player and broadcaster for the Dallas Mavericks. They competed in the renamed Continental Basketball Association for five seasons until the economic recession ended their run in 1982.\nThe city was the U.S. candidate for hosting the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics, but lost to Albertville, France and Lillehammer, Norway respectively. Anchorage is a premier cross-country skiing city, in terms of density of groomed trails within the urban core. There are 105 miles (169 km) of maintained ski trails in the city, some of which reach downtown. The same trail system also provides access to Chugach State Park, a 495,000-acre (200,000 ha) high alpine park. The Tour of Anchorage is an annual 50-kilometer ski race within the city. and is the Host for the 2009 and 2010 US Senior National Cross Country Ski Championship.Anchorage is also home to Alaska's first WFTDA flat track women's roller derby league, the Rage City Rollergirls.The Anchorage Football Stadium is also a noteworthy sports venue.\nThe 1989 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships was played in Anchorage.\n\n\n== Parks and recreation ==\n\n\n=== Parks, gardens, and wildlife refuges ===\nAlaska Native Heritage Center\nThe Alaska Botanical Garden has over 900 species of hardy perennials and 150 native plant species\nAlaska Zoo\nAlaska Wildlife Conservation Center\nAnchorage Coastal Wildlife Refuge\nDelaney Park Strip\nKincaid Park\nPoint Woronzof Park\nFlattop Mountain Recreation Area\nWestchester Lagoon/Margaret Eagan Sullivan Park\nNumerous other city parks throughout the borough\n\n\n=== Recreational facilities ===\nArctic Valley Ski Area\nAlyeska Resort\nHilltop Ski Area\nKincaid Park\nTony Knowles Coastal Trail\n\n\n=== Points of interest ===\nMoose's Tooth Pub & Pizzeria, a pub and pizzeria ranked 3rd best in the United States\nAnchorage Museum\n\n\n== Government and politics ==\n\nAnchorage is governed by an elected mayor and 11-member assembly, with the assistance of a city manager. These positions are non-partisan (as is the case with all municipal elected offices in Alaska), and thus no candidates officially run under any party banner. All eleven members are elected from districts known as sections. Five of the sections elect two members from designated seats, while the remaining section elects one member. Prior to the 1980 United States Census, the single-member section was the one centered around the northern Anchorage communities of Chugiak and Eagle River. Since that census, the area encompassing Downtown Anchorage and surrounding neighborhoods has served as the city's single-member section. The mayor (along with members of the school board) is elected in a citywide vote. In practice, however, the party affiliation and political ideology of major candidates are usually well known, and is highlighted by local media for the purposes of framing debate. The city's mayor is Ethan Berkowitz, a registered Democrat. Along with 7 sister cities in the SCI program, Anchorage has a cultural exchange program with the former Yugoslavia nation of Montenegro.\nThe Anchorage Assembly gained national publicity following their 2017 municipal election, when two openly gay candidates (Christopher Constant and Felix Rivera) were successfully elected into the eleven-member council \u2013 becoming the first openly gay candidates ever elected into Anchorage public office.Anchorage generally leans toward Republican candidates in both state and presidential elections. However, since the establishment of the municipality in 1975, there have been two Democratic mayors (Tony Knowles and Mark Begich) who have been elected to two consecutive terms and later to statewide office. Downtown, Girdwood, and much of both the west and east parts of town trend Democratic. However, areas closest to the military bases \u2013 including Eagle River \u2013 and south Anchorage are the most Republican areas of the Municipality. Midtown is relatively moderate by comparison.\nVoting trends show that Downtown Anchorage votes Democratic in large margins, while Spenard, Turnagain/Inlet View, and University/Airport Heights are relatively moderate and swing in elections. The remaining Anchorage area votes Republican. In 2018, Anchorage began conducting municipal elections by mail (as directed by the assembly in 2015) and had the highest voter turnout in the city's history.Anchorage-Eagle River sends 16 representatives (as of 2018 9 Republicans and 7 Democrats) to the 40-member Alaska House of Representatives and eight senators (5 Republicans and 3 Democrats) to the 20-member Senate. When seats from the neighboring Mat-Su Borough are added, more than half of the Alaska state legislature comes from the Anchorage metropolitan area. This is often used as an argument in favor of moving the state capital from Juneau to a location in the Anchorage area.\n\n\n=== Public safety ===\n\nWith a reported strength of 383 sworn officers, the Anchorage Police Department is the largest police department in the state, serving an area of 159 square miles with a population of 300,950. Until 2016, Alaska State Troopers provided policing for the southern regions of Anchorage along Turnagain Arm. After their withdrawal, Girdwood contracted with the neighboring city of Whittier for its policing, and the following year APD provided contract policing to other Turnagain Arm communities. The Fire & EMS Operations Division of the Anchorage Fire Department (AFD) includes thirteen fire stations with over 300 personnel covering three rotating 24-hour shifts. Additionally, there are volunteer fire departments in Girdwood and Chugiak and fire departments on Elmendorf Air Force Base and Fort Richardson, as well as the Airport Police and Fire Department.\nIn 2010, Anchorage reported 837.7 violent crimes per 100,000 population and 3,518.0 property crimes per 100,000 population (see table). Anchorage's crime rate, both for violent and property crimes, is higher than for Alaska as a whole or for the U.S. as a whole. When compared with U.S. cities of similar size, Anchorage has a slightly higher rate of violent crime and a slightly lower rate of property crime. Anchorage, and Alaska in general, have very high rates of sexual assault in comparison with the rest of the country, with Anchorage's annual rate of forcible rapes over three times as high as for the U.S. as a whole. In 2010, the rate of rape for Anchorage was 90.9 per 100,000 population, while the U.S. rate was 27.5 per 100,000 population. Alaska Natives are victimized at a much higher rate than their representation in the population.The Anchorage Community Survey, a public survey conducted in 2004\u20132005 by the Justice Center at University of Alaska Anchorage, found that overall, Anchorage residents are fairly satisfied with the performance of the Anchorage Police Department. Most survey respondents perceived the justice system to be \"somewhat effective\" or \"very effective\" at apprehending and prosecuting criminal suspects, bringing about just outcomes, and reducing crime.\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nPublic education in Anchorage, Eagle River, Chugiak, Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force Base is managed by the Anchorage School District, the 87th largest district in the United States, with nearly 50,000 students attending 98 schools. There are also a number of choices in private education, including both religious and non-denominational schools.\nAnchorage has four higher-education facilities that offer bachelor's or master's degrees: the University of Alaska Anchorage, Alaska Pacific University, Charter College, and the Anchorage campus of Texas-based Wayland Baptist University. The University of Alaska Fairbanks also has a small Center for Distance Education downtown. Other continuing education facilities in Anchorage include the Grainger Leadership Institute, Nine Star Enterprises, CLE International, Nana Worksafe, and PackBear DBA Barr & Co.\nNinety percent of Anchorage's adults have high-school diplomas, 65 percent have attended one to three years of college, and 17 percent hold advanced degrees.Anchorage has the most ethnically diverse schools in the United States, including the three most diverse high schools, the three most diverse middle schools, and the 19 most diverse elementary schools. Even the least diverse schools in Anchorage rank in the top 1% nationally.The Chugach School District operates neighborhood schools in Valdez\u2013Cordova Census Area, Alaska, as well as the supplementary Voyage to Excellence Residential School in Anchorage; its board office is in Anchorage. The Aleutian Region School District, which operates schools in areas of the Aleutian Islands, has its district administrative offices in Anchorage.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\nAnchorage's leading newspaper is the Anchorage Daily News, a citywide daily newspaper. Other newspapers include the Alaska Star, serving primarily Chugiak and Eagle River, the Anchorage Press, a free weekly covering mainly cultural topics, and The Northern Light, the student newspaper of the University of Alaska Anchorage. Anchorage's major network television affiliates are KTUU 2 (NBC), KTBY 4 (Fox), KYES 5 (MyNetworkTV), KAKM 7 (PBS), KTVA 11 (CBS), KYUR 13 (ABC/CW), and KDMD 33 (Ion/Telemundo). Anchorage is one hour behind the Pacific Time Zone, and receives the same network feed as the West Coast. Weekday primetime runs from 7 to 10 pm. Effectively, programs are viewed at the same local hour as those in the Central Time Zone. The city's only cable television provider is General Communication, Inc. (GCI). However, Dish Network and DirecTV offer satellite television service in Anchorage and the surrounding area; and uses East Coast feeds.\nThere are many radio stations in Anchorage; see List of radio stations in Alaska for more information.\n\n\n== Health and utilities ==\n\nProvidence Alaska Medical Center on Providence Drive in Anchorage is the largest hospital in Alaska and is part of Providence Health & Services in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California. It features the state's most comprehensive range of services. Providence Health System has a history of serving Alaska, beginning when the Sisters of Providence of Montreal first brought health care to Nome in 1902. As the territory grew during the following decades, so did efforts to provide care. Hospitals were opened in Fairbanks in 1910 and Anchorage in 1937.\nAlaska Regional Hospital on DeBarr Road opened in 1958 as Anchorage Presbyterian Hospital, downtown at 825 L Street. This predecessor to Alaska Regional was a joint venture between local physicians and the Presbyterian Church. In 1976 the hospital moved to its present location on DeBarr Road, and is now a 254-bed licensed and accredited facility. Alaska Regional has expanded services and in 1994, Alaska Regional joined with HCA, one of the nation's largest healthcare providers.\nAlaska Native Medical Center on Tudor Road provides medical care and therapeutic health care to Alaska natives \u2013 229 tribes \u2013 at the Anchorage site and at 15 satellite facilities throughout the state. ANMC specialists also travel to clinics in the bush to provide care. The 150-bed hospital is also a teaching center for the University of Washington's regional medical education program. ANMC houses an office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and Southcentral Foundation jointly own and manage ANMC.\nThe Municipal Light & Power (ML&P) and Chugach Electric Association provide electricity to the city. A municipally owned utility since 1932, ML&P supplies electric power to more than 30,000 residential and commercial customers in the Anchorage area. Chugach Electric Association is a not-for-profit, member-owned cooperative that was formed in 1948.\nMost homes have natural gas-fueled heat. ENSTAR Natural Gas Company is the sole provider for Anchorage, servicing some 90-percent of the city's population.\nThe Municipality of Anchorage owns and operates the Anchorage Water and Wastewater Utility, serving some 55,000 customer accounts with water from Eklutna Lake, which is mainly meltwater from Eklutna Glacier. Anchorage Municipal Solid Waste Services and Anchorage Refuse conduct trash removal in the city depending on location.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n\n=== Major Highways ===\n AK-1\n AK-3In everyday discourse, Alaskans do not use numerical route designations, preferring instead the named designations\u2014in this case the Seward Highway and the Glenn Highway.\n\n\n==== Highway to Highway ====\n\nOn and off since the 1960s, the Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities, in coordination with the Federal Highway Administration and the Municipality of Anchorage (or the lineal predecessors of those entities), have been exploring the concept of a roadway connecting the endpoints of the Seward and Glenn highways. The project is called \"Highway to Highway\", and the most recent concept for this project is that of a \"trenched\" freeway through the heart of Anchorage.\nHighway to Highway was included in the 2005 Long Range Transportation Plan, and would cost at least $575 million ($726 million in 2018 dollars). \u2013 by far the largest urban infrastructure project in Alaska's history.\n\n\n=== Public transit ===\n\nAnchorage has a bus system called People Mover, with a hub in downtown Anchorage and satellite hubs at Dimond Center and Muldoon Mall. The People Mover provides carpool organization services. The public paratransit service known as AnchorRides provides point-to-point accessible transportation services to seniors and those who experience disabilities.\n\n\n=== Rail ===\n\nThe Alaska Railroad offers year-round freight service along the length of its rail system between Seward (the southern terminus of the system), Fairbanks (the northern terminus of the system), and Whittier (a deep water, ice-free port). Daily passenger service is available during summer (May 15 \u2013 September 15), but is reduced to one round-trip per week between Anchorage and Fairbanks during the winter. Passenger terminals exist at Talkeetna, Denali National Park, Fairbanks, and several other locations. These communities are also served by bus line from Anchorage. The Ship Creek Shuttle connects downtown with the Ship Creek area, including stops at the Alaska Railroad depot.\nAnchorage also is conducting a feasibility study on a commuter rail and light rail system. For the commuter rail system, Anchorage would use existing Alaska Railroad tracks to provide service to Whittier, Palmer, Seward, Wasilla, and Eagle River.\n\n\n=== Air transport ===\n\nThe Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, 6 miles (9.7 km) south of downtown Anchorage, is the airline hub for the state, served by many national and international airlines, including Seattle-based Alaska Airlines as well as many intrastate airlines and charter air services. The airport is the primary international air freight gateway in the nation. By weight, five percent of the value of all United States international air cargo moved through Anchorage in 2008. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, it was briefly the busiest airport in the United States due to sustained volume of cargo flights through Alaska while passenger travel sharply decreased in other American airports. Next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is Lake Hood Seaplane Base, the largest Seaplane Base in the world. Merrill Field, a general aviation airport on the edge of downtown, was the 87th-busiest airport in the nation in 2010. There are also ten smaller private (mostly Department of Transportation) general aviation airports within the city limits.\nList of airports in the Municipality of Anchorage\n\n\n== Notable people ==\n\n\n== Sister cities ==\nAnchorage has seven sister cities.\n Chitose, Japan\n Darwin, Australia\n Harbin, China\n Incheon, South Korea\n Magadan, Russia\n Troms\u00f8, Norway\n Whitby, United Kingdom\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nAnchorage Fire Department\nAnchorage by singer Michelle Shocked.\nList of aerospace museums\nList of tallest buildings in Anchorage\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Anchorage, Alaska\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nPreston Jones.
